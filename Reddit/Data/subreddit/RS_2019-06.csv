bvexeq,7,2019-05-31,How do I tell my boss I am leaving (when it seems like the company will crumble when I leave),goodsurferatoutlook,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bvexeq/how_do_i_tell_my_boss_i_am_leaving_when_it_seems/,"Background: You can see my post history for more background on my job... But basically I’ve been working for a startup and doing almost all of the technical work while making the salary of an intern (1099) . I feel like things with my current company aren’t going anywhere. One junior person doing all of the technical work doesn’t seem realistic for a complex idea. The communication is also somewhat lacking. I’ll get last minute notice while working on a build that a demo for a potential client needs to be done so I have to scramble to cook up some half working system. Things seem slightly deceptive in that sometimes things said by others during demos alludes to this being fully functioning (they’ve even thrown out it being ready this summer which I’ve never suggested). I’ve brought up concerns before and it was somewhat acknowledged but I didn't feel like anything was really done. Luckily things have been quiet for about a month now. I’ve accepted another job and so I’m just trying to silently document the hell out of everything and wrap things up that I’m working on so I don’t just screw the company over.

This brings us to last week when I receive an email from my boss asking to setup a time to discuss a roadmap/deadlines for the software. (I’ve been out of the country so I’m just now going to be calling back) I’m pretty nervous. I feel like things aren’t going to work for the company and it’s going to be my fault for leaving(they’ve told me before things might fall apart if i leave). What’s the best way to tell my boss I’m leaving soon, that I’d like to wrap everything up I’ve been able to accomplish and document, and that there’s no amount of money to make me stay? I feel like no matter what the bridge will be seriously burnt. I am not leaving for about two more months but I think at this point I should say that I am leaving."
bvf1e5,1,2019-05-31,Dealing with a bad internship,foreverhere01,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bvf1e5/dealing_with_a_bad_internship/,"Hello, 
Im currently dealing with a bad internship experience at a hospital and i was wondering how to deal with it because im very disappointed. 
Basically, this is what happened i ask someone if i can help them load the specimen into rhe instrument and she was a little rude and said students dont do that; 
mine you i said said help. 
then i said i did that before and she went rude AF on me, so i walked away and she was like dont you walk away i told you who let you load it. i didnt want to give that person away just in case she was doing something wrong but at the end i told her. 
i honestly felt scared with her tone. Then the next day she didnt say good morning so be either. i felt to angry and disappointed to face her and truth be told idk what i did was that was so wrong. she told the supervisor and i heard but i didnt say anything as i dont want to get involved further and the supervisor didnt make comment to me. 
i started to sit in back because everytime i ask some one they if need help they said no. 
After that incidence, another tech said you should stand in the front because people might think you dont do anything, i said but i ask and they say they dont need help. 
she also stated that when i am in the back she feels like she cant talk to me; to that i replied that i always ask you if you need help and u say ill let you know. so i though in my head wtf maybe on my face it may have shown that. then she tries to start a converstion with me with a random ""you dont like to eat"" and again i was like wtf in my head and prior to all this the other tech that was rude started a conversation to me like this

""what time you started"" she said

""7""

""did you really come at 7""

""yes because that is the time i start""

""oh where you live""

""around here""

""oh but where do you live""

""around here""

""but you take a bus""

""yes""

""what bus""

""the name of the bus""

""oh where does it go""

""name of the last stop""

""do you live there""

""no""

""where do you live""

"" just around here""

she gives up and walk away. To me this conversation was a bit freaky, idk could be just here after the second around here she should me but i dont want to give out my personal information it was just the second say in that place.

maybe after all this conversation, people though i was giving an attitude or something because the supervisor pulled me into the office and said when is you last day and do you have any questions. i said no. she then proceeded to ask do you have  problems i said no. she said ""people told me you have an attitude and i think you do"". Also to add  i barely talk or see to her for me to give her an attitude; maybe when i had my earphone on and she said how are you and i didnt hear until she yelled at me. So after she noted i gave her attitude, i voice my concerns and what happened. I bascially said  that i didnt do anything and didnt learn anything. Her reply is thats how it is with all intern and they dont complain. WTF, i dont care what the other interns think
 an internship experience is so you learn something and i express this but she doesn't care. she said ""i gave you one on one time for 2 day"". i said out of the 5 weeks i am here for and i will be leaving soon and she was like ok then let me know what you want in a mocking way . how can you come to me now and say this you are barely in your office and you want to expresss to me this now i didnt say anything before because i know she is going to take side of the tech and im just an intern. Also, she expressed that im an intern that i am not on the same level with them in terms of status. WTF so its okay to be treated like shit im not getting paid and im full time here 35 hrs a week wtf. i became soooooooooo angry and i had to go because i have some one sick at my home and i have a responsibility to help them so i left and said bye 
but i cant stand this kind of treatment. i have intern at other places and never had this experience and when i first meet her she was like you are future. if really i am the future you are suppose to teach the future right. im sooooooooooooo sorry for this long post but can anyone help me here. i only have 3 days but i feel so angry and idk if i can take it"

bvfhj4,6,2019-05-31,"[Discussion] Is the new generation of low level, compiler, systems, or similar developers going to meet a surplus of demand in the future?",doublesigned,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bvfhj4/discussion_is_the_new_generation_of_low_level/,"Cloud Development, AI, Data Science.  Those things are all anyone talks about anymore.

Python, Java, Visual studio code.  Those are the tools young developers learn on and are taught to use.

However, if such a great focus is put on high level programming skills and concepts, who is going to write the assembly when new architectures are released?  Who is going to write new compilers that allow companies to target multiple platforms with multiple languages?  I am merely a student in Computer Science, but in school, many teachers or students seem to downplay the importance of these skills, often saying along the lines of ""the people of the past have already done the best that can be done in those areas.  Nobody needs to touch assembly anymore.  The best kernels have already been written.""  Obviously, few are naiive enough to outright say such things, but it is strongly implied, or at least a message that doesn't use absolutes but is in that direction is implied. It seems the professor for my assembly class and that of my compiler class seem to be the only people who still express to students that these areas of Computer Science are alive and well.

However, after getting an internship at a company that placed me in a compiler development role (I wouldn't be writing this post if I didn't have a vested interest in the question it poses, after all), I've realized just how much of a mess the code is at this level.  It can be just as bad, cluttered, or poorly documented as any high level code base, and what's worse is that development in these areas can easily be a bottleneck to releases, especially in larger companies who don't have the option not to target multiple platforms.  

I mean hell, people always talk big about the cloud but have they heard of modern mainframes like SystemZ, first released in 2011 and with updates to the architecture still being released?  Those things are important to companies because you can't just distribute everything, or if you can, doing so often fails to optimize for programmer time.

Anyways, my point is that the compiler and systems crowd is aging.  There are a lot more of them that are 40-50 than there are in their 20s, at least by percentage.  So here's my theory- at some point in the future, these people are going to drop off the labor market without much of a reduction in the demand for their skills.  Those three dudes who fell in love with vim in their first C/C++ class are going to take their place readily while the pythonians are going to wake up to a flooded market on their end.

Do you guys agree?"
bvfm7w,0,2019-05-31,TIFU by accidentally giving my RA a concussion,Ignorethemoon,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvfm7w/tifu_by_accidentally_giving_my_ra_a_concussion/,"Tl;dr I drunkenly smashed a chair and a piece bounced off and hit my RA in the head, giving her a serious concussion

Obligatory this happened a year ago.

I was a senior in college, and like most college kids, my group of friends loved to get liquored up and have a good old rowdy time.

We lived in a townhouse in a block of 6, 3 on one side, 3 on the other, with a walkway dividing in-between, and our RA (Resident assistant) was our direct neighbor.

We had a penchant for breaking furniture, and would often scour the local neighborhoods for chairs that we could smash during our drunken revelry. On this given night, we managed to get a hold of a prime piece, a nice old wooden chair, just asking to be smashed. 

So we started drinking, and after about 5-6 shots we figured it was time to get our night started and give the chair what it deserved. I took it outside and spiked it off of our stoop with all of my force, which immediately smashed it into pieces. My roommate took a turn smashing and pretty soon it was totally smashed. I took a piece and held it up like a baseball bat, and my roommate pitched it to me and I took a swing. We were having a grand old time, laughing and running around like idiots. That is, until one of our neighbors approached us and told us that our RA, we'll call her Lauren, was hit by a piece and was seriously hurt.

I ran to her door and her boyfriend told me to fuck off, and then campus police came and interviewed us and made us sign a paper that detailed the whole ordeal.

I found out in the morning that we had given Lauren a concussion, as one of the pieces of the chair ricocheted and hit her square on the back of her head as she opened her door to see what was going on outside.

We ended up having multiple conduct meetings, semester long suspension was on the table, but we were able to get off with just a month of weekend suspension plus probation (basically, if we got in trouble again we would be fucked). 

Lauren had such a bad concussion that she had to take time off of her required internship and almost didn't graduate on time. It was absolutely awful. We eventually reconciled and actually became good friends with her, but she never quite let it go. I don't blame her."

I should have been graduated by now but haven't cause I fucked up. Nevermind back to topic...I have been meaning to change city and find a job as a software developer after my backlog exams are over which will be by the end of Jestha. I wanted to take advice on the following things

1. What tech stack should I focus on to secure a good job; better paying and easy to score comparatively? I can do dot net development, have made few games in Unity, have a working level knowledge on Django and Django rest framework and with front end in React and React native. I might need take a look at dot net development again because, its been awhile since I moved away from Windows which wouldn't be a problem.

2. What type of questions will they be asking in interview (both tech related and otherwise)?

3. The most important part is after these exams are over, I will still have a few backlogs that I need to clear and next exam will be after Dashain and Tihar. Will the companies be willing to give me 2-3 weeks leave if need be? Or even give me a job without keeping me as their slave in the name of ""internship"" because of this? I am pretty proficient in what I know so, that would be unfair to me I guess. How should I go on about this in interview?

4. Any other fields I can focus on except Web development and any other tech stack I should learn that would be a good alternative? I learn pretty quickly or atleast ""grasp"" new technology relatively easily so that wouldn't be a problem either.

I don't expect much so a job paying 15-20k would be good enough as a start which would help me survive for a few months in Kathmandu, without my mother having to send me money. I hope this isn't a high expectation. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."

I enjoy programming and other aspects of Computer Engineering. But sometimes I am interested by Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering courses.

Is it normal to second guess my path as an engineer? I know I want to be an engineer, I want to build things. I want to create things. I just don’t know what I want to specialize in.

For example. I started a summer job working for a company that creates custom harnesses. I am working in production (soldering, molding, lasering, etc). They have Electrical, Mechanical, Mechatronic and Manufacturing Engineers there. Essentially, any discipline that has drafting and solidworks coursework is applicable to this company. 

It doesn’t seem like my education is applicable to their needs, all though I am interested in working there as an intern while I finish my degree.

bvhgtn,22,2019-06-01,How You Can (Still) Get a HS Internship,zetrikus,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bvhgtn/how_you_can_still_get_a_hs_internship/,"Summer is basically here and I know a lot of people who have applied to a ton of super competitive internships at universities or summer programs and were rejected from all of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fear not! there is still a way you can get an internship this summer. Just as a heads up, this may not be the way you think!

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: For the majority of this, I am going to be talking about STEM internships.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing you need to know is that there are a lot of opportunities out there. There are a ton of companies, especially startups who need someone like you to do all sorts of things in an internship, the challenge comes in actually finding these internships. For the most part, simply Googling opportunities won't help because these are usually those competitive lab internships or other summer programs.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the main thing you should do is look for local small startups. What do I mean by startups? Small, few employees, and new. They USUALLY ARE NOT well known brands or products. They usually have a very specific field for their product or service that they are actively developing. Most of the time, they will have &lt;10 employees and may have just recently incorporated.

&amp;#x200B;

 These are the companies that will likely need people the most. An important thing to keep in mind is that these companies don't have set internship programs in that they aren't recruiting interns. They don't have a set internship program or intern listing, so you aren't applying to a job role.

&amp;#x200B;

The way to find these companies is complicated, but if you actively look enough you will find one that matches your interests. The first way is to look on sites like [angel.co](https://angel.co) and just cold email a crap ton of companies. When I say a crap ton,  I mean 50+, startup CEOs are busy. Make sure you follow up. Keep in mind that [angel.co](https://angel.co) companies can likely be large and not really small, so you will have to distinguish between that.

&amp;#x200B;

Another method that I found was a lot more helpful is going to conferences or presentations and watching startups speak about something. Afterwards, chatting up the founder or whoever is presenting about what their product is about and eventually get their contact info.

&amp;#x200B;

The main underlying thing to keep in mind is that it's the finding that is the hard part. Once you find a startup and get in touch with the founder, it is easier to eventually get an internship. Make sure these are REAL startups, like small and hyperfocused. This will give you more lenience on what it is that you are actually doing and you can get involved in multiple different aspects of the startup process.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, for high school students, these are usually unpaid.

  
Hope this helps someone!"
bvhmgq,2,2019-06-01,Something's wrong,naya_aam,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bvhmgq/somethings_wrong/,"This is my first time posting anything like this, listing everything out. If this is the wrong sub-reddit for this, please do let me know.

I have almost zero knowledge about mental health and the issues related to them. I've grown up thinking it's normal to feel the way that I feel. But now, looking at the large amount of awareness campaigns relating to these issues, I have come to ponder upon my reality. 

I grew up with very loving, but now I realize, over-protective parents. I have been subjected to verbal and physical bullying and seclusion from my peers. Please don't take this as self pity, I just want you to know the reasons for the way I think.

Where I'm from, we have two major, life milestone kinda examinations, one in 10th grade, and one in 12th. I had coldly decided to kill myself after the 10th grade exam, and attempted the same by downing about 150 ml of mosquito repellent liquid. My body rejected it outright, and the only effect was a stomach ache for an hour. I have read stories about how a failed attempt can open the eyes of the attempter to life's value and whatnot. That however did not happen to me, and I again decided, coldly, with no impulse and/or pent up emotions, that I will attempt it again, after 12th grade examination. However, I also had to give entrance exams for colleges and decided to give it one last shot. I got through to an above average college against all expectations, and I finally thought, for the first time in my life, that I finally had a shot at this. I went away to college and felt that it was the first time I have ever developed my own independent identity. I met a girl, the love of my life. She saved my life. I hold her closer than any family member that I have. 

It has been two years at college now. I thought I was past all this but new issues have cropped up:
1. I am not able to go through with public speaking in any way or form. Every time I have been forced to, it has been with great difficulty, and it isn't getting easier the way people say it's supposed to. Any time I'm required to speak in public, I mark it on my calendar and it is a great deal of stress for me. I mark it on my calendar to slowly and steadily build my confidence up to the mark, preparing my presentation a million times.
2. I have developed a body image issue out of nowhere. A 19 year old weighing 51 kilos is severely underweight. I have been like this my whole life but for some reason, it is only affecting me now. However, I'm actively working towards gaining weight in a healthy manner and diet, and I think it's working.
3. I get very mad when someone tries to point out a flaw in me or my actions. I have to prove that I'm right till the maximum extent, without any regard to the other person's relationship with me, and their intentions behind pointing out said flaws.
4. I don't know how to describe this one: just a feeling of wanting to be mediocre. I have absolutely no ambitions in life other than to settle down someday with a good family of my own.
5. Don't know how to describe this one either but this is the only one I have carried over from my past: just this feeling of not wanting to do anything. I've turned down dozens of offers for competitions, debates, MUNs, etc. I just don't have the will to do anything whatsoever. I just do the bare minimum, pass in all my subjects, and do internships as required by my college, and the course that I have chosen.

These issues are taking me back to a very bad mental state which I have worked very hard to leave. If there are any suggestions or ideas, or if someone wants to call me out or something, just go ahead and tell me in the comments.

I have no clue if these issues are even relevant to mental health, or just me being mediocre. 

Rules say I should disclose where I'm posting from: I'm living in Delhi, India

TL;DR: Tried to kill myself in school, came to college and those feelings went away. However, two years into college I'm feeling suicidal again."

I graduated high school, worked a bit, traveled a bit, and now need to figure out what to do to support myself as an independent adult.
I want to work remotely or on a contract basis to avoid getting trapped in a town (been there, not fun) so im considering software engineering as this field seems pretty flexible in those terms.

Do I:
1. Go for a 4 year degree in the US?
2. Go for a 3 year degree abroad (i may choose to become an expat at some point anyway)
3. Self teach (my discipline is not the best)
4. Attend a coding bootcamp for the internship opportunities and networking
5. Another option I'm not aware of, maybe?

I already have basic IT knowledge and think that the first 2 years in a US college would be reiteration or irrelevant, so I'm not too keen for that but will attend if necessary.

My parents do not care what I do. Whatever my choice, they will help support me financially.

Is it a good idea to ""not overthink it. Choose one path and just do it""?

Do you have any advice?
Thank you"

&amp;#x200B;

Guys. Gals. People. I really fucked up I think. I'm so disappointed in myself after this 

I'm genuinely depressed about it now.

&amp;#x200B;

Small ground to cover here for context.. I'm a male. I recently have gotten out of an extremely long relationship (am only 21, as is everyone else in this story) and have been really looking to play the field and fool around a bit after being tied down so long. Call it what you will, but I won’t lie I have wanted to experience the classic MFF Threesome jackpot like most straight men do in their life at one point or another (I never have tried to force it or anything!). No lie, but ya boy sometimes frequents these NSFW subs thinking how awesome it'd be to be in a threesome like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the friends..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have these two friends that are girls that I share very much sexual tension and strange happenings with. I'm very much physically attracted to both of them and have been intimate on certain levels in the deep far past. these two girls express it in their own ways but often there are times where they both, or all of us remark about ""when that threesome is gonna happen"" among other things... I always thought the thing stopping it was opportunity/venue (we all still live at home with parents)...

&amp;#x200B;

Just Now..

&amp;#x200B;

Today was a very, very long day. have been grinding three weeks straight at this awesome ""internship"" of sorts, and drank a little with my boss to celebrate our last day working on the project. tipsy when I meet one of my friends who offers to dab me out (THC) after my very long last day at the job. We get high as shit and then his GF asks him to pick her and her 3 friends up to go to a club so we do. On the way I'm getting naughty, hittin' the THC pen especially when the girls get in the car. I think I can induce social anxiety on myself and got super high to cover it up. Anyways, we get the girls to the club, and one of the two girlfriends I mentioned in the above paragraph calls me and says both of them are hanging at her house and I should come over. I head there and see her dad head to his backhouse he sometimes sleeps in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Showtime... Not.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We're all three relaxing and chilling on her bed, no one else is home and it's obvious she's confident her dad isn't coming back in because they're lighting fuckin' dabs with a torch and everything indoors. I let them hit the pen some, they let me hit some of their wax they had, which sent me flying into motherfucking high space. I'm jazzed up and groovy AF and decide to use the restroom, when I come back I see them in a hybrid-hug pile of sorts so I naturally dive in high and horny (oh god I'm really not trying to write softcore right here) AF and we're rubbing our hands over each other and my heart starts beating and I think ""Oh fuck this is actually it holy fucking shit"" my little guy ain't even flexing that hard I just genuinely can't believe this is about to happen like wow this is finna be the best day ever.. and then... 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing Interesting happens.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's right. My high dumbass deflects most every opportunity to initiate or take any hint they were trying to give me. I couldn't have deflected it better, actually. They're telling me to feel how soft their legs are and I do, But my high self starts freezing and slowing. I paralyze and can't fucking act. We're kinda all three spooning with me on the far right and the girl in the middle literally says ""and this is how threesomes happen"". Like how much clear of a fucking signal could she have given me. When in the moment I felt like my brain was just making every single reason NOT to initiate anything, that these friends aren't worth losing because I wanna just fuck 'em for the threesome, to not to touch anyone deeper than the fucking knee even though they were flailing their legs all around me, and that what if I'm misinterpreting certain messages and go for the touch on something and come off rape-y. Still, I want this very bad. My heart was beating so fast and she even said ""I can literally hear OP's heart beating right now haha"" I just did a whole lotta nothing. Fuck man. I can't believe I'm writing this. I want to blame the fact that I was high as fuck, but honestly this has happened in my life at many points, and maybe this is a problem I gotta address or this is just a representation of what is to come about things I want and how to get them. The first time I kissed a girl my heart was beating out of my chest, I could barely do it. In fact, she really had to do it now that I think about it. The first time I told someone (not even a GF but this also happened with GF as well) that I loved them, could barely do it I was so shaky and couldn't even look at them in the face when I said it because I was so nervous/anxious. And just now, when literally the signal was given of ""Now touch in between both our legs"" was said, I literally looked at something that, not going to lie, I highly covet(ed), and was too dang scared to take it, even when life seemed to be handing it down to me for some reason. I fear I will never get an opportunity like this again, and that I threw away a once in a lifetime opportunity. also sorry this got real softcore porn lol but I just gotta describe it as I felt it because man... I think I need some dang help tbh I'm still very high and just.. aghhh. Don't do drugs.

 Disappointed by this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, thanks a lot for listening to my fuck up :(, throwaway for obvious reasons..  If anyone has or wants to shoot me some genuine suggestions about what to do about all this, the situations, my attitude/mindset, man, that'd be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's kinda funny in a way so I understand people throwing that shade, I really deserve it lol.

Anyways, have a great day. Don't waste your life.. you only have one.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR- I had epic opportunity to have dream threesome with two girls I'm highly attracted too and blew it because I was too damn stoned and anxious and not confident in the obvious signals I was getting, causing me to become a frozen chicken on the bed where it was gonna go down."
bvlw6t,2,2019-06-01,Displaced and Distraught (Long Post),AboveTableAccount,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/bvlw6t/displaced_and_distraught_long_post/,"I made a post here earlier lamenting about the fact that despite having 7 years of projects under my belt, attending a top college and being involved and invited to do a project at one of the tippy toppiest of top schools, having 2 years of work experience, having a 3.5 GPA, and having sent over at least 500 applications in I can't get an internship due to a narural disaster causing me to lose the one I had lined up at about May 13th.

Briefly I had an internship lined up at a VERY recognizable large company, but I found out around February that the team I had been assigned to was a no go and I should just apply to other teams which hasn't panned out. It felt awful fulfilling my dream of getting one of those top intern positions so few get and then have it ripped away. They still are open to putting me on a team but recently I had an interaction where my recruiter explained that I was probably not going to get a team opening anytimensoon and that they would stop offering me positions after Summer was over. I explained that I lost my other position and that I really liked the company culture and employees that I'd met and that it was important I talk to her about any opportunity because I may not be able to afford shelter or power much longer. (Because I think I might have 2 weeks left at most). So the problem is to get this position I moved to the middle of nowhere. And I mean there are no jobs because there aren't any businesses. There is a Best Buy about 20 minutes away that I applied to, but when I call or go inside they say that it usually takes a month. They get employees from I where I live and a few people commute from another township about 40 minutes in the opposite direction.

My recruiters response to this was that she ""understood my predicament"" but ""begging for a position won't do [me] any favors just make people uncomfortable because [I am] trying to force my way in with sympathy"". Which I wasn't trying to do. Is this normal behavior? Also on a tangent I don't think she understands my predicament judging from her LinkedIn and what she told me her family is well-to-do in South California and like her parents actually graduated high school and have jobs, and she went to a provate high school for STEM. I wish I had those opportunities. Sorry if I'm salty, but she really emphasized that she didn't want to think about me being homeless because of how bad it might make her feel. Which I don't understand because unless she's secretly been ruining my attempts at getting on a team it's not really her fault. The whole team dissolving without telling me until February is sort of their fault. Actually I'm not sure if they just stopped having an intership position point is I can't apply to them anymore.

I drove about an hour away and attenpted to get an intern position at a medium sized manufacturing company which is a bit out of my field but not too far out. I can work with PLC's. They then told me to interview on Tuesday. I showed up dressed at 8 am to be told they had no interviews were scheduled and talking to HR or hiring managers was prohibited and that I'd need to apply online... for a position I already got an interview for... online. I called twice a day for a week before and after lunch and finally Monday of the next week an HR representative answered and told me that while I was offered an interview they chose the candidate who got the interview slot the day before me because the hiring manager wanted to get them to work ASAP and they cancelled all the others. I told her I found this really unprofessional and she apologized and I felt rather cheated especially because I met the guy and he can't do the PLC's... that were literally in the job description and were on my resume. Sorry for being salty. 

My career counselor from school told me that if I just keep bothering people they'll eventually give up but I think she's wrong. She insists that going to a top school gives me a big advantage, but most people are interested in my large back catalog of projects. 

A Fortune 500 actually I'll just say i:t John Deere, I applied to in the Fall because I have a lot of friends who are employees there, and they offer to relocate people, but no matter how much I bother HR on the phone or on LinkedIn they tell me that they're very sorry I lost my internship but that they only allow locals to interview... which is strange because their definition includes areas of my state that feature a state college that are further from their location than my hometown and further still from where I currently am. I think what they mean is theu just hire from that college but don't say so. Anyway the HR people redirected me to a remote staffing agency that pays dirt and only currently has warehouse positions in places I can't move to, but apparentley they sometimes get engineers from there and they told me my qualifications were such that they'd be willing to hire me in a full engineering position if I applied online. And I did... and it's been a month and any time I ask I get told that I simply need to be patient.

Am I doomed? I recently talked to an HR person who when finding out I had no internship position yet asked gave me a pompous laugh followed by a ""Did you slack off the whole year? I'm glad I went to community college it was way more bang for my buck since I guess those fancy top schools simply don't prepare you for a career."" Which made me very angry. This seems to be a common sentiment I get from both HR people and relatives I ask to borrow money from... well none of my relatives have gone to college but the last part holds. Like actually what I do? Right now I wanna move there was a fast food place but it recently permanently closed (which came as a shock), there is a mom and pop grocery but they aren't hiring I need to be somewhere else where I can at least get a job. My friends at school like to say they can empathize but I don't think they can they all came from magnate schools and most of their parents work at large companies and stuff of that sort. And they got onto teams at that particular company. Does anybody have any ideas of what I should. I have no job so I spend all day applying for positions so that's covered."

I'm a rising senior and I have my heart set on Northwestern for early decision this fall. I'm also very interested in Tufts, Brown, Georgetown, and Princeton. I know that applying to any highly selective college is a crapshoot for everyone, but I'm curious to see if any of you have any insights into what Northwestern (or any colleges, for that matter) might see in my profile and maybe what you'd estimate my shot to be. And feel free to suggest any colleges you might think I'd like based on this info!  
Thank you so much!

Gender: Female  
Ethnicity: White  
Intended major: History or political science, possible double major or minor in creative writing

GPA: 4.65 weighted / 3.9 unweighted  
SAT: 1540 (790 [r/w](https://www.reddit.com/r/w/), 750 m), plan to take 3 subject tests in June and August (Literature, US History, Math II)  
Top public high school in Rocky Mountain state, very competitive  
IB Diploma candidate / all AP classes when IB is not always available

Predicted recs: 7-8/10 (maybe? I can't read my teachers' minds haha)  
Predicted essay: 9/10 (I absolutely love writing and spent my childhood in Africa for my dad's job, so I have a few unique stories to tell)

\* I'm likely going to send an arts supplement for other schools if I don't get into Northwestern (I know NU doesn't accept arts supplements). More on that next to jazz choir.

Main EC's: ( \*\* indicates leadership role)

\- \*\* (10, 11, 12) National Honor Society - Leadership Team (treasurer) in 12th. My school's chapter is pretty big and has authority over student council, honor council, and quite a few other leadership organizations, so being appointed to the leadership team is pretty big and requires a lot of work outside of school. Some of the projects I created/organized with NHS are included as separate EC's as well because of the time and effort they required. ----&gt; (also a member of French Honor Society, but the club is kind of a joke and I might not include this on my common app).&gt; Being on NHS LT also includes being a part of Honor Council and a school-wide leadership council

\- \*\* (10, 11, 12) Speech and Debate. Team captain junior/senior year, placed top 6 at state two years in a row, double qualified to Nationals this year (will be competing in a few weeks) in speech/interpretation events.

\- (9, 10, 11, 12) Musical theater. Every year of high school, I've been a cast member (both lead and ensemble roles) in my school's musical theater productions. Freshman year, I was also part of a very intense independent theater company, which was a great experience but prevented me from doing a lot of other EC's, so I transitioned to my school's program in order to be involved with other things as well.

\- \*\* (10, 11, 12) Nonprofit organization that promotes mental health in middle and high schools - Leadership Team in 11th, 12th. As a volunteer member, I travel to other schools in the district as well as community fundraisers and give interactive presentations on suicide prevention and the risks, warning signs, etc. of depression. My leadership team responsibilities include running meetings, managing social media, organizing fundraisers, applying for grants, etc.

\- \*\* (11, 12) Created, organized, and hosted an off-brand TED-Talk event with presentations given by my school's students for the community on issues and topics they are passionate about, where all admissions proceeds were donated to a local charity (we raised a pretty substantial amount of money)

\- (11, 12) Jazz choir. In addition to being in traditional choir for four years, I also sang in two of the country's top high school jazz choirs at my school junior and senior year (we frequently perform at state and national conferences, etc.). This is pretty rare for anyone doing the IB Diploma at my school and I think it might set me apart. I also had to give up a lunch period second semester junior year to fit this in, so the dedication is pretty apparent haha. Because I want to emphasize this part of my application and the fact that I'd love to continue singing in college, I think I'm going to send in a recording of my solo performance from our solo night concert as an arts supplement for other schools in case Northwestern doesn't work out (NU doesn't accept supplementary materials).

\- (10) Co-taught a 7th grade English class at the middle school next door through a program at my high school, but I'm putting it in EC's because it required a ton of work outside of school. Through my experience with speech and debate, I developed and taught a new 7th grade debate curriculum and also taught other miscellaneous lessons. It was an amazing experience and might ask for a letter of rec from the teacher, who I also had for two years in middle school and knows me really well.

\- \*\* (9, 10, 11, 12) Coordinated and managed a library program for NHS where high school volunteers are paired with an elementary schooler and work on reading skills and mentorship. Volunteer 'big pal' 9, 10; coordinator 11, 12.

\- (9, 10, 12) JV tennis team

Awards and honors:

\- Placed 7th nationally at the National History Day competition in Washington DC (essentially science fair for history projects) in a performance category (after getting 2nd at state)  
\- 4th, 6th at state speech and debate sophomore and junior year  
\- Qualified to debate Nationals. Will be competing in a few weeks so I'll update how I do afterwards  
\- I'm also very into creative writing and have won awards at a few big regional and national competitions:  
\- Scholastic  
\- Women on Writing  
\- Polyphony Lit (pretty competitive publication)  
I'm waiting to hear back about a few submissions too so we'll see how that goes!

Summer internships/work:

\- (11) Paid internship with state university history professor this summer, helping her with her book's bibliography and editing  
\- (9, 10, 11) Volunteer camp councilor at an educational summer camp for elementary school kids. I assisted the instructors in teaching lessons and entertained/played games with campers in their free time.  
\- (11, 12) Job at ice cream store

I'm also very interested in the environment (took AP Environmental) and might be starting an internship with a local nonprofit to pass legislation to save bee populations.

Okay, there we go! Yikes, I'm sorry that was so long but hopefully you get an idea of what my app's going to look like.

Thank you so much for any imput/advice!"

But I feel so confused by it at times.  Am I just not being my genuine self in all of these different social situations?  Would love some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

At work, I feel very well-accepted.  My CEO constantly asks for my opinions in large groups, and after I deliver, it is taken with lots of head nods and smiles.  My interns look to me for answers and direction, and they are honest when they feel my door is always open.  I am responsible for my mistakes and own up to them.

&amp;#x200B;

With my siblings, parents, aunts, uncles, etc.  I am very well-enjoyed, funny, optimistic, and supportive.  People miss me when I am not around and laugh a lot when I am there.  I am encouraging and often looked to as a source of inspiration and achievement.

&amp;#x200B;

However, with my spouse's side of the family, I struggle.  People often cut me off or ignore me in conversations or after I make statements.  They rely heavily on sarcasm to be funny, which I think in very small doses and used very light-heartedly can be funny, but at the level they use it, I think it can be damaging.  There are a few people here and there that I enjoy talking to, but the odd thing is that most of these individuals have married into this family.  Most of my spouse's siblings have 20+ years of age on me, which makes it difficult to connect a lot of the time.  I'm nervous before family gatherings and I often feel overwhelmed and ask my spouse to leave early (she is very supportive).  I always try to put my best foot forward, ask people about their lives, follow up on certain things they've mentioned in the past, etc. but mostly leave feeling disappointed.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I doing wrong?  Is this just one of those groups I don't (and most likely won't) click with?  I can't be the only one out there, right?"

I need to come to a decision soon, and I was wondering if you guys had any input on which one you would choose.

&amp;#x200B;

The IBM internship is for 2 months, and the startup one is for 6. The startup pays more. The startup is also at an earlier stage (seed/maybe series A funding?). I would be doing React at both, but the startup has &lt;10 employees.

&amp;#x200B;

For IBM, I would be in the Watson/Cloud department.

I'm not sure which one would lead to more personal growth. On one hand, there's an exciting startup opportunity close to home, on the other, I may get more mentoring at IBM and tackle real world problems at scale. While I do worry that 2 months may be too short, I also worry that having a nameless company on my resume for 6 months would really make it stand out to recruiters.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, would you delay your graduation a few months for an internship at a startup such as this? Or would you rather wait for an offer from a better company (unicorn, big4, etc,.)

So basically to graduate my highschool I had to do 8 weeks of internship (there is not a minimum wage, but most companies pay their interns in Austria. Albeit a laughable amount. Then again my duties consisted of sitting in an office and watching youtube videos, so I'm not in any position to complain about the pay being too low) so I was interning at that company for a month or 4 weeks. Since my school specializes in biomedical engeneering I interened at a hospital location, where they would provide tech support for the entire site. Then we get a call.

I won't insult your intelligence by telling you who is who.

Boss: OP, User in Room is having trouble with their keyboard. It's not gonna be too hard, just take a keyboard from the shelf, go there and swap it out, you know the drill.

So I went there and interrupted what seemed to be a very private talk between patient and doctor to find the keyboard that was causing trouble, which wasn't plugged in. I stared at it for a minute in disbelieve and then asked

OP: Why is this not plugged in?

User: Well I unplugged it, because it can't be THAT important and I had to copy some data from this USB-Stick and there were no free slots...

OP: are you done copying the data?

User: Yes, but the keyboard isn't working.

Still processing what just happened, I just wordlessly plugged it back in and left.

The hospital does technically have a policy against USB-Sticks because of the huge IT-safety issues they can cause, but they didn't pay me enough to listen to a rant from an old doctor 5 years from retirement about me, a lowly intern from an external company, telling him, a fucking high and mighty doctor what to do and what not to do. The USB-ban is by the way the reason it's impossible to plug anything into a PC without unplugging something.

I do feel sorry for the patient, but I'm glad to report that in the two years after this exchange the keyboard hasn't caused any issues ever again that I know of. (That was towards the end of the third week, so I was basically only there for one more week, and they don't keep me informed about what happens to that one keyboard I just so happened to plug in. I do like to think that they're still getting a decent laugh about it though...)"

&amp;#x200B;

How do you know you've reached the point where you are confident enough in your skills to ""go out into the real world"" and start applying for jobs? Should you start freelancing first? How does the normal interviewing process work (submitting a portfolio, going in for an interview)? Should you start an internship before applying for a job?

I've heard ""Make stuff, contribute to projects, start a blog"" countless times, and no doubt that's valuable information; Seeing as I've got a few years before I need to be able to support myself in this career, I'll have plenty of time to do those things; What can I do in the meantime, while I'm still learning, to make the whole finding-a-job-process easier? I've also heard that specializing in one area is better than trying to be a ""Jack-of-all-trades"", what if there are no agencies in my area that need my specific skill-set?

im a j2 student and im in the arts stream. i pretty much got lucky at Os so i could choose a relatively good jc and even though i had a rough idea of what i wanted to study in poly, i chose jc in the end because it would be easier for me to get into a uni (which is also what my parents would want) 

however, my time in jc has made me realise that i really wont be able to do well for As because ive never been the type to be good at mugging and studying hard. i dont have the stamina and focus to study hard, the mildest interest in my current subjects, or the aptitude to do well enough to have a good enough rp to choose a course i like in uni. i barely scrapped by promos with SSC/E with an A for gp (s for both econs and math) and eventually got conditionally promoted, and even though i tried to study more this year, i got UEE/U with a B for gp. my results have not been improving and until now ive yet to pass a single major math or econs exam. i personally also have a hard time fitting in and finding real friends because i dont feel particularly close to anyone except for a few friends outside of class who i dont even see often in school. to be very honest, jc so far has been utter hell and ive never regretted this decision more. its been so bad that i would just shut down in the middle of class sometimes and i used to have almost daily breakdowns in the toilet at the end of last year after promos and start of this year lol

i am very interested in video production and pretty much set on working towards a career in that field making anything from music videos to documentaries to commercials and even film. i know i dont want to work in singapore and the best ways to get a footing in the industry are through connections and internships. ive been thinking about it since after promos last year and finally decided to apply for lasalle's broadcast media diploma in may for ay 2019/2020. i passed the admissions test and interview and just got my offer on friday; i have about seven to eight days left to accept it before they give it up to someone on the waitlist so if i dont accept it now i will never get the offer back. but heres the thing lol i havent told my parents and the only people who know now are some very close friends and my form teacher. im planning to break the news to my parents on monday evening and explain to them my current situation; they know that im not confident of doing well for As and that i really hate jc but they dont know that i applied in secret. 

this course has always felt like a lifeline outside of jc lol but now that ive received the offer, some part of me doesnt want to go anymore? ive heard some bad things about lasalle ranging from students buying their way to a good gpa, people ""studying"" there because they have nowhere to go and not because theyre genuinely interested in their craft, lecturers not taking their job seriously, etc etc and this seriously scares me... i dont want to be impressionable and form false opinions but i dont want to put lasalle on a pedestal and enter the school realising that what i perceived it to be was a complete lie lmao idk... idk and theres also so little time left for As so ive been wondering if its a waste to just drop out right now? like im done with almost 3/4 of the way and if i choose to switch paths it would mean that ive wasted 1.5 years of complete suffering for absolutely nothing 

but at the same time this IS my dream course because they cover modules on things that im really interested to learn. and i really have zero confidence to do well in As... i dont want to have to collect my results and break down seeing straight Cs and Ds on my cert while all my friends can enter their desired courses in uni. my parents are not willing to fund my overseas education so the only uni course that im kind of interested in and can go to is comms at either nus or ntu.... not only is it very hard for me to get in, its probably going to be extremely academic and nothing that im actually interested in (aka the actual process of video production) 

so ya basically i just dont know what i should do now like do i continue with jc with a very high chance that i will do badly for As or go to lasalle which is probably nothing that i make it out to be??? also if anyone can give their input on lasalle (especially broadcast media) or comms in nus/ntu that would be great!!! thank you for reading"

At the time, Michigan was my first US acceptance after being rejected by Georgia Tech and waitlisted by UIUC and I was super excited to get in and thought I should definitely go to Michigan because I want to move and work in the US after graduation and since I'd heard a lot of good things about the school. Michigan ended up being the only US school that I got into even though I thought I had a decent shot at UIUC/better schools; I ended up getting rejected from Berkeley, CMU, UCLA, USC, Georgia Tech, and UIUC. For Canadian schools, I got into UBC and another safety but was rejected by Toronto, rejected Waterloo computer engineering, and deferred to Waterloo Honors Math from Computer Science.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew I wanted to go to Michigan even before the rejection from Waterloo and I took it as oh, well I guess I'm definitely going to Michigan and was still really excited. I thought Michigan was still definitely better than Waterloo since I wanted to go to a school with good research and industry prospects and had an amazing college experience.

&amp;#x200B;

After this first school year, I see that the majority of my friends at Waterloo have good internships that are better than mine where they're actually paid while I do a shitty part-time unpaid internship for a non-tech company and unpaid research. I initially got ghosted by the mass majority of the 300+ positions but I got final round at 2 places and an interview with a well known tech company for a data science position intended for MS/PhD students so I thought I was hot shit until the 2 final round interviews rejected me even though I thought I did fairly well. I know my resume looks pretty good considering multiple recruiters and people who have interviewed me told me they're surprised I'm a freshman but I guess it doesn't mean shit when I barely get replies and probably had juniors and seniors that were picked over me because I'm not good enough to compete with them. My parents spent 60k USD for me to come here and although I know I'm very privileged that they wanted me to get the best educational opportunity possible it pisses me off how I know students with much less impressive resumes working at the Microsoft Explore Internship while I got straight up rejected. Maybe I'm just stupid for coming here as an international Canadian student when I should have just swallowed my pride and went to UBC or by some miracle transferred into CS at Waterloo.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just disappointed in myself. I thought I could do so much more at Michigan but I was even rejected by their undergraduate research programs and had to find research on my own and was rejected from so many university affiliated opportunities here. I don't want my experience at Michigan to be a 240 thousand dollar mistake but it just doesn't make me feel well knowing I'm not doing jackshit at what's supposed to be a better school than Waterloo and my parents are paying so much more. I guess it's my fault that I didn't focus enough on school in high school and can't join my friends at Waterloo. Toronto is also basically the slightly worse Canadian equivalent of UMich yet I got straight up rejected there for computer engineering even though I've looked on LinkedIn and have stronger achievements than most students I looked at. It's my fault though, I didn't pay enough attention to my high school grades even though I did pretty well on standardized testing and I paid the price."

I am not that smart.  I have always been slightly above average in my CS program, but I have never been anything special.  I am now realizing I am extremely underqualified compared to the other interns and I do not understand my project at all.  I have been working late and even on the weekends but I seem to be making no progress.  I honestly do not think I am going to be able to finish this project.  I am wondering if I should have an honest talk with my manager about lowering expectations to make the project more manageable.  I am very stressed because I wanted to work for this company full time, but now I don't think there's anyway I am getting a return offer, and even If I do ,I am not sure I would be happy working for a company where everyone is this much smarter than me.  I'm wondering if anyone has been in this situation before and how they ended up handling it.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I wanted to thank everyone for the advice!  I think the heart of my problem has been that, as silly as it sounds, I felt like I didn't deserve this opportunity and was afraid to ask questions in case my manager ""found out"" that I was underqualified.  I'm gonna take all of your advice, and treat this summer as a learning experience, and rather than focusing on looking good just try to learn as much as I can.  I have a meeting with my manager Monday and I am going to come in with a list of questions I need clarifications on."
bvuoqn,2,2019-06-02,How do I cut off my sister... for good?,Ririnavyxoxo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bvuoqn/how_do_i_cut_off_my_sister_for_good/," 

Ever since I was young my sister has always wanted to control and use me. If she was nice, she had a motive. After this semester ended I decided I NEED to cut her off. I'm not confrontational or really competitive. I'm very positive, forgiving, and bottle up my emotions. She's the complete opposite.Possibly a narcissist honestly. A scorpio.

Freshman year of college back in 2016 I gave her **$1,000** from my refund so she could intern in New York which was never paid back, this semester I let her **stay in** the open room in my dorm **apartment** due to commuting from her job to campus (could have gotten kicked out). This was AFTER she went on a trip to Asia with my **ex-best friend** who also hurt me which she's aware, and now she's back to her old ways of treating me, my oldest sister, and mom poorly. I know I have to stop forgiving. She only shows up as the good sister when others flock to me after I dance or model in shows at our uni. She treats her friends way better and it's sad. So many hurtful things she's done, but these top the cake. I'm 21 now and she's 23 this year. 

She's always gotten a rush from confrontation and controlling situations with others. She's very good at convincing that she has changed just to strike again later. So I want no communication what so ever. I haven't talked to her in a week and half lol. I've talked to her once about her ways, but nothing changed and was awkward.

My question I guess is **how do I deal with the aftermath**? We have a few mutual friends and may see each other at family event if she makes an appearance. She also will show to anything I'm doing as ""support"". Should I completely ignore her or just be cordial in these situations? She may paint me as the bad person to others or be cordial for her image.She's unpredictable. I just want to be ready for whatever she brings in public or one on one. Also any tips on not being tricked by her and returning back.

Sorry it's long! I would really love to hear what you all think."

I'm a 24 y.o. Romanian currently, in my second(/3) year, soon starting my exam period. I finished highschool when I was 19, lost one year with a phony university where literally passing exams meant bribing people. Gave up that, got to a decent university when I was 20. Failed first year, had to wait another year to get back. Got back, got in my second year with a lot of missed exams (granted, a huge chunk happened with me getting sick in the midst of my exams).


I'm borderline not passing in my third year. I tried to get a job as at least a web developer, even although I worked with C++, Java, C#, servers, databases, did development on Linux, did some really small projects + university projects on GitHub, have a website with a blog (granted, only 1 post atm). Granted, I'm not the kind of guy who plays with AI or microcontrollers, but for the most part, I think I'm pretty honest to my level as an average Java dev.


I and applied to 40 places for an intern job got about 9 interviews.


Best I got was database teacher under some...odd requirements (not passing university in time meant that they no longer recognized me as if I worked for them (???)), a job as an observer (literally just watch what people did and do nothing), and frequent job offers as tech support (as I also speak German).


It's depressing as hell being this old, still being supported by family (for which I am grateful, but I always fear something bad might happen to them and jeopardize everything), and feeling like a hamster in a wheel. They still insist on me going on and not drop out (granted, if I had a good job, that would be at least an excuse of sorts).


I had no other job. Didn't get to work in any NGOs because I always felt doing organization work (instead of programming) was a waste of time. No competitions. I no longer care that I live alone in a different city, I just want this thing to end and grab some real market experience. I see my colleagues cheating their way through university and it's frustrating as hell when I actually try to do my job. It's even more frustrating when I see them in hotshot jobs, me knowing them that they know jackshit about their job.


So... am I too old for a webdev job? Is the market over-saturated? Should I concede defeat and look for a QA job, or look to focus on something else? Should I find an open-source project and give my best to contribute to it? Have I failed my career completely and am barely employable for a decent job?


Many thanks in advance."

One of my main goals in life is to move out of Bosnia, and it's a large part of the reason I'm pursuing software development. Unfortunately, internships aren't really a thing in my country, but I'll be trying to find some sort of development job once I return to have it on my CV. I'm also working on some personal projects to maybe show off, though I don't know if I'm capable of making something incredibly impressive or extravagant.

I don't think I'm smart enough or have a resume good enough to get an offer from any 'big' companies I've seen mentioned on this sub (i.e. Google, Amazon, Microsoft), so - do other, possibly smaller companies, ever sponsor fresh graduates?

I'm fluent in English and speak enough German to communicate in (and I believe I can reach fluency within a year, maybe), if that's worth anything. Frankly, I'm prepared to work for a pittance, if it means getting out.

And honestly I slacked off a lot during school so I don't really have much to put on my resume except for my school projects. (I really regret this but what can I do now?) Fortunately my GPA (3.56/4.0) is not that bad, even though it is nowhere high enough to be of merit on its own, but I would like to believe it's sufficiently high enough that it will play against my favor.

While there is indeed a lot of things I need to work on to be a competent candidate, **my biggest concern is the resume screening.** I was unable to get past the resume screening for every company but one (Five Rings Capital), and the firms I managed to score an interview were those that replaced the resume screening with a mental arithmetic test (something like [this](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/)), and for these firms I managed to advance several rounds in the process. Hence, I would really appreciate your advice for the following questions I have:

1. **How can I make my resume more attractive?** Is there any technical skills I could work on that could make me a stronger candidate? Or should I just go do some mini projects?
2. **Should I just try to get referred to skip the screening?** For this, I was thinking of going to linkedin and asking for informational interviews and eventually ask for a referral. (I know this sounds super naive)
3. **Should I apply for internship or full-time jobs?** If I have an option to apply either way, what should I do? Of course scoring a full-time offer right away would be the most ideal situation, but I fear resume without any work experience will almost surely get screened out, especially for full-time positions.

Thank you for your time reading this post. I would really appreciate any inputs."
bvzlro,7,2019-06-02,Sad Going to UofT After Being Rejected by UW,xantbej,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/bvzlro/sad_going_to_uoft_after_being_rejected_by_uw/,"I just finished my first year at the University of Toronto and I honestly thought it would be better than what ended up happening. At the time, UofT was my first acceptance after being rejected by UW and I was super excited to get in and thought I should definitely go to Toronto because I wanted to get into research and maybe do a Master's after undergrad and since I'd heard a lot of good things about the school. I also got into Ryerson and York and another safety but was rejected by rejected Waterloo computer engineering, and deferred to Waterloo Honors Math from Computer Science.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew I wanted to go to UofT even before the rejection from Waterloo and I took it as oh, well I guess I'm definitely going to Toronto and was still really excited. I thought Toronto was still definitely better than Waterloo since I wanted to go to a school with good research and industry prospects and have an amazing college experience.

&amp;#x200B;

After this first school year, I see that the majority of my friends at Waterloo have good internships that are better than mine where they're actually paid while I do a shitty part-time unpaid internship for a non-tech company and unpaid research. I initially got ghosted by the mass majority of the 300+ positions but I got final round at 2 places and an interview with a well known tech company for a data science position intended for MS/PhD students so I thought I was hot shit until the 2 final round interviews rejected me even though I thought I did fairly well. I know my resume looks pretty good considering multiple recruiters and people who have interviewed me told me they're surprised I'm a freshman but I guess it doesn't mean shit when I barely get replies and probably had juniors and seniors that were picked over me because I'm not good enough to compete with them. My parents spent 10k for me to come here and although I know I'm very privileged that they wanted me to get the best educational opportunity possible it pisses me off how I know students with much less impressive resumes working at the Microsoft Explore Internship while I got straight up rejected. Maybe I'm just stupid for coming here when I should have just swallowed my pride and went to Ryerson co-op or by some miracle transferred into CS at Waterloo.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just disappointed in myself. I thought I could do so much more at UofT but I was even rejected by their undergraduate research programs and had to find research on my own and was rejected from so many university affiliated opportunities here. I don't want my experience at Toronto to be a 40 thousand dollar mistake but it just doesn't make me feel well knowing I'm not doing jackshit at what's supposed to be a better school than Waterloo and my parents are paying so much. I guess it's my fault that I didn't focus enough on school in high school and can't join my friends at Waterloo.  It's my fault though, I didn't pay enough attention to my high school grades."

And up until this summer, I  was pretty secure with my choice of major. This past week, I started at a paid internship close to home. This is by all means a great opportunity, and will great on my resume, but it is so monotonous. I have work to do, and maybe it is just because I'm an intern, but when I look at the more senior developers and see what they're doing it doesn't exactly excite me either... I can't see how people can enjoy coding. I realize a lot of people don't like their jobs, but maybe as just a rebellious teenager, the classic work for 45 years, make a lot of money, then retire doesn't appeal. I'm having trouble seeing the point of college too if I'm not going for a high-paying career.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the third grade, I've wanted to join the military. I've been passively thinking about it since then- asking myself questions like should I enlist or become an office after college and which branch should I join. I've been considering joining now for four years (or even a two year active commitment with the army) then going back to college.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: working my first full time job as a software engineering intern. It's not exciting and thinking about doing this for the rest of my life makes me want to die."
bw2azp,0,2019-06-02,"I've (22M) wasted 4 years (pushing 5 now) of my life after Highschool ""trying"" to apply to University in Germany and shunning every opportunity for studying in my country that my dad gives me.",Luzider,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bw2azp/ive_22m_wasted_4_years_pushing_5_now_of_my_life/,"Hey all, hope you're all having a nice day/night. I need some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation as me here. I apologize for the long post in advance and for the grammar mistakes if any, typing this from my phone. TL;DR is at the bottom. 

So some background, I'm the last born in a family of 6 and my dad retired like a year before I finished HS (British system) in 2015. I've been learning German since before I started HS and after, I took 2 years off any form of education, went to a German institute to really learn to be fluent. I went to Germany in 2014 for the first time and I was blown away and always wanted to go back to study and since the education fees is extremely reasonable there, I saw that as an absolute win for me. 

I've always had a real problem with saying when something isn't right and so before my graduation my teachers asked all the students in my class if anything was wrong, if they needed help with any *applications they didn't complete or if they had no spot in a Uni*. I didn't... But I didn't say anything because it was really close to graduation and I didn't want to look like my life was definitely going to be in shambles the next several months or like I'm a fool who doesn't know what he's doing. 

Well, in July right after HS, I started an internship at an animation studio thanks to my older sister's concern for my future and started to learn the ins and outs of animation which is great but after the beginning 2016 I became very ineffective as an intern. By May in 2016, I left the internship and my dad urged me to apply here in Kenya and I did, I found a Uni that does offer animation and I got a spot in that Uni and oddly enough, when I got that admission, I was relieved, like I could finally move on in my life but then my mom questioned the Uni saying they're less advanced than in Germany and that I would be wasting money studying here rather than abroad because ""c'mon, you went to an International school, why would you go here?""

So then I doubted if I wanted to even study there and then decided to hide my admission form from my dad and still wait to start studying in a place better than we have here. So I just to stayed home and did YouTube and played videogames. Did this for a year then in 2017 went to sharpen my German tongue, so to speak, at a German college. 

Fast forward to now in 2019, I have job transcribing German audio that I got thanks to a friend that I met at the German college. It pays as much as I want it to, so like the more work I do, the more I get paid and I get to choose my hours and thanks to my job i've invested in my gaming and learned more and more about how games are made in relation to animation, the games industry and in fact, I've invested so much into gaming that I am running out of games to play and I see that as an opportunity for me to invest now in my career. 

I've grown mentally, I'm helping out with the bills and around the house where I can. I have more friends than when I left highschool, i've become more confident, I also have a girlfriend who I care about and love to bits. But for all of this there are some negatives, I've already had countless arguments with my dad about me still not being in University yet, ""wasting the years like (my older brother's name) has"". He keeps trying to get me to go to do apply for a course here which is ""related to animation"" but I don't buy into his method of doing things because it feels like he's the one making the choice for my life, not me. And it also kind of sounds like that course he mentioned could be something that I won't be able to put my heart and passion in.

But what i've noticed is unsettling, almost scary even... I'm getting older every year, and the people who were in my class have either graduated or will graduate this coming year and yet here I am... With no undergraduate degree which is part of the issue but I'll get to that in a minute. 
I don't like comparing my life to other peoples lives for this reason, I mean we all live at our own paces, I understand that. But it it's just damn hard to see how little I've achieved in terms of my career. 

Well, just now me and my dad had a discussion revolving around a PC which I need help buying the parts for and building for adding more to my digital portfolio for animation and as a means for applying to Germany next year (some Universities over there require you to complete course work digitally and my current laptop can't do that) and he basically said that I can lose nothing from *AT LEAST* starting to study animation here in Kenya, I can ""gain fundamental knowledge for the course and then use that knowledge when in Germany"". And I considered that. I also feel like I have a direction in life but I'm not moving towards it fast enough if at all. So when I agreed with my dad that we'll go check out this course he was talking about, it's strange but, I felt relieved again. Almost like I'm finally moving towards my destination. It's almost as if my gut is telling me something. 

To end this post, I sent an email to the University that I  was admitted to saying that I will be attending studies elsewhere and haven't been in contact with them since. I want to see if I can reapply to that same Uni again, 3 years later. Is that possible? 

Edit: I forgot to mention that my parents have been spending more and more time away from me and my siblings and it's always so nice and calm up until they show up again after weeks (sometimes months) of being in another country. This made me notice how much I want to get away from them and just live my own life without them being there constantly

TL;DR - Father wants me to at least start studying something similar to animation/game design in Kenya but I've been pushing to go to Germany for 4 years and still haven't started an undergrad. I already speak fluent German and technology is more advanced there BUT I am really considering just FINALLY starting my undergrad here"

Need to put it all in writing,danglyfigger,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bw2rty/i_feel_stagnant_need_to_put_it_all_in_writing/,"Not sure how to start as I havent really spoke  to anyone about my mental state. Last year was intense. My ex lied to me and broke up with me. My dog passed away. My grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. All in the span of a couple of months. 2018 was rocky to say the least, i lost a lot of weight, had many break downs and thoughts of suicide on multiple occasions. In September I went to Switzerland with my best friend for 2 weeks which was a great detachment from ny horrible summer. However as soon as I came back, university started again and I was super busy as well as all my friends, which helped distract me but the breakup was still damaging my self esteem and self worth. In December, i had started seeing this new girl and things were going well. I finally felt good about myself again. I ended up cutting things off with her because school became really time consuming with 5 classes and my joining of a student association. This was in February. 

Everything was going great until mid-April when my final exams were all done and I was set to start my new internship. This is when my mental state really started to crash, and now, June 2nd, exactly one year after I got dumped, I am an all time low and don't know what to do. You would think that a year is enough to get over it, but I still find myself thinking about her frequently. My internship sucks, all my friends are taking classes and see each other all the time, I don't have time for the gym or guitar since work consumes all my time from 7 am to 6 pm. All my friends are trying to hook me up with girls but I refuse because I just dont have that interest anymore. I don't want to go through all that again. I don't enjoy the things I use to and I feel like my life has come to a stand-still. Nothing new or interesting is happening and it feels as though everyone else is getting closer but i'm being left behind. I can feel myself pushing my loved ones away, yet I don't know how to stop myself. People use to care, but i've pushed them away so long and have been so negative that I feel them distancing themselves, which just makes me even more miserable. I spend my weekends in bed, and try to go to the gym. I'll be invited to clubs, something which I use to love doing, and just sit there bored. I don't find pleasure in the things I once loved and i feel exhausted all the time. 

I tried explaining myself to one friend and she was shocked. ""You have good grades, you have friends and family, you're in shape and you play the guitar. Why don't you have good self esteem?"". Quite honestly, I don't know why. Ever since being dumped I never fully recovered. I'm at the point where ive accepted that im miserable and ran out of ideas or solutions to this. 

If you've made it this far down my word wall, thank you for listening to me. No one really does anymore. Im not quite sure what to do anymore, and I can tell people don't know what to do with me either. But thats okay I guess, theres nothing I can do about it. This is me now, even though I hate who ive become. 

Thank you."

I am a freshman going onto sophomore and this post doesn't apply for this year.  Next year summer of 2020 I really want to get into the industry. I don't really aspire to do research I would much rather work as an engineer for a tech company but I am not apposed to it and I think it would be fun. Anyways I know I have a year to decide and neither are guaranteed but I know my university has research opportunities and starting next semester I want to start positioning myself to get 1 for summer of 2020. The problem is I don't know if doing research for the summer will hinder my chances of getting a internship in later years. What I mean is if I start on the road of doing research would i be pigeonholed. I am not really sure how common it is for CS students to do research in university and transition to the industry as a software engineer.

TLDR: If i do research one summer for university would it be more difficult or easier to get a tech job in the future. 

I know its a dumb question but I rarely hear of developers doing research as undergrads. I only hear about the stories of students who did internships in their college years and then went off into the industry so before I start making any plans I just wanted to know for sure."

&amp;#x200B;

I began teaching myself Python six weeks ago and feel like I have made decent progress with it. I started with a class on Udemy and since then have been using MIT OCW as a reference, completing the projects and lectures for 6.0001, 6.0002, and 6.189. I have uploaded my projects to GitHub for now and these include a simple game of Tetris, hangman, Caesar Cipher + decrypter, greedy algorithm + dynamic programming implementation, and a few basic data science projects (simulations, training and testing intervals).

It's occured to me that I can go back to school this September and finish with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science by April 2020. I'm grappling with the decision of either going back or continuing in the self-taught trajectory. My goal is to obtain an internship which I can parlay into a full time role as a SWE/SWD (ideally I would skip the internship part and land a full time gig as a SWE but that doesn't seem very likely). I'm unsure of what the best course of action is to lead me to this goal.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions basically boil down to:

\- Are projects such as what I have done sufficient for receiving internships?

\- What constitutes a project? On reddit, the advice I see the most for self taught programmers is to build a project and deploy it to GitHub, but this advice is ambiguous. Tetris is a project, no? As is hangman/Caesar Cipher/the other 'projects' I have implemented in the MIT PSets. Would these projects meet the criteria that reddit users mean when they say 'Build your own projects""?

\- Is a degree in CS really that valuable if I already have a math degree?

\- I'm wondering when I can realistically expect to be competitive for internships/jobs. Is 3 months of programming too presumptuous of a timeline or realistic if I continue to grind as I have been? This ties back into my question of going back to school, as I can have a degree in CompSci in &lt; a year and I believe that will make my life a lot easier and my candidacy more competitive.

\- If I can complete the required credits for MIT's comp sci program via OCW, how will this affect my marketability?

\- How can I go about creating a resume for SWE gigs? Should I mention my MIT OCW coursework and the projects I have done? This is really the only relevant information I have atm for jobs in this sector.

My current approach to applications has been through sites like Glassdoor, LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, etc., but I get very few responses and even less interview opportunities. If you guys have any advice, I'd really appreciate it. My main questions are:

* What type of jobs should I be applying for?
* What jobs can I realistically get with a gpa below 2.5?
* What sites/resources should I be using to help me land that first job?
* What skills can I work on to make myself a more desirable candidate for a job in finance?

Thanks again for your guys' time. I appreciate any input or comments you may have."

I’m a CS Major but was sought out and offered an MIS/IT Internship at a local Electric company.

bw6nin,3,2019-06-03,How to get Summer Internship after First Year of CS Bachelors?,aselhd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bw6nin/how_to_get_summer_internship_after_first_year_of/,"This fall, I will be starting CS at Georgia Tech. I have heard that landing and internship after freshman year for the summer can be difficult, especially with the limited experience that most have. **What can I do to have the best chance of getting an internship after my first year for the summer?** 

&amp;#x200B;

For reference of what I have so far for my resume, here is the basics of my experience. Most of my experience so far has little to do with CS. This summer I am interning full time at an materials science engineering / chemical engineering business. Previously, I have worked as a math tutor (at a local business) and at a family owned business (apartment complex) doing some IT work. I have very limited experience in Java and Python that I learned in school for AP computer science.

Thank you in advanced."
bw7fwc,1,2019-06-03,I feel so misunderstood by my mother,Royalwastaken,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bw7fwc/i_feel_so_misunderstood_by_my_mother/,"I'm sort of emotional right now as I write this, so please excuse me if I sound weirdly disorganized or anything. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to post it in, but it's something that really came up recently after learning more about ADHD and being diagnosed and learning about myself.

I was just on the phone with my mom regarding my willingness to go to a volunteering service that was in China, to which I declined with a couple of reasons, such as that it was out of the way (we'd go there for 10 days for the sake of helping for 5) and that I felt like the way in which I would help them was not very meaningful to me (teach kids how to use computers and take pictures). We basically had a big back and forth that resulted in me crying in frustration. I'm a 21 year old guy, I normally don't and shouldn't cry about things like this. I have almost failed courses I genuinely was trying my hardest in and haven't shed a single tear in frustration for that.

What it essentially is is that every argument I've ever had with my mother sort of deteriorates into a sort of she's a victim situation that makes me feel like a piece of shit human being while also questioning my own worth as a person. Part of what my mother says is hard truth, such as my lack of initiative in my goals and my lack of drive in things such as finding an internship (because a lot of 3rd year uni students have one by now). Those hurt a lot, but it is something that I do genuinely need to work on. 

Side note: Ever since I have been diagnosed with ADHD, I have been trying to teach my loved ones and people I care for about my tendencies and newfound understanding of myself. 

The other half of her arguments sort of work around here. Here's what she does:

1.Turn me into a sort of bad guy when I bring up views that don't align with hers. Words such as ""naive"" and ""contradictory"" hold much power here.

2. She basically hung up on me knowing full well that I could not focus on doing anything after so when I called her back she would make it seem like I'm trying to convince her. I really wanted to come to an understanding.

3. Brought up various aspects of my shortcomings in a way that seemed to point to me being stubborn and unaccomodating. Every point had a big part to do with my ADHD, and I just had a big talk with her the other day about these things and how I've been trying to fix them. It seemed as if she didn't even take them to heart.

4. Because of 3, it almost felt as if my choice of going to this service was one of obligation and proof that I was, in fact, a good person who likes to help people.

5. ""You won't even help people on small things, and you want to change people's lives?"" I guess I'm just a piece of shit now. Of course I want to help people, but I want to do something more substantial. Something I can feel like I truly made a difference with. Plus, something that is not so out of the way. I know how cranky I get when I'm uncomfortable or unsatisfied, and I fear that I will do only negative by going at this point.

6. She seemed like she was just trying to win the argument to assert dominance rather than to come to an understanding. Out of all the reasons I gave her, she used my mini aside that I may have something I want to do at that time as the generalization of my argument. My biggest point was that I believed that how much you helped does not quantify itself in how much suffering you took to do it for someone, but in its effects. If it is really inconvenient then it should be really important. I feel like this was not, and no amount of convincing could really change that. I'm just like that.

Anyways, I totally felt misunderstood during the whole argument and sort of broke down when I tried to bring up the whole thing. This was the way arguments have always gone with my mother. I was a child back then and did the same back, but since entering college and maturing more while learning more about positive communication, I feel like I just can't bring myself to communicate like that anymore.

Luckily, my mother sort of listened as I half talked half cried while pointing out these things and said we could talk later when we both cooled down a bit more (I was on my way to the library to study). She's a great mom, but I feel like whenever she gets heated she turns into a toxic person. It has sort of affected how I have argued until college and I'm still catching myself doing the same at times. It sort of scares me because I know I hurt people doing that and I still regret it sometimes. I guess today was just the straw that broke the camel's back and I just couldn't hold it in anymore."
bw7oai,1,2019-06-03,[professional advice I guess?] In between a teaching job and an internship...,HayleyTheLesbJesus,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bw7oai/professional_advice_i_guess_in_between_a_teaching/,"So I won this internship that allows me to ""intern"" at a research lab of my choice at this computer science department just before my first year at uni.

It's a paid internship but more than anything it's very valuable experience, I was so happy to have won it and my school made a big deal about it. 

However, I was hired for this summer teaching job in August that I would not be able to do if I had this internship. I have not yet called them to let them know I would not be able to come, because I am waiting to make sure this internship thing is for sure. 

I met with the director of the department (he's in charge of my internship) a little more than two weeks ago and he said he'd get back to me the week after about starting my internship. It's now been two weeks that we last spoke and I've no signs from him.

Im a little worried that they just won't give me the internship at all and I don't want to quit the other teaching job without being sure I have the internship, but I also don't want to wait too long before telling the teaching job I'm not going.

Is this unprofessional from what the director is doing to me (nor getting back to me) or for what I am doing to the teaching job (not telling them in not coming)

EDIT: I also contacted him last week (Tuesday the 28th) and the director never replied back. Which is weird because he usually replied fairly quickly.

EDIT #2: I don't know if you guys can help me with this... But when I met the director, even though the internship gave me the right to choose *any* research facility, I don't think he wa super eager of my choice, because he kind of seemed to want to push me to something else. But I did win this thing and I think it'd be odd to just... Never get back to me?"

I don’t know which role I should be looking for because I feel my experience involves many areas of software engineering, and is not explicitly software development like many posts in this sub. 

I’ve been at my current job 4 years and I’m looking for a change. I know many will cringe at the 4 years thing but at this size company (4,000+) I have been part of many different projects, so I haven’t been doing the same thing the whole time. It’s a SETA-type company in the defense and aerospace industry, which mostly works with the government customers to provide technical expertise and solutions. The work here mainly involves systems engineering on large projects, but there are also scientific research projects and internal software tools/solutions that are developed, which is the area I have mostly been involved in. 

I suppose you can’t give me much advice without knowing more about my experience and background, so here is a quick rundown.

I did web development as a hobby for my photography hobby when I was close to graduating. I created multiple websites, the full stack on my own and hosted it on the internet. This helped me land an internship and the internship led to a job.

I have some Windows domain administrator experience 

I have lots of Linux experience (standing up new servers, securing them, installing and configuring software, troubleshooting issues, automated scripts and jobs)

Some experience coding in Java, Python, JavaScript. HTML

Experiences with databases such as Postgres, MySQL, InfluxDB

I have developed strong communication skills. 

I have strong leadership skills. I have naturally taken over as lead in a few of my projects due to my enthusiasm and initiative.


So, I’m looking for my next opportunity but I’m not sure what my next role should be. Thanks for reading."

This morning I overslept and missed a morning meeting at my company. The team is small and so the meetings involve the CEO, COO, and pretty much everyone that is important. Now before you guys say it, yes I know what I did was bad and that I deserve to be fired. I regret it, but it is done. I ended up sending my manager a bs excuse of how I am sick and couldn't make it. He didn't bother to reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, is there any way I can bounce back from this and get on the good side of the company. I am only a rising sophomore so I don't necessarily want a return offer from this company or anything. However, I also know that some employers like to call the previous internship manager in order to screen potential candidates. I am afraid that this may affect my future internship searches if they call the manager of my current company. Additionally, if I do get fired, it may look very very bad for future interviews.

What can I do?"

I have an already booked trip out of the country that is 5 days long but I only need to take 3 days off from work (it’s also over the weekend). More recently my boyfriend left to work in another state for the summer, which I didn’t know about until after I planned the first trip. I would like to take some time to go visit him for a few days, but I’m afraid of taking TOO much time off. I was originally thinking take 2 days off + weekend, but flying back is going to take up the entirety of my last day, and 3 days there isn’t much.

I completed an 8 month web dev schooling program (795 hours) where I learned a variety of languages, and I have been searching for a job for about 7 months. I have been self-studying coding for about 2 years. I apply to everything I can. I get in person interviews every once in a while, not as often as I'd like. I attribute that to the fact that the jobs that I am targeting and ideally suited for come up less often.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience is that the jobs that ask for heavy programming (php, angular) are looking for more experienced devs. So I have decided, after observing that many of my classmates have got their start in front end web design, to pursue that. (HTML/CSS/Javascript) (I am focusing on bootstrap, because my mentor tells me that everyone wants a responsive web page.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a portfolio web site ([www.danielklein18.com](https://www.danielklein18.com)) and my resume is on there as well.

I have included several projects to show off. Two simple bootstrap landing pages, to show off my abilities. One php/mysql database to show off some back end. One Wordpress and a simple angular js app.

&amp;#x200B;

I have done two internships so far. And I got paid for a week to do a job that involves SQL, that wasn't 100% related to coding, but it didn't work out for reasons I won't get into. Other than that, I have not gotten a full time job yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I work approximately 11-12 hours a week during the week to work on projects and practice and study coding.

&amp;#x200B;

I open to any advice/strategy that would help me.

bwdh4l,6,2019-06-03,IBM or Startup Internship?,StrawberryMarmalade,IBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBM/comments/bwdh4l/ibm_or_startup_internship/,"Hey all, I was fortunate enough to get internship offers at both an IBM and a startup. I need to come to a decision soon, and I was wondering if you guys had any input on which one you would choose.

The IBM internship is for 2 months, and the startup one is for 6. The startup pays more. The startup is also at an earlier stage (seed/maybe series A funding?). I would be doing React at both, but the startup has &lt;10 employees.

For IBM, I would be in the Watson/Cloud department.

I'm not sure which one would lead to more personal growth. On one hand, there's an exciting startup opportunity close to home, on the other, I may get more mentoring at IBM and tackle real world problems at scale. While I do worry that 2 months may be too short, I also worry that having a nameless company on my resume for 6 months would really make it stand out to recruiters.

Also, would you delay your graduation a few months for an internship at a startup such as this? Or would you rather wait for an offer from a better company (unicorn, big4, etc,.)

The DCU course has an internship and seems more practical, while the TCD course is more theoretical and has no internship but the college has a better reputation.

I'm not from Dublin so accommodation doesn't really factor in, it will be expensive where ever I go :( I believe DCU might be more enjoyable in the social sense but I understand that it shouldn't factor in too much

bwfhh2,2,2019-06-03,Is it bad to leave a good job for a job in the same field but different career path?,phantompanda14,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bwfhh2/is_it_bad_to_leave_a_good_job_for_a_job_in_the/,"Two years ago right out of college I wanted to work at company A or company B. I got the job at company A which was my dream come true but I hated the position and quit after 4 months which made me really upset. Company B was rapidly expanding in my area and I really liked the company culture and goals, but had no openings that my degree qualified for. Before I quit company A, I applied for a position in company C and got an offer which I desperately accepted so I could leave company A. I never heard of company C, only read about it online and it sounded interesting. I moved 45 minutes away from home to work at company C. 

Fast forward 1 1/2 years later (now) one of my friends who works at company B emailed me saying that company B finally has positions open for what I was interested in. I'd been working as an analytical chemist at company C (even though I have schooling in chemical engineering) and this new position was for chemistry but more or less a desk job where I would interpret hazards etc of chemicals for the company. I've been looking into environmental health and safety management courses which I was always interested in so I thought it was a good coincidence. My current job a while ago refused to help me pay for those courses stating that they'd rather see me take more chemistry courses to align with my job. The closest chemistry college is 45 minutes away whereas the other was online so that would be very difficult to fit into a standard work day. 

I wasn't really intending on applying for a new job, I just finally got comfortable in my current role, taking on projects, and I was planning on reevaluating my situation at my 2-3 year anniversary. The job I have now isn't bad but it's too relaxed. I've been told I can't pursue the courses I want to take even though with those courses I intended on staying in my current position (my boss assumed I was going to take those classes and leave for a new career). I also get discouraged because there's people who've worked here for 30+ years and are content being in the same position so there isn't much movement. A good percentage of people will be retiring within the next 5-10 years so I fear the company will suffer, and they aren't hiring which is freaking people out. Other than interns, I am the youngest person in my business unit and everyone else is ""dad age"" to me so it's hard for me to relate to them. My boss is a great guy but very distracted, I was supposed to be trained on a lot of equipment but to him it's easier for him to do it and have me watch. Company C is also owned by a much larger company D which I really like a lot so I always thought that if I was unhappy I could transfer to one of the smaller companies that Company D owns. My job is all lab work which I don't mind but I also don't want to do it forever.
 
My biggest concern is that if I got offered a position at company B, I'd have to move back ""home"" (45 minutes isn't bad to drive for a while) and break my current lease, I'd have to abandon all of the projects and people I've met at company C, and idk if it would be beneficial since this new position isn't (from the job description) really a step up, it's more of a career change. I've always liked company B, I've toured twice, I know the head boss and my friend works there so I know it's a good reputable company. The business is expanding and there's a good mix of younger and older people that I could learn from.

 I know I'm thinking 100 steps ahead, and I will probably apply anyways to get more information on the exact position but what would you do? Is it bad to quit a job after a year and a half? I know it'd ""break their heart"" if I left since it took a total of 5 months for company C to hire me so it would put them at a huge disadvantage. I'm really torn because I feel like I could learn a lot more from my current job but I see movement being years down the line. Thank you so much and I appreciate any advice!"

I am a recent graduate and I applied to many jobs and places. However, my resume won't get me offers or frankly even rejects. Just to check what is going wrong, I put my resume for free reviews at TopResume, ZipJob. Both of them gave the same result -  low score from ATS.  I have attached a screenshot of my report from TopResume.

**A little background:**

I switched my career from IT to embedded systems. After my first job of 3 years in IT, I did a master's in embedded systems, with couple of internships.

**Problem**:

Low ATS score. I believe this is majorly due to mishmash of my careers. I suspect that the ATS is not able to understand my transition from IT to embedded systems.

Most importantly, no calls or rejects.

&amp;#x200B;

I have attached my resume and I would really appreciate if this forum can critique my resume and help me know for potential areas where I can improve on.

This seems like a great opportunity, but it would add to my already heavy course load. The research is paid and credit is given, but the credits I would receive aren't the type I need at this point. I've been given a lot of different opinions on this. Some have said that the experience and networking would be huge, but some have said that research is really more for if you're going to grad school (which I'm not).

bwi9r0,17,2019-06-03,So I got a dream international aerospace internship. Couple weeks in and I fucking hate everything. Any advice is appreciated.,kdawg_w26d12l0,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/bwi9r0/so_i_got_a_dream_international_aerospace/,"Background: I'm currently in the last year of my undergraduate mechanical engineering degree, enrolled at a Canadian university where an aerospace engineering isn't offered. Despite this, I've worked my ass off to join multiple aerospace groups, start aerospace initiatives, attend various conferences etc. which allowed me to participate in awesome aerospace opportunities around the world. All this despite a few years of uni being a disaster and having to take significant time off to deal with depression. I know a lot of people in similar situations who weren't able to recover, and I am very thankful to all those who helped me back up. Hence, I'm very weary of taking things for granted, just because of the ugly situations I've been in and the fact that it could've be worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this year and things are great (haven't been down in the dumps mentally for years) and we're working on our school's cubesat project (which I joined only a few months prior) when an opportunity arises to fly down to a major US aerospace-focused university for an unpaid internship working on international satellite projects for the summer. Insane, right? I go to the meeting thing, and it seems like most of the team leads are applying though, and I'm just like fuck it: outranked, way inexperienced - there's no way I'm getting in. Eventually I cave, throw something shitty together in under an hour and submit it 10 minutes before the deadline because why the fuckberries not.

&amp;#x200B;

I get in! Somehow, along with 4 others from the same school group. Still not sure why me, but okay whatever great! Again it's unpaid, but the experience will be awesome. I do all the ""good intern things"" beforehand: read up on past years' materials, get there a few days early, figure out the place, even have lunch with my supervisors; I'd like to say I'm pretty friendly and open, and we connect over shared interests like sports, travel, outdoors stuff, and gaming. Here and there (not overwhelming in the slightest) I sprinkle little tidbits of what my skills are and what areas I would like to get involved in, project-wise. They seem receptive. Good start, I'd say.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the interns get here and it begins. Standard start, the first week they have us read over past design reviews to catch up, and go over what's expected. When we get to a section I want in on, I make a conceited effort to show my interest, ask questions, clarify any ambiguities etc, along with again, actually clearly stating that I want in on that.

&amp;#x200B;

Then comes the time when people are assigned to stuff, and I GET PASSED ON FOR EVERYTHING. No explanation, nothing. Half the time other people are reminding the supervisors what I can do or am supposed to be doing. Still nothing. Like I wouldn't mind if it was because of my relative inexperience or whatever, but other people were getting added to shit simply to learn and gain that experience, but me? Nope, still jack shit.

&amp;#x200B;

What in hell am I doing wrong? A couple weeks in and I maybe have an hour of work a day, and I'm bored as hell. Supervisors won't add me to sections, other than one thing where there's 3 other people attached and even they have separate and better shit to do. Everyone else is doing cool shit. I'm not doing or learning anything. I had other awesome paid summer offers abroad as well that I rejected for this, and now I'm just regretting everything.  I'm probably gonna send off an email to the supervisors asking for work, and maybe touch on the same points as above, but apart from again talking to them in person, I don't know what else to do. I came for the experience, which everyone else is getting, but I'm gaining absolutely nothing and sitting here feeling utterly useless and unwanted. I'm at the point where I just want to leave, say goodbye to aerospace and fuck it all.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is, despite me taking antidepressants, working out a couple times a day, getting outdoors always, staying clean-shaven, eating healthy, and essentially doing the stuff I didn't when I was super-depressed years ago, and upping all that when I got here, I'm starting to fall back into that same state of depression, almost as deep a pit as back then. Again, what the fuck do you want me to do, life?

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the opportunity and I realize how lucky I am, compared to where I started. I don't know, maybe I'm being a whiny bitch and I should just fuck off.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rant. I guess I'm just looking for anything at this point. Tips, advice, guidance, similar experiences - all appreciated. delete this if necessary, wouldn't that be just fitting"

I have gone on hundreds of interviews and it always comes down tot the same thing, not enough experience. I have 2 internships unfortunately, when I transferred to my second school one of credits took up my internship slot and there was no way to switch it out, so I couldn't apply for any for school credit. But I have about 7 years of office experience, 2 internships, I do freelance social media and I have over 10 years of volunteer work and not a single job has offered me a position.  Every position in my field wants 5 years for entry level and that's not realistic at all, they want you to know all these programs and have all these contacts but you can't get them with working in the field. I honestly look every single night and send my resume out every night. Best part is I am now overqualified to work a simple retail job, one job even said why should I hire you you'll find something in your field and leave. I even went to trade school to humor my mom in medical office training one office called me and the woman even said over the phone ""I don't even know why I'm calling you, you aren't qualified at all, but I'm going to humor you by bringing you in for an interview."" and she was the HR manager. I can't catch a break no matter how hard I try, I know I'm worth something, I know I'm worth more than ""here is your change have a nice day"" I have fought for everything in my life, including my own life at 13, when I was diagnosed with cancer. I didn't know if I would see the next day, let alone my next birthday. But I am 16 years cancer free, graduate of 2 colleges, I have my son whom I was told I could never have, and I just got married something else I thought I would never get to do. So I don't believe in giving up, but I just wish someone would say, yes you are worth something and we will give you a shot. I want to prove to everyone who has called me a failure that I accomplished something, but I most of all I want to prove to myself that I finally did it, want my son to be proud of me."

But there are several things with this:

1) I've done a ton of research on the CS department (both on the GT website, scrolling through Reddit, etc), but none on EE, so would anyone mind shedding some light on what the EE department is like?

2) I don't have a ""favorite"" in software or hardware– like, I think both are cool, but my interests lie in the interactions between the two. I've heard negative things about the CmpE department here, however :( I'm currently stuck between an EE degree with a CS minor or a CS degree with Devices + SysArch threads; which option would focus more/allow me to hopefully get a career with software/hardware interactions?

3) I've seen many stories from CS students (in general)  getting internships and job offers after grad; is it easy (with a reasonable amount of work, ofc) for an EE to get these opportunities?

4) Perhaps the most important thing: I already know I like CS, but is there an EE-esque class I can take within my first 2 years that can help me determine whether I should make the switch? Time is kinda of the essence, bc my scholarship only covers 4 years and OOS rates are not fun :(

So I’m a year into my Masters in a CS program. My research areas are machine learning and deep learning with a past emphasis on reinforcement learning (a few projects for seminar classes under my belt). Lately I’ve been more focused on time series analysis as a whole though as I have an internship where I do some types of time series research. The internship is at a startup and I absolutely love the pace and environment of it. So much so that working for a startup/small company seems to be my forte.

I’m pretty set on getting my masters and then trying to get into a financial/quant/hedge fund type startup afterwards. This seems like a very cool and challenging space and I want to make sure I’m able to get into a company that I’d be excited to work for.

This leads me to my question about potential Master thesis or project options. Would anyone here know of ideas or good starting places to look for projects that would strengthen my ability to get into the type of financial/quant type roles I’m looking for?

I’m in a spot at my current university where I really have the ability to pick any type of project I want so I figured it be a great opportunity to get my foot in the door while also jumpstart the knowledge of the finance field.

As for my background I’ve had formal education in deep learning, ML, 2 semesters of mathematical statistics, and a basic finance course with all the mathematics as well (calc, linear algebra). With my funding from CS I’m able to take MBA courses from my university and plan to take a quantitative methods in finance course and a derivatives course. Personally, I’ve traded stocks in a buy and hold type manner for a couple years and over the last 6ish months I’ve been trading/researching derivatives, mainly options.

If you had any advice or suggestions on my thesis I’d love to hear them and I really appreciate the help."

I just finished my freshman year of college and am back home on summer break. I am working two jobs, one at a car dealer and one at a baseball park. As an automotive major, the dealership is working wonders for me. Anyways, to the point.

The college I go to has jobs and internships coming to the school to interview for positions. I would love to get an internship but within that likes the problem. If I get an internship provided through the school or even one I go out of state to interview for, I will be going away from home for the summer pretty much in my own place (in a apartment). I don't know if I'm ready to make that step, I know I'll need to get comfortable being away from my home which is why I go to a college where I rarely go home when I'm not on a break. I want to stay home and see my friends but I also want to do what's best for my future career. Sure, I can get internships that can progress my career but options are limited. There is one major option I'm looking at back home, and that's an independent shop. But if I choose to go away, I can end up at major companies like GM, FCA, Ford, etc. and obviously that is really good to have experience wise.

I know I still have a year to decide this but I'm torn between the two. Move away and I'll rarely see my friends, but I add to my future career. Stay home and I have a possibility of one more summer seeing friends and hanging out, but I won't get the chances I would if I would've moved out. Any comments help, thanks.

I spent 6 months learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap in 2017, and another 6 months in 2018-2019 strengthening my fundamentals, learning GIT, learning Markdown, learning JavaScript data structures &amp; algorithms, and familiarizing myself with React.

&amp;#x200B;

My Vietnamese visa will expire next month and I need to make a decision -- Commit to living in Vietnam for another year or come back to the states to find a job.

&amp;#x200B;

I have family or friends who will ease my financial burden (with free/reduced rent for several months) in Wisconsin, Texas, and Arizona, but I will still have to provide for my other living expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Having been abroad for so long, I don't know what the economy is like in the states. I get by living in Asia, but I'd like to transition into development so that I can earn enough to comfortably support my aging parents and future family regardless of where we eventually choose to settle.

&amp;#x200B;

Mostly, I just don't know where my skills put me. Is finding entry-level development work in the US realistic for me ($3,000+/month)? Or should I maintain my content marketing business on the side and take a worthless paying job ($400/month) doing React development for a company in Vietnam and make the move to a US company next year?

&amp;#x200B;

It'll definitely be easier to get experience in Vietnam because being a native English speaker here basically doubles the value of any tech skills I have. BUT... I won't be able to save any money living here, and I'll likely have to work 60+ hours per week (40 in development and 20 doing side hustles) to comfortably get by.

&amp;#x200B;

I speak English, Spanish, and Vietnamese. I have a US passport. My five year goal is to be making at least $5,000/month doing web development remotely. I know I need lots of experience to do that, *but...* I've been abroad so long I just don't know how hard experience is to come by in the states.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 1: 

Just graduated college for Computer Science about two weeks ago, i have one internship and two part time computer science related jobs for the past 2 years. Let\`s say i have more hands on skills than 80% of other undergrads who just graduated.

I still somehow can not find a job, i did not imagine it would be so hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 2:

5 months ago i met a girl through a mutual friends. We both started talking and clicked right away. She is beautiful, hot and the best part is we can talk freely to one another. Me as a person i find it very hard to get close to other people, most of the time even when i am out with friends i still feel alone, like a dont belong, but with this girl it was different. I have walked out and refused girls who wanted to get with me or in a relationship plenty of times just because it did not feel right, that is the type of person i am and this girl is the first girl in many many years that i really like and have feelings for. Anyway fast forward a week ago, her student visa got rejected so she is going to marry someone for papers. This is not a problem because we could still meet, but her uncle made her promise she would not go in a serious relationship of any kind to undermine this for at least three years so she said that we have to stop talking. I will be meeting with her one last time in one of these weeks.  She has already told me that she loves me and has been pretty upset/crying about this, i am very sad aswell.

&amp;#x200B;

helpful facts:

\- first relationship

\- she is 19 , came here last year , her uncles are helping her

\- told me she loves me already

\- scared if her uncles find out about us, because they would be disappointed since they asked her explicitly not to and they are helping her a lot

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway not having a job + having someone that we both love each other, but can not be together just because of circumstances is fucking with me mentally a lot and i dont seem to find anything enjoyable anymore."

bwsx0l,1,2019-06-04,Offered a QA role after a long period of unemployment; should I take it in the short term? Or should I wait for something better?,PuzzleheadedLynx7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bwsx0l/offered_a_qa_role_after_a_long_period_of/,"I'm a (relatively) recent grad with a Bachelor's degree in CS. I graduated with Honors and a fairly high GPA (~3.75). While in school, I maintained a really good internship -- full time in the summer and part time during the school year -- for about 2.5 years at a major company. Without naming it, it's not one of the ""Big 4"", but it is a huge, well-known and well-respected international software corporation. The internship was mostly a dev role working on some pretty substantial stuff, but in this company there was no real distinction between dev and QA, so I also did a ton of testing work.

Right after graduating, I ended up faced with a major emergency that spiraled way out of control and basically locked me down for several months. I was completely out of work for this whole time. After that period ended I started applying for jobs again, but progress has not been great and I've now been out of work (and school) for a whole year. Prospects have been slim, to say the least, and being that my finances are not in great shape after going so long without working, I've started applying for roles outside my ideal. That includes QA.

I've recently interviewed for and have been offered a ""Junior Software Tester"" role at a local company. This is the first offer I've had, and I'm very tempted to take it. There's absolutely nothing glamorous about this position, but I'm running out of money and it pays well (approx. the same as a junior SE in my city).

My problem is this: although I actually enjoy testing, I'm not sure I want to do QA forever. I've heard, variously, that taking QA work of any kind is tantamount to career suicide, like a black stain that can never be removed from your resume; or, that QA will maybe slow my future prospects a bit but won't prevent me from switching to SE; or, that it's fine as long as I only do it for a year or so; or, that it won't have any bearing on my SE at all.

So given my past experience, my education, and some decent if not stunning side projects, would taking this role be shooting myself in the foot if I don't really want to be in QA indefinitely? How long should I be looking to stay if I'm planning on switching streams? Or would it be better just to stay unemployed and try to hold out for something else?"

I have to pull data from their OS400 IBM iSeries in regular intervals, which I'm also still figuring out, then work with that data and build a UI for outputting the data and building an environment for management. 

btw, I'm thinking this is way outside the scope of what can be expected of a single intern in under 3 months. They want it done in Python and that's what I've already spent the past couple weeks learning nonstop. 

I learned about some different libraries that I can use like Django and a lot of different GUI tools like tkinter, QT, wxPython, etc. Then after working with this for awhile, I read some things that implied I couldn't simply import the GUI I make. So I then found some things that said I could just import it through [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#wxpython-version). 

I just learned about the django-intranet module and found some guides, but I'm still not sure what I'm doing here. I'm having a lot of trouble implementing anything from that module on PyCharm. I could use any advice on how to start this project and any resources you suggest. Honestly worried I'm not going to be able to fulfill what they asked for.

Edit: btw, I don't have access to GitHub on their network and I'm limited to working on Windows

Update for anyone reading this: I guess they felt I was taking too long so they called a consultant who told them that their timeframe was ridiculous. I'm now looking into some other stuff they want automated like their form workflow over Adobe, which is a whole 'nother pain in the ass because they don't use Microsoft Outlook."

I don’t have all the details because it’s traumatic for my bf to talk about, but when he was 14 years old he was groomed by his mentor at his internship and he was molested. The child molester preformed oral sex on him unwillingly. He went to trial and his sentencing, in mine and my bf’s opinion, was incredibly weak. He received no prison time and was not jailed for more than 30 days. Later it came out that this child molester had molested an Autistic boy and received harsher sentencing for that case. My bf believes that they were not stand alone cases and that there were other boys who had been groomed as well, but wouldn’t come forward because of the stigma. He is now soon turning 24 and after just finding out this information I feel the justice system has failed. My bf has faced long term consequences like battling with mental illness, having to go to therapy, having adverse affects on his sexuality, and having anxiety that the perpetrator will come and get him(he bought a shotgun that he keeps under the bed because he fears for his life). I want to know if there is a way for the case to be retried so that a harsher sentencing can be given, especially now that time has passed and the affects of his molestation are prevalent. Any and all advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.

It's usually teaching simple stuff like Scratch (drag and place block based programming) or simple games like hangman or quiz-games. 



The problem is, the hours are crappy and thus the pay is pretty abysmal. I'm thinking of working a retail job instead as a result of this. My question is: how does a position like this look on one's resume? As someone in the industry or a recruiter, would this be a plus in terms of future employment?

bwuxbs,1,2019-06-04,Job Search Recommendations,ezee_chief,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bwuxbs/job_search_recommendations/,"I had an interview for my dream job last week that was technically for 2 open positions. The company is a subsidiary of a huge player in the industry. The openings are entry-level positions that I have a decent amount of experience in, albeit mostly self-taught, and it's very much related to my degree. I had a referral, I studied up on the company and its sister companies (they work in tandem and share office buildings), and made sure to ask many high quality questions as possible. The highest ranking interviewer followed up with my thank you email saying that he could tell I was passionate about the industry. The recruiter scheduled a phone call follow-up with me suggesting that they’re waiting to hear back from an offer they extended the week prior, and an intern that may potentially be slotted up. The only negative feedback he got was that I was nervous during the interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where things get confusing, I did check the job listings at the company on LinkedIn and Glassdoor, and the listing for my job was relisted/republished on Glassdoor the day after my interview. The recruiter also said if I didn’t get either of the positions that they’d be open to have me do a phone screening with another team’s manager, when another opening presents itself. He said it could be next week that he becomes aware of a new, similar opening, or it could be in 2 months. He wants me to check in with him weekly, but hasn't responded to my first check-in.

I didn't really expect to get it but i went everyday since to just follow up and find out how my application was looking. I ended up going today on my lunch break and they said they were really impressed with my persistence and when we sat down to talk they were happy that I did some research on the company.

Now coursing business management, intern in the biggest brazilian company, which holds me a good career. I've a relationship for 5 years now.

You would think I have my shit together, why am I complaining? I will tell you why. My life's just utterly disgraceful by now.

First of all my first relationship was just magical, the kind of love you would just stop what you're doing to fantasize about how you would get in front of a bullet to protect her if you needed to. She was, and in some way still is absolutely everything for and in me. It was quick, we started by 2010 and it was over late 2011, just as I was going to attend an exam which I was preparing myself for half the year, for a public position which would provide us enough to start our lives. I was 19 by the time and got destroyed by the breakup.

Then there was like 2 years of absolute depression. I started dating my current girlfriend in an attempt to forget the first one. 

When I was a kid I had a confortable life. My father worker in a big brazilian tech company in the 90s and would make some good money, but the company was sold and he decided to quit, just as my aunt was dealing with a very hard economic situation with her 4 children. My dad decided to move from our house, our owned house so that my aunt could live there for free, while we would rent a bigger one. In exchange she would just have to pay the condominium taxes, which she never did, and here in Brazil it means your house can be auctioned to pay for the debt, and she didn't notify us because the buyer paid her some money for it, as the price for them would be smaller. This is how we lost our home. Since then our economic situation got slowly but constantly worse. I had lived in several different houses because my parents didn't have stable economic income and therefore we always had difficulties in paying our rents, resulting in having to find another house to live in from time to time.

While I struggle to make it through college (internship is very far from everything and it makes studying harder) so I can have a stable job to provide for my family, holding the burden of my age, I'm facing the third eviction just this year. I didn't suicide yet just because I have a brother and a sister under 13, but I'm already broken, and I mean broken. I can't feel joy in anything more, not even alcohol seems to work anymore.

To make things worse everyone seem to rely on me, from my current girlfrient to my mother and my brothers and I can't rely on anyone. It just feels lonely for me, I can't even speak out what I feel because I need to maintain the confidence otherwise everyone will collapse. I'm the only one who doesn't have the right to bend over and it's just too much for me.

I don't know if you guys will read this text, I just needed to speak out all of this. I can't do it anymore."

bwwxw6,5,2019-06-04,Isn't the 85th percentile rule fundamentally flawed...?,Goins2754,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/bwwxw6/isnt_the_85th_percentile_rule_fundamentally_flawed/,"ELI5 on the 85th percentile rule as I understand it:  in 1964, a researcher for the Dept of Commerce, Bureau of Public Roads named David Solomon wrote a paper called [""Accidents on Main Rural Highways Related to Speed, Driver, and Vehicle""](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa1304/Resources3/40%20-%20Accidents%20on%20Main%20Rural%20Highways%20Related%20to%20Speed,%20Driver,%20and%20Vehicle.pdf).  In this paper, Solomon states that variation in vehicle speeds on roads is a leading cause of accidents.  Somehow, that became to be that, when left to drive completely by their own intuition regarding speed in a free flow condtion, 85% of drivers will drive a ""reasonable and prudent"" speed.  And somehow that became to be that, logically, if speed limits are set at the 85th percentile (rounded to the nearest 5mph), then the road will have safe speed limits.

Now, like I said, that's how I understand it.  Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.  I'm a structural engineer, so I only had to take two classes of highway &amp; traffic engineering.  Maybe my understanding of the fundamentals is flawed.  Also, if someone would fill in how we got from the Solomon paper to the ""reasonable and prudent"" 85th percentile rule, that'd be great, too!  I see the logic in the progression, but I'd love to hear who made the decisions and exactly why.  But that's kinda off topic.

Here's my beef with the whole thing:

As an intern, I helped lay down tubes and do speed studies with a county DoT.  Now, I didn't do the number-crunching at the time, but there seemed to be some direct relationship between the speeds the tubes recorded and the speed limits on the signs.  But those drivers were driving on an already-marked road.  They weren't free to intuit their own reasonable and safe speed.  So, wouldn't the whole concept be flawed?

It'd be akin to taking speed measurements with a police car and radar parked on the side of the road.  Then, stating that the speed limit needs no change as 85% of people were driving at the posted limit.

But what about unmarked or new roads?  Every driver is taught their ""...unless otherwise posted limit"" during driver's ed.  I don't remember exactly, but it's something like 30mph in city limits and 45mph or 55mph on rural roads.  So, even if there was some brand new road through the country, drivers would be influenced by the thought, ""I don't know the speed limit, but it's probably 45mph.  I better drive that just in case there's a cop around.""  This seems flawed as well.

**TLDR:**  My understanding of the 85th percentile rule is that it requires drivers to intuit a safe speed in a free flow condition without any legal influence and I wonder how that's possible when speed studies are conducted in an environment where existing speed limits are already clearly posted or where drivers are taught typical speeds for unmarked roads.

My solution would be, of course, to just use the design speed of the road as the speed limit.  While working at my county DoT internship, I sought out a few roads' design speed limits from the drawings.  Knowing then pretty much what I know now about roads, I drove them at those design speed limits to see what that was like.  On a design speed 45mph road (signed at 35mph), I can honestly say I didn't *want* to speed.  I felt like 45mph, with the number of entrances per mile, clear zones, etc, was plenty enough speed.  I feel like it's a much better system than the 85th percentile rule.

I could go on and on because I'm passionate about speed limits and roadway design.  But I don't want to ramble.  Please help me understand how the 85th percentile rule isn't fundamentally flawed as described."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 20, female, a rising junior studying English at a liberal arts college in the US Northeast, but am currently home for the summer in Alabama. Here's sort of my general life story of the near past that has led to my current situation: 

Right before I came to college my dad passed away very suddenly and unexpectedly and left me and my entire family reeling. I went to college anyway, since we had both worked as a team applying to all of the schools and I felt like he would've wanted me to move on with my life and him not be the reason I didn't go in the fall. I didn't have any time to process what had happened, and I thought about taking a year off, but I had no idea what to do, especially under such short notice. I struggled throughout the year to find people I connected with and was having a difficult time grieving, coming to terms with what had happened, especially being completely isolated from my family and old friends. I began to feel really tired and apathetic and decided to go to the school's health clinic to see if I had mono or something, and they referred me to specialists, where I found out I had a (benign) brain tumor. I asked about what could've caused it, and the doctor told me that it could've been a result of my hormones being messed up from extreme emotional stress, which would make a lot of sense if that were true. The year was coming to a close and I felt extremely disillusioned and embittered about my first year and life in general, and I thought a summer at home would be restorative and relaxing, but when I returned to school for my sophomore year the same feelings began to creep back in after an initial period of excitement about having cool roommates, being invited to parties, etc. Once again, my grades were sub-par, and even though my professors were extremely supportive and encouraging of me, reminding me about the wonderful work I'm capable of, my talent as a writer, etc., it only made me feel like even more of a failure for not living up to my potential, and like I was wasting time at this great school I was lucky enough to somehow get into and get a full ride to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm back home for the summer after a half-hearted attempt to get an internship that didn't work. I find myself constantly in a negative mindset, like I don't believe that the world will be good to me ever again. I feel trapped here at home, and have few friends from high school that I really connect with, so I don't have many people to have meaningful interactions with, although there are plenty of people I could hang out with. I feel so alone, completely unmoored, like everything in my life is going absolutely nowhere. I don't know what I want to do career-wise, and my closest friends I took for granted have been less than loyal and generally unwilling to be there for me in the way I've been there for them. I feel like I'm stuck staring at a brick wall, honestly, and like all the energy I've put into trying to be successful at school and cultivating relationships seems to have yielded me nothing. I have been to therapy frequently, which seems to help temporarily, but then a friend will really let me down or there will be some stressful family situation and I'll feel like I don't deserve those things after all I've been through and my sense of disillusionment becomes harder and harder to shake off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given....all of this, I doubt my situation will change substantially if I go back to school in the fall. I want to take a semester off, but I don't know what to do or where to go. I want to meet new people but also have time to myself to reflect, and I don't think it would be good for me to have a super-demanding job, which is unfortunate, since I have some money saved up but not enough to live off of for several months, especially not if I go abroad. I'm beginning to panic a little, since everyone I've talked to basically says ""I don't know what to tell you, you've got to chart your own path"" etc. and summer won't last forever and I have to let my school know in advance if I'm taking a leave of absence.... it's all so overwhelming. I have experience with tutoring, am decent at writing, am an avid photographer, am competent and experienced at general domestic tasks and childcare (even though there are things I'd rather do than babysit). 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to grow and thrive and see the good in the world and be more able to help others, but I feel completely stuck right now. If any of you has any ideas/know of any opportunities at all, or can simply give general advice for my situation, I would appreciate it so much. Thank you for reading."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Canadian student from a university near Waterloo (not as prestigious though). I was recently hired for an internship in the Fall (2019) after months of applications and interviews. The position is IT Systems Administrator but I am a little worried that the position is not going to help me for a future internship (that I would much rather be a Soft. Dev position).

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't seem to get many Soft Dev interviews as my grades for my first semester (second year) were so bad. I am now in the process of retaking the 2 courses I had failed in Fall of 2018. I also bombed a technical interview last week.

&amp;#x200B;

Will future employers look down on me when applying to future internships? I am going into my third year and this is going to be my first internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

So I'm an intern at my municipal public works department and I was tasked with organizing all the properties they own and all the related attributes (fire extinguishers, sprinklers, suppression, etc.). Basically a massive inventory (but the attributes are only for my specific division.) [Here's](https://imgur.com/WQ8IPNg) what part of my excel inventory file looks like, to have an idea. I've used conditional formatting to make the dates pop out at you. Orange = within 14 days, red = today, blue = already passed, regular white cell = 15 days beyond the current date (irrelevant). This is all with excel 2010 on windows.


Anyway I kind of want to surprise my boss with this:

I want to generate some sort of report (maybe a pivot table) in excel that searches all the date columns for the orange colored dates (within 14 days) and displays the property name and address (row header and adjacent column) with the dates next to it. It would be neat if it could refresh every time it's opened. I have the conditional formatting do that with the ""today's date"" column at the far end. [This](https://imgur.com/yR0w2b6) is what I'm thinking in my head. I'll try to configure it to show past inspection dates to know which ones to update.

A bit lengthy but I would be really grateful if someone could guide me as to what I can do and where I can learn about this.

Thank you!"

I'm currently majoring in system and cyber security engineering. However, I've always have been more interested in the devOps and in the automation fields,  therefore I applied at one of biggest banking companies in the world (which I wont mention the name) as an intern, in the RPA field, using a variety of tools, such as VBA, UIpath etc.


My manager was very pleased with my work so far that he offered me a contract. Though I'm not quite sure if I want to keep working in this field, even though I really do enjoy it, it's just that I prefer the other king of automation, mostly cloud and network related.


Considering that I really like my current job, not to mention that I keep getting job offers from recruiters through linkedin on a daily basis, though only in the RPA field, whereas I truly struggle to find an internship in netwoking, cyberSec and devOps.


So ehat would you do in my place? Even though, I'm technically speaking very skilled on all fields (full dev, networking and infrastructure engineering, but also on a more human level, in which I can communicate well enough to achieve process automation, with non technical personnel).

What should I do?"

'You're the new doctor, XY, right?' Boom, no turning back now, handshake, introduction -&gt; LET THE CONVERSATION BATTLE COMMENCE.

It was intense as fuck in the start but the longer we talked the more smooth and flowing the conversation became. We talked for 30 minutes about all kinds of shit, laughing and joking. 

He was a complete stranger and a very intimidating such. I was scared shitless, but this time I didn't give a fuck. I did what was good for me longterm and I think I made his day better as well.

I just finished my freshman year of college, and for the last month, I've been trying to find a part time job over the summer. So far, I've been having difficulty finding a job over the last month, and I've just been very frustrated with it all considering I've never had a job before and I'm just looking for any old part time job. While I'm not absolutely desperate for the money or anything, I would really like to make some extra money to help me pay off some of my student loans and to help finance my education.

On Wednesday morning, I was browsing Indeed and found a position for a local summer camp where I would be teaching kids JavaScript and HTML for $15/hr. This seemed like the perfect position for me. This fits in perfectly with my major (I'm studying computer science), I already know JavaScript and HTML, the experience it would give me would be great on my resume for when I start searching for internships in the future, and the pay is better than being something like a cashier. Plus, I have some experience with kids (I've tutored a kid before and done events with kids in my past volunteering). I applied that morning, and within 2 hours, I got an invitation for a phone interview the following day. I did the phone interview last Thursday for 30 minutes, and the interview went really great. On the phone, the guy who was interviewing me told me that he wanted to do a second interview (this time, in-person) sometime this week where I would meet another person who works at the summer camp. He sent me an email on Friday inviting me to an in-person interview at a coffee shop yesterday, and that interview (which also lasted 30 minutes) also went really great. We discussed things like what I would be expected to do, how I should prepare to handle the kids, where I would work, etc., and both of them really liked me and were excited to get started with me.

Before I left, the guy who was interviewing me told me he would send me a contract yesterday night and told me that he would provide me the materials to prepare for when we start next Monday after I sign it and send it back to him. I assumed that this would be something like an employment contract that would detail information like my pay or hours, but to my surprise, when I received the email yesterday, he only sent me a confidentiality contract. At this point, I never discussed my pay with him in my interviews, and he didn't send me anything regarding my pay. The only thing I know about my pay is, based off the Indeed listing, I should be making $15/hr.

I signed the confidentiality contract and sent it back to him this morning, and in my email response, I asked him if there were any other steps I would need to take before beginning employment, such as filling out any other forms. Granted, since I've never had a job before, I don't know how exactly the hiring process works, but from what I understand, I would need to fill out an I-9 form and my parents have been telling me that I should fill out a tax form, too. I asked him this question in the email in the hopes that he would provide me with some sort of employment contract or something that would guarantee my salary. By asking this question, I was also hoping he could provide me with any tax forms or other forms that are necessary for employment.

However, in his reply, he completely ignored the question I asked him and just sent me the materials I need to prepare with before Monday. This is leaving me very uneasy about this job so far because:
(1) We never discussed how much I'm going to be paid, even though the job listing says $15/hr.
(2) I haven't filled out any standard employment forms, like tax forms, that you would normally fill out before taking on a new job, and as of now, it doesn't seem like I will be.
(3) If I begin working for them, I currently don't have anything regarding my salary written on paper, and I don't want them to go back on what the listing says and pay me less.
(4) The fact that he completely ignored my question makes me think he isn't going to give me any kind of written proof, form, or contract that would normally be given when being hired for a job, and it makes me think that he is trying to avoid filling out any tax forms.

I've been talking about this to my parents, and they've been telling me that I should not start doing anything for them until I get some form of written proof regarding my salary and until I fill out forms like the tax forms. They told me that they're worried that the guy who interviewed me is trying to scam me or pay me under the table, which is illegal and could also backfire on me since he can pay me less and I'd have no legal recourse. I really don't want to be paid under the table because I don't want to do anything illegal, and I don't want to be screwed over with how much I'm getting paid. With how things have been going so far, I'm starting to get worried that they may be right even though I really hope they aren't.

**At this point, what should I do going forward? Again, I've never actually had a job before, so I don't really know what to expect when getting hired for a job. How does the process work? What forms should I be filling out before getting started? What should I do to protect myself before I'm supposed to start working? Is what is happening right now, in any way, shape, or form, normal, or should I be pressuring him to give me some sort of written proof?**

I'm thinking of sending him an email telling him that I cannot begin working for him until I get some sort of contract or written proof verifying my salary, and I'm thinking of asking him about the tax forms. I don't know how exactly I would word it yet, but I'm thinking of being more straightforward/upfront in the way I say it than I was in the last email I sent him.

I'm sorry if this post is all over the place. I've just been really stressed and frustrated recently, and I just really hope this is all going to work out in the end.

Thank you guys so much.

**EDIT:** I forgot to include another important piece of information that I found out from another post I made. The confidentiality contract I signed was titled an ""Independent Contractor Confidentiality Agreement."" Based on this, it seems like he wants to hire me as an independent contractor rather than an employee. From what I understand, this means I wouldn't be eligible for workers compensation or unemployment benefits (which is fine anyways), but I would have to pay 15.3% in taxes instead of 7.65% because the employer wouldn't pay his share of the taxes. Is it still worth doing this job if I'm going to be classified as an independent contractor, or should I push him to classify me as an employee? Based on the Department of Labor's description of employees and independent contractors, it seems like the work I'd be doing falls more in line with that of an employee due to the nature of the work and his economic dependence upon my work."

I'd like to share my story and hope to gain some advise on what it is you would do in my situation.

Last month, I graduated with my undergrad degree in CS with honors, 3.8 GPA and no internship experience. I spent my summers at university working as a research assistant doing deep learning and taking classes outside my major. (I realize now I screwed up for doing this and should've done internships)

Throughout last semester, I have been applying for jobs through my career fair and I got lucky and got a couple offers. My first one was at American Express in south Florida. This was not my top choice, but I still signed because my contract was ""at will"" and I thought I could rescind whenever I get a better offer. I continued interviewing and I got an interview with a university-affiliated research center which I don't feel comfortable naming. Throughout the interview process, I was told that a security clearance is required. I asked if it's okay to be duel citizen multiple times, which every time they said ""Yes it's okay, laws have changed and you can be a duel citizen. Don't worry."" This offer was much better in terms of what work I would be doing at the company (deep learning/reinforcement learning). SO, I signed with the company, and rescind the offer with American Express. Everything was GOOD.

About a month or two later, I found out that I was denied interim security clearance without a reason. I know that everything on my clearance application was clean, except the fact that I was duel citizen with Iran and had been there within the past seven years. As a result, my offer was contingent on security clearance and my start date was pushed to 2020. Even though they did not end the deal with me, they pressured me to rescind. They mentioned that I would have to do multiple interviews in the process of getting full clearance and to expect not to start working until 2020 at least.

Now i'm still in my college town with no job. I apply everywhere on linkedin and handshake, but no luck. I hardly get interviews and all the ones I've gotten are from it staffing companies like Infosys, revature, MindTree etc... I've just been doing leetcode all day and that's pretty much it.

Am I screwed? Am I not getting interviews back because it is summer time?



edit:

Just to clarify - I was born and raised in the United States. My parents are immigrants from Iran."

Please critique my resume and make suggestions!,jubialz,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/bx2spg/life_plans_changed_now_what_please_critique_my/,"Reddit, I am in a bit of a pickle. I moved to London last year with my husband who came here on contract with his company. I decided to do a career change and left my job in consulting to pursue Experimental Psychology - the idea with that was that I could combine my love of data, psychology, and business all in one degree. I was looking to get a job in consumer insight or marketing or organizational psychology or anything that relates psychology and data to the business world (I hated my Finance degree).  The dream job was to work for a food company and researching consumer tastes and etc.

I was lucky and got offered an internship here in London and was all set.

Until my husband lost his job (issues with his company) and now we have to come back to Texas. I am sort of freaking out because I cannot get a post-graduate internship in Texas since companies are no longer doing post-graduate internship recruiting. I am looking for jobs in fields I am interested in and can find no internships - only experienced level positions that are asking for WAY more than I have.  So I am currently applying to consulting jobs (don't really want to do this) and jobs that have vague descriptions.

I feel stuck in writing my resume because I was royally screwed over by the firm I was at. I came in as a Finance consultant, but because the Finance division got no work I was literally used as a fill-in and thrown into random projects - to the point where I came out of this job with nothing but general consulting skills and no hard skills. I didn't actually do any Finance work even though that was what my title said.

I am interested in the following areas: consulting (only because I might stand an okay chance), consumer insight, organizational psychology, business processes, marketing, and anything that combines psychology with the corporate world.

Any recommendations on how to word my resume? I would really like to get a job in the field I was aiming for, but at this point, I just need A job since it's hard that we are both currently unemployed and need a source of income at the moment. Be as harsh as you like, as I don't feel very confident about anything I have on here.

Thanks in advance!

In my interview, I told them that I was self-taught and eager to get into the computer science field. I got an awesome internship at a lab that requires a lot of computer and programming skills.

I feel like the past month has been so unproductive since they've used so many resources to train me. I've been watching videos, reading papers, and trying really hard to understand my project better but writing scripts is so much harder than learning to do it.

bx3w89,13,2019-06-05,What I wish I knew about financial aid and life after college.,grumpymeatball,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bx3w89/what_i_wish_i_knew_about_financial_aid_and_life/,"These are my opinions and my opinions only. They do not apply to all situations or circumstances but are what I wish I knew or would tell my future children. College is heckin' expensive and you should know where your advantages are.

**Educate yourself.** Knowledge is power. Financial information is dull, exhausting, and complicated. But the more you know the more tools you will have in your toolbox. Learn about your school's financial programs, talk to a financial aid adviser, and study up on financial aid terminology. Google the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Understand what a grant is. Check the deadlines for scholarships and financial aid contests on campus. You are responsible for taking care of your own future. Never rely on anyone else to do it for you or hoping for the best.

**You do not need to accept all of the loans you are offered.** When you receive a financial aid package from your school it will sometimes contain a combination of loans, grants, and scholarships. ALWAYS ACCEPT ALL OF THE GRANTS AND SCHOLARSHIPS. They are free money! HOWEVER, the loans are optional and can be catered to fit your financial situation. (Obviously, if you need the entire loan take it but know you can adjust the total to your needs, if desired.) Even if it is only a small payment, those contributions before graduation add up to significant savings.

* **Example:**

1. Bob receives a financial aid package offering him $8,000 total aid.
2. $1000 is an academic scholarship. $2,500 is a federal grant. $4,500 is the loan offer.
3. Bob can, *and should*, accept the scholarship and grant for a total of $3,500. He doesn't have to pay that back later. Scholarships and grants are the unicorns of financial aid. The more, the better.
4. But what about the loan? Let's say Bob saved some cash and can afford to spend $1,500 this semester. Bob should accept $3,000 of the loan offer. He will then owe $1,500 up front for the current semester. This means Bob will only have to pay back $3,000 after graduation instead of $4,500. This may not seem like a lot but it adds up over time in interest.
5. Bob should ask his financial aid office about payment plans. If they are offered, Bob can split his $1,500 into smaller monthly payment over the course of the semester instead of one lump sum. He should ask about this option EARLY because the payment plans often start before the first bill is due and classes begin.

**You can start paying off your loan as soon as you graduate.** Do not wait for the grace period! Most loans offer a six-month deferment grace period after graduation where you can delay loan payments. Most people think this is a honeymoon period where everything is peachy-keen and it's such a nice feeling to be able to enjoy life after college. If possible, DO NOT WAIT. Start paying your loans off immediately. If your financial institution doesn't allow payments early then start setting aside that money as if they did. Pay your savings account that amount every month until the grace period ends and then transfer the total to your loan. The sooner you start paying the sooner you will be debt-free, regardless of interest accruing or not. There is no honeymoon after college. Welcome to real life. Adulting is expensive, boring, and full of disappointment. The best thing you can do for yourself is get your financial situation under control. Of course, always check the fine print of your loan company and follow their rules.

**Whenever possible, pay more than the minimum payment**. I cannot stress this enough. Most people graduate, get their first loan statement, and pay the minimum payment listed over and over again. Doing so will increase the amount of time you have to pay the loan back and, over time, the cost of the loan with compounding interest. Most people don't realize you can pay as much as you want! If the minimum payment is $175 and you can afford $200, do it. Never underestimate the power of a few dollars. They add up and will significantly change the course of your loan lifespan.

**Work your butt off.** If you are able, try to work as much as possible during (and immediately after) college. Get a part-time job. Find an internship. Volunteer. Be active in your community or field of choice. Employers like to see potential candidates who are actively involved and have experiences. Note I didn't say ""experience"" because that infers you need a job in your field. Yes, that is ideal, but not always possible. Instead, accrue as many valuable work experiences as you can even if it is unpaid. Not only is it great for a resume but it means you are building a reputation and network of references.

* **Example:** I was in school full-time for undergrad, worked part-time in retail, and had an course-based internship. When the internship ended I continued to volunteer for the same organization which eventually led to another part-time job. I was dizzy with work and classes, running around every day taking multiple trains and buses, barely getting by. But it made it very clear that I was willing to work hard and provided lots of excellent references. (I will mention that I was living at home and relying solely on public transportation at the time which I realize is not an opportunity everyone is able to afford.)

**If offered, take advantage of accelerated summer and break classes**. At my school there were classes offered during spring break week and during the summer. The spring break class was one whole week in April, Monday to Friday, 9AM-5PM. That was it. Sure, it's tough to take a a whole week for a class but it meant I could reduce the schedule load of the rest of my semester because that entire class, start to finish, was done in one week instead of spread out over a whole semester. Summer classes were usually a few weeks longer but still less than a whole semester. You can use this tip to either accelerate your graduation or use these classes to take some of the pressure off the longer semesters by being ahead credit-wise. I never went on a spring break vacation but saved a heck of a lot of time in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

*I will note here that this is not one-size fits all. Some of you might have children, health issues, disabilities, or a number of other circumstances where surviving takes priority over finances. College is hard and debt is brutal. We're all drowning in it but do everything you can do educate yourself on how it works and how you can take advantage of every opportunity. You owe yourself the chance to make it.*"

bx4sfs,14,2019-06-05,Job Search is Hard for someone without Experience,waster2252,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bx4sfs/job_search_is_hard_for_someone_without_experience/,"Simply put, look at the title. I am actively looking for a job, so much so that I've considered contacting staffing agencies and even registered to attend something similar to a job fair in my area, which is north-west San Antonio. The problem is that I have no work experience and therefore no real references. The only jobs that want me are marketing/sales roles that are akin to slave labor where they want me working Monday-Saturday from 10am-7pm for $360 a week base without benefits which is 54 hours a week at a rate of less than $7 an hour. Like its so bad, I can't even get an interview from companies like BestBuy while retail locations like Nordstrom, Macy's and Express simply respond with no in an email. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I am doing wrong, like I've searched for ATS friendly resumes and did what I could to make it look decent. I don't even know if I interview well since all my interviews are for mass expanding companies just looking for chumps that enjoy being paid less than any minimum wage employee. What I wouldn't give to know why I am just not being considered for any role I want, considering I am not even shooting that high just a retail associate at local stores, but any position that sounds like I would get burned out within 3 weeks is more than willing to hire me to start as soon as I finish the interview. All I want is a steady, secure full-time job that pays at least $11 an hour where I wouldn't have to work over 40 hours a week without overtime. Originally I wanted to work in something similar to computer repair or help desk while in university so that I would have relevant work experience once I graduate, but I always get saddled with rejections. I had to start shooting lower, and even then I am still being rejected. It hurts. I don't know what to do and it feels like everything is closing in on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, all I really wanted was to work at my nearest BestBuy or Clarks, I even posted on the BestBuy subreddit asking if it would be a good idea to go in person to apply directly to the hiring manager to sell myself and get noticed. That was quickly shot down when they told me it was all online, but its the online portion they reject me at. I can't even get an interview scheduled. I've never felt like such a failure. There was a time when I was confident that once I got an interview I would get hired. I've since lost that confidence. I have created accounts on indeed, glassdoor, ziprecruiter and linkedin and am now just futilely looking through scores of job opportunities ready to reject me. I don't want to work in fast food due to the sensitivity of my nose, I would not manage smelling the odor of the greasy food all day. That is the prime reason I wanted to work in retail and yet there isn't a store willing to hire me. I just don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I wanted to work for BestBuy or Clarks is because I did so much shopping at both stores when I was using my parent's dime. I am fully sold on their business and yet it feels like there is nothing I can do to even get noticed by either company. I always imagined that I would have difficulty finding a job once I graduate in my major, but I also always thought I would already have a secure job that I would have worked in for years while attending university and applying to internships. I never once imagined I would have difficulty so soon. I just have to catch my breath, and hope for some luck I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Rant over, if you read this far... thank you for doing so and I am sincerely sorry you had to put up with me. Thank you for your time. Have a nice day, for the both of us. I know I need one, and I hope you'll have one.\*\*\*"

&amp;#x200B;

any feed back regarding the feasibility of my expected future is welcome, i feel like my options are 

* start recruiting heavily for ibanking, hopefully eventually make my way into a hedge fund and hopefully have a large enough network by then to start my own
* start a company, do my best, hopefully exit for a modest amount, repeat a few times until i hopefully have enough connections with a VC / angel investors to start my own fund off the back of that &amp; my accumulated exit cash (which is what the managing director i'm interning under did)
* I read somewhere that if I get a CFA (which I might be overestimating my ability to do while attending school), network with professors and meet the right people, I can make my way directly into a hedge fund and, with a solid foundation in math/tech I can climb / build relationships and seek investors much like the first option

but there seem to be a lot of ""hopefully's"" in these paths and if anyone thinks it sounds like the ramblings of some deluded 20 year old feel free to roast me to hell"

I’m going to be starting my third year of (community) college and after this it’s onto my four year. Problem is, I don’t even know if this is what I want to do. I searched for internships to try and find out if this is what I want but all of them were BS or didn’t get back to me. I’m in a relationship and love my girlfriend and hope to marry her one day if everything keeps going the way it has been. I’m a business major with an emphasis on marketing. So to make your lives easier here are my worries:

• I don’t want to take my work outside of 9-5 (or whatever my schedule is) unless I’m passionate about it and it doesn’t interrupt my relationship/family time. 

•I love motorcycles and the motorcycle community so much but I don’t see a way to make that part of my work 

• I want to be working in my career by the time I’m 25 so that I can provide for myself and my partner. 
 -I’d looked at being a veterinarian but I’m not from a rich family and can’t afford it and I don’t want that much debt. Plus it would just take too long and I’d feel like a bum by not being able to provide until I’m 27 because that’s how long it would take for me to graduate from veterinary school assuming I get accepted in my first year which is really hard in that field. 

• I need to make decent money because we both love California and want to stay in this state. We both think the only time we would leave here would be for school or just a year or two. 

• Neither of us really want to work in the city yet it seems that’s where most of the business jobs are which again loops to is it even a good career for me? 

I’ve just been super stressed and not sure what direction to take my life in because I just don’t know what I’m good at or what I truly enjoy"
bx5ksb,1,2019-06-05,Internship motivation,HelenaHelene,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bx5ksb/internship_motivation/,"Hey everyone I (22F) just started my second internship with a construction company as an intern estimater and I’m getting so unmotivated being here. It seem like every task they give me I end up messing up or being wrong. I feel like a burden whenever I ask questions because it seems like I’ve already asked that question or I just feel like I should know. I was working on some plans for four hours the other day and I couldn’t figure out and I kept getting my numbers incorrect. I’ve been here 2 weeks and I legit want to cry at times because I’m so frustrated with myself and I’m embarrassed to keep asking the same questions. The whole time I’m trying to complete my task I’m over thinking in my head about everything I’m calculating. This should be simple but it’s not....( Mind you, I haven’t even taken my estimating class for college either. I’m actually taking it now for summer school.) 

Any advice on this situation and how to be more motivated?

I still live at home, although I'm so far gone I'm not even embarrassed about that anymore, I want to use that to my advantage to go back to school. I currently have 30 credits (all gen-eds and some major classes) at a community college towards an Associate's degree in IT. I know the stigma around Associate's degrees, but I can't afford a bachelor's degree right now and I don't feel like I'm the 4-year university type of person. I just quit my part-time retail job in order to focus on school full-time and just figure some shit out, so I have time this summer to get this together before the Fall semester. 

I have always been interested in computers (not necessarily good at them yet) and I know this is my path, I just don't know the best way to go about it. Should I put all of my effort into finishing this Associate's degree in the next 1-1.5 years? Go back to work part-time/school part-time and take another 4 years to finish? After obtaining this degree, my plan was to go for a CIS certificate or two to add to my resume. Somewhere in that time period I'd like to apply to a few internships as well. If all of that isn't enough I don't know if I'm cut out for this life, a bachelor's degree just isn't obtainable for everyone. I've wasted my life from age 18-23 doing absolutely nothing and I want to try one last time before I give up for good. I've never really had any guidance in my life and my parent's are too busy with their own jobs, they just accept me as a basement-dwelling loser so I'm desperate for some help...thanks for reading."

It was paid ($22/hr) and it was my first real experience in the engineering workforce. I was given a few simple projects, nothing complicated, and I did all my projects in a reasonably timely manner. However, I worked from 7am to 5pm every day and most of this time was definitely not productive. I spent a lot of time on my phone, looking up stuff on the computer and shadowing employees (until I got the idea that they were annoyed and i would fuck off for a bit). Pretty much every employee knew I was unimportant and acknowledged it. Some employees got jealous (which is why HR told me under no circumstances tell anyone what you make) but overall, my managers were fine and that was that.

Now going into my last semester of college, the summer before I was contacted by my old internship company and they asked if I'd work for them again. I said yes because I was working in fast food for minimum wage and I thought I hit the jackpot.

Well, my first day was yesterday and it went pretty bad. We started off with paperwork and then my boss listed off a bunch of things he needed done and a deadline, and I got to work but I didnt know exactly what I was doing so I asked for help. Word got around and my boss was upset because he expected I know these things from college. He seemed to get over it and I spent the rest of the day handling my projects and shadowing employees, trying to at least look productive.

The second day (today) I came in and got to work on handling each task one by one. Until my boss came in and gave me another list of tasks. I obliged and told him I would get them done ASAP and he asked me what my progress was on my previous tasks and I told him nothing was done yet, and he lost it. He told me that he didnt hire me again so I could sit around and get paid to ""learn"" and that I needed to actually be a productive employee. After that, he walked out and I just went to an older employee and practically begged him for help, and he helped as much as he could but he was really busy. My boss saw me working with the guy and he said ""just go home, no point in paying you for the last 4 hours to ask questions"".

I'm incredibly worried that my ass is fired. I feel like there was a huge misunderstanding from my boss. I'm worried I'm gonna have to go back on the job hunt after having a false sense of security. I'm also worried that this is gonna cause a negative reference for future employees. What do I do?"

I was looking for advice on certain issue I am dealing that is repeated despite my attempts for the last year. 

1) Poor academic performance

2 terms ago I received a 65 term avg. Next term after doing poorly on midterms I decided to fix it. Changed my studying strategies, went to TAs, seeked out upper years at ""student success office"" etc. 

Ended up with 61.6 term avg. Frustration from putting in work and not getting results ensued. 
Bet more on diligence, tried to optimize my schedule better this term. Just received 5.5/10 on latest quiz worth 10%, where class average was 8/10. I made dumb mistakes where I just substituted the wrong value despite stating correct values before that. 

It was free marks and I missed it on accident. I even studied for the quiz, I tried to sleep enough that night.

It's frustrating, demoralizing and I know I just need to move onto the next quiz. But I can't shake the feeling that I will repeat the same things again and these types of mistakes have been chasing me all of my undergrad. 

For context, I have been minmaxing my life. I have been active on FSAE and 4 month rotations between school and internships are part of the program. I cannot drop FSAE to focus on school, frankly it's what's truly motivating me in engineering, despite liking the material and not the education system. 

I try to optimize time properly, make sure that I don't waste any, rotating between FSAE and studying and making sure not to burnout. I crave and hunger for improvement in all aspects, but at the same time there aren't any immediate fruits of my labour. In addition, I ranked bottom 3 in my class last term, took it with humour but I am worried I am starting to tell myself that I am dumb and lowering the standards for myself and making excuses for poor performance. 


TL:DR
How to deal with not reaching goals you were trying for? In academic, professional and personal topics."

I am a senior electrical engineering student who is graduating next summer 2020(Probably, not sure if the internship will affect that date). I went and interviewed with the electrical engineering department manager and I got a good understanding of the type of work I will be doing. The only thing that really scares me right now is the amount of time the manager took explaining how much he likes to challenges his employees especially interns. Now, when I heard that I was kinda excited cause  I thought I will get a chance to learn a lot and do work on my own, but now that I thought about it I worried that he will be so tuff on me that I won't get a chance to show my potential.

Please, I need some advice. also, from your experience do internships have a set end date and if so will I be forced to work at the company until that end date?"

I’m no longer as passionate as I once was for it and the job opportunities are stressing me out. 

All the internships I’ve applied for EE since January required you to know multiple coding languages such as python, java, C, HTML. However at my university, it’s not in our curriculum to learn any of those languages. I’ve applied to countless internships for this summer but I did not receive a single interview. It’s very stressful to think that I’m a year away from graduating with an engineering degree and I’m not even given the chance for an interview. 

Will it be the same problem one year from now; not being able to get an interview? Have other EE students encounter the same thing? Is coding that important for EE?

I’m trying to pick up Java and Python over the summer and so far I’m really liking it, more so than the courses in EE. Might be considering switching into software but I don’t know. Has other people have this doubt in EE? Just looking for some guidance."

bx8a62,1,2019-06-05,Help! Wellbutrin XL for anxiety with low moods?,tristategirl1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bx8a62/help_wellbutrin_xl_for_anxiety_with_low_moods/,"Hi everyone! 
Long post ahead but I’d appreciate the help!

Background: 

I am posting because this past school year (senior in college) I have had anxiety that I've never experienced before. I also had my first anxiety attack at the very beginning of this school year in life for coffee. It felt like I had a train running across my chest. I woke up so anxious every single day there were some days where I would uncontrollably cry. I distanced myself from my friends and isolated myself instead of enjoying my senior year. I would smoke and binge eat a lot instead of going out. 

I've had trauma growing up and I come from a fairly broken family. This has always made me very goal oriented (or so I thought it was goal oriented but I think its more so me controlling my life so much so I am not similar to my family). I stress over everything, become emotional easily, I have racing thoughts+low moods, am paranoid about who is genuine and who is not(also fear of abandonment), sometimes my focus is off and I cant get my point across. I have never had suicidal thoughts. 

I am a social worker and at work I am always on top of my game even during hard days. I have had many internships and social work related experience and Ive rocked at each and every single one of them. I have had a job lined up for 3 months now and will be starting mid of this month. I am the first person to graduate college from my family. All things I know I should be proud of. So why am I still feeling so low and anxious? It never impacts my work however, I am nervous this time it may?

I understand some may say during your 20's you are a mess trying to figure life out however, I do think its more than just that. Reflecting on my past I can confidently say I believe I have an Anxiety Disorder. It has recently given me some physical symptoms such as tension around the neck and shoulder area, irritability, this uncomfortable sensation under my skin like restlessness or something I want to shake it off all the time and thrown off my sleep schedule. However, I will say it has gotten a lot better compared to the school year (physical symptoms are new; anxiety in general has gotten better). This could be due to my cleanse from smoking for my job. 

Currently stuck: 

So now, I have decided to do something about this obviously. I went to my general doctor for a physical and also explained what has been going on mentally with me. He prescribed me Wellbutrin XL 150Mg. PLEASE comment and review it if you have had experience with this medication. My concern is that this is for depression, not necessarily anxiety however, the doctor said it would help with anxiety depression and help me focus and possibly lose weight. I am also concerned because this was a general doctor not a psychiatrist. I cant afford to go see a psychiatrist I dont know how much medicaid will cover(still looking into this). He made it seem as if he believes I would benefit however, he does not believe the quality will be good and it would be difficult to find someone who will take me in because I have a United HealthCare Community Plan(medicaid). 

Im doing my research before I start this medication however, I dont know if I am actually going to start it--he was a general doctor not a psychiatrist, he was confident but quick. He seems to know what hes doing obviously he got to where he is now however, still makes me uneasy how quick it was. My plan is to get into my routine of work and changing up my lifestyle. Then when my insurance changes to my companies health insurance I will look into talking to someone and then seeing if they think I need medication. 

PLEASE give me all the advice you can! Feel free to share your anxiety symptoms and story. 

Hopefully, some fellow social workers or psychiatrist  and doctors come across this post with some professional advice as well as personal stories!"
bx8ae6,3,2019-06-05,Concrete ways to make the first move at work,Xolbio,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/bx8ae6/concrete_ways_to_make_the_first_move_at_work/,"This is kinda long, I'm kind of half ranting/half explaining so here's a **tl;dr** right off the bat:

It's common advice that to make friends at work (or I guess anywhere for that matter), you should make the first move. But what does that look like? What do you say? How do you do it? 

\----

My social skills are trash, but the hardest thing for me definitely has to be approaching others. I thought getting a job would be great practice...but I never make the first move and it always ends up the same.

My first job was at a fast casual restaurant and boy was that a mistake. I messed up at the job way too much, but aside from that I just couldn't socialize with any of my co-workers. They talked to me like the first day and sometimes after that but I couldn't talk to them. Everyone seemed to like and work well with each other, but I just had no idea how to get involved. Needless to say I got fired from that one (and tbh I agree with the decision because honestly I wasn't very good at it).

When I worked at a grocery store after that, I just ended up becoming the guy that basically talked to no one. I kind of talked with some people but it was mostly work related, and barely about other stuff. There was one guy that talked with me a lot, and it was definitely the days I enjoyed the most because it was fun working with him. But the only reason I talked with him was because he approached me, he was just one of those guys who can talk and get along with anyone. I saw everyone else had clear friendships, but I didn't know how to approach or get involved, so I just never really talked to anyone and stayed by myself. Of course this was a vicious cycle because since I was acting like this, I'm sure everyone thought I didn't want to interact with anyone.

I started an internship after that and I was confident that I would have a fresh start, and not make the same mistakes this time...except I did. Talking with people was rare, and it was only ever work related. I didn't feel part of the team, I just felt like an outsider (I don't blame anyone there, everyone was very nice. It's me just being way too afraid to approach anyone). 

I have an interview at McDonald's in two days and whether I get that job or not, I will get a job somewhere eventually. And when that happens, I really don't want to make the same mistakes again. I'm not that great of a worker, so that'll be a challenge in itself, but I don't want the social aspect to be a challenge too. 

I'm not the best at conversations, but if someone's talking to me, and if they themselves are interested and in a good mood, I don't have much of a problem keeping with it. The problem for me is approaching others and making the first move. I've read a few things online, and even a few posts and comments from this sub. All really helpful, but I always keep reading the same thing. Make the first move. But how? I'm way too afraid. And I get it, you have to get over that fear but what does that even look like? What do you actually say when you approach someone?"

I am currently looking for advice on recruitment for IB. I am a rising junior at a large state university studying accounting with a minor in math looking to add a MIS or finance degree next semester( 3.9+ gpa). I have spent a majority of the past two years recruiting for Big 4 advisory which I have landed 3 offers within for summer 2020. However, I am started to lean more towards a job in investment banking due to interests and exit ops.

Since I am so far behind on the progress. My current plan is to go through the recruitment process for 2020 even though I am not expecting to land any offers but for experience/networking. I am currently planning on doing a one year master as well. Which leads me to a few questions

* Could going through the 2020 recruiting be detrimental to recruiting in the future?
* Would applying to a 2021 internship even though I am graduating but planning on doing a masters be looked down/harmful?

In addition our university has a Investment banking club, however I would not be able to apply until second semester junior year due to a time conflict with another organization I am on the executive board of.

* Would this still be beneficial?

edit: thank you for your time and really appreciate the input you have on this situation."

I was almost done but then the industry crashed and I switched majors to computer science. I started off in a basic java 101 course and I started again. The school I go is a joke, honestly every class was curved to the point where there’s no point in trying. I did my assignments through a computing wizard called google and it didn’t help at all. Fast forward to a few semesters of bullshitting and to my hackathon. I find my team and I sat there and couldn’t do anything, and tried to put some input. One of my team mates says that’s fine your just here to learn you have Input. It’s crazy but our team ended up winning and our prize was an internship and no interview. So fast forward and I’m here at my internship feeling no better than how I felt initially at the hackathon. First week we get to meet everyone, met our managers and by the 2 week we get our projects we start on it and at first I’m learning but my other coworkers who are also interns and blazing through it. I’m trying so hard but idk why I’m struggling with this. My team mates don’t even ask me to do any work which is so disappointing. I just need advice on what to do."

I initially chose computer Engineering because you know Engineering seems pretty cool and I liked physics, but I didn’t know that I needed to sell my soul, and the workload is just a lot.

The workload for computer science seems more manageable for me, just from looking at the scheduled map of what classes I would need to take. I’m really only into computer science because it might give me the opportunity to start my own business someday, I like the idea of building things for a purpose, (building a program or something), it seems like a good job money wise, and it’s a job that is in high demand.

With that being said, I’d have to go through the internship grind, have lots of side projects, and computer science is a competitive field, so it’s not like I’d just get the degree and then just be set (or would I). 

I’d say that I’m above average at math and physics, and I’ve always seemed to come easier to me, so I figured that computer science might be the way to go. Has anybody else kind of experienced this?

Basically what I’m asking is that for those of you who don’t really care about your job and find it unfulfilling, was it worth it in the end, or do you regret your decision?"
bxad2p,2,2019-06-05,How can I do well at my internship (and future internships) despite feeling burned out?,wonderful9235,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bxad2p/how_can_i_do_well_at_my_internship_and_future/,"So.

I am 20 year old college student, and overall, I'd say that my biggest problem is that having summer internships makes me feel like I can never have a break.

I remember last year I started my first summer internship a week after finals ended. I was used to having long summer breaks, but this time, I'd be working a 9-5 job five days a week. Long story short, the job was incredibly stressful for me, and I ended up bringing that stress with me to college.

My sophomore year started, and instead of feeling refreshed and motivated, I started my classes tired and dejected. I was still thinking about whether or not my work at my internship had been valuable at all (it probably wasn't) and I felt wound up and anxious all the time. Still, I plowed through my first semester. I stopped taking care of myself the way I should. I still managed to get decent grades, but I found I was able to fall asleep anywhere, and never felt fully awake.

Second semester started, and that's when things started to go south. I remember wishing I could just press ""pause"" on my life. I could never feel good about any one accomplishment, because there was always another test to take, another way for me to fail at something. I started feeling like my mind was working at .5 speed, and I started getting distracted a lot. I don't know. I just was constantly tired even when I'd gotten 8 hours of sleep, and I felt like I just *couldn't keep up.* I started getting behind on assignments, and I had this general feeling that I *couldn't do it anymore.* I just couldn't. I kept applying to internships and getting rejected or ignored, and my parents would call just to tell me that everyone else was getting jobs, and that I should have started searching earlier, and that my future depended on getting an internship and doing well at it.

Anyway, I got an internship and started the day after my last final. I am not doing so well. It's been two weeks and I am already falling behind. I don't really have an excuse. I just feel tired--mentally, physically, and emotionally. I find myself getting bitter/fed up all the time. Though I should be grateful that I even have a job, working from 9-5 five days a week just sucks the life out of me, and I don't know why because I know that so many people around me are doing the same thing. I get up early (I live far away from my job), show up to work, go to the gym, and by the time I get home I just want to sleep (though I often end up continuing to work). This might be my immaturity kicking in, but having to sit still in a dead-silent office while trying not to screw up all summer is my form of hell, and I know that as soon as it's over I'll be on a plane back to college.

So my question is, how can I feel better about constantly being on the grind, and start doing better work? Everyone else around me is doing the same thing--working hard in college and then doing internships--but for some reason I find myself unable to get with the program. I almost get sick every time I think about the fact that my responsibilities will never stop and I'll always be under pressure.. My productivity is already going down, and I know it's my fault but I keep falling into the same pattern of getting short bursts of motivation followed by periods of distractedness/sleepiness/procrastination. If I'm already crashing and burning now, what will happen at my next internship, and my job after that? I would really appreciate some advice on how I can be more relaxed/productive at work despite never pressing pause, and never feeling like I can have a break. What is the difference between me and every other college student who manages to get good grades, balance summer jobs and still be happy? I know that my days of having long summer breaks to just screw around and relax are over. Any insight on how I can do this internship (and jobs in the future) well without tiring out would be greatly appreciated."

I (age 23) graduated with a bachelor degree in Computer Science in December 2018, with little of 3.0 gpa. At time of graduation I didn't have any internship or industry experience and the only work experience I had was working as a waiter and a Service representative (currently working). I started applying to every entry level software developer/tester/analysis position that is available in my  local area (50mi in radius) through indeed, monster, linkedin, and other job sites. I managed to land multiple interviews, however it doesn't go anywhere, and usually I get dropped in favor of someone with experience or get no response at all. Recently I also discovered that I am starting to forget some the coding languages I learned due to lack of practice.

I really need a job as I have to start paying off my loan, but not sure what I can do to improve my chances of landing one. I am not sure what to do in general. To gain experience in the field I am even willing to work without pay. I have a choice of going back to College and attempting to finish Masters in Computer Science which takes about two years. I can also try to get another bachelor in Mechanical or electrical engineering which will also take two years as I have many of the of the core classes finished due to my original Major being Electrical Engineering (only switched because I liked coding more). I also have the choice of joining a company called Revature which trains individuals for 10 weeks and sets them up with job but this results in me being Contracted out for 2 years at a random company at a random state, with below industry wage. 

I have parents that are about to turn 60 with their retirement plan being me. They have very little income, but are willing to assist in whatever decision I make. 

Please help, any and all advice is appreciated, and thank you.

TLDR: Bachelor degree in Computer Science with job not anywhere close to related. Can't get job in related field due to lack of industry experience. Have a choice of going back to college for masters or another bachelor. Have college loan and have to take care of parents.

Update:
Thank you to everyone that responded. I live in Detroit area and there are lots of available jobs so was worried when I wasn't able to land one in about 6-7 months. And major companies like GM, Ford, Chrysler and DTE gave me the chance for an interview but always declined. Even on their rotational programs. Anyway, I gave a one last attempt at applying for job and if I didnt manage to get a job I would have gotten CompTIA certificate and become a technician or go into networking or system administrator as suggested.

I came here to America before the start of my junior year. My previous country is Egypt. I had very good grades in Egypt ~ 3.87 GPA right now and this semester it’s going to increase to 3.9 probably. I took the March SAT and got 1340 which is above average for UW, and took the June SAT and expecting a score between 1400-1440. 
My problem is that I didn’t take many challenging classes my junior year. Since it was my first year, I was prudent in terms of course selection to allow myself to adapt to the system. The two hardest courses are Pre Calc and AP Bio. Bext year I am taking 4 or 5 AP classes. 
Does my course selcetion in my junior year lower my chances of being selected. Also bear in mind that I don’t have many extracurriculars as many people have, because in egypt it’s not required to have many extracurriculars ( however, I did 3 or 4 things in Egypt and I got an internship this summer too in America ) I will be applying to biology major.

I decided to apply to at least 20 CS related positions each day and have continued to do so for the last 3 weeks, however in contrast to the results I got in the Fall and Spring I'm suddenly being rejected from everything. It's gotten to the point I genuinely fear for losing a place to live and I only really have enough money to live off ramen noodles. I finally made the 40 minute drive to the nearest restaurant which was a Starbucks, got really excited for an opening to hopefully buy myself more time to apply and got told that I didn't really have the qualifications to be a barista... which is weird because I had a sales position for 2 Summers before and always got good marks and in general I'm a good public speaker, presenter, and am in general good at talking to people/customers. So I wanted to talk a little about what I've done CS-wise, and ask what I should do to try and get a job at a large company out of college (in particular Apple and Waymo are the places I'm most interested in working at). With the background out of the way here's my qualifications/experience though I am going to anonymize it because I like to keep my info private:

**Academic Work:**

3.50 GPA at a prestigious Institute in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering one last year... but my required courses are done

High Marks in Algorithms and Application Courses in especially in robotics, web development, and debugging and quality assurance.

Took graduate courses in robotics and got high marks applied several cutting edge robotics algorithms in ROS the Robotic Operating System

Helped Develop a backend website for a League of Legends project on campus using C++ and eventually switched to Django.

Used a very basic quantum computer to do simulations.

Took a course in utilizing GPU's for parallel computing using CUDA.

Earned very high marks in a lab based course using scientific/numerical computing.

Successfully developed a working prototype of a novel device for preventing ice build up on drive ways in a capstone course where I worked as a mechanical and chemical engineer... I know it's not CS related but I did it because I had to and because I spent several years in high school taking design courses and have taken most undergrad physics and chemistry courses and am in general mechanically inclined. Also I did enjoy the experience of working on a team and bringing a product to fruition.

**Projects and Extracurricular Activites:**

Worked on a robotics team for 2 years and made it to the head of scientific instrumentation.

Worked on numerous IoT devices with roomates and friends using various microcontrollers and did so myself for some 3 or 4 years before while I was in High School.

Was the programmer and captain of an FRC team for 4 years (Captain only for 2), and made it to the world level multiple times.

Used Simulink to develop control systems on the Arduino creating a functioning smart car and a segway.

Used a C8051 microcontroller to create a smart car capable of performing gradient descent and a flying gondola from path to path with PID pose to pose navigation.

**Work Experience:**

Worked as a Materials testing technician for a materials testing firm and developed algorithms using ML methods as well as statistical methods for optimizing outputted concrete by strength and price of the material by selecting inputs.

Had a sales position selling the materials outputted from that same position.

Did Front End web development for a few small local companies on a freelance basis.

**Technical Skills and Misc:**

I'll just say most CAD programs I don't want to list them all, on my resume I generally choose to list the ones that are most relevant, but literally all of the Autodesk products, Solidworks, Creo, Mathcad, NX Siemens

My github has project stuff but honestly it pretty much just reflects my projects nothing super interesting there outside of those.

PHP, Django, Javascript, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js, Ruby, very minor experience with Kubernetes.

Python, Java, C and C++, Java for Android Development/Android Studios, a little bit of Haskell and Lisp.

I can use Allen Bradley PLC's as well as other common PLC's of a similar nature.

I know ROS fairly well, but I do have vast periods where I go without using it so I tend to forget a lot.

I have a strong background using Linux and I have a working knowledge on all Windows systems 98 and onward. Actually my one weakness here is Apple products I have rarely used them although I do like them.

A very large quantity of SPICE tools both for analog and digital applications and a lot of experience with circuit theory.

A very strong background in physics, chemistry.

I also have at least basic competency in algorithm design, UI/UX design, Industrial/Product Design, Computer Architecture and Hardware Design, Electronics Engineering, Control Sytems of the mechanical, electrical, and software varieties. (In descending order of experience).

I dunno if this counts but I have general leadership ability in that I tend to float to the top of most organizations that I'm in and many years of robotics and other clubs and capstone have made a pretty effective project manager. I also have pretty strong communication skills I like to think.

**Conclusion:**

What is above is essentially what's on my resume except the academic stuff which is just a note about which degree I'm in the process of earning, and obviously my resume is less verbose and leaves out the minor details. My resume seemed to be doing well inn Fall and Spring I was getting interview left and right, but now I'm just whiffing I'm not even landing interviews anymore. If it weren't for my foolish choice of putting all my eggs in one basket with the aforementioned large company I might've gotten any number of other positions I was offered but when I asked they had already been filled. Can anyone give me any advice on what to change or add, or maybe a new place to look for a job.

I'm worried that Apple and Waymo are just going to pass on me if they see I don't have an internship this last Summer before I apply for their real jobs. Does anybody have any similar experience or have any idea how this might affect my career in the future?

bxea8p,0,2019-06-06,Can a Vocational Program be considered an Associates Degree?,kibblerz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bxea8p/can_a_vocational_program_be_considered_an/," 

So about 3 years ago I graduated from a vocational school where I went for 2 years for software engineering and web development. During a year while attending I was an intern(that was the title anyways,, yet me and my classmate led the entire development of the website. Our boss wasn't a developer). Thing is all the jobs want a degree and for the past 3 years I've gone through spurts of applying and getting turned down for jobs, without even an interview.

I was wondering if maybe I should tweak my resume, since at this vocational school I spent 2 1/2 hours a day developing and my internship was far closer to a full stack role than an internship. I was optimizing php code and redesigned the interface for the website.

So in order to increase my chances, would it be reasonable to list my vocational school experience as if it were an associates degree? And also would it be too big a stretch to change the title on my resume from intern to a full stack developer? I feel like the title Intern really undermines what I was actually doing for the company and that recruiters quickly dismiss my education because it has the label of vocational school. I'm currently working in a SOC and am losing motivation in my job search completely because I can't even get an interview... I don't want interviewers to think I'm lying about my experience, but I also feel I'm being quickly dismissed in my applications because of these terms."

I’m very drained from exam stress and feel I may be happier if I get into industry jobs once I get my BSc but I don’t know if I can go far with it. 

I think my overall dream is to work in a famous AI company like IBM Watson, Google AI or Apple or something. I also have an interest in game design companies like Blizzard. Am I ever going to get those kinds of jobs without a grad degree? I also want to make a good salary (ideally over 200 grand a year one day). 

For context, by the time I’ll graduate I’ll have done an internship with a research group from my University doing work in coding and I’m currently doing an internship at Harvard that requires skills in Machine Learning. 

I do have an appreciation for being an expert in a field and understanding theory behind things, allow I don’t think I’d necessarily need a Masters to learn it. 


If I want to one day work in those kinds of jobs or just generally respectably paying ML or AI jobs (I understand entry level pay will be lower with a bachelors, but I’m hoping it’d be possible to increase my pay in time and not have their be a blanket salary ceiling without a masters), will I need a graduate degree?"

While I am a Christian, I ultimately chose the school solely on the fact that it was 5 minutes from my house. Fast forward 2 semesters later and I've adjusted to school life and completed a couple of CS classes. I'm extremely unimpressed with the CS department at my school. They offer connections for only 2 internships, they have no tutoring for CS classes at all, the professors seem uninterested and don't take the work seriously, and last years graduating class was 10 people. Those are just a few problems I have but it led me to apply to another school that is 30 minutes away. 

To my surprise, I was accepted. The new school appears to have good internship connections, a larger student body so that I have peers to help and get help from and most importantly it has an actual CS department with classes that aren't a joke. 

Ultimately, my question is for people that might have been in a similar situation. Is transferring because of these concerns worth the trouble of moving my family closer, transferring credits from 4 previous schools and possibly losing a semester of progress?

If any additional information would help with giving feedback please let me know."

I’ve decided that UTM would be best for me based on the program reputation and the internship UofT offers, but POSt scares me a little bit and I’m also fearing debt due to my financial situation.

Queens would probably be between $15,000-$30,000 cheaper than UTM, and I could probably make it without taking a bank loan, however, if I go to UTM I may end up needing to take a bank loan, which scares me. I don’t really want to deal with bank debt... I’d like some advice. Do you think it’s worth going into more debt to go to UofT?

I have until tonight to make a decision."
bxhych,1,2019-06-06,4 weeks into internship and I still have nearly no assignments,Benjangles528,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bxhych/4_weeks_into_internship_and_i_still_have_nearly/,"So a few months back I received an internship at an insurance firm. I was incredibly stoked and excited. My majors are finance and risk management so it would be right along the lines of what I wanted to do after college. I was told I would be an underwriter (the position I applied for) and all was well...

Until the first day I showed up for the internship. I was placed into the underwriting training as was expected only to be pulled out about 10 minutes into and placed in IT. Full disclosure I know very little about computers (and even told my supervisor that). And ultimately agreed to do what they needed in IT with a smile on my face. 

Well now fast forward 4 weeks and I very rarely have any assignments to work on. Most of the time I sit for hours at a time with little or nothing to do. 

I hate that. I want to be productive and despise the idea of being the intern who just sits in a corner and looks lazy. I’ve asked people around me and my supervisor if there’s any jobs or more long term tasks to take on, and I’m almost always met with “I can’t think of anything”. 

My supervisor about a week ago even asked what it was I was wanting to do here exactly. When I told him he said he was going to talk to the other departments and see if he could find somewhere for me to go. Well, I talked with him again a day ago and asked if he had asked anyone and he replied with yes, but now come to find out the department he asked is already full and doesn’t want anyone else.

I’m getting very frustrated and losing motivation. I want to enjoy my internship, but it’s not the position I applied for and accepted, every time I ask for more work I feel like I get shot down, and I’m not learning anything related to my majors.

At this point I don’t know what to do. I’m normally very motivated and optimistic by now I’m wishing this would just end. Any advice on how I can salvage this or try to find ways to get more assignments and work?"

I am pretty comfortable with Linux CLI. Been using Linux distors as a desktop for 5years, as a daily driver, for learning simple C kernel development (compiling GCC following specific requirements, qemu), later web dev (PHP, Laravel, npm, mariadb). I can configure systems as Arch. I feel comfortable working with documentation. I recently graduated IBM 3 months Cloud DevOps course. It covered Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Grafana, Ansible, Jenkins. It was pretty basic, but gave me overview of these technologies. I know basics of AWS, don't feel comfy working with it, but get the idea. I am following IT security for 3/2 years (not sure), pretty interested it that, I think, I am quite up to date with vulnerabilities in various tools, apps, systems, devices (don't remember them specifically, but I am aware of dangers).

I am currently putting the most effort into learning Laravel, but I feel better with ""admin"" work yet, so I thing it's better way to catch my train. I also keep in mind that there is a trend for bootcamps and similar ""easy ways to earn $100k a year"".

Yeah, I know, that there are probably hundreds of ppl in similar situation 😉

So, is there a chance that some companies will find me useful?"

I want to step back into the game and work towards that $8000/mo internship at a big company. I really want to. But now I'm just comfortable. I'm finding comfort and happiness and positivity in the small things and keeping myself satisfied with it. I'm liking taking it slow in life. I go to a top 5 school and don't know anybody other than my one friend in computer science. I don't have a big circle. And it does feel pretty great cuz there's no pressure to be a certain type of a person. When you know so many people you are constantly rushing to be one of the better ones. I don't know if I will ever have the personality of a big achiever anymore. The environment at my school just doesn't allow it cuz it's huge and I haven't tried being involved in anything because I just find it hard to come to terms with the idea of doing such a tough course while also being involved in the big school events. Something tells me I can't do it. 

I have anxiety about being stuck in a 9 to 5 job I will hate that doesn't even pay enough. I have a good background but it would really suck to not be able to be financially independent out of college. I don't know what to do. I guess this is what makes life hard. Wanting some things but also being comfortable with what you already have and all of the curiosity that comes with not having that something else. It's really hard. I just want to use my mind to answer all of the important questions so I have a formula for happiness. I think I'm going to make it my hobby to pen down my thoughts so I can consolidate my thoughts and logically figure out what it is that I want, what's stopping me from getting it, what it would feel like to have it and other similar questions. And from all of the thinking I have done so far, I think it will start with finding people who have interned and worked at these big companies who know what it's like to work for them. Cuz the bottom line for me is will it be something I would like to do at this point. But I'm also just really confused by everything right now."

I decided that the combination of getting my degree about 6 months sooner and the lack of necessary classes offered online by my institution for relevant minors made declaring Psychology my minor a good choice. But, I'm curious, while I still have time to possibly change minors and/or majors, will this combination hamper my ability to get an internship (which I will be seeking after I move soon) and a job when I complete my degree? I know that I very much have enjoyed learning programming. I have tons of motivation to teach myself. I was never a reader in life before. The only book I ever finished was The Hobbit.

We only finally got to meet in person on Monday, and it was pretty short. We texted after that, but I haven't heard anything from her since.

I've had my resume reviewed four times, I attend a top 20 school, have a high GPA, know a decent variety of programming languages, participated in hackathons and worked on personal projects in my free time, but I keep getting rejected for internships. It's just very bizarre to me, and I'm not understanding why this keeps happening. It's getting frustrating too because I have applied to over 70+ positions and have not gotten a single interview with a company (not even a coding assessment). I work very hard in my free time. I have essentially given up any type of enjoyment in life to focus on CS because that's what I'm passionate about, but obviously companies cannot see the all the work I've done. They can only see what's on my resume.

I'm essentially trying to make sense of my situation right now. I have applied for internships throughout the school year, and aggressively applied during May to make a final push. Most of the available internship positions I applied for in May are out of state. Is it possible that those companies rejected me because I live out of state and have no faith that I can relocate in time for the internship? Also, I have my street address listed on my resume, and I've heard that there are some companies reject out of state applicants because of this. Is this true?

Additionally, I'm an east Asian male. Is it possible that companies are rejecting me because I'm not a minority and perhaps not as exceptional as other east Asian male candidates? I also don't have an ""American"" name, so is it possible that companies will throw my resume aside because they assume that I'll need a H1B1 sponsorship? I've heard some people put ""US Citizen"" at the top of the resume to avoid this, but I'm not sure if this will help me.

If it's neither of those, then there must be something fundamentally wrong with my resume. In that case, I'll have to get it reviewed again for a fifth time, and I'll probably have to spend the rest of the summer working on programming project(s). At the same time I really don't want to just work on another app that I know wont be passionate about making since I'm most likely am going to go down the data science path instead of SWE. The reason why I'm applying for SWE internships is because data science internships are usually reserved for masters/PhD students, so I don't really have a choice here and I really need the money."

I want to know if there are any strategies I can employ to teach myself how to read and comprehend papers better. The numerous new concepts walls of text seem to make it impossible for me to get anything out of reading, short of spending an entire day trying to comprehend it.

We're learning so much new info like Java spring boot, cloud foundry, rabbit, etc, and my bosses are making it out to be that we really need to be studying even more after training on our own for our next interview further in the company. Ik Imposter syndrome is a real thing and I try to ignore it but I'm pretty clearly the least experienced one here. I'm still keeping up it's not as though I'm anywhere near useless but idk if I'll be able to do well on the next interview and this certification test were supposed to take.

On one hand maybe I should feel more confident because I got the same job as them with way less experience and I'm making good money but I feel like I don't deserve it lol. Idk what I did to get here I just had internships cause my uncle hired me for 2 summers. 

Some guys came in and asked for an impromptu demo and I did not volunteer cause spring boot is really new to me. This guy who worked at a startup took up the task and they were so impressed he might not even have to interview again lol. I get that ofc he has more experience than me so obviously he's more comfortable, but I'm just scared because everything we're learning is completely new to me and I'm burnt out after work I don't want to study at home much more.

Ik I must deserve the job, I got it, but I don't know how. Everything is totally new to me so doing an interview with these technologies sounds pretty terrifying. I'm a good programmer but I just don't know all these frameworks and such and I don't think I'm ready to do an interview and look confident. I try to ignore Imposter syndrome because it's not really a healthy mentality but as I said I am definitely the least experienced one here and I don't want to bomb the interview. Guess I just have to study more at home and be stressed for a month or 2 until things settle down.

Now that I wrote the post idk why I'm posting it to this sub I don't have a programming question really, more just advice on how to fell less scares and to feel like I actually deserve this. My friend from Cornell applied here and she didn't get the job, I have no clue how I ended up with this job and I'm just really stressed"

Hence, my software experience clearly doesn't match up with many/most of the other applicants to the university (like cs students). Is this a big problem? It's not like I haven't taken steps to program more, so how would you guys suggest I bridge this gap? Would the fact that I haven't done intense software be a red flag for admissions into cs/programming-intensive robotics Master's in research or non-thesis based programs? Or would they accept this lack of specific technical expertise for my high grades/GRE + I'm not completely clueless in programming?

bxp73w,26,2019-06-06,"In joint lease, roommate stopped paying rent and left the USA, - IL",CriticalDurian,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bxp73w/in_joint_lease_roommate_stopped_paying_rent_and/,"Hello,

One of my roommates stopped paying his portion of the rent starting with May and is unwilling to pay through the rest of the lease through July. After talking to my landlord, they are sympathetic in the short term and have let us delay in paying that rent for now, but eventually they will put their foot down. Any attempts by the leasing company/landlords to contact my roommate have been unsuccessful. The amount he has elected to not pay is around $2200, so this is a battle I believe will be on my own right now. 

Some important notes are that he is a born and raised citizen in Spain and was doing a foreign exchange for a year at a public university, which I also attend. I actually am a sublessee in the apartment. He left back for his home country during the first week of May, around the same time we learned he did not pay rent. He opened a bank account in the states that he fed money into for rent and other expenses while he was on campus. 

The specific wording used which makes me believe I am liable for my roommate's rent is 

&gt;The SUBLESSEE, upon execution of this  
&gt;  
&gt;SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, is equally responsible for the full amount due under the terms of  
&gt;  
&gt;said RENTAL AGREEMENT, during the period of this SUBLEASE AGREEMENT.

and also

&gt;In consideration of LESSOR leasing the LEASED PREMISES to LESSEE and nothwitstanding other amounts which may become due as described herein, LESSEE agrees to pay rent to LESSOR the total sum of $\[total rent amount\]... (goes on to detail rent schedule)

Additionally, the contract also states

&gt;LESSEE acknowledges the LESSOR is not liable for any claims, damages or actions of any nature relating to, arising from, or connected with disputes between roommates. 

This leads me to believe I will not receive any help further from my landlord besides what I mentioned above. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the info I know:

* I am able to make contact with him on facebook, so I am screenshotting all of our conversations there for when the situation arises. All of our conversation has been about the rent situation.
* I found his (possibly) home address in Spain and through [Spain's public registry](https://www.registrodirecto.es/registro-de-la-propiedad/nota-simple/) I believe I may be able to acquire details on who lives there and maybe contact them. I can understand and read Spanish, but my speaking ability is poor.
* His current employer (internship) is an extremely large US based tech company, with an office in Spain. I am exploring options on if attempting to contact someone from there would affect anything, or even if it is worth it.
* He has what I believe to be an unpaid bill in collections (possibly medical, he was admitted to the hospital in the states). The mail was sent to the apartment, I have not opened it, however I have also not looked for it. 
   * He left his initial medical expense in the apartment and I have that and a number I could call to see if he paid what I believe to be the same bill potentially.
* My other roommates and I have contacted the office of conflict resolution through my university and they stated they would contact the dean of the college my international roommate was in. However, they have been unresponsive upon further communication. It has been over 3 weeks since the initial meeting. 
   * If my international roommate did not pay a certain fee, then I have access to the University's legal resources pro bono, if not then only consultation. But knowing that depends on the person from the conflict resolution office getting back to me.

&amp;#x200B;

With this information at my disposal, I have a few questions about my situation, which seems really complex to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I truly liable to pay his portion of the rent? If I do not, would my landlords be able to pin it on my credit? Is there a way I could convince his employer's HR to hear my case and pressure him to pay rent? Is there a way to pressure him legally into paying rent? 

Worst case scenario is I have to pay his portion of the rent, which I have been trying to prepare for financially. Thank you in advance for any help"

bxpg6l,736,2019-06-06,TIFU by telling an intern that I'm disappointed in her 4 hours into her first day,epi_glowworm,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bxpg6l/tifu_by_telling_an_intern_that_im_disappointed_in/,"I work in nuclear power and one of my role is to oversee worker's occupational radiation exposure. Since it's a federal requirement, it's part of our normal in-boarding process for all new workers and rather routine.

&amp;#x200B;

This week, I find out that our new interns are arriving. Since I'm generally excited to see the doe-eyed, eager young minds coming to work at the red-headed stepchild of power production, I was planning on making the workplace seem 'normal' when they arrive. You know with bantering, the small talk, and what not to make them feel at ease and show them that we're Rad.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm doing other work, just before lunch, the staff nuclear engineer comes in with their intern. I greet them in my normal fashion, asking for badge information and such. Since I know the staff engineer well, I'm making small talk to show that we're humans too and not just rigid professionals. I ask the intern where she goes to school, find out her school is in the same sports conference as mine but a lesser college, so I egg on her about that. She's hitting the ball back into my court and all seems normal and smooth. By this point, I'm feeling smug that we're giving the good impression.

&amp;#x200B;

And on the paperwork all she has left is to sign and date it. I'm talking to the senior engineer and wasn't thinking too much at this point, kinda on autopilot conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Intern: ""Is June six?""

Dumbass me, overtly animated: ""Dude! You're a nuclear engineer! You should know that by now.""

And my dumbass reflexes turned to the staff engineer and said ""Dude, I'm so disappointed in your intern man"" with a smug smile thinking I was being funny.

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't say a word after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day, I ran into the other staff nuclear engineer and was gonna egg him about what I thought was a funny remark. Thankfully they all have a sense of humor, and he said, ""Haha, what if she was asking if it's June sixth?"" And all the little gears start to click in my head and I haven't felt that embarrassed and like a dick in a while. And as the staff senior hears the gears click, starts laughing.

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling bad, and knowing I'd run into their group the next day, I figured I'll let her know that I misunderstood and was a dumbass and apologize for it. But I found out that she called in sick. And having gone through a serious rough patch myself, I'm wondering if I hit the wrong chord and probably fucked it up real bad. Or maybe it was coincidence. Worst thing is that I don't have the balls to actually reach out to her to apologize for the smartass remark and actually find out how she actually took in the remark. I'm hoping she took it as banter. Right now, I'm gonna wait it out until I run into her and apologize then.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Tried to make interns feel at ease with what I thought was funny banter and my bad hearing probably caused me to make her feel bad 4 hours into her internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: First off, sorry for the delay in the update. The company treated the interns to a dinner and all of us stayed out longer than I thought I would...

&amp;#x200B;

So, the first thing in the morning, I did go look for her and did let her know that I'm sorry about what happened. I let her know that what I intended and that after a while, I realized that I could actually have stepped over the line and may have been a dick (didn't say that, but used professional words). I told her that I thought I heard what I heard and acted the way I did, but others have told me that she may have said it differently and that I probably did misheard it.

&amp;#x200B;

She laughed it off and told me that she knew that I was joking and meant nothing by it and wasn't offended by it. And since I had a meeting to go to, went about our merry ways.

&amp;#x200B;

So, thankfully, it was taken the way I hoped it was. And now I have learned some lessons for sure...Finally at peace knowing that I wasn't a complete dick.

&amp;#x200B;

And thanks for the feedback everyone, I genuinely appreciate it! You guys are weird, but at least you guys are reddit weird.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit #2: The dinner was interns and their associated managers. And more like dinner/networking."

I'm 25 and I've decided I'm going to start by BSc in Computer Science in 9 months' time. After completing a completely different yet entirely useless bachelor's a couple of years ago, I've just been working my min wage job around 25 hours a week and saving money. 

I am almost finished an online Intro to Computer Science course and am loving it (cs50x). We spent a few weeks on C, a couple on python, and the rest on webdev (html, css, flask, and a bit of JS). That's what's put me on this track. 


Question: what do you think is the best use of my time in these 9 months? Could I perhaps develop a skill that would help me get a job during uni or help me start to build out my GitHub for when I apply for internships? (My degree includes industry based learning opportunities, at a quantity lower than the number of students in the course, so it's competitive. I really want to nab one when given the chance.) I've enjoyed the webdev side of things but I think I enjoy the back-end stuff a bit more as well as general software development, but haven't had much exposure to either. I haven't had any experience with mobile app development. 

Some of the things I've been looking at:

*  [This recently-released web development course offered by a Finnish University](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), which seems to be using quite up to date languages

* [Cs50's web programming track](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript)

* [Cs50's mobile app development with react native track](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-with-react-native)

* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for full stack webdev.

Any ideas?

I've also been thinking about taking some linear algebra or some foundational cs courses like nand2tetris, but that seems better left for uni. I want to see if I can develop a real practical skill before I start my study. 

Realistically I think I could complete 2 or 3 courses within the 9 months and have some personal projects as a result.

I really appreciate anyone providing me with their viewpoints, which will hopefully get me thinking about what is in my own best interests to pursue.

**TL;DR** : Just finished CS50x, starting uni in 9 months. What can I do between now and then to develop a skill that will make me employable in the field during uni and allow me to start to build up my GitHub for future job applications?"

I just saw a posting about an SWE Co-op at a tech- e-commerce company that mentioned full stack training about front-end tech (HTML, CSS. LESS, JS, MySQL). 

Co-op positions usually take 2 rotations (2 working semesters) commitment, possibly a full year of working in total if including summer.

Glassdoor reports the company size is 1-50 and the pay range is $17-22/hr but not really sure until I get the offer.

**Background:**

I am interning at my **first** internship right now this summer and plan to go back to school this fall. 

I have 3 full semesters left to graduate (BS) so I will graduate at the end of 2020. So I only have one summer to find another internship.

I don't really interest in or have any knowledge about the front-end dev at the moment but I am willing to learn (I know I can) if it gives me the experience about SDLC.

I live by myself by I think I can handle my finance until graduation.

Location: Raleigh

**So here is the summary:**

1. Graduating at the end of 2020 with one chance to get an internship next summer (Class FA19 | Class SP20 | Intern SU20 | Class FA20)
2. Delay my graduation \~1 year for a co-op position in front-end and lose \~$7.5k of FA (Grants and scholarships + Co-op fee)/semmester and still have a chance to get an internship with this schedule (Co-op FA19 | Class SP20 | Co-op SU20 | Co-op FA20 | Class SP21 | Intern SU21 | Class FA21)"

PS: I wasn't sure if this is important, but for the USC Internship, I have done 2 years, but I dont have much to show in terms of projects, just confirmation from the head of the chemistry department. The Intership only has 3 highschool students who just help out, but the work seems to be pretty important, the head of the project worked with a team to win a nobel prize in Carbocations via superacids, and the project right now is replacing normal fuel like gasoline with ethanol.  The head of the chemistry department said that I would be able to publish a research paper by the end of the summer. Would mentioning or going into detail about this in my transcript be beneficial?

Im really looking to apply to UCLA, UCI, UCD, UCSD, and USC, but due to my low GPA, Im really scared that Ill get rejected from every school

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, like which schools would be safeties, reaches, or matches, and if there are any colleges that would fit my stats and are good for my major choices

Edit: Are there anything I can do to raise my chances"

As you know Term 1 was the first session of our new UNSW3+ calendar. It was the culmination of two years of intensive transition activity, including the re-configuration of the curriculum.

The UNSW3+ calendar is designed to increase flexibility, which is particularly important for students who work part time to support their studies, and across a degree it also increases opportunities for extra curricula activities and internships.

Your study load can now be spread over more of the year - a normal study load remains eight courses but this is now spread out across 30 teaching-weeks, instead of 24. You also have the option of easing back to just two courses in a term or six over the year and [remaining eligible for full-time status](http://elink.clickdimensions.com/c/4/?T=ODYxMzM2MzE%3AMDItYjE5MTU4LWE1YWIxODE3MzUzMjQ5Zjc5NTZmM2JiNmM2Y2QxYmRj%3AZC5jaGhlZGFAc3R1ZGVudC51bnN3LmVkdS5hdQ%3AY29udGFjdC0zZTk3YWQ1ZWVjYTFlODExODEzODcwMTA2ZmE4YTI0MS03YTA0MWE2MDZiMjU0M2QxYjFhOTMzZWIyMGU1NGYwMA%3AZmFsc2U%3AMQ%3A%3AaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnVsbHRpbWUuc3R1ZGVudDNwbHVzLnVuc3cuZWR1LmF1LyMvP19jbGRlZT1aQzVqYUdobFpHRkFjM1IxWkdWdWRDNTFibk4zTG1Wa2RTNWhkUSUzZCUzZCZyZWNpcGllbnRpZD1jb250YWN0LTNlOTdhZDVlZWNhMWU4MTE4MTM4NzAxMDZmYThhMjQxLTdhMDQxYTYwNmIyNTQzZDFiMWE5MzNlYjIwZTU0ZjAwJmVzaWQ9ZDA3NjM1YTEtZGY4OC1lOTExLWE4NTUtMDAwZDNhZTAyMTgz&amp;K=fvEWvaeBtUeaOygyNfFOeA). The spreading of the load also provides new work opportunities for staff and reduces pressures on the campus.

The data from Term 1 confirm there were 29% fewer course clashes, 25% fewer final exams, and around 20% fewer scheduled contact hours for students, providing more flexibility. Various teaching rooms were freed up and this allowed us to schedule fewer evening or early morning classes, despite there being 12% more courses available in 2019 than in 2018. More students in most Faculties were provided final marks sooner than in previous years.

We also continue to learn from our experiences. I acknowledge that many people in our university have found the transition to the new calendar stressful. The new calendar reduces the session from 12 to 10 weeks, and the total student holidays over the year now stand at 13 weeks. Some students have said to me some courses feel rushed and that the curriculum refresh may have had the unexpected effect of allowing more material and assessments, including additional digital support resources, to be added. I am meeting with Faculties, Schools and student leaders and we will continue to collect data and reflect on the configuration of courses with the aim of delivering the best learning experience possible.

UNSW is working hard to provide additional opportunities for our students and staff. We are very proud of how innovative the UNSW3+ calendar is. Although I must confess that several people have reminded me that both the AGSM and the Medicine Faculty already operated on a three-term system. UNSW actually used a three-term calendar at its inception and many leading universities around the world have a trimester system.

Please continue to provide me, and your faculties, with specific feedback, which can be emailed to [strategy2025@unsw.edu.au](mailto:strategy2025@unsw.edu.au). I wish you all the best with your studies in Term 2."

My plan is to take some CS courses at my local community college which can help me work towards a bachelors at my local university. It also gives me the option of taking data structures and algorithms at the university, which requires prereqs that can be done at the community college. To sum it up I’d probably get at least two intro to programming classes, a couple of sophomore level courses, and data structures and algorithms. 

While I do this, I’m going to try to see if I can land an internship at a local software company and if I can eventually get a full time position without a bachelors.  I have a masters in biomedical informatics, but it was somewhat useless. Very little focus on computational work. However, I’m wondering if that will get my foot in the door in some places, especially after I have better foundational knowledge from my classes and self-studying. If that goes according to plan, instead of finishing my bachelors, I would prefer doing the OMSCS. It might take me longer overall, but I’d have the option of working full time while finishing a fairly cheap education. 

Now here’s where things get a bit complicated. If I don’t get a job, should I either focus full time on completing my bachelors or working towards finishing OMSCS (assuming I get accepted)? Based on using data structures and algorithms as the supposed cut off for my university program, I would probably spend roughly 1.5-2 years vs whatever amount of time I’d spend with OMSCS."

Since I can work remotely, I intend to work around 3.5 hours per day while I am away so I can continue to earn money and contribute if I take off for the week and still maintain the amount of hours I work per week.

I have read that ideally one should wait a few months before going on vacation, so I don't know if it would look bad to ask for time off since I started this new role within the month despite me interning in the months before.

I got an offer to intern at a recognizable company (not one of the biggest names but still famous) as a software developer which I’m interested in but not sure if I want to do it for my whole life (making me doubt the usefulness of this experience).

Besides the big company, I have also received an offer from the public health department to do device development, which I have been doing as a hobby and previous internship at my university.

Now, I understand that the general rule is to go to the big companies for work experiences, but I do love the hardware part of designing in conjunction with software. Doing both parts kinda gives me a break when I am tired of one of them.

So, the question is: will the experience at a recognizable company be more useful, and there just aren’t many hardware + software job out there (as I do still want to make a living), or just do what I want to do?

I understand it will be my responsibility to make the eventual decision, but if anyone has insight into this, please do share!

Some additional background:

**What I like:**

A bit of everything, especially learning new stuff and solving problems

-&gt; Software: data analyzing, modelling, simulation, web app

-&gt; Hardware: power, electronics, circuits, easy-optics

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my situation. I'm a computer science student at U of T, currently 21, and turning 22 in a few weeks. I'm making around 190k a year right now doing bottle service in a high volume, high end club in Toronto working Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. I used to work at this place taking and running drink orders, but didn't get promoted to the bottle service tier until I lost some weight and managed to beat my acne into submission. I'm making about $20 an hour from the club, plus about $1200 a night in tips (on average), which I fully intend to declare on my taxes.

There's about 15 other girls who do bottle service at my club, but none are over the age of 24, so my time making this level of income has a clock on it.

I've maxed out my TFSA and RRSP, currently 100% invested in XGRO. I've opened a Wealthsimple Trade account for my additional funds that don't fit in either of these tax shelters, which is also 100% invested in XGRO. I have $30k in a high interest savings account for my emergency fund.

I'm focusing on machine learning and AI in my CS degree, and will be graduating next year. I've had two internship placements, one in machine learning and one in a Python-focused software shop, and based on my experience there I think I will have a job lined up by the time I graduate making approximately $95k. I intend to do this job plus the bottle service job until I 'age out', so to speak, so my income will be around $300k for two years before dropping to $95k.

My question is - is there anything I should be doing differently? Is there anything I can do to better prepare myself for the 60%ish drop in income that's coming soon?

bxxrxp,4,2019-06-07,Question about personal projects,The_Pulsar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bxxrxp/question_about_personal_projects/,"Hi all,

My question is, what kind of projects are employers really looking for on your resume/github? Like, super complex ones? Or just even small projects that you make for fun, to learn fundamentals, to try some new framework or language, etc.? I mean, probably include some example uses data structures in there is a given, but what about others?

For example, what if you're better at the back-end side of a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application written in C# than you are on the front-end XAML UI design side? For instance, many of my UWP projects have a fairly decent back-end written, but the UI isn't always the best, maybe not ""modern"" as they call it? Mostly because I'm not huge on designing front-ends, but I'm still learning for experience sake. Would they penalize you for not being the best at XAML, even though you show decent c# skills?

Another example, what about simple projects for a small task? There were approx. 290 videos I downloaded from MS Build 2019 that I listen to on my way to and from work, but the folders and files in them were all named by the session code, i.e., ""BH2002"" something like that. But there was a .txt file with a few lines of information and one line was ""Title: Azure Functions"" for example; so, I wrote a python script to read each folder in a given directory, read the .txt file in it, strip the title from that line in the file, rename the files in the folder, then rename the folder, and then move on to the next session folder. I really didn't feel like manually going through the folder, opening the .txt file, copying the title, manually renaming the files in each folder, renaming the folder, and then repeating that for the other 289 session folders. Not super complex, small, BUT it still did something!

I started off at a community college for computer science and graduated, taking a decent amount of useful courses such as C# Desktop Apps (Win forms, but I have experience in UWP too), Beginning Game Programming (using the professors engine, his updated C++ UWP engine coming soon for those interested!), Android Programming back in 2015 with Android Studio, Comp Sci 1 &amp; 2 had C++ as its primary language, Discrete Structures I with a few programming projects in c++, 68k assembly language of course too but definitely don't plan to do much with that, Visual Basic, and a couple non-programming related computer courses.

I then transferred to a 4 year university starting my Bachelor of Science in CS with a concurrent degree in math (because I love/hate math). Comp. Sci. course wise I've taken Discrete Structures II (Finite Automata, Pushdown Automata, Regular Expressions, Context Free Grammar, more more more theory), Intro to Python, Data Structures &amp; Algorithm Analysis (that was a fun one 😄) and in the Fall I'll be taking Software Eng. 1, Algorithm Analysis and Design (further continuation of data structures course), Intro to AI, plus my physics and math.

I am very big on self-teaching, I have went on my own and tried to learn as much as possible between college and work from back then and now. I didn't do much coding for about a year and a half almost a year ago because I was finishing general eds before graduating at the other college and working quite a bit but cut down on my work a year ago to focus on school and to learn more on my own to prepare me for a career. It's now summer and I have quite a bit of time so I have been watching my courses online and learning, though at the moment it's C# UWP applications with a XAML front end (though I still write a little bit of the UI in code), Azure, [ASP.net](https://asp.net/), some stuff IT related, and when I have time make a few applications in Python and C++ to stay fresh in my mind. I do balance them out very equally, so I typically don't get mixed up and confused, and it's usually worked out well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now here is the interesting part:**

So, if you've read all of the above, you'd notice that I have not had a single college course focused in Information Technology. Currently, all of my professional experience is within the Information Technology field as an IT student assitant at my old college, IT Intern during the summer, and IT Help Desk at my current college. I had another job not pertaining to my career at all that gained me valuable customer service experience which employers have so far liked. All of my college course work is on one side, and my professional job experience on the other.

The point of this post is that I had a couple interviews for Summer 2019 Software Dev Interns because I want to get into professional coding and see if I actually enjoy it compared to college-coding and my side projects. They liked my resume, but the fact that I had no professional experience in programming, or as an alternative, a decent amount of projects listed on my github and some on resume that demonstrate experience and knowledge in the languages I claim to know at a particular skill set, etc. I did mention a couple I wrote in C# Win Forms but the fact that no code was given nor shown didn't help. So, here I am looking for some advice.

I apologize for the long post, hopefully you kind souls out there don't mind reading it and handing me some advice 😁 I thank you all for your time, patience, and help :)"
bxxsw1,0,2019-06-07,How do I get a good-paying CS job if I'm garbage at coding questions?,pianoman1031,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bxxsw1/how_do_i_get_a_goodpaying_cs_job_if_im_garbage_at/,"I'm an almost graduated CS major (1 more semester) who really only got into coding 3 years ago after switching from mechanical engineering/chemistry. I've loved my time in the program and have done well in my CS classes. I've learned more front end stuff and mobile development on my own time, deploying a few apps and such (nothing noteworthy). I've worked as a student employee at a major University affiliated government contracting company for about a year and a half before getting an internship at a different small (~150 employees) contracting agency doing digital signal processing. 

Now before you think that sounds impressive, I have no idea what I'm doing at this internship, having never done jack squat in electrical signals and I feel like I'm learning the equivalent of a 2-year electrical circuits degree in the few weeks that I've been here. I'm not doing any development and I really wanted an internship to help me learn industry standard development practices. I'm not on a team at all and there is no scrum meetings or anything. I literally sit at my desk all day and try to learn stuff on my own that I've never even messed with, shooting in the dark on what I'm supposed to learn.

But that's just all for context. In addition, the interviews that I had previous to this internship all had a technical portion, which, barring an actual coding question, weren't too bad. I understand concepts well enough and the interview for this internship was an hour long, half of it being in depth questions on various programming concepts, primarily from C++. I guess I did well, I got the internship. But as is seen from my second paragraph, I don't think I want to stay at the company. 

I actually interviewed for Sony for a mobile developer position in React Native and I really wanted it. The interviewer was great and he liked my resume, and sounded like he would have been happy to bring me on. But I muffed up the coding questions pretty badly. They were simple and I can definitely solve them, just not quickly and talking out my thought process to a potential employer at the same time. 

In general, I can code. I've been able to go through a fairly advanced program at my University, not with ease, but I've worked hard and done well. But I struggle with the interview questions, even practicing on firecode or other sites, I struggle with the simple questions and feel like I have to cheat or look it up before solving it. It's awful. 

So all in all, how in Sam Hill can I land a decent paying job doing something reasonably enjoyable if I'm absolute trash at coding questions and don't feel like I'm getting any better by trying to practice?"

According to Glassdoor reviews there are tons of growing pains. The ones that concern me the most are a concern about the middle management (including engineering management) not being clear or effective, lack of gender and racial diversity, and a lack of mentorship for junior engineers (which I will be). I don't know how reliable GlassDoor reviews are but I think I should take heed especially because I think these issues are normal for startups.

I had 2-3 internships at Facebook so I've been exposed to fast paced work cultures and I actually struggled in them. What I loved about Facebook was that there was a strong emphasis on mentorship and support for young engineers.

Do you have any advice for what I could do in advance or as soon as I start to make sure that I succeed in this new, potentially stressful and confusing environment? Overall, I'm concerned that the company is at an inflection point and will either take off and be a huge success or it will crash and burn. How do I prepare for the worst?"

I want to share my story and i hope it will bring some interesting thoughts or inspiration to you!  Be it inspiration, encouragement or some other feelings. 

I got into my current field of business while still being in a university in 2015. It was an unpaid intership. Where im from it is mandatory for our degree to get an intership (part of curriculum, gives 15 ects, ”credits” ) , and it also is not an easy task since the placements are quite scarce. 

I was a complete newbie in the industry, but was essentially blessed to have a very thorough and mentoring  boss who wanted me to learn as much as I could in the short term of 3 months internship. To top it off, i had great colleagues as well. This internship, while being unpaid, was my first experience of a white collar job, and I loved it. I worked blue collar for some 7 years before going to university. 

And i did well. Participated in everything i could, took notes, was curious and always eager to learn. I liked it there and definitely saw myself to making a career in the company if given chance. Got a great recommendation as well. 

Fast forward one year forward - i got a position as junior consultant in the company while still being in my studies finishing up some courses + bachelors thesis. Was very upbeat, now being a part of the company. 

Felt INVINCIBLE.

Invincible, as in so hungry to make as big a paycheck as possible.  It was in a huge company. Had enormous energy, learned fast, was moving up the ladder really quickly. Loved it, did huge hours (9-11/day) but it didnt bother me since what was the cons - less video game time? It was easy to prioritize career of personal pleasure.

Until I broke down.

Completely broke down.

I did not see it coming at the time. I had stopped my hobbies. I became more tired. I didnt accept being tired! Goah, work is what defines me! Im loyal to this company!

One day I was so broken down i literally could not lift my computer laptop lid open.  I had a panic attack.

I was diagnosed with burnout and was on a sick leave for 2 weeks. Was on a total emotional rollercoaster but mostly felt resentment towards upper managemt for being overworked to the maximum. 

When i returned to work it didnt feel the same. Ive always been a  Company man. Always eager to any task.  Not anymore. I stopped caring, and started completwly half assing the job.  I felt betrayed by management. I knew i had to go. My performancw got worse and worse as i was struggling with mwntal issues due to burnout and had all these thearapy sessions.

I finally quit. Felt happiest in YEARS. Enjoyed some 1,5 months on savings. Rested a bit. Spent time with my wife more. It felt great. Fwlt great from the start! It was the right move to quit.

Started my own company. Now its six months going. Its still very raw and I make a fraction of what i used to.  However now that i see that i can succees on my own i know one thing for sure:

Im never being an employee again. Im an entrepreneur. The freedom just kicks ass and im happier than ever.

Thanks for reading this far. Let me know if you like to know how my entrepreneurship has been doin for past 6 months."

Will i be good enough to get an internship?

Im hoping to be an intern at companies like cisco, deichut bank, bloomberg, jp morgan etc.. someone in my year of uni has already got an internship at deuitchet bank so i think it is realistic.

I have already completed an internship at a start up for first year.wasn’t the most productive internship

This year i will be doing scientific C++ development at a bigger company so will be more productive.

Also for my third year i will be doing individual research project into networking and mainly be using JAVA/reactJS and a bit of python.

The masters program I am looking into would be a non-specialized program at a state school and should take me 1.5 years to complete. I could certainly continue on in school and come back to the same company in 1.5 years, but I am beginning to think that I should just start working and perhaps pursue a masters degree at a later time. The company I am looking at has programs to pay for your masters degree as well.

Current situation as it stands; $80,000 in debt to school, just finished up Sophomore year in CompE at a school that would make an overbearing mother brag about her kid attending - no, not one of those, a bit farther down... yes, that one - money just isn't there to finish, but I also am not a fan of college and really just want to work full time, at least for a while. Figure out a bit more about the industry I'm headed for, you know?

Currently, I am working for a very impressive sounding group subcontracted by an also very impressive sounding place. For security reasons, I am legitimately not cleared to know what I'm working on. I'm working mostly in Machine Learning, which is also what I'll be working in come Fall, given that I'm about to accept an offer from a fancy-shmancy company that an overbearing mother would absolutely brag about her kid working at, and it might actually impress someone off the bat, without said mother having to pull up a chart on her phone.

Anyway, point is, I'll be getting out of that internship with a total of about a year of work experience in ML and ML-adjacent stuff, a not insignificant amount of ML-based coursework, independent projects, and self taught knowledge. How can I take that, and actually get a full time ML job? Preferably one that pays well enough to start making a real dent in my student loans, hopefully in a big city. NYC, Philly, Boston, or SV.

TL;DR: Dropout with fancy shmancy resume filler and an overbearing mother thinks he's too goddamn special to need a degree to go into ML, and would like to get a full time job

P.S. For those interested, the process applied to get the job was cold emailing a recruiter, being as kind as possible in emails, constantly sending follow-up emails, and performing well during the interview. As a note, I did not solve all the technical problems during the interview, but I got along great with the interviewer."
by47n3,2,2019-06-08,Today's thoughts,AloneUnit,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/by47n3/todays_thoughts/,"I feel like I'm drowning. No boat, no vest, in the middle of the ocean during a hurricane. Everyday is another struggle, another thrashing of tired legs that, in the end, will have been in vain. In this world you really have to take care of yourself. No one can do it for you. No one can save you. And, if you don't have the skills necessary...tough shit! I, obviously, don't have those skills. My mind is a fucked up tunnel leading to caves of utter despair. The more I try to shine a light and find my way out, the more I become hopefully lost. Even when I manage to escape the grasp of this depression with some sort of distraction or diversion, my mind acts like a sun, and my thoughts cannot escape the gravity of it, the orbit that keeps spinning the bullshit back around at me. I really thought if I just poured myself in trying to get my career started, it would lead me to something better. At first, I could focus and really had a drive to become what I wanted. Partly out of a sense of hope, but now looking back, I think it was more out of a sense of desperation to escape a shitty situation and prove that in the end, their would be some sort of positive outcome. But now, in these days where i can barely focus, have lost all joy in things I really used to love, I know that a positive outcome is not in my cards. I hoped today would give me something to go on. Just one sign that what I'm doing (which feels like stumbling through a pitch black hallway at night) is actually leading to something better, or at least in a better direction. The internship, the state job, the cat, Angie letting me know she would be okay. Then, I found the cat online! I rushed down there, excited and happy for the first time in a long while. As I entered the pound, I allowed myself to imagine this as a launching point. ""Things can get better now."" But life likes to remind you of just how helpless and powerless you truly are. I can't even be there for my cat when he needs me, let alone any person in my life. Just a leech that will eventually disappoint all those around me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to be 40 years old,  no money, living in my Mom's basement, dependent on people who can't afford it, and pretty much a burden to anyone who has anything to do with me. I watch people's reactions as I mumble to them, failing horribly to explain what's going on in my head, let alone my life. They feel so uncomfortable, like any other place in the world would be better than around me. You can tell that my parents are pretty much sick and tired of the same conversation they feel they need to have with me. Like I'm a fuckup who is never going to learn what everyone else knows. Every time they talk to me about my problems, it makes me feel like I'm still a child and that kills me. My Dad literally doesn't think I can do a damn thing myself. Every time I would try to help him with anything, he would get frustrated and start doing it himself like I'm some reject who just won't learn. I always thought that was just him but these last few months, I've noticed my Mom do the same thing. Maybe I am this pathetic person. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's felt like that a lot of my life. Like people just look right through me. Invisible. A nice person, sometimes interesting, but mostly just a commercial people suffer through when they're trying to watch their favourite show. I know my family loves me, but as I learned painfully in this life, that's just not enough. I really don't know if I'm a person that can be loved if it wasn't for genetic biology or society telling them to. I think that's why I fell for Angie so hard. She was the first person, (literally) that made me feel like I was something. That I could be desirable, loved for actually being myself. I will always love her for that feeling. It was probably the best feeling I have ever had. I think that's why I fought so hard, even when she had clearly given up. After 14 years, that feeling has all but dissipated and every time I unrealistically expect somebody with Borderline to come to her senses and not make me feel like utter bullshit, the reality comes down like that boulder on that Colorado highway. My only love, was somebody who just couldn't love me back. And I loved that feeling so much, that I probably put myself through too much. I always thought I was strong enough to handle the chaos. Now it just feels like it hollowed me out like a termite infected tree.

&amp;#x200B;

If the universe did have anything to give me hope or inspiration, why would it wait so long to show. I know they're are people in much worse places than I am, which just makes me feel weak and pathetic. Mom's always telling me how hard she had to fight, which just makes me feel like I really don't have what it takes to survive. Like I really am too sensitive for this world. I want desperately to make an impact. To matter to somebody beyond just being related to them. In the end, i will just be a waste of potential and and truly insignificant. Not making a difference in this world one bit. I never thought I would think about suicide, but the more I do, the more I understand. I've been so fearful about Angie doing it. The panic that would hit and the quick talking to get her back to a better mental place. It all seems pretty hypocritical now. If you really look at everything logically, suicide really makes sense. The amount of work I need to do, just to get to non-pathetic place in this life, seems like too much. Like I waited way to long to make a healthy life for myself. And even if I somehow became this badass that turned it all around, the world is in such a shitty place that the question of ""was it all worth it?"" is actually valid. I really do feel like the day after everything starts to show promise, really turn around, will the day I will have a stroke or something fucked up like that. When I finally get to a place of independence, truly not relying on anyone, Russia would bomb us or a supervolcano would decide to blow. All a reminder that I fucking wasted my life. So why wait, at least I can control how it ends. At least the one thing I can do is not let experience that final indignation.

&amp;#x200B;

So the question becomes do I put the people I care about through that. I'm not so blind to pretend that it wouldn't hurt those close to me. I always hated when people who are suicidal say that. But the real question would be is the pain they would go through my suicide be more or less than all the disappointment and stress I put them through. Seeing my Mom's reaction and my sisters face, how sad I make them is unbearable. I think the pain at first would be bad, but then they can say ""at least he isn't in pain anymore"". I also debate whether it's better for them to know I committed the act or to just disappear and do it somewhere no one knows who I am, Just some John Doe. Some melancholy  story that will never be fully told, or remembered. Maybe that will provide my loved ones the opportunity to cling to the idea that I'm doing well somewhere, an asshole that doesn't talk to his family which is pretty much the truth. It was always too hard. Too many bad memories and feelings. No one in my life was a villain or a bad person. Just a bunch of fucked up generational inertia that was just too powerful for me to deal with. I tried, I definitely tried. I coped by not thinking or dealing with it. Now that I try to, I feel like it's too late. Like it's Godzilla and I'm one of those people running around the streets, trying hysterically to survive it all. Nothing I really do or did, will have made a difference. If Godzilla wants to fuck up the whole city, who am I to stop it. Like everyone I love is just in a bunch of misery themselves and all my existence does is remind them of it. What's ironic, is I always wanted to be an inspiration to people. What a fucking joke. Childish thoughts from a childish person. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, as I weep for the billionth time these last few weeks and use way to much kleenex to not make a total snotty mess, I think that my story will be a sad story. Not enough importance or significance to really even be a tragedy. Too intelligent to be blissfully ignorant, but not smart enough to navigate these rough waters. No, just a boring dude, who in the end, might as well not of existed in the first place. A heartbeat of existence that was pointless, and made no positive impact on anything or anyone around him. A person who peaked in the 8th grade and was all downhill from there. Not worth the breath to tell the story."

Colleges: Vassar ED 1, Smith ED2

Vassar has taken 1 student from each graduating class at my school for the past several years (although that might only be because not many apply)

My sister currently attends Smith, but I don't know if that will offer a boost or not.

I don't know how colleges will take note if at all, but my high school is notorious for grade deflation in 11th and 12th grade (Even then, a 75% isn't good. I had some extenuating circumstances, my grandfather died halfway through the school year and my family situation was not good, but I don't think I'll be mentioning this in the application because it's a bit of a sorry excuse.)"

On the other hand I’m also trying to run a photography business on the side since I invested in a camera with my savings a year ago. I coded my own website and I get most of my clients through Instagram. The few client experiences I’ve had so far have been great, but at this rate I’m only making about $100 a month- nowhere near minimum wage or the cost of tuition. Right now this side hustle has been more of a liability than an asset, and I want to learn what I can do to turn that around."

White Female / 26yrs / UK citizen – originally from Poland, but recently applied and got UK citizenship due to uncertainty around Brexit. 

 

**Professional experience:** 

2.5 years as analyst at Big4 Management Consulting in London (started on the grad scheme, will be promoted to senior analyst in autumn). 

I will apply in round 1 this coming autumn for programmes starting in 2020. I am quite concerned about financing as I also have an elderly family member I have to financially support but I’m determined to make it work – I worked 2 jobs during uni and I will be most likely working part time during the MBA as well. But before I apply I definitely have to consider what options (if any) I have at a scholarship

**GMAT score:** 750

**Education:** Top 10 UK university (not Oxbridge), BSc Business and Finance, result: First Class with Honours

**Extra curriculars:** 

-	committee positions held in multiple societies at university 
-	international volunteering experience in mentoring of students from disadvantaged background in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Poland
-	taught English as second language to second children in China (basically illegitimate second children who didn’t have any official status in the eyes of the government and had no options at a formal education)
-	leadership role at an LGBT non profit in London as a volunteer
-	mentoring students at my university (mock interviews and career discussions) and also at juniors/newcomers at my workplace

My end goal after MBA is to transition to MBB (like everyone here) in Financial Services or Corps Strategy and to get more international experience but of course it will all depend on the scholarship options. 


I’m looking mainly at the following schools:

-	London Business School  – pros:  I live in London and already went to their insight day earlier in May. I love the campus and the international atmosphere, also I have a high(er) chance at scholarship + would be eligible for a UK government masters loan (10k). cons: I would mostly prefer getting experience abroad as I would like to work internationally and not necessarily in the UK. I would do their 18 month programme which would give me an option at summer internship (both work exp + funding)

-	INSEAD – pros:  love their international environment and strong alumni, I think they would be my best option at working internationally. I also speak French fluently (besides English, Spanish and Polish). cons: However, my scholarship chances would be slightly lower (I called them to ask), also I briefly worked in France before and I don’t like their working culture – afraid their attitude/culture in education will be similar

-	 M7  – this would be my dream come true! obviously I prefer HBS, but I would consider any if I were accepted. I have a couple of Polish friends who go to Kellogg and one friend from uni who graduated from Booth and they absolutely loved their experience there. My only worry is my scholarship options (unknown) and financing a two year full-time MBA with loans. Also, not sure if I have a chance to get in with my experience / background.

Are these options realistic for me?

Thank you in advance for your feedback and hope you have a nice weekend!"

by9s7l,2,2019-06-08,Pursue more school or focus on leetcode? (Need Advice),Basic_Set,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/by9s7l/pursue_more_school_or_focus_on_leetcode_need/,"I'll try to set the stage with all of my strengths/weaknesses and maybe you guys can help make my decision because I'm at a bit of a standstill and really need outsider input. (Sorry for the long write-up)

Currently I'm employed as a Software Engineer with 2 years experience. During my time of employment I've been put on some great projects at my company where I've learned a lot and have even been promoted! I get a lot of good feedback from other developers on my team about my technical ability, and I really enjoy where I work currently. The drawback is the location. The company is a technical consulting agency in a small town with not a lot of opportunities.

Also the area as a whole has kind of low wages, so this company has probably some of the best wages I can get for the area and my experience. 

My wife's family is from Los Angeles so we really would like to move farther out west than where we're located on the east coast to be closer to her family.

The problem as many of you guys know is in the tech hub areas its a lot more competitive. The interviews are technical (leetcode) based versus where I'm at now where the hardest question you would get in an interview is what a class is.

Now I'm in a bit of a predicament, I graduated with my Associates in computer science.
However for my Associates they did not cover any theory and it was mainly coding.
So I did not learn the basics of data structures and algos that a lot of the leetcode questions are based on.
However, I did learn to code really well in that degree. I got a lot of feedback from my team that they don't typically see entry level devs start making commits into the code base at the speed I did. Part of that was self teaching myself outside of class extra coding related things to get more of a base knowledge.

I figured if I wanted to move out west, then I should go back for my bachelors and learn the basics of the theory. Then I would be in a better spot to be able to answer some of the technical interview questions, plus I would have a Bachelors on my resume. I've been taking classes part-time while working full-time which has been a struggle. I did this for my associates too, and it soaks up so much of my free time but I've been pushing through. However the highest level of math that I had to take for my associates was Algebra, so I still need to take trig, calc, calc 2, Diff EQ stats etc. Plus I still need to take a bunch of comp sci courses and random electives.

I've been really bad at math in the past and when I take the math classes, I'll probably only able to take those one at a time. So that's probably a year and a half right there to get the math part of my degree done.

Anyways I'm really rethinking this path and want some of you guys to weigh in. I had a recruiter from amazon reach out to me for an assessment for an engineer role at amazon and I bombed it due to my lack of theory. I see this being the gatekeeper for me to land a job at somewhere in a more competitive environment. I get recruiters that reach out often for roles so they are at least interested in what I have on there.

When I graduated with my associates, I had an internship on my resume and I applied for a lot of jobs and only got two interviews. So I'm worried that not having a bachelor's would make me less desirable to call in to interview.

My strengths:
I'm amazing at behavioral interviews, I'm extremely personable and I've gotten offers from almost any company that's interviewed me.
I'm really good at writing code/software engineering. (Designing features, communication skills, breaking up a problem, documenation, etc)
I have high impact projects that I've worked on/designed at work that I can talk about in interviews.

My weaknesses:
Associates degree,
Bad ability to whiteboard/answer leetcode-esque problems in a technical interview.

I was thinking if I wanted to move out west, maybe I should stop taking classes and just focus on DS &amp; Algo in my spare time.
There's risk involved because right now I'm spending my free time on taking the classes towards my bachelors. I'm accumulating college credits and actually working towards a goal, versus going all in and studying for a technical interview and having nothing to show for it if I don't get hired.

Thoughts? Am I crazy? If anyone has been down a similar path I would love some feedback.

TLDR: Live in small town but want to move to more competitive area out west with wife. I have 2 years software dev exp and great soft skills/software engineer skills but don't have the CS fundamentals included in a bachelors degree. Linkedin recruiters are reaching out for me to interview for tech companies. Should I focus on completing my degree which would take longer (probably around 3 years) because I'm full time employed or grind through leetcode/CTCI for a few months and then start applying to companies in the competitive areas?"

I noticed that a lot of internships require some understanding in Servers, Javascript, HTML, SQL,  and OS scripting language like Shell.

This is where my dilemma comes in. Should I become more well rounded in my first programming language((C++) or begin learning new in demand languages to make my Resume sound more impressive.

It was a 50/50 mix of labor (taking laptop carts to different rooms and hooking up the computers, mainly) and some basic troubleshooting and repairing of Windows PCs, Android tablets, and Chromebooks (removing viruses, doing updates, replacing keys and cables, mostly just ""turn it off and on again"" type stuff lol).

I mostly got work via work orders from the tech dept and my boss, but I also helped out students and teachers whenever they had trouble. I *was* the ""IT guy"" to a lot of them.

Admittedly, the internship was low-key, being a smaller school, so the most stressful endeavor was traveling to a neighboring school with my boss and getting a small computer lab set up there.

So would this be a good example to put on my resume under experience? Due to personal issues this ""employment"" is followed by 2 gap years and I've never had a job besides this internship. 

Also, do I need to get some more experience elsewhere (retail, etc) or do you think that'll be enough to *maybe* get a help desk job with IT at my college? I'm planning to talk to my career coach to help get my shit in order anyway but I wanted to ask you guys for advice as well."

I'm going to assume most people reading this would like to and aim to work at one of the desirable companies with fancy benefits. Telling someone with these aspirations that they shouldn't expect to have job hunting success til their junior year is bad advice, and hurts their future.

It's my first time at one of those types of companies, and one thing I've noticed from doing smalltalk with other interns, is how many people here have some sort of prior work or research experience before they start their junior year. Before anyone starts stressing out, most of these prior work experiences are at unknown startups, local small companies, just places where you talk to a recruiter or hiring manager, and based on conversation they think you're willing to learn and give you a shot. Additionally, based on the large array of the actual experiences, ranging from the person not doing much for 3 months, to becoming competent in whatever technology the person's project uses, it seems like it matters more that you have the work experience listed on that resume, vs what you actually did or learned at that experience.

So my hope is, for those ambitious freshmen, sophomores who are struggling to find their first internship, and want to eventually end up at a fancy company, instead of placating them by saying not to worry until their junior year (where their current errors in jobhunting might follow them even during junior year), you should instead encourage them to try different approaches to their job hunt, from going to more university company events or jobfairs, or cold-emailing and linkedin hunting. Basically anything other than the clusterfuck that is online apps. Do the recruiter's job for the recruiter, instead of the recruiter finding talent, the talent finds the recruiter.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm making this post because it can be really easy to develop an unhealthy mindset and put people with prestigious internships on a pedestal if you're struggling to get one. Someone who receives the advice of ""wait til junior year"" may be smart, worked hard to create a good resume with say personal projects, but since they have no work experience and struggle jobhunting, it's easy to think that they're just not good enough. But that's not true. The most common factor among other interns at my company, isn't academic ability, tier of school, major, software dev ability, or quality of personal projects but prior relevant work experience, regardless of the tier of the company.

IDK if its true, but its often said that the top x% of men get the majority of women (or men KappaPride) on tinder. The same is true for tech internships. The top x% of students get the most choice in tech internships. But while one might think what defines a top student here is general smartness or technical competence, it's actually just having work experience"

I was business administration major with a concentration in management and just switched to a concentration in management information systems. At my school you have a choice of three paths in MIS and I'm deciding between Business Analytics and Cyber Security. If you have a job in either of these fields, can you go into as much detail as possible about the day to day aspects of your job and why you like it? Once again as much information on the job that you can list would be greatly appreciated.

Additionally, can you list what certifications would be good for each career path. For example, I've seen A+, Security+, and Network+ come up a lot. If I were to get these, which order would be the best to get them in and if there's better options besides these certs, then what are they? There’s just so many out there that are similar, so I’m not sure which are the best and most practical to get.

Another quesiton I have is about learning programming languages or any other software I'd need to know.  Would I need to learn any programming for either of these career paths, and if so, which ones?

Also which type of jobs can I get right now that would be good experience for each job. I know internships are the best, but I just want to know what other types of jobs can give me experience. For example, would a help desk job be good experience for either of these career paths and if so, how would I go about getting this job without any IT experience?

If you do have experience in either of these fields would you be able to give me a quick run down of the career path you took. For example what degree you got, what experience you got (internships and other jobs, including what job titles you had), and what certifications you got.

Lastly, if you have info on which job generally has more openings/positions available, which one is growing faster, and the salary difference between the two, I would be very grateful. If it helps I’m in the Los Angeles County area.

I’ve just been a little overwhelmed with all the information out there on these two career paths, so any information or advice you can give me would be incredibly helpful and appreciated."

However, with the way things have turned out in my life, any hope of being able to do such a thing is beginning to fade. I am a 26 year old school bus driver who barely makes enough money to cover his own needs -- let alone a family. I have no marketable skills.  I have an Associate's degree but no desire or financial means to continue on with college.  I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and other autoimmune diseases that keep me from breaking into the skilled trades because my body simply cannot handle daily physical exertion; I even made it pretty far into the process of becoming a police officer but couldn't continue because of all the exercise required for the academy.   


The sad part is I am drawn towards more physically active careers and yet I am barred from these because of my health. It bores me to even think about having a job sitting at a desk or cooped up in an office all day. For these reasons I started gravitating towards driving jobs because it had the combined benefit of allowing me to not have to exert myself but also still be ""active"" in the sense of not sitting inside all day, but being out on the rode going from place to place as I do my job. I initially started with the idea of being a truck driver because they are easily able to earn enough money to support a family, but I passed over that idea once I realized how much time it would take away from me being able to actually spend time with my family.    


From there I went on to the idea of being a bus driver because the district I am employed by offered to pay me to get my CDL. Ironically I am now in the opposite situation I would be in as a truck driver: I have all the time in the world with this job to spend with family, but I don't make nearly enough to support one.  


Since going to college is seen as one of the standard paths that one is to take to acquire a job with sufficient earning potential nowadays, I will give you some backstory on what happened with my college career. In summary, I ended up wasting about 6 years on the pursuit of a Bachelor's degree because I listened to what other people said I should do with college and not my own heart. After I got my Associate's degree (General studies -- I just completed all of the basics and a few pre-reqs for my Bachelor's), I slogged through the same degree plan (Environmental Science) for years because I was told that I needed to get a STEM degree. It was all I could do to make myself go to class every day. Eventually it got to where I was almost suicidally depressed from how much I hated dragging myself to those classes. The final nail in the coffin was this: I had to do an internship for my degree -- a requirement which I successfully completed according to the guidelines laid out by the department chair. When it came time to to take the capstone class which was attached to the internship, however, the professor had changed the requirements for the internship and told me that I had to do another internship if I wanted to take the class. I worked for free for months at a job that  I hated... and now I was told that I had to do it all over again. That indeed was the final straw -- I dropped out after that.  


The truth is, I never would have chosen such a degree on my own. I probably wouldn't have even gone to college at all if not for the strong pressure from family to do so. I was told that my life would basically be over if I didn't at least get a Bachelor's degree. But even to this day, there is no marketable degree plan that I would be interested in studying in college. If I had my choice I would have chosen Music... Okay, so that allows me to be a music teacher -- not interested. I just don't have any real interest or passion for any of the fields that are the money makers today.  


It has been years now since I dropped out of college, and I have racked my brain for these years trying to figure out how I will be able to make a comfortable living without a degree and without the ability to work jobs that require physical exertion. I have worked a number of jobs typically considered menial: grocery store employee, security guard, and I would even consider my job as a bus driver menial and I found myself bored with these jobs within a month or two of working at them.  


The part that breaks my heart the most about of all this is that I have fallen in love recently with a girl whom I would like to spend the rest of my life with... but I am brought to tears when I think about our future together because... I can't see one... and it's all because I can't foresee how I am going to be able to make enough money to do the things that I want to do with her -- to get married, to have kids, to have our own house, to go places and do fun things together. I am heartbroken at the thought that, in spite of the fact that we our both madly in love and seemingly perfect for each other, that it could all come to an end someday because she will realize that I can't bring in enough money and that there is thus no way for things to progress past how they are now.  


Am I doomed to be working unengaging jobs that don't make enough money?... Am I doomed to lose the one I love because I can't earn enough money? It has always been my understanding that I would need to make at least $50,000 or more per year to be able to support a family (myself, wife and 2 kids)... How is someone in my situation able to earn that much money?  


 I would greatly appreciate it if someone could give me their insight and advice.  
All opinions, positive or negative, good or bad, are welcomed. I have reached my wit's end and am in dire need of outside council on this subject matter.  


Thanks in advance."

Context: in 2016, a bank closed all my accounts with them, with no notice. I had a credit card, a checking/savings account, and an LLC. They would not disclose why and I did not have a legal case to have this expunged as the bank can close my account for any reason (as dictated in the contract). I accepted the 100 point drop in my credit score as my lumps, opened up the same accounts with no problem at another institution. They are still operating currently.

Since, I started another LLC and required federal and state licensing - this required very stringent background checks. I then also got Global Entry, TSA Pre-Check, attained a firearms ID, concealed carry license, and passed two employment background checks.

I am now an MBA at a top program, and accepted a summer internship at the bank that ended all relations with me in 2016. This was a dream job for me. I accepted the offer in writing on 1/24/2019, to start on 6/10/2019. On 5/1/2019 they called me to ask why my personal accounts were closed. I disclosed what I knew (nothing), and they followed up on the 10th of May asking about the LLC account. I faced the same issue there. 

During this time it was impossible to reach my case advisor. On 5/25/2019 they called to say my case hadn’t been updated and I needed to follow up on my case. I did. I was then told judgment will be rendered in 48 hours. I was called on 5/28 and told that my offer was rescinded without chance to appeal due to those accounts.

I spoke with the campus job center to see if they could get any insight. I immediately asked the bank for someone to talk to - they provided me with a general email and nothing more.

I get a call five days ago telling me that “the accounts were closed due to patterns of behavior that, while not illegal, the bank was uncomfortable with” and no chance to appeal. They said it was company policy to not hire people with this flag on them. I was never told about this in the four months leading up to the case.

This now puts me in a position where I cannot find suitable summer internship employment. Not only does this cause me significant financial harm in the short term, but in the long term it massively impacts my potential for finding jobs.

Given I turned down other more lucrative offers for this position and was never asked about my banking history with the company, I had no way to know this would be a potential issue.

I am in an at-will employment state, but what I want to know is in an instance like this - where there *are* no other viable options for employment in the short term as a summer intern and I can demonstrate massive lost income potential, is there any case to be made?

On top of this, aside from financially, it’s a huge embarrassment because immediately when I share this everyone thinks I committed some criminal act - I’ve never even gotten a ticket for speeding.

This causes me significant personal financial harm, but I cannot argue it from a pure employment contract position. Is it possible that since the structure of internships and business school recruiting (i.e. they are aware that if I accept an offer I can no longer engage in recruiting or field offers from institutions) is known to this company, that I have some sort of case?

This puts me in a rough bind. Thank you all for your time in reading this."
byer5o,1,2019-06-08,I'm in need of engineering career advice. Can you help?,GenericUs3rn4m3,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/byer5o/im_in_need_of_engineering_career_advice_can_you/,"**First paragraph contains context to my situation. Skip to second paragraph for questions.**

My relationship with the field of engineering has been slightly convoluted.  Originally my undergraduate degree was biomedical engineering and I had plans to work as a researcher after graduation.  I had an internship at the NIH between my junior and senior year that heavily discouraged me from pursuing my first plan so I pivoted into a double major in electrical engineering.  However without a relevant internship during my undergrad, it was hard to land a good job as an electrical engineer.  I decided to apply for Ph.D. programs in electrical engineering thinking it would allow me to gain further knowledge in electrical engineering and pursue a research role as I had planned from earlier in my education.  Fast-forward and I am now graduating with my masters in electrical engineering.  Although I learned a lot, the program wasn't a great fit for me in terms of continuing with my Ph.D and I couldn't find research that I was really interested in doing.  I am now at a crossroads in my career path.  On one hand, I am excited to be done with school for a little.  I accepted an offer to work at Northrop Grumman as a hardware engineer which will be a good opportunity to build my resume.  I am on the other hand still attracted to the idea of a pursuing a Ph.D.  I received an email for an on-site interview at the JHU applied physics laboratory which seems like a good place to possibly continue this goal, but I feel that I'm reaching a point of burn out.

**For those of you that have decided to go down a career in industry, how has your progression through the engineering ranks ended up?**  I am concerned that I will be working on projects that may not be interesting but it may be necessary to put in work now on something less interesting with the goal to move on to something better.  I am however excited to start my ""adult life"" as I will be making a good amount of money and I will have some free time to pursue extracurricular activities that I have wanted to for a while.

**For those of you that have received your Ph.D., was it worth the extra input at the beginning?**  The advice that consistently I've gotten was to do your Ph.D. early.  I have however realized that to be really successful in a Ph.D. program you must be interested in what you are studying.  I am concerned that I may not find that thing that I'm really passionate about and trying to force the Ph.D. will not be worth it.  It also sucks having to spend all of your time working and I am concerned that I'm quickly letting my early adult life slip away from me.  However, the reward for putting in the time early seems significant so I am trying to weigh the pros and cons.

To be honest, I currently feel like there hasn't been a specific thing that I've studied and said ""this is what I really want to do"".  I like engineering and I'm good at it.  However I feel like I have no idea about where to look and find something I really enjoy.  **I feel like I can't be alone in this feeling and my question is** **how did people find something that they really enjoyed?**"

I have a pretty high GPA around 3.5 and I thought UCI was really prestigious and especially in the Irvine area so it would be easy to get an internship. Some of my professors that I talked to even said that it would be super easy to find an internship especially because I was a junior from UCI and they would want to hire me after college. I applied to several companies with a couple in Irvine but why is no one seem to be responding to me though??? Summer is literally starting after next week and the companies are not saying anything at all so I don't know if I got the internship or not. I made sure to always check my spam emails and all my phone calls but there is nothing. Im getting so stressed out thinking about it before finals. I dont know if I should go to the local companies I applied to and ask them why they have no responded to my applications or just wait until next week.

Hey all,

I joined a medium sized (350 employees) finance company in early January as a data science intern with beginner knowledge in SQL and no knowledge in anything else.

As time progressed, I became better at SQL and my manager started to introduce me to other languages such as R and Python. In the end, he ended up leaving (went back to Europe for another job) and I was assigned a new manager who had recently joined. With him, he asked me to learn R and try make sense of former codes and during these 3-4 weeks, i felt like shit because I was not contributing to the company at all. I was purely just learning. 

Fast forward to 2 months later, I’ve done quite a bit of work and I was given more responsibilities. It felt like I was actually contributing to the company now and I was invited to some more senior meetings.

I was given a task that was supposed to be completed within 2 hours but I was not too familiar with one of the tables. This meant that i took way too long to write the SQL query and the senior manager (not my manager) of the division became frustrated and told me off, telling me I had a long way to go and that this was an easy query/SQL was the foundation of a data scientist and that i should know stuff like this back to front since i’ve been working for nearly 6 months. I was pretty shaken as I had never seen him go off like that, and I respect him immensely due to his impressive work experience. He explained to me what i had to do and I immediately understood the table structure. I felt so silly, defeated that I didn’t think of the solution at first, overcomplicating a easy task. 

I ended up completing it a couple of hours later and sent in the query for production later that night.

The following morning, he asked to speak with me and told me that I would now be working in another team (which was way less technical, only SQL needed) within the same division for the next few weeks. He told me i had potential that needed to be reached and I had to think more analytically. I was happy that he was willing to help me but i’m also unsure of whether he wants me to go back into data science? 

My old manager and my new manager (had a coffee catch up with both) both told me that I should probably just settle into this new role because the senior manager didn’t mention me going back? 

Can anyone shed some light? 

I should also mention that I am on the cusp of getting a graduate contract.

Thanks."
byhmy4,1,2019-06-09,Medicine or Law?,urindianfather,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/byhmy4/medicine_or_law/,"Hi! I am a 16 year old Australian student, and I am in my second last year of high school, and will sit the HSC (Aussie equivalent of the SAT) around this time next year. I will be starting uni in 2021, however, now is about the time when students generally begin to start seriously considering future careers and uni courses.

I am torn between two degrees, both of which require VERY high ATARs (HSC scores) and am unsure as to what I should choose. The two degrees are Law and Medicine. Here are my pros and cons for both:

**Med:**

\- I genuinely enjoy science and have taken subjects that are more science/math oriented

\- Both of my parents are doctors (one works at the largest children's hospital in Sydney, and the other is Head of Department at a tertiary hospital) and making connections/internships will be easy (relatively) and professional advice will be very easy to access

\- I know this industry like I know the back of my own hand - did work experience at a hospital, have spent most of my life sitting in hospital rooms, also means I am VERY aware of the ugly side of medicine e.g. night shifts, intra-department 'politics,' hard work required, intern salaries etc. (which is perhaps why I am unsure as to whether I should pursue this as a career or not) 

\- Of course, eventually, the large paycheck (esp. surgery, which I'm interested in anyway, and anaesthetics) 

The only con is the huge amount of time and effort it takes to actually reach the point where you make that sort of money, and I'm not sure that I'm willing to put that much work into Med

**Law (I would eventually like to pursue International Law):**

\- I have excellent communication skills

\- I don't know much about it which is possibly why Law is as appealing to me as it is

\- I do Mock Trial (same as Moot Courts), and while I am very aware that real law is VERY different to MT, I genuinely really enjoy it

\- I think right now I want to do Law more, but this is also coming from a place of basically a complete and utter lack of understanding as to what the career actually entails

\- Con: not as much money as medicine, no connections

Any advice, Reddit?? Thank you all in advance :)"

One developer from each team is on call at all times and they do weekly rotations. However, this company also likes keeping teams small and most are 4 - 6 people. So that means people are on call for a week every 4 to 6 weeks.  
  
While you're on call, you're expected to have a phone and laptop on you at all times and be working on a fix to a ping within 10 minutes.    
  
There's no extra compensation or overtime or anything because it's considered just part of the job.
  
How normal is this kind of thing? Because, frankly, this sounds horrible to me. Because of the laptop/phone service requirement, it'd be really hard to do things like exercise, go to concerts, hike, travel, go on dates, etc. And it's not like it'd be a once in a blue moon type of thing; I might be spending a quarter of my life on call while working for this company.  
  
Is this a valid reason to rule out an employer, or are policies like this so common I'm just going to deal with it wherever I go?"

I don't have a lot of work experience, mostly fast-food, which I quit after 6 months about 2 years ago, and I've recently re-applied and worked for about 8 months now, but I'm considering quitting once again.

I was truly happy when I got accepted over the summer, but right now I'm feeling dreadful every time I have to go to work.  I don't even work that much, I limit my shift to about 10-12 hours each week, but I feel like it's been sucking my soul dry every time, and I haven't had a lot of time for myself because I had to juggle a lot for my uni, extra-curricular activities, and volunteer work. I'm currently a general committee for 3 different clubs at uni, though I'm only partly active there (I'm mostly active at mostly 1), and I also do volunteer work a couple of hours a week. I'm also looking for an internship for my 3rd year, and I've been going to info sessions, at least I've been trying to.

The thing about my workplace is that, even though I only work meagre hours per week, most of my shifts are only for a short period of time, about 1-2 hours each shift, and it takes me about an hour to get there from home (though it's close to my uni about 15min travel). It's been hard for me to plan my time, because I'd be called in for work for most days of the week, even though I wouldn't even work that much. And sometimes I'd start late because they didn't need me yet, or be sent home early because they didn't need me anymore. The work is also a bit physically demanding, in which I have to run around serving customers.

I feel like all these combined have contributed greatly to my stress, and they're mentally and physically taxing. I don't understand how someone can work 30+ hours a week while being full time in uni, and survive. And I honestly feel pathetic/weak-willed for not being able to handle just this much work-load.

Although I'm currently dead-set on quitting, there's still a part of me that wants to stay, because of the money and how it would help make my resume look better.

I'm currently living with a relative and I pay a very cheap rent and I'd only have to worry about that and my car maintenance, but I'm pretty sure I can survive with my gov allowance (I don't know if you have this in the US but in my country the gov gives you an allowance for being in education), so money is not really a problem for me.

In the end, should I quit after all?

PS. There's just one good thing about my workplace. Everyone in the workplace including the manager is friendly and nice, and it has a very welcoming atmosphere. They treated me very well when I first started while teaching me how to do things in the restaurant."

I ended up getting an offer from a relatively-local software company, where I was hired as a part time, project-based software engineer. Basically, I am hired until the project I am working on is complete, which is projected to take 6 months, and then there is a chance I might be offered a full time position. 

While I was nervous at first about the kind of experience I would gain, I have already learned a lot and definitely feel I am gaining valuable work experience because I am doing a lot of hands on coding. 

However, my advisor is still stressing that I should look for an actual internship for the fall semester (my last semester of school). Will the part-time position not look as valuable on my resume as an actual ""internship"" would?

byp67z,1,2019-06-09,i need help?,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/byp67z/i_need_help/,"hello dear reddit community.

i have just signed up on here, because I've been browsing on this page and i feel like i could really use some motivation and people who would listen to my problems and not to only give me advice, but also could maybe help me feel better. because my mental state hasn't been this bad in a while.

I live in Germany, am female and I will be turning 17 in 3 months or so. I graduated last year and I thought I would stay in school and do my a-levels (which is called 'Abitur' over here and we are not forced to do it, but I've heard many schools in America for example aren't like that so I just wanted to clarify that). But because of my mental health, I realized I needed a break. Summer break after graduation went way too fast for me and I had no plan what to do. A friend - that I have now ended the friendship with out of other reasons - was very unhappy too. So we decided to sign out of school again. It made us feel pressured and I had other things going on in my life which impacted me too much during that time. I had also broken up with my girlfriend around the time school started again, because I realized that it was only some kinda Stockholme syndrome keeping me in that relationship and our breakup made me go through a small phase of both feeling excited and finally free, but also deeply sorry and sad. I already feel empty writing this, because I'm scared that people will only tell me to go talk about this with a therapist, and I know I should be talking to a therapist, but guess what - I'm scared of that too. Don't worry, I have friends and family who I talk to every day, especially about my problems. But yet I still feel alone sometimes. As if I am the only one who seems to not have their shit together and doesn't know how to handle life.

Going back to what I was saying (sorry I tend to ramble) after I signed out, I was happy. ( Well, as happy as you can be going through a break up and a few family-related problems.) But then I got scared. Scared I won't achieve anything in my life. In Germany we are forced to do an apprenticeship of at least 2 years if we don't finish our a-levels. Which is fine, I accept that. But I just can't seem to find the job that makes me go 'yes, I want that!' or 'this job calls my name'. But I don't wanna go into a job with just the feeling of 'well now you finally have a job'. And I don't care about the money. Over here I would even have to give most of the money to my mum, because welfare - or whatever you would call it - would use my income so that my mother (who can't work out of health reasons) gets her rent paid every month. No problem with that, I am not planning on moving out soon (because I love the place we live in and the flats here are way too expensive.) and I am okay with giving my mom the money I earn, since she had to waste so much money on me when I was a kid. It's just fair that I give her something back.

So I need a job that makes me happy. But there is none. I've been signed out of school officially since January and have been unemployed since. I said I would be fine with doing mini jobs, but you see, I am forced by the state to either keep going to school (which I really, really wouldn't want to and don't have to) or do an apprenticeship of at least two years. Wow I feel like deleting this post because I must sound like such a brat that doesn't want to go to work. I do. I wanna work, but I wanna find **the right working place** for me.

I've been doing tests to find the right job for me, reading about every job that is possible for me to do... until I find out I'm either not qualified because of my knowledge or my characteristics and fears. And at this point, I'm okay with having to live a life full of unhappiness and in the worst case scenario, I will force myself just to do any kind of apprenticeship... but on top of that I just feel like I don't belong in this world at all. The way I behave, the way I always want everything to be perfect and the way I never try to hurt anyone makes me seem like a weak person - a softie, to be exact - to many people, which is why they love to just bully me for it or use that to manipulate me. And the bosses that I had met during internships, they did exactly that - manipulate me or make me feel like I'm a piece of useless dirt. My mum was really mad whenever I told her stories about them.

Don't get me wrong, I do like my life. I enjoy my life, am thankful and I love when my mum wants to go to concerts with me because she knows they make me forget about any kinda crap just for a few hours or even for days after. I appreciate my friends too. But I feel like I'm going crazy. I feel like I'll never find a fulfilling way to live life.

I think I don't know what to say anymore, so... please don't be too hard on me. I must seem like a small little piece of shit that will never achieve anything with this attitude and can just whine about how unfair her life is. You don't need to tell me that, I already know. I went on this page exactly, because German pages like reddit are filled with mean people who will definitely make me cry (I'm sensitive, sorry) and I just want people to give me motivation or help me find a way out of this ''hole''. Or maybe this is just cry for help and some love. I don't know.

All the love, stay kind."

Most of the job ads that I find are only available to citizens or permanent residents.

I just finished my second year of undergrad (2.5 left to go) and am very strongly considering pursuing a PhD (possibly professorship). I've done very well in undergrad so far, but sometimes when I see the achievements of students who get into grad school at MIT, Cal Tech, etc., I feel like I'm somehow still not doing enough.

If I were to apply today, this what my application would look like:

1. Undergraduate engineering student at a top \~5 engineering undergrad program;
2. 4.0 GPA (I'm likely to get a B or two before graduating);
3. Solid research experience in my field of study:  

   1. Summer research position at a top \~20 engineering school during high school;
   2. research assistant during my 1st year of undergrad at my school (quite lackluster, left this lab);
   3. research assistant during Fall of my 2nd year of undergrad  

      1. want to return to this group, BUT I am very unlikely to be an author on a publication in this group, as the professor is very unwilling to have undergrads as co-authors on papers;
   4. Current summer research position at a national lab
   5. No publications currently/in the works, and it seems unlikely I'll get a publication from my current research position at my school (despite enjoying it immensely);
4. One industry internship in my field;
5. Involved in 3 decent extracurriculars on-campus;
6. No notable scholarships or awards;
7. No GRE Scores yet;
8. I expect to have strong LoR's from faculty I'm close with.

I'm quite worried that my lack of publications, notable scholarships/awards, or truly exceptional extracurriculars will prevent me from getting into top grad schools for my program. I have another 2.5 years of part-time research experience that I will accrue during school semesters, alongside two more summers that I will try to fill with some REU-like program. Do you guys have any advice on things I can do to increase my chances to get into top schools?

How do I get myself on track to getting a CS internship at the end of 3rd year?"
byqkwh,2,2019-06-09,Interning at a startup and I'm having fun. How can best I use this experience?,TTG300,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/byqkwh/interning_at_a_startup_and_im_having_fun_how_can/,"Just finished the second week of my software engineer internship at a mature startup in NYC. In the first 1:1s with my manager, seems like I'm making meeting expectations pretty nicely (or exceeding them, idk). I really enjoy this company, as this is my first tech internship at a company as small as this. I also lucked out, and was placed on a revenue-generating product team. I plan on making as much impact as I can by the end of the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Although working at this company has been great, I plan on recruiting pretty aggressively after I graduate (in December). I want to work in NYC, and I've been made aware that new grad recruitment in the city can be quite competitive. It seems there aren't as many grad roles to go around if you're not in SF. In my view, my best shot is to lean on the impact made in my internship experiences as proof that I can enter a role as a more-productive-than-average graduate. Therefore, this summer will hopefully be spent making the right moves towards a hopefully busy recruiting season.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to why I'm making this post: A lot of this plan is formed from my assumptions about startups, the tech market in NY, and even how many companies recruit new grads in the winter. If anyone has any more info to divulge on those topics, I'd love to hear more. In general, how should I approach working at a small company to do the most for my resume/portfolio, and recruitment soon after?"

It is making me reconsider my career track.

Few things:

• I can't ever really slack off (go on Reddit, phone, read a book) when I don't have anything to work on because my work station is facing out (to my boss' office) and people pass by my desk a lot (its an open floor plan).

• The work I do have is boring as hell (it's all coding busywork). I count down the minutes until 5...

• When I look at older developers and see the work they're doing, that doesn't exactly excite me. I'm starting to hate CS in general. I also am not a huge fan of the weird ""office culture"" shenanigans (coworker relationships, etc).

Good parts about my job:

• Flexible hours (I can work anytime during the day as long as I hit 40 hours a week).

• It's paid.

• ""Casual"" attire.

I've started to drink coffee regularly to try and stay focused, as well as to improve my mood, but I'm starting to consider other career options. I have enough time left in my college career to change majors. Thing is, nothing really excites me. I've thought about joining the military for four years then going back to college once I have my life figured out."

I hate myself for studying history, but I can't go back in time, so there's no point in dwelling on it... 

21-year-old me wanted to stay in academia, 28-year-old me hates the pointless publications, the self-absorbed conferences and the narrow research that rarely touches the outside world (talking strictly about my own experience). I could easily get a PhD stipend and I probably would enjoy writing another thesis – but then what? I'd be even older, and my skills would still be useless irl.

I want to find a new path, but I have no idea where to look. Should I get a 2nd, useful degree? I live in Germany, and the college system here is kinda rigid (because of course it is). I would have to go back to the start and invest another 5 years.

Soooo, after lurking for a while, I thought maybe you guys could help me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional info:

&amp;#x200B;

**Work experience**

I’ve written for a couple of newspapers (only analysis, no original reporting)

Tutor (at my university)

Student assistant for a professor

Cashier at McDonald’s

Student job at a consulting firm (PR)

Tourist guide

Retail

No internships (always needed a job with a salary)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I want to do / hope to achieve**

First and foremost, I want a career that’s a bit more stable and secure than academia or journalism. I don't want to play musical chairs until I'm 50. I would love to work in a field where the employer actually needs me.

I don’t need a lot of money, but I would like to be in a position where I don’t have to worry about every unexpected bill. Ideally, I would have enough savings to support my parents when they're old and then some.

I want to do something that leads to actual results and/or has an impact on people's lives; something \*useful\*, no matter how mundane it is.

I like – and, to be honest – \*need\* intellectual challenges and regularly changing demands, though I don't mind and even enjoy tedious tasks as long as it isn't the only thing I do.

I'm willing to move for my job (within and outside of the EU)

Something environment, tech, government and/or policy related would be awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Things I suck at**

My social skills aren’t great. I’m on the spectrum (Asperger), so ya… I learned how to fit in, but it can be exhausting.

Handling other people’s bodies freaks me (and consequently them) out.

I'm accident-prone and weak af (but I do have stamina haha)."

First, a little background about myself: I'm a high school junior who is interning at a computational biology lab in about 3 months.

My mentor, a professor and researcher, has invited me to go out to brunch with him and possibly one of this lab members in a few days. He wants to discuss with me about my interests and some ideas I have for a research project I could work on during my internship.

Unfortunately, I've never went out to eat with a group of people besides my close friends or family. Once, I was forced to go to dinner with some people from a sports team at school and I was extremely uncomfortable and quiet.

I'm especially anxious because of the age gap, and I see this as a hindrance to any meaningful or long conversations (as I do not know how to converse with older people). I'm afraid it will be awkward for the entire brunch, even though he is one of the nicest and most outgoing people I have met. I'm afraid it will be just him talking the entire time. My interests in terms of research are pretty straightforward, and being just a high school student, I don't know how I can talk about this subject for an extended period of time.

The advice of asking questions and listening to people talk about themselves is not really applicable here, because I feel like I should be doing the bulk of the talking, as this is my internship. (IMO).

What are some talking points, ideas, skills, or mindsets I should keep in mind during this brunch?  Any help would be appreciated."
bytuoo,74,2019-06-10,"Please help, my Ex was found guilty of Harassment and Disorderly Behavior by our university's conduct office. I've graduated and she's coming after me since I'm no longer a protected student.",ElQuesoGrande248,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bytuoo/please_help_my_ex_was_found_guilty_of_harassment/,"I just graduated this past may from college and spent the last 3 months stressed and pushed to my breaking point because of my crazy ex girlfriend. I broke up with her and over the course of an entire week she went from ""I miss you please don't do this"" to ""Fuck you, you're going to give me closure because I fucking deserve it. I am not crazy, you're crazy and you can't run from me."" I documented every text message, Facebook message, and Snapchat message and sent it all to our university's Public Safety office. I immediately had a ""No Contact Order"" placed against her which prohibited her from contacting me via physical, electronic, or third parties (people passing messages to me for her). She violated the No Contact Order several times and each time was documented. After building a case against her and documenting the stalking, harassment, and threats she made against me she was found responsible for Harassment and Disorderly Behavior but not Stalking or Refusal to Comply. She received a warning and has to write a 3 page, double spaced paper about what she did wrong.   


Since graduating I have blocked her on all forms of social media and all other platforms I could think of. Just this past week she contacted me over Steam (a gaming service that we were friends on but I forgot) telling me about how I wronged her and how she wanted to talk and get closure, but if I didn't want to talk ""it would be fine."" I responded saying ""Do not contact me ANYWHERE, EVER again. Lose my contact information. Leave me and my friends alone."" I was met with a swift response as a paragraph with numerous insults and threats against me. She explained how her dad had friends on the police force and she would have a ""talk with them"" if I contact her. She also explained how her cousins are lawyers and she will ""be telling them about the fake Title IX stuff you pulled on me"" and ""some day, people are going to hear about the fake Title IX you filed on me, the defamation of my character, and the load of shit you pulled.""   


I have not responded to her and I have continued to block her on any other gaming services we used in the past. I have forwarded screenshots of the messages sent to me to the University but they told me they can't do anything because I am not a student anymore.  


For context I want to pursue a career in Law Enforcement and am scared of her ruining my potential future employment opportunities. I am in California and she is from New York where our university is located, but she's in another state last I heard for the summer for an internship.  


My question is can I file a restraining order against her and would that even protect me? Are any of the things she said to me actual threats in a legal sense? Since she was already found responsible for Harassment and Disorderly Behavior under our university's policies can that be presented in court to work in my favor? Can I sue the school because one of their students is harassing me?  


I was sexually assaulted in February by a different girl while we dated and sexually assaulted again in April by another, other girl. I have not been able to process or heal from either assault because my ex was the most present threat for the months following both assaults. I want her out of my life and I want to live in peace without fear of her ruining any potential employment or hurting me or my family.   


Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated."

I am a new UMD freshman and am very ambitious: I'm aiming for MD, PhD, or MD/PhD in oncology/bioinformatics/computational biology. Since I am pretty sure that I want to do at least something related in those fields, I've spent a lot of time making my 4 year plan.

[CS and Math majors, DCC, premed, CS honors program](https://i.redd.it/8lr1acp3tg331.png)

I've checked the course requirements for geneds, cs, math, and premed multiple times and I think that I've covered everything.

Fortunately I've come in with a lot of AP credit, so a lot of geneds are knocked out. I plan to CBE out of MATH 240 and 241 and to get at least a B in CMSC 250 to pass out of MATH 310. In the future I'm planning clinical research internships and shadowing physicians. I'm also planning to teach myself machine learning and AI in the future to save some space since I know there's great resources online. And I'm planning on being involved in a handful of clubs so that I can actually have a social life.

I would appreciate anyone who could answer my questions below. I am aware that I have plenty of time to make this plan and that my life may take me a different direction, but I'm choosing to be a lot more focused than I was in high school. I'm not assuming that I will be able to achieve my goals perfectly but I'm going to give this my all.

1. Is this plan possible? Am I being too ambitious? If anything this is the most important question I have.
2. Is 17 credits too many for a freshman? I don't want to get run over by college right away.
3. I've heard that it's not a good idea to take 2 math and cs courses at the same time. Is there a way I could restructure my schedule to avoid this? I'd be open to taking a few more summer classes.
4. Which semesters would be the best to overload credits? I'm thinking of adding SOCY 100 to prepare for the MCAT and maybe 1 or 2 more humanities/social studies electives.
5. I'll figure out what 4XX math/cs classes to take later, but are there any that are a must-take or must-avoid? I'm considering CMSC 433 or 402 if it's even offered anymore.
6. What if I don't get into a class that I need according to my plan? I'm ok with taking courses out of sequence but would like to take all of them eventually.

Any other tips for a rookie freshman like me would be highly appreciated!"

(You get indirect entry at UBC but for simplicity's sake lets say I get CS at UBC in the second year)

So at UBC, the profs teach you and at Maryland, you have a lecturer to teach you. In that sense. I feel that I could create a better connection with the profs and have a better chance at getting good LORs.

At maryland, I got into the FIRE program which is basically first year research and can be done in any stream you like and I know that research is really important for grad school. But I cant do research until the completion of my second year at UBC.

At UBC I can get better internships and job opportunities than at UMD but Idk if internships really count for your grad school application.

I want to do grad school in the US so I feel that Maryland will be a better option but I feel like I'll be happier at UBC because I know a lot of people going there and have connected with them and the UBC campus is insane whereas UMD campus isn't that great compared to UBC (I'm an international student). At Maryland, I feel like I might have a hard time fitting in.

Keeping this in mind what would you suggest I do or what would you have done in my position ? 

Ps - I plan on doing grad school right after undergrad."

I did many paid internship related software, attended many hackathon as leader (initiated all alone) but never won any which I am so frustrated about and even after all this deep inside I feel like I have never accomplished anything. I see many people doing complex stuff, getting internship in great companies and building project which are so cool that even with my knowledge I fail to understand it. Seeing this I realized that maybe I am not in right place from start. Besides then whenever I browse youtube and whenever I see any video worth seeing related my field, I keep on adding it to Watch later and today I realized that it is around 200+ videos.  


I always think that there is no time left and I keep on delaying stuff, I don't know how to change myself so that I can actually prioritize stuff, I can see my whole life getting wasted in front of my own eyes knowing that I am not doing things which needs to be done for my own good. I don't know how to keep it in words but why I don't feel like doing stuff. Whenever I think of starting something new, I remind myself that you have no time left and to remove this sadness I start playing or watch some random shit.

I recently started an internship at a NASA center. I was very excited to come work here for the summer until I learned that I was working with NASA contractors far away from the main buildings on site. I work in a small building with some contractors and blue collar workers. NASA owns the building and only a select few offices were given to the contractors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I currently have no work and the room they put me in is a computer server room, and it is very, very loud in here. The computers are always making this loud ass beeping noise and I can't focus on anything. I barely can type out this post. I have a nice pair of Bose headphones (The QC35-II) and I can still hear the damn computer unless I have my headphones at 100% volume. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked to be moved, but because of ""Reasons"" they can't move me anywhere else. Even though they're plenty of desks in other rooms in the building, the contractors weren't assigned these rooms and so I can't even go in there and ask to sit at that desk? I don't report to anyone here, that's just what the co worker who has been helping me out told me.  What irritates me the most is that there is a conference room that no one uses that is very quiet and last friday, when almost no one was here, I just moved my computer over and sat in there and worked in peace for the day, but when I asked if I could work there full time, my co worker said no. I kinda think that it's bull that they can't move me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My co worker did say that the program lead sometimes comes to our building and uses the office that I am in, and hates the noise too. He said that they could be interested in buying a soundproof box, but the main noisy computer has some odd dimensions. It's LxWxH are given as 25""x8""\*15.5 (measured with my iPhone) 

&amp;#x200B;

I am asking you all, what would be the best solution for this noise problem? Should I keep asking around and see if I can get moved to a new, quieter desk? I person who is technically my manager may have some say and may be able to help me move desks, but honestly, the hierarchy is so confusing here and I actually don't know if this guy is my manager and even has a say in moving me. Should I try and convince the contractors to buy a sound proof box? Do they even make sound proof boxes of those dimensions? I was looking online at various sites but couldn't find full sound enclosures that fit those dimensions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could you all please help me out before the sound drives me crazy?????? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all in advance"

I'm a computer science major but thought this was a good way to get my foot in the door since I would like to work here in the future. I want to make a difference while I'm here. 

&amp;#x200B;

They have a system in place where if someone has a problem, they call the national help desk and if they cant fix it, the ticket gets assigned to us. We will then either go onsite or remote in to fix the problem. On Wednesdays, we have a program where people can come in and show their problem to us and we will log it into our own system that transfers data to an access database. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I have used Microsoft PowerBI to visualize that data in the access database and provide a nice dashboard to the managers. I want to do more. I was thinking I can develop a chatbot that people can use to chat with the support team on Wednesdays instead of coming into our room. I know I could use applications like Slack for this, but since it's a government office, it takes a long time for third party apps to get approved. Plus, it would look better on my part if I developed it.

&amp;#x200B;

But the reason I came here is to ask, what do IT departments need to be more efficient. Is it a certain app, a program, a chatbot...?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."

Due to a few health issues, I'm dealing with, I'm looking to do mostly remote work. I'm looking for websites and services in which employers can look at resumes and hire people, either as freelancers or employees. I believe small businesses use the site ""Up work"" in order to hire programmers. Are there any websites, software, or tips you guys could give me to help out? I know that a small business owner is going to be very skeptical hiring a college kid who hasn't graduated yet, but I'm working on side projects, getting references, internships and more at the moment so leave the resume/ getting experience to me. I mostly just need help finding platforms in which I can get some work in the industry even if it is with a small company.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S:

I'm already on LinkedIn, Facebook, and all the other basic networking platforms. The reason I ask is because some websites actually pay through their platform. Other websites actually give you coding challenges and give you a score in which employers can review how well you did and see your methods for solving the problem. I was looking more towards those sites and services."

byz43i,1,2019-06-10,Did I lose the job I haven't even begun yet for asking a harmless question?,cxyas,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/byz43i/did_i_lose_the_job_i_havent_even_begun_yet_for/,"I try to make it as short as possible.

Situation: I applied for an internship in Asia and signed a contract. Will work there for 4 Months. All the administrative tasks were delegated from the CEO to his assistant. I asked the CEO several times for a starting date, he didn't give me an answer and suggested to ask his assistant. His assistant wasn't acting aswell, so I suggested the 15th of this Month as day to start. The thing is: It is a Saturday, where I normally would work for 4 hours. Another thing is there is a big celebration of my girlfriend's family which I wanted to attend. 

So I asked my boss if we could move the start of the internship to the 17th. A Monday. Thought it was a harmless question, especially considering that he currently already has an intern. Earlier he told me that he just wanted me to start a bit earlier before the current intern leaves, so he could introduce me to everything. 

Again I thought asking this would do no harm. In the worst case, he would say no. That's it, right?

Well, he said no and I accepted and told him I understand. But he started a big drama. Telling me that my girlfriend is influencing me too much and got really personal. I told him no need to worry. But he insisted that I don't take this job seriously and that he will see me fail? WTF? 

The thing is I am a bit dependent on this guy now. I took a long flight and spent money on it. And went to the trouble to apply for a visa. 

Normally, I would move on and run away from him as far as possible, seeing that he has some issues and doesn't know how to treat employees (I already despise working from him although I didn't start yet).

But my GF is here and I want to see here, since that is the only chance for us. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing I texted him was: ""How can I assure you that I won't neglect my work and take it seriously?"" 

He didn't bother replying and is ghosting me now for 1 day already.

\&gt;Any advice? :/"

I have enough experience to attract employers but not enough experience to get more than the occasional phone interview which always ends early as they have already decided to throw my application into the trash and move onto their next person. Do you think the phone interview end after a few minutes because of what I said or my experience or is it something on their end? I know how to troubleshoot technology problems better than the average person but not as good as a it professional. I think if people got to know me better and giving me a chance instead of just looking at my resume and figuring out that I might have a disability and rejecting me because they don't know what I am capable of doing with my disability I might have a better chance of getting hired.

There are some opportunities to help on the customer support side for their software - which would deal with HTML+CSS+JavaScript. I am no longer interested and lost passion for being in IT Support and trying to leverage my new degree and possibly pick up a programming language to add on to my resume along with my 3 years of experience in IT Support.

I am looking to get into programming of sorts. I see some of the people I know dabbling in programming and ask myself why I didn’t learn or even try this stuff earlier. I started to look in to Web Dev stuff but then starting really looking at Python. I am kind of set on learning Python… but don’t want it to just boost me in a role that is still doing IT Support but at a higher level.

So my newb question, can someone learn enough Python to be employable in say 3-4 months, or would it be better to go with web development. I enjoy both, and will likely continue to enjoy both but am leaning towards python but I do not want to use Python to funnel myself back into staying in IT Support. I looked in to Sys Admin type roles - but I really don’t enjoy the whole networking and server side of things. I started to look at python and see that python can definitely be applied in IT Support for automation and stuff like that - but like I said before, I am kind of trying to get out of the IT Support type roles. I was looking at picking up web dev skills to maybe get into Application / Software Support Engineer type roles.

Everyone is respectful, supportive, intelligent, and easy to get along with. The reason I left my old company is because there was not only a toxic culture in general, but a beehive of nasty busybody bullies, 1 woman in particular. She was horrible - constantly spreading rumors about people, making other people do her work, throwing random tantrums in the office, talking/screaming over people to get her way - basically Mean Girl stuff, but 40 years old. She also got into a fist fight with her husband in the lobby. All of this was enough to make me quit, as well as a bunch of other people. Seriously, I know of 4 people who cited her as one of their reasons for leaving.

Well, now she is applying to my current company after being fired from the old one. I was absolutely horrified.

Apparently, she has framed it as being laid off (a total lie - she was fired for cussing out an intern, on top of all the other awful shit she did). Her first impression tends to be pretty good because she's very smiley and articulate and seems easy-going. She just finished her first interview.

Is it ANY Of my business to let my company know what a psycho she is? Or is it above me now?

I am seriously considering looking into other jobs if she gets hired - that's how horrible she is. I am afraid if I speak up, it will make me look bad. If hired, she would be working in my department, in the same area of the office. Should I say anything?"

Just for a bit of background I graduated with Computer Science about 4 and a half months ago.

I recently had a hacker rank screening for an interview and I solved 2/4 programming questions correct, and attempted 3/4 with a sort of partial solution. After the exam, it asks you for feedback and rating (I thought this was for hacker rank's interest only?) and I wrote a comment that said ""too difficult"". I was mostly messing around assuming recruiter wouldn't see it. But I got an email from the recruiter that based on how I did AND based on my feedback on the exam, they don't think the full time position is right for me. I thought 2/4 medium level questions was pretty decent.

TL:DR; But they say that they are still interested in me doing an internship which can lead to a full time position in the fall. I was looking for some advice on if this may be worth it?

I initially didn’t apply to out of state schools because the UW was my dream but now I know I have no choice. So I was wondering which schools to transfer too with these stats and what schools your recommend  for CS. Thanks

Grades:

Calc 1 : 3.0

Calc 2 : 4.0

Calc 3 : 4.0

Computer Programming 1 : 4.0

Computer Programming 2 : 4.0

Linear / Matrix Algebra : 4.0 (taking fall 2019)

General Chemistry 1 : 3.8

Maybe: Physics Mechanics : 3.7+ (heard UW makes this course hella hard, taking fall 2019)

(Almost all Other classes 4.0)

ECs:

UW Indian Student Association

UW Punjabi Student Association

UW Dubhacks (programming competitions)

UW HuskyTech (programming, projects)

UW DubsTech (programming, CS stuff)

Ill try to do more non CS clubs if that helps

Machine Learning Research through UW with PhD Students

Computer Science Education Director (My uncle is starting a school and I am creating the curriculum and pretty much everything for the computer science classes) (we aim to teach younger kids, from k-12 about CS, and I will be teaching there) (opening end of the summer)

Public Library Virtual Reality ""Intern"".

Also volunteer at various places including: (the YMCA, Temples, Tutoring kids, and other small stuff)


Thats about it, I was wondering what universities I could get into and which ones you guys reccomend for CS. 

Thank You So Much."
bz38sv,0,2019-06-10,Just got a CIS degree and burnt our in IT Support. Looking to learn programming to boost my career and change. Python or Web Dev?,VapesfromBible,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bz38sv/just_got_a_cis_degree_and_burnt_our_in_it_support/,"\*Python or Web Development quicker to learn to boost a career out of IT/Help Desk Support

I am starting to look at my career outlook after graduating college with a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems. Currently in IT Support and not loving it anymore. As the old adage goes, do what you love and love what you do no longer applies. I spent my college career going through multiple internships and gaining valuable experience - these were all Help Desk support type roles. I just graduated and accepted a good job with a great company, but I am starting to see myself just getting into the burnt out Help Desk customer support mode again. There are some opportunities to help on the customer support side for their software - which would deal with HTML+CSS+JavaScript. I am no longer interested and lost passion for being in IT Support and trying to leverage my new degree and possibly pick up a programming language to add on to my resume along with my 3 years of experience in IT Support.

I am looking to get into programming of sorts. I see some of the people I know dabbling in programming and ask myself why I didn’t learn or even try this stuff earlier. I started to look in to Web Dev stuff but then starting really looking at Python. I am kind of set on learning Python… but don’t want it to just boost me in a role that is still doing IT Support but at a higher level.

So my newb question, can someone learn enough Python to be employable in say 3-4 months, or would it be better to go with web development. I enjoy both, and will likely continue to enjoy both but am leaning towards python but I do not want to use Python to funnel myself back into staying in IT Support. I looked in to Sys Admin type roles - but I really don’t enjoy the whole networking and server side of things. I started to look at python and see that python can definitely be applied in IT Support for automation and stuff like that - but like I said before, I am kind of trying to get out of the IT Support type roles. I was looking at picking up web dev skills to maybe get into Application / Software Support Engineer type roles.

Can anyone offer me some guidance? Thanks."

Now, if you don't know what that means, it means that I wish to work in autopsies, more specifically the deaths that occurred under mysterious circumstances, being those accidents, suicides and homicides. 

Although I feel like this has always been my call, my weary contribution to the world, I needed to ensure I wasn't putting myself in something I wouldn't be able to endure. So, on summer break I decided to apply for a voluntary internship in the local forensic institute. I can already tell you that since the first day I realized that it definitely was what I wished to do my whole life, and I was loving every single day of that internship.

Every day I had to ride the train for like an hour to arrive at the institute. It was the 4th day of my staying and we had a lot of corpses to deal with. In the room there was 5 autopsy tables, so more than one autopsy could be performed at the same time.

I was with my hands deep dived in one corpse when the other team pulls the next one to the table and call me to check the case. It was a young man, in his 30´s, that had hung himself. Now, during that week we got a solid number of suicides by hanging and, since it was the summer, most of the corpses were in their pajamas or light clothing. This one guy looked like he dressed himself up before hanging. He was wearing a black shirt, some denim grey pants and a pair of black shoes. It's important to tell you too that he had black hair and a middle eastern like complexion.

I looked at him, checked the rope scar that the assistant pointed out for me to see, and left to continue helping in the autopsy I was at first.

The day ended, and I was riding the train home. It was peak time, so a lot of people were riding the train home after work. I arrive at my stop and an avalanche of people leaves the train. I'm walking slowly, tired, in the same direction as everyone when I notice something... In the middle of that one direction flow of people, there was one person standing in the crowd, facing my way, staring in my direction. I noticed he looked a lot like the suicide case corpse I saw earlier that day. It was a guy in his 30's, black short hair, middle eastern like complexion, wearing a black shirt and grey denim pants.

I stood there for what felt like a whole minute, staring at him, trying to put together what I was seeing. The crowd kept passing through him without noticing him, like he wasn't there. I was feeling my whole skin getting goosebumps as I looked at him.

He then just turned around, walked a few steps and vanished in the middle of the crowd."
bz4o8i,1,2019-06-10,"(US, NY) Offer of Summer Internship Rescinded",AThrowawayADay42,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bz4o8i/us_ny_offer_of_summer_internship_rescinded/," 

Context: in 2016, a bank closed all my accounts with them, with no notice. I had a credit card, a checking/savings account, and an LLC. They would not disclose why and I did not have a legal case to have this expunged as the bank can close my account for any reason (as dictated in the contract). I accepted the 100 point drop in my credit score as my lumps, opened up the same accounts with no problem at another institution. They are still operating currently.

Since, I started another LLC and required federal and state licensing - this required very stringent background checks. I then also got Global Entry, TSA Pre-Check, attained a firearms ID, concealed carry license, and passed two employment background checks.

I am now an MBA at a top program, and accepted a summer internship at the bank that ended all relations with me in 2016. This was a dream job for me. I accepted the offer in writing on 1/24/2019, to start on 6/10/2019. On 5/1/2019 they called me to ask why my personal accounts were closed. I disclosed what I knew (nothing), and they followed up on the 10th of May asking about the LLC account. I faced the same issue there.

During this time it was impossible to reach my case advisor. On 5/25/2019 they called to say my case hadn’t been updated and I needed to follow up on my case. I did. I was then told judgment will be rendered in 48 hours. I was called on 5/28 and told that my offer was rescinded without chance to appeal due to those accounts.

I get a call five days ago telling me that “the accounts were closed due to patterns of behavior that, while not illegal, the bank was uncomfortable with” and no chance to appeal. They said it was company policy to not hire people with this flag on them. I was never told about this in the four months leading up to the case.

This now puts me in a position where I cannot find suitable summer internship employment. Not only does this cause me significant financial harm in the short term, but in the long term it massively impacts my potential for finding jobs.

Given I turned down other more lucrative offers for this position and was never asked about my banking history with the company, I had no way to know this would be a potential issue.

I am in an at-will employment state, but what I want to know is in an instance like this - where there *are* no other viable options for employment in the short term as a summer intern and I can demonstrate massive lost income potential, is there any case to be made?

On top of this, aside from financially, it’s a huge embarrassment because immediately when I share this everyone thinks I committed some criminal act - I’ve never even gotten a ticket for speeding.

This causes me significant personal financial harm, but I cannot argue it from a pure employment contract position. Is it possible that since the structure of internships and business school recruiting (i.e. they are aware that if I accept an offer I can no longer engage in recruiting or field offers from institutions) is known to this company, that I have some sort of case? Is Promisory Estoppel a potential route? If so how could I argue this?

This puts me in a rough bind. Thank you all for your time in reading this."
bz4orv,7,2019-06-10,"Stay at UC Santa Cruz ($32k/year) or transfer to USC ($77k/year, no aid)?",EarlyAnteater,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bz4orv/stay_at_uc_santa_cruz_32kyear_or_transfer_to_usc/,"I'm a first-year CS major at UC Santa Cruz. I love the campus here and I've made some great friends. However, in UCSC CS there's major issues with overcrowding (it's damn near impossible to get the classes you need to graduate on time in CS, and there's a BAD housing crisis) and I feel like I don't have access to the best resources/education  I could. Also, my dad works in tech and has warned me about how competitive jobs will screen me out for being from UCSC.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had high-paying software engineering internships, and am fully aware that there are many good and high-paying jobs in tech that do not require a prestigious school, but I want to work at these top tier unicorns and places like SpaceX that I know care a lot about prestige.

&amp;#x200B;

I was fortunate to be admitted into USC, however, with no aid. My parents make $160k combined (base, before taxes), and I make about $20k/year before taxes in a VERY high COL area---so middle class. I do not want to take out loans, and am aware my parents will pay a lot to help me afford USC, but I don't want to cause them financial hardship.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my main pros and cons:

**Pros of transferring to USC**

* Better ""prestige"" for jobs
* More smart/competitive students I can learn from
* Better connections
* They have the best club in the nation for an extracurricular I'm interested in
* Easier to find housing
* Bougie af

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons of transferring to USC:**

* 77k/year, will cost about $160k more in total to attend (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
* They won't tell me how many of my classes transfer but it's not looking good -- like 3.5 years to graduate
* Probably won't be able to participate in music because it's a top music school and I'm mediocre (but music makes me happy)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of Staying at UC Santa Cruz**

* Affordable (32k/year). I can pay my tuition and have $$ to travel left over
* Graduate in 2.5-3 years with a B.A. in Computer Science and a Music minor
* From work experience in my field, I have industry connections and interview experience so I'm not super worried about getting a job (again, it's just the top jobs like SpaceX I'm worried about)
* Here, I've been able to teach people the skills I know (I've helped teach people robotics as a club lead, helped people with resumes for applying to internships). At USC, I feel everyone might be super smart and know everything so I won't have as big of an impact.
* I am happy here (trees/walking around helps me have good mental health and I can stay with my friends here)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons of staying at UC Santa Cruz**

* Might not be able to work at some top companies due to UC Smokes Cannabis reputation
* May not accomplish as much due to highly limited resources for engineering
* Overcrowding -- I can't get any of my damn classes and I have no idea where I'm living next year (current plans are to live on friends' floor, it's bad)
* This school is honestly a fucking mess and I learn next to nothing from my classes (not sure if transferring will fix this tho)
* My gut says to just stay at UCSC, but it might be just because I'm comfortable here and afraid of transferring, not because it's actually the right choice

&amp;#x200B;

What do y'all think? I have to make my choice by Wednesday and it's the middle of finals week so I don't trust my brain to make a good decision lmaooo. Thanks for reading and any advice is appreciated!

bz5lpj,1,2019-06-10,Idea being stolen at work,Ydarg000,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bz5lpj/idea_being_stolen_at_work/,"So I am a temp in an office and around April one of my bosses started looking into new project management tools. After receiving an email showcasing a possible option, I replied with some feedback and offered an additional option called Monday.com. I very distinctly clarified that I knew it might not be what they’re looking for but hoped it at least showed some features that would help narrow their search in what are “must haves” and things to avoid. No response back. 

Flash forward to May- We have a very big “town meeting” (all departments together) where the boss of my boss directly asks “If you guys have suggestions on how to stay more organized, manage, and track our work/projects. Let us know” 

I directly email his Number 2 (different person than my boss) and again reference Monday.com and provide several links to its features and uses. Quick reply that she (#2) would look over it. The next day she approaches me and says thank you for the suggestion but she decided to go with her own program she found because hers is more “robust”. Okay sure fine. (Why ask in a large meeting for suggestions if you’re going with your own? But I digress) 

Fast forward to today! -
I saw an intern from a different department using Monday.com. Needless to say I was surprised. The intern started less than a month ago and she explained that her whole department had been using it since she got there. That they had been using it for about a month. 

I felt jealous because I had really wanted to use and learn that program. It would look nice on a resume to be familiar with a project management tool. But even more it would a personal victory to get some credit for having a good idea! I do actually like my job and I hope they hire me full time....but I feel like I’ve been ignored and at worst been poached of my idea that could have scored me some points. 

How do I handle this? Do I just let it go? Wait and see what happens? Investigate? Do I confront someone? Do I go to hr? What do I make of all this? I’m pretty young (early 20s) and still a temp. I’m don’t have any experience in office politics, never been my style and i don’t want to shoot myself in the foot."

2 semesters of research at my undergraduate institution
1 summer REU at UW-Madison
1 year internship at an environmental lab company.
2 years working as a chemistry supplemental instruction leader (kinda like a tutor/TA combo if you're unfamiliar with that)

UW-Madison
MIT
University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
University of British Columbia 
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
University of Minnesota
University of Washington
Georgia Tech

I know MIT is a major reach but would Illinois/Michigan/UW-Madison be reaches too? I'm mainly worried because I only have 1 year (spring + summer + fall) of research experience. I expect my letters of rec to be good but I don't really understand what constitutes a ""very strong"" letter of rec. Should I try to apply to more lower ranked schools? It's difficult to find PI's doing research that I really love because I want to do computational physical organic but it is very specific and rare (if anyone has suggestions for PI's doing this kind of research please let me know lol). I've mainly been choosing schools that have one person doing something I find super interesting and at least 2 others doing research I could tolerate. I also don't want to apply to too many schools because unfortunately this sh*t is not free. Bonus question: should I take the chemistry GRE? I keep going back and forth on that decision because it also costs money :/.

I have successfully got on to a Summer Internship. The Internship can be done at the University or remotely.

I have not booked accomodation yet and am swaying back and forth between staying or coming home and getting a car. I have to confirm my apartment this week.

My initial plan was to stay in my university town for one month - but following my exam and having to come home out of boredom and loneliness, perhaps that is a bad idea?

I only have one acquaintance there who I see once a week. All support and clubs would be ending. So the setup would be me living alone, not seeing anyone and going in and out of work.

The University is very quiet during summer.

I am really struggling to make this decision. My main thing keeping me from going home, is the idea of being needed/looking bad and possibly feeling too much tension with my parents/sister.

There is also the worry there that I might not get a job and be stuck in my family home for a few months.. so perhaps this is my last chance to live independently for a while? 

I was thinking of spending the weekends in London to spice the boredom up. (I don’t really like my University town.. it is quite insular and backward.)

Main concern at home, is lack of mobility and family tension. But then very, very isolated at University with little going on. 

But ultimately I have no idea what to do. And I need help! Feeling forced into making this decision.

Stomach says home but don’t want to restrict myself. Want to be able to get away from family tension.

What would you do?"

Unfortunately for me, I had never heard of Github until coming across Reddit looking for answers about a year ago. No one in my classes had even mentioned it. At that point, I made an account but was very hesitant to start anything because of my situation. I had given up, stepped back up, and given up again. Soon after my graduation, I’d moved in with my mom to look for jobs but was only able to get one at CFA but several months after graduating she moved out of state into a rural place. I felt the urge to stay and learn to pay my own bills. The whole last year has been chaotic. I’m willing to sacrifice some of my little personal time.

I have an offer call with the recruiter- is the pay negotiable and do they use Cultural Vistas for J1?
bz8ufh,1,2019-06-11,Choose the top ten school rather than the scholarship school!!,ricottanose,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bz8ufh/choose_the_top_ten_school_rather_than_the/,"A lot of you on this subreddit will eventually have to decide something along these lines: Should I go to a lower ranked college with significant costs covered, or a top ten school that would put you in possibly hundreds of thousands in debt? Most people will claim that the brand name of a school doesn’t matter, and that you should choose the option that will cost you the least student debt. 

And I did just that. I turned down \~$150k in debt at a top ten uni (think UChicago, Yale, Duke) to go to a 50’s\~60’s tier university on a full ride and not paying a cent for tuition, housing, food, and travel abroad. I would advise that everyone presented with the choice do just the opposite. Why?

**BAD NETWORK**

The lower your school is ranked, generally, the more localized your network will be. People I’ve met from the Ivies and other top schools have networks anywhere: Shanghai, NYC, Dubai. Anywhere they go, they will have friends there to crash with. As for me, most of my friends have stayed in the city because the name value of the school drops considerably out of state. Think a Columbus, Ohio or a Charlotte, NC. The school might have pull in that region or even state, but ask around and see how people outside the area regard it. This is especially important with competitive recruiting. 

That’s not to say that there won’t be some strong players at any school. I networked my way to one of the most prominent finance firms. I’m just saying that your chances of having great connections will be significantly higher the better your school is. 

It’s also worth mentioning that at the top schools like Stanford, companies will actually fund student groups, vying for their attention to scout new hires. This was nonexistent at my school.

**BAD PERSONAL REPUTATION**

A lot of people say, “Your school doesn’t matter at all after your first job,” and “Don’t live to impress others,” among other platitudes. Newsflash, from an evolutionary perspective, your entire purpose of existence is to compete with others and to signal your social status. If your ancestors didn’t do the same, you wouldn’t be here. People are hardwired to find ways to rank each other. It’s one thing to step out of the game deliberately, but another to say it doesn’t exist. 

When you say, “I went to Princeton,” or “I went to UChicago,” people WILL regard you differently off the bat. That’s not to say that your relationships should be based on shallow one-liners on your resume, but I’m saying that where you went to school will make a big difference in how people gauge your potential as a date or in a job role. When someone knows nothing about you, they cleave to “sound bites” like this to judge you. This isn’t the truth I want, but it’s the way it is. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

*HOWEVER— I think it’s most fair to balance these points with the good.*

**EASY TO STAND OUT**

Going to a lower tier school DOES make it easier to stand out among your peers when you try to find new opportunities. That can be an internship in the area, standing out to your prof or school administration, and getting in-house research positions. If other students don’t try, don’t show up to class, or aren’t standouts, you’ll have a better chance. I’ve personally experienced this myself. I recognize that it would’ve been harder to get the positions I did at a better school because it would’ve been more difficult to work harder and differentiate myself from my peers. 

**NO DEBT**

Some people pay $300+ every single month for DECADES before they pay off all their debt. Thinking about it in monthly terms really brings into perspective the sheer onus of having that kind of financial strain. 

**THE SOLUTION**

Is, of course, to be born to wealthy parents so that you can go to any school you want to without the crushing student debts. Just work hard in school and let merit take you where you want! Too bad the world isn’t that fair. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."

First, a little background about myself: I'm a high school junior who is interning at a computational biology lab in about 3 months.

My mentor, a professor and researcher, has invited me to go out to brunch with him and possibly one of this lab members in a few days. He wants to discuss with me about my interests and some ideas I have for a research project I could work on during my internship.

Unfortunately, I've never went out to eat with a group of people besides my close friends or family. Once, I was forced to go to dinner with some people from a sports team at school and I was extremely uncomfortable and quiet.

I'm especially anxious because of the age gap, and I see this as a hindrance to any meaningful or long conversations (as I do not know how to converse with older people). I'm afraid it will be just him talking the entire time. My interests in terms of research are pretty straightforward, and being just a high school student, I don't know how I can talk about this subject for an extended period of time.

The advice of asking questions and listening to people talk about themselves is not really applicable here, because I feel like I should be doing the bulk of the talking, as this is my internship. (IMO).

What are some talking points, ideas, skills, or mindsets I should keep in mind during this brunch? Any help would be appreciated."

I'm planning to pursue a masters degree in the US. I need internships to increase my chance of getting accepted into a university, especially since I am an international aspirant.I am doing online courses on ML and trying to figure out project ideas for the same. I am not qualified enough for most of the ML/AI internships (they require a lot of experience). There are tons of internships in web and app development and I am at a fix. The languages for web and app development are totally different. Should I start learning android and other courses from scratch just so I can increase my chance at an internship? or should I stick on to learning and developing projects in ML (which may or may not land me in an internship). These programming languages know: c, c++,java,python.  


I don't know which one I should focus on. And I am afraid if i try to focus on too many things at once, I'll end up half-assing everything and remain a jack of all trades.

I choose CS as my profession because that's what I always loved to do but honestly I'm office-sick. Remote wouldn't be any better I guess, I would just get lonelier. 

Now that the weather is finally good here, I spent a lot of time outside on the weekend and so many memories came back from my childhood when I spent whole days outside just biking, fishing with my father, doing random stuff and I felt alive. 

And what now? When I get home I'm too tired to do anything. In the weekends I'm busy doing the things that I couldn't do in the weekdays, like cooking, cleaning, studying, meeting friends, and then I'm happy to get a decent sleep. I'm still expected to spend many hours of my free time coding to improve my skills and move forwards in my career. I'm so sick of it. I don't even get enough days off in a year to get a decent vacation, because I'm too young yet. 21 days a year, and at least 15 of them is spent for administration stuff and going to doctors for a checkout in the worst possible time, etc. 

I don't think it's a good idea to change to another field because coding is probably the only thing I'm good at, and I have no idea what I could do anyway. I just don't know how to accept being an office-worm for the rest of my life, really.

Edit: 
the thread blew up and I don't think I can reply to everyone so just to clarify some things. 
I'm not from the US. Yes I heard devs make good money in the US, they make good money here too but not that good. For example, right now I'm living in a students dorm but I plan to move out in the next 1-3 months. A 1room apartment in my city costs 2/3 of my monthly salary, a 2room apartment with a stranger is at least 1/3 of my salary. I'm on a diet and I try to eat healthy, I don't eat a lot but 1/3 of my salary goes to food. Healthy stuff have extreme prices there. So there is really not much I can spare to retire early. My company raises 3% average in a year of salary. And if you think they pay shitty, while it's not the best, most of them are even worse from what I've seen and heard.

So as you can guess I'm coding in my free time to find a way to 1. get a passive income too, 2. have more and better skills to find a better job one day that pays enough to actually have some savings too..

I still don't have my degree, still studying, it's difficult to sell myself to companies without it. Some companies don't give a fuck about degree, while others won't even read your CV without it.
And no I'm not an intern, I'm a full time junior dev for quite a while now."

I am currently a student veteran from the US with one year left before I receive my degree in Accounting. I am single, 24 years old, and I have a 2yo Corgi. After spending much of the last year traveling, I want more. I love the States, and I am damn proud to be an American, but with family in Europe and my love for the places I have been, I wish to move overseas after graduation. I have the opportunity to work in Spain or Greece in a non-Accounting job, but I would like to stick to the business field.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what countries might be best to work in? How is a US accounting degree seen in Europe? I speak fluent English and proficient Spanish, but my Greek is trash (not that their economic situation makes it a particularly desirable country to move to for work).

I actually turned down a B4 firm, and I accepted with a mid-tier (but large international) firm for a summer internship, and will most likely receive a job offer in the next few weeks. I just don’t want to stay in the States right now.

The countries I am most interested in are England, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and France, but I am open to just about anything. I just need my dog with me.

I also have plenty of my GI Bill left, and I would be open to continuing my education with a Master’s degree from an English-speaking European Institution. This is a strong consideration of mine, as I feel it might open more doors in Europe for me as well. Is this accurate?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!"

I'm a web/software developer from Europe with 4 years experience almost entirely in C#. For the last 5 years I traveled a lot and got working experience (internships and regular jobs) in China, Canada and Taiwan (different companies).

For the past two years I've tried to learn embedded programming at home but 2 years ago was also the time I met my wife and since then I find it muuuuch harder to find free time than when I was single.

Now I'm coming back to my home country (France) and my idea is to send applications to companies **as an intern** embedded developer because honestly I really don't have enough knowledge to pretend applying for a junior position.

My graduate schoolmates tell me it's a bit dumb after 4 years experience I go back to an intern position. But I think not and I want to maximize my chances to be taken in the embedded world.

My knowledge is very limited, I've learnt a bit of C/C++ long time go but I basically forgot everything. 
At home I've learnt the basics of the ARM microcontrollers architecture and using the ARM GCC toolchain.
I tried to debug my nRF51 DK from its SWD interface using BMP and also OpenOCD but without success (I think I actually burnt the SWD interface by mistake) and I'm learning a bit the Zephyr RTOS but in terms of code I stopped at blinking an LED because so far I was focused on the debugging part.

That's pretty much it. Now I really want to work in the field, it's taking too long at home and I get bored doing the same things in C# over and over.

So do you also think going back to an intern position is stupid? Or do you think it's a good idea?

I just want to get a foot in the embedded world for maybe 4 months or so. Hopefully after I get the basis knowledge I could stay in the same company or find another one as a junior embedded developer.

Thanks for your answers"

Its time they are critiqued equally as men.,BaidDSB,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bzaor9/women_arent_pure_and_innocent_goddess_its_time/,"I'm a single child and I'm an introvert. And my hobbies except gaming are mostly things I do alone. So I have always been a bit awkward around people. Never had much friends etc.

So anyway. First year in college was hard. Ragging and stuffs.Management is ignorant as is the norm in this country. 

So this girl from my year once texted me on FB to ask for songs.Never before a girl msgd me so it was exciting.We talked a bit, i found her taste in music and anime very much like mine so we hit it off.  this went on for about 45 days.
She suddenly proposed me to be her bf.I was flabbergasted.I liked her too but it wasn't even close to be in a relationship.
But I accepted.The greatest mistake of my life.


Anyway I made a gf without much friends.Few months after that, she started for hugs and kisses. I wasn't  ready at all but didn't want to lose her so I went along.That increased to more physical stuffs but I put a check
Thing about girls throwing themselves at you is that you kinda want to enjoy a bit too.
8 months after she proposed, things started to break apart.Fights cries blaming etc.I thought it was my fault so I wanted to hold on.16 months in, we broke up.


Now within 1 month she was in a relationship with one of my better friends.Naturally I was devastated.Depression ensured.Took meds and stuff.Since then I realized my friends are avoiding me.Didn't know why.

One day me and his new guy had a big fight in college because he was trying to insult me in front of everyone else in teh canteen and i had enough.
Later that evening She sent me an email saying that if I do anything about this she's gonna go to the police about how I forced her to be physical.
I still keep that email as evidence.


For over 2 years I spent alone in college.No one talked to me. Lost all my good friends. Those who did were asked why they spoke to me (learned this from a good friend who wasn't a part of the big group and helped me with my problems) much later...


Joined interneship. Determined to make things right with people.Wasn't easy but I made people saw I'm not a bad person.Suddenly my popularity skyrocketed. Everyone was cool with me and wanted me around. 

The shock isn't here yet. Wait.
Middle of internship. Those 2 broke up.People were turning against them before internship in final year because they aren't pleasant people [i dint even know because i was always alone for the whole 8 hours of college, everyday and im an ignorant fool]. And being great in computers I did official stuffs for college like some IDA stuffs for publicity etc. I gained a lot of friends because apparently if the management and the teachers like you, other people start doing too. Then I was told what happened.

My ex didn't even like me.When we first joined college, she liked him [her crush, the new ex].
But he was a very good looking guy and she wasn't. So he didn't pay much attention to her.
She was desperate for a relationship but no boy was falling for her tricks of physical signaling, constant texts and touching. I did without realizing [again, ignorant fool].
So she used me for physical pleasure.
And to make the guy jealous who was starting to like her.
Eventually he fell for her and she spit me out like bubble gum.
And then for 2 years she told all college people, Seniors and juniors too that I mistreated her and used her physically.I guess the final win was mine because I ended the most popular of the 3.Took me years to get out of depression.


I wrote this before too. But the few new posts about how women get affected, there's this other side of the coin too. Pseudo feminists and entitled women were running wild in yesterday's post. 

If men can be critiqued for just asking for an answer [a SIMPLE NO], women should be held accountable too, which sadly doesnt happen.

PS: I glossed over a lot of things, like my extreme family situation 2 years ago. So i had to deal 2 whammies at the same time. 

2018 was a hell of a year though. Cleared off my depression and regained confidence to forget my lost years. Im still thankful to my friends and my mom who helped me through this period."

APs: Comp sci 5; 4 or 5s for Physics 1 and Chem (self studied); I have no idea what I will get for Seminar; will be taking Calc BC, Research, and Physics 2 next year and probably self studying Physics C (maybe stats or psych)

Took honors math and lit freshman year, honors lit sophomore year (because I knew I would've done badly under the teacher for honors), and honors math junior year

ECs:

- NHD China 3rd place

- Passed Chinese calligraphy highest level examination, which I practiced for 8 years

- Will have 2 years of being secretary for an interest club that doesn't do a lot (ACG) and 1 year for another club that doesn't do much (Digital art)

- Will have been in environmental club of school for 4 years which contributes to an organization dedicated to fighting deforestation in Inner Mongolia, but I'm not an officer or major member so probably doesn't count for much

- Volunteered for a few events (TEDx and a charity concert from school), not very significant

- 2 summers at CTY (Comp sci and cognitive psychology)

- Internship upcoming summer in a tech company (to compensate for my incredible lack of STEM ECs lol)

- Will be on the school yearbook team for 2 years with one year as an editor (it's an elective at our school so idk if that counts???)

(basically, me shoving everything I did since freshman year on here)

Essays and recs: I don't have them yet bur assume average essays and above average rec letters.

Other stuff: self studied AP chem since couldn't take at school due to an incredibly dumb scheduling issue which kinda impacted my grades last semester since I couldn't pull myself together (stupid reason I know); might be Aspie according to therapist but don't have a diagnosis yet which could relate to my abysmal social skills

Don't really have a spike/hook :/

For schools, as long it's doing good academically especially in STEM subjects and not in the middle of nowhere I guess? I don't really have a lot of ideas rn"

We started with putting up 2 new DCs with winser 2019 and after everything is up running we would demote and decommission the 2 old DCs winser 2012 R2. We followed the Microsoft Guidelines and everything was running along happily.

&amp;#x200B;

When we demoted our old ''primary'' DC, weird errors happened, DNS test results failed and RDP errors occurred. So did you know there are actually 7 FSMO roles? **DNS Zone Master** and **Forest DNS Master**. I think it took 24-hours for the DCs to sync the roles because around the same time next day the problems stopped, but im not sure. ( some sync magic?)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Knowing this might be important when a DC is dead and you have to seize the Roles.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder why they are not well documented by Microsoft since they are quite important in my opinion. What are your experiences with demoting Domain Controllers?"

For my masters, I want to do a terminal masters degree which doesn't require me to write a thesis and I plan on doing my masters immediately after undergrad and want to do it in US. I like research but can honestly do without it because research isn't involved in my overall career goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

UMD 

\- I got into the Fire program which is first year research and innovation program. I will be conducting research with a mentor assigned by the university. Plus UMD is a well known research university so will have tonnes of research opportunities and get to know the profs better for good Letter of recommendations. 

\- I got into my major directly. 

\- I am an international student so it will be tough for me to find internships in maryland as mostly CS majors go to government contractors in Baltimore due to the proximity and the security clearance is to be a citizen or to hold a green card. People do go to Fb, twitter, amazon and other good companies as well but idk the scenario for international students much since UMD is a state school. 

&amp;#x200B;

UBC 

\- I got into the faculty of Science, so did not get CS directly. 

\- It is ranked better than UMD 

\- Located in Vancouver which I personally like and the campus is beautiful. Much better as compared to UMD 

\- After first year, you can do co-op terms which is kinda guaranteed once u get your major. So I will have better opportunities in terms of internships and better work experience. But I feel that since it is Canada the opportunities to work in the Big 4 might be limited. 

\- I get to do research only after first year (second year onwards) 

\- I know a lot of people going to UBC and because of the location and beautiful campus, feel like I will be happier here and would be easier for me to settle here. 

\- Since first year is general science and I will be completely focused on my academics because I'd want to get into CS, I feel like I might not have good opportunities lined up for me after first year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please do let me know how to decide between where I should go from a grad school perspective. Which would be a better choice to attend a T20 MS in CS program in the US."

Prospects for grad school,Insomniac_applicant,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/bzehlr/what_can_i_improve_on_prospects_for_grad_school/,"Hi all, first time poster. I’ve been a longtime lurker but I finally created a reddit account just to stay abreast of this subreddit. 

I suppose some key details about me
My undergraduate GPA is a 2.98 whilst majoring in Mathematics and Economics (Major GPA not any more impressive). I struggled with newfound freedom and some persistent health issues (due to my weak constitution) during my time in university, but I think I let it get the better of me and pushed me to complacency. 

My current GRE score from last September (2018) is 
Quantitative: 164/170 (84th percentile)
Verbal: 161/170 (91st percentile)
Writing 5.5/6 (97th percentile)

In an attempt to mitigate some of the undergraduate mistakes, I’ve recently taken (completed last month whilst juggling my new job) a 10-week certificate course in the top national University (in a South East Asian Country, where I am from) for Probability and Econometrics, with Modelling and scored a 95/100 (side note the certificate was issued by the top national university but the lessons were taught by the research arm of the university)

I’m aiming to take another two summer courses for certificates in a neighbouring country’s top National University in Quantitative Public Policy analysis.  Much like the aforementioned programme in my home country, this too shall be issued by the university but lessons are taught by professors from renowned global institutions like Sciences Po of France. 

For professional career, I was head of an Investment Fund of the University, in which I managed USD650,000 And was able to disburse more than USD15,000 in scholarship money from investment returns. I’ve interned in NYC for a credit ratings agency which handles complex securitised products. (High school internship was in an internationally acclaimed South East Asian micro finance institution that focused on empowering female entrepreneurs through micro-loans and education)

Upon graduation I moved back to my home country (2.5 years ago) I moved into a Big 4 consulting firm where I have provided consulting and financial advisory services to a slew of organisations and companies such as, but not limited to:
I. My country’s second largest e-learning platform
ii. Nation’s second largest caustic-related manufacturing plant
iii. Nation’s largest start-up
iv. Nation’s ministry of finance for subsidy equation formulation for a landmark infrastructure project
v. City’s largest transportation network in developing non-ticketing revenue
vi. Options pricing for nation’s largest travel booking start-up

After a year and a half at the first big 4 firm I moved to a different big 4 company, where I was double promoted  and currently work on several Strategy-focused projects:
i. Long term strategy for nation’s top defence company
ii. Foreign investment analysis for a mining company
iii. Financial feasibility for one of nation’s largest cement manufacturers
iv. Aiding in financial feasibility analysis of a foreign company entering my country

For current extracurriculars:
1. I do several charitable organisations, mostly through my church, and some on my own undertaking such as going to teach schools on the weekends
2. I’ve written an opinion piece under the guise of a book review for the nation’s top English-language daily newspaper.
3. I’ve written a 4500 essay regarding labour market polarisation in the country, and what steps need to be taken. This is to be submitted to The nation’s top English-language policy and foreign affairs journal. The journal has past presidents, generals, foreign professors, and eminent journalists it can count as past contributors. 

In university, my extracurriculars were:
1. Model United Nations. Attended several conferences and placed runner up for committee’s best delegate
2. Part of an undergraduate finance club in which I helped organised Southern California’s largest financial professional conference. This conference bridges the professional world to a finance non-target school such as mine. 
3. Was President of student investment fund, which was part of larger philanthropic organisation which crafted innovative solutions to fundraising scholarship money and used equity and debt returns to scale up disbursable amount. 

What I want to do:
As for now I find myself at a crossroads, i am heavily interested in pursuing either Public Administration or Public Policy, Finance, an MBA or an MM, International Affairs, or Education. 

My overarching aim is to contribute more to my country, but i feel that I am reaching the maximum given my undergraduate education. I find my professional experiences to be uniquely a marriage between economics, finance and public policy and service, a combination of which can enable me to play a role in national development. 

I know my GPA is an overwhelming factor to overcome, but what are some next steps that I can take if I am aiming for top schools? (Ivy Leagues and top 10.) 

Are cut-offs on an institutions website hard cut-offs?

Where do you think I should improve on?

I thoroughly apologise for the long post. Any advice would be very much welcome and thank you for taking the time out of your day to reply."
bzep37,35,2019-06-11,Fraternity attempting to sue me for charges I am not liable for...,blondemustacheguy,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bzep37/fraternity_attempting_to_sue_me_for_charges_i_am/,"Hello everyone I was hoping to get some insight on what I should do in my situation. I currently do not have a lawyer but  I have a court date coming up next week and have a couple of questions. The opposing law agency wants to mediate with me before the court date.... but here is some background.

Part 1:

I was apart of my fraternity for three years under good standing. At the beginning, I signed a paper with personal information stating that I would pay my dues each semester.  Each year I got a doctors note from my family practitioner with the reason on why I would not be on the meal plan. The management agency that runs our finances were sticklers on the notes attempting to get my doctor to release medical reasons that are protected under HIPA. The agency eventually budged after I submitted four doctors notes and I was removed from the meal plan. Fast forward three years. I visited the house twice during a week at dinner time. At this time, one of the members of exec thought he saw me eating dinner. This member proceeded to tell the management company what happened without first speaking to me. I learned of this situation approximately a month and a half later when my final payment was $800 more than what I was anticipating on paying. I reached out to the management agency to discuss why I was being charged for the meal plan. They told me that I had been seen eating dinner when I was not supposed to be and terminated my exemption. They also claimed that they sent certified mail to my home state address but was never signed for. I told them I would not pay this amount because they have no proof I ate dinner on the nights I was accused of. This is where it gets a bit interesting. The management agency proceeds to tell me that I need to pay the money for the meal plan or they will not let me sign a lease inside the fraternity house. I tell them no. Then the manager of the agency attempts to make a deal with me. She offers that if I pay $500 of the money I ""owe"" I can sign a lease to the house. I shut down this deal because I do not want to do it. I do however pay the rest of my dues that I owe but NOT the meal plan.

Questions:

1. Do they actually have any argument to get me to pay this money or is it just hearsay?

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2:

My last semester in college I participated in an internship in my college town. I was working fifty hours a week and did not have time for the fraternity. I told the management agency I was graduated and that I will not be participating in a ny events. I had all the hours necessary for my degree but I wanted to take an internship. The agency said I needed to submit paper work of my degree audit even though I was instilled as an Alumni the semester prior. I never submitted this audit because I was tired of being hounded by them. I received the court notice from the lawyer about three weeks ago with the amount they want me to pay which is $2700. This beaks down into $1,900 for dues and $800 for the meal plan. I am not so confident about this argument since I didn't submit the document on time but I did not participate in any events with the fraternity that would give them ammo for their argument. All they have is a paper I signed four years ago stating I would pay.

Questions:

1. Should I fight this part or will it ultimately cost more than what I could mediate?
2. Can I ask for an extension on the court date? I will be out of town on vacation.
3. Being a recent college grad, I can lawyer up but it will take a hit on my finances. Should I lawyer up?

bzff35,1,2019-06-11,Cable Altitude Derating,Tavvv,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/bzff35/cable_altitude_derating/,"Hi there,

I'm currently an intern at a mid sized engineering firm and was hoping to get some help.

I've been told to prove that these cables: 535 Conductor 7.5kV 125 Degree EPDM will be okay to use at an altitude of 4000m for a motor with a max operating voltage and current of 1500 VAC and 600 A.

I've honestly been googling around for 2 hours and still am not quite sure how to approach it. The relevant standards for the cable are ASTM B33 and UL 758-AWM Style 3900.  Both of which I do not have access to.  I have the date sheet for the cables which offers this information: 

Flexed Tinned Copper Conductor

Cond Size (AWG) = 535.3, No. of Strands = 1332, Insulation Thickness (mils) = 125 , Nominal OD (mils)= 1130

My supervisor is a  nice guy but is super busy and I feel like I am annoying him. He keeps on telling me to just do research but I'm still not sure what exactly to do. Is there a calculation for such a thing?  I know for certain switch gears there are de-rating factors for various altitudes that you can use, but I still have not found anything relevant to cables. 

I thought I might as well ask here and see if anyone had any insight. 

Super frustrated and any help would be appreciated..thanks"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22 M from Ohio in NY for the summer. I have no previous spots on my record and no infractions whatsoever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just before 10:50am on Tuesday (today) I was pulled over driving on the highway in New York.

I was in the HOV lane when the lines thinned and I pulled out of the HOV lane to head toward the exit I needed to take.

I signaled and paused between each lane and cut across to get to the exit.

I did not cut off any other cars and there was no traffic between me and the exit.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pulled over just before I got to the exit and pulled to the side of the highway.

The officer immediately berated me, shouting ""You can't do that here!""

I responded, asking what I did wrong.

The officer, irate, told me that I can't cut across traffic like that.

I told him that I signaled in each lane and tried to explain myself, but he cut me off and barked at me to get my license and registration.

&amp;#x200B;

I did as I was told and tried to inform him that this was not my car and I just needed to drive it to a dealer as my job.

He took my license and registration (which I didn't know was expired) and returned 15 minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

He handed me a stack of papers and told me to follow the instructions on the paper. I started to ask him a question, 

but he immediately turned around and walked to his car. I called out for him again, but he ignored me.

When he got into his car I waved him down and he pulled up next to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I told the officer I was unaware that I had broken a traffic law and asked him to explain what I had done wrong. 

He gave no explanation other than ""You can't do"" what I did. I told him I had signalled and he said ""It doesn't matter.""

I told the officer ""Thank you for your service,"" and he sped off. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I pulled off the highway I reviewed what the officer had given me only to realize I had been slapped with eight separate tickets.

1 for each lane violation (4)

1 for the HOV violation

1 for reckless driving

1 for failure to use the exit lane properly

1 for driving without insurance (the vehicle was insured, the documentation was just expired)

&amp;#x200B;

So all in all that's around 20 points on my license and over $5000.

&amp;#x200B;

The real kicker here is that I'm a senior in college and I was driving this car for my internship. My internship requires me to drive every day, and without a license I might lose my internship. If I lose my internship and my license both there's no way I'll be able to take full time with the company in the spring like I had planned. And without my license I can't drive back to Ohio, so I'm essentially stuck here.

&amp;#x200B;

So this one thing can stick me with a fee I can't afford, have me lose my current job, have me lose my future job, and leave me stranded in New Jersey.  I could be more or less royally f\*cked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea on how best to go about this? Should I fight all the tickets and plead not guilty?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am finding this sub very helpful and just joined.  I'm a 30 year old mortgage banker and I've wanted to change careers for about 4 years.  I went to UCF in 2007 but wasn't really ready for college.  I mostly took easy liberal arts classes and barely earned any credits.  In 2016 I enrolled in my local community college in Computer Science and I earned my AS this Spring.  I'm now transferring to a 4 year school to get my BS and need around 40 credits to do so.  I still think it's the right move for me, the balance of salary and my interests (problem solving, programming, scientific/number theory, etc.) seems ideal.  I know there are some challenges ahead, but I'm looking forward to overcoming them.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked very part time as a mortgage banker for the past 18 months (before that I was a salaried mortgage processor and only went to school at night) so I could take more classes at community college and get to the end faster.  I now realize I have no interest in half-assing two things, and I want to whole-ass my CS career.  I will hopefully graduate with my BS in 18 months (end of Fall 2020).  That will require at least 12 credits each semester and 1 summer class (all my remaining classes are 4 credits each).  I loaded up 3 classes on Tuesday and Thursday afternoon/evening for Fall 2019 with the thought that I could work at an internship or otherwise on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or some combination of all days.  I have one single class on M/W that I may drop depending on work opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is about some opportunities that already came up.  My friends and family don't understand what CS is, and just think of me as a ""computer guy.""  I have two IT positions offered to me through friends.  Both are part time and would likely work around my schedule.  Both pay well and I would love something stable again (I'm currently 100% commission).  They are basically entry level ""computer guy"" positions.  Is this even worth taking?  Will it be even remotely close to relevant experience for a CS career?  Should I spend my time working on a real CS internship instead?  Or even just go to school full time and work on projects?  I feel comfortable with my class load because they are 3 hours a week for 4 credits (each class).  At community college it was always 4 for 4 and even 6 for 4 if there was a lab.  Plus I have the option to drop down to 12 credits if I want to work part time.  I'm mostly self funding state college so I'm not beholden to FAFSA.

&amp;#x200B;

Career advisers at the college recommend internships in the breaks, but I think I can handle work during school.  I would prefer to not eradicate my savings as well.  If there was a way to finish in 1 year I would probably not worry about work as much, but since I need a minimum of 3 semesters I want to balance money and school.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Should I take a flexible part-time IT job or just look for CS internships?

Hadn’t heard back after a few weeks and couldn’t stop thinking about it, followed up - they said they had been too busy to look at applications yet but thanked me for interest etc. An old friend of mine happens to work there so she asked the PR team for me and again (around April), they said they had been too busy to look at applications. 

I waited more, still nothing, emailed again in May, got the same response (too busy to look at applications but would take a good look at mine when they could).

To preface, I'm an intern with a marketing company and do a lot of marketing research and financial activities at a firm. Said firm is pretty small (about 20 total employees) and a lot of the employees are family members and family friends. We recently started upper management and office training so me being the short-term intern, I cover phones and mind my own business throughout the days when there is training. 

So long story short, the delivery driver we usually have banged out sick, and when that happens our CEO would usually do some deliveries in between her meetings, but today she was too busy and asked me to run a few deliveries in her car around the city. I'm in a major metro area in FL, and if you've ever driven in FL the roads can be really deceiving. So I accept the task from my boss, and she suggests her granddaughter who is  a minor (highschool I think, working over the summer for extra money) go with me to help with deliveries and navigation. ""Okay cool"" I think to myself, ""that's an extra set of eyes on the road and can help with deliveries"" (found out that she has gone on deliveries before in past summers), ""this should be a breeze, I know the city pretty well at this point and we have GPS etc. How hard could it be?"" 

Short answer: super fucking easy, not hard at all. Unless of course you can't listen to Siri's directions like myself.

So we embark on our delivery run, 3 stops. First stop, pulled up to the door dropped it off, onto the 2nd stop, pulled up and dropped it off. (Mind you that stops 2 and 3 are in the downtown area where it can get congested and confusing.) Onto the 3rd stop, easy drop off. Time to head back to the office and get back to my normal, comfortable, day-to-day work. 

Cue the fuck up. With the granddaughter's phone giving us nav, Siri tells us to turn right as we try to head on the the highway **WEST** back to work, we're maybe 5 miles from work, quick shot on the highway. Well Siri says ""in a quarter mile, turn right"" I thought that I had driven a quarter mile and banged a quick right and that's when all hell broke loose. I took the right turn that was before the turn for the correct highway and found myself on our outbound top deck of the expressway that goes for 8 miles **EAST** before any exits are available for me to jump off.  To boot, this expressway entrance is a dual-use entrance as an exit at different times of the day, so there were also markers on the ground along with backwards signs that made this poor kid think I was not only driving her far away from work but also driving the wrong way. The tension in the car was just completely unbearable as I tried to explain that I didn't mean to take this and that I wasn't heading down a wrong-way highway but that we were indeed traveling in the wrong direction. I am certain that this girl feared I was a serial killer or some sort of perv and that I was trying to drive her out into the boonies of FL away from her family. And on top of that the expressway is an added expense to the company's ""SunPass.""

After 8 miles of driving with maybe 1 or 2 cars around, I finally was able to get off and head back in the right direction. Eventually found my way back to work and determined that I would never be doing deliveries again and that if I had to, I'd be doing it alone. Currently sitting in my office with my door barely cracked so I don't have to see the poor girl that thought I attempted to kidnap her.

TL;DR: **Went on a delivery run for first time, was accompanied by a minor, and proceeded to drive the wrong direction away from our work after said deliveries were done, making minor uncomfortable and taking a painfully long time to do a simple task. Shoutout Siri and city streets.**"

The big 4 + other major tech companies actively recruit at my school, so I'm looking for tips on how I can stand out from the CS majors. At these career fairs there will probably be CS, EE, math/stat and physics majors and I'm assuming that the CS majors will be the most desirable for the recruiters. Any tips on how I can attract the attention of a big name recruiter at these career fairs? I'd like to get at least one internship before I graduate and I am willing to do anything for it."

bzirmk,253,2019-06-11,God Comes In The Darkest Of Night,poloniumpoisoning,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bzirmk/god_comes_in_the_darkest_of_night/,"I’m a sleep researcher. My name is Holly Simons and for my whole adult life, I’ve been studying dreams. I am currently the head of my city’s Sleep Institute.

The concept of dreaming has always fascinated men. The mystical think of them as revelations, the scientific minds assure you can only dream of faces you’ve seen, there’s studies indicating that people that were born blind can’t see in their dreams, while those who lost the eyesight during their life can still see images in dreams, but less and less as the time goes by.

I was overjoyed when I found a girl blind from birth that had the ability of lucid dreaming. Her name was Taylor and she was 22.

“The things are there, but the blind can’t see them, just like in real life”, she told me. She could feel her dreams with her hands. I wanted to know more about it.

Taylor was excited to cooperate, and she needed the money, so we started soon.

For the first night, I wanted to keep it simple. I used a common Erickson hypnosis technique to induce Taylor to a sleep-like state; her mind was technically sleeping, but she could still tell me what she saw – or rather, what she felt.

“Where are you, Taylor?” I asked softly. Although she was blind, all the lights were low to create a comforting atmosphere. I sent my whole team home, except for Barbara, my trusted assistant. She was in charge of taking notes.

Other than Barbara typing and the vague humming of the computers and air-conditioning, everything was perfectly quiet.

“It seems to be a corridor. I can feel one of the walls. It’s cold and sleek. Now I felt the other. I guess it’s like 4-meters large”.

“Good! Are you alone?”

“I hear no one else. Wait. Doctor, I have the urge to run. I’m running now, still feeling one of the walls. Oh fuck”.

The girl got a little agitated. I was keeping track of her heart rate with an ECG machine; it was slightly quicker now, but still normal.

“What happened, Taylor?”

“The wall disappeared. I think it… it’s larger now. And there’s a presence some meters behind me. But I still don’t hear footsteps or breathing”.

“Run carefully, Taylor. Remember, it’s a dream and they can’t hurt you”.

“Shit”, she muttered, as her body rapidly contracted. Her heart rate went up a little more, and I noticed the BPM was now consistent with someone doing light exercise. “I fell”.

“Get up carefully”.

“I can’t. Doctor, there’s no more floor. I’m falling”.

She didn’t say anything for good 20 minutes. I nervously called her name a few times, but after a while, decided to let her be. I can’t interfere if I want reliable results. Besides, her heart rate was still okay.

Her face contorted once in a while, but her body almost didn’t move – other than her chest unevenly breathing.

Finally, Taylor’s closed eyes started to move rapidly, like in the REM stage.

“I have a bad feeling. There’s a woman in front of me”.

“Are you feeling her face?”

“Yes. It’s kinda like mine. Is it my mother or sister?”

Taylor’s hand touched under her left ear.

“No. She has a little scar. It’s me”, Taylor seemed to panic.

“Hey, it’s fine. It’s normal to see yourself in dreams, Taylor. Try talking to yourself or exploring the place you’re in”.

“There’s something wrong, doctor. She’s not moving or breathing. There’s something sticky… and the skin. Gosh, the skin is crumbling in my hands”.

“You’re dreaming of yourself dead. That’s normal too”.

“But she’s standing”, Taylor cried. She sounded so young and scared. I looked at Barbara, wordlessly asking if she thought we should stop. “Fuck you! Get this thing out of me!”

I calmly induced Taylor out of the hypnotic state. She was trembling and sweating a little. Heart rate compatible with moderate exercise.

After assuring that everything was okay and it was just a dream, I asked Taylor what happened last.

“I don’t know, doctor. I just felt that bad presence again and there was something cold and narrow touching my back. I think it was some kind of helmet”.

The poor girl was sulky and almost crying; I felt really bad for her. I had a feeling that we could have a breakthrough in this study, but was I putting too much strain on the subject?

“This is fascinating, Holly”, Barbara put her hand on my shoulder. “You have to keep this study going to matter what. I know something big will come out of it”.

I smiled, reassured. Barbara was my best pupil, and I hoped she would take my place as head of the team when I got too old.

I offered the girls some coffee, but only Barbara accepted. After a few minutes calming ourselves down, Taylor got up with the help of her cane and said “see you tomorrow”. I was relieved she wasn’t thinking about giving up.

Barbara got up too. She is barely older than Taylor, but I always think of her as someone much more adult, being so strong and reliable. She offered a ride to Taylor. 

We usually pay our subjects an Uber, especially because most of our studies are developed during the dawn and the public transportation can be sparse or non-existent; but, due to her impairment, Taylor would be safer with someone from my team.

I went home, had a cup of tea and fell asleep to restless dreams.

I woke up with a call from Barbara’s mother. My assistant never made it home.

\*\*\*

It wasn’t like Barbara to fall asleep at the wheel, but it was so late in the night. I felt terribly guilty. Was I overworking her?

I rushed to the hospital and spent over ten hours in the waiting room with her parents.

The doctors said Barbara is probably going to survive, but after seeing her, I almost wish she doesn’t. Due to the crash, her jaw was shattered to smithereens, and the first reconstructive surgery made her face awfully swollen and deformed.

I gave the whole team the week off. Barbara managed pretty much everything, so we would all be feeling lost and frustrated. I would go and organize the things before everyone else was back.

I thought about giving up.

*You have to keep this study going to matter what.*

But Barbara wanted me to continue. So I decided to simply give Taylor a week before our next meeting as well.

When I called to let her know that, her voice was full of panic.

“Can we please continue today, doctor?”

“But Taylor, Barbara was in an awful accident and I can’t—”

“Yes, I know. I was still with her”.

\*\*\*

Two hours later, I was sitting in front of Taylor in my lab, while Jamie, the 17-years-old intern, furiously took notes. 

The nature of Barbara’s accident was still as inscrutable as before. Taylor explained to me that she had a seizure in the car and Barbara got distracted trying to help her, then the crash happened. Taylor then felt extreme pain and passed out.

She woke up in her bed without a scratch.

This couldn’t be real. Barbara’s accident happened when she was almost at her house, at least 25 minutes after dropping Taylor home. Her car GPS showed so.

Still, Taylor’s explanation was very plausible, because Barbara never seemed tired during her shift, and she even had a cup of coffee before leaving.

Taylor begged me to continue the study immediately and let her go to the place from yesterday again. For the second time in less than 24 hours, I wired and hypnotized my subject.

She easily guided herself through the already familiar corridor. Once again, when it got larger, she felt a disturbing presence. She then quickened her pace and fell for almost half an hour.

After that, she found her crumbly and sticky version again. Taylor then dexterously moved through this unexplored room, finding more completely still and flakey bodies.

While feeling them, she touched something insanely cold.

“There’s a large pipe coming from their backs”, she whispered, scared. “I’m walking between them, following one pipe. It seems like there’s a lot of people positioned in a circle”.

After almost an hour of silence, Taylor’s heart rate suddenly flatlined.

Jamie looked at me in panic. I immediately started to perform chest compressions on Taylor, instructing Jamie to get me the defibrillator.

I didn’t want to use it because, although I theoretically knew how, I never had to before. I was scared. The CPR, however, was something I knew how to do since I was 15.

I was panicked too. How could I explain to anybody that a girl died during a simple lucid dreaming study? What would it mean to my career? Would I ever found another person like Taylor? Did I actually do something to jeopardize her life?

After six long minutes, Taylor was back.

She abruptly woke up, heart rate skyrocketing, and screamed for three whole minutes. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but you should try listening to the same ear-piercing cry for that long.

“It’s okay, Taylor. It’s okay. You’re scared because you were pulled out your trance before time. Everything is alright”.

“Where am I?”

“At the Sleep Institute. It’s me, Doctor Holly Simons”.

People could get confused if they weren’t properly dehypnotized. 

Not after long, her BPM was back to normal.

“What happened during your last minutes there?”

“The reality broke and I was all turgid inside a bathtub. The liquid… it wasn’t water”, she pressed her fingers on her temples and started to talk too fast; I had to listen to the transcription many times to understand all her words. “There was electricity all around you like a field if you moved it wasn’t actually a tub because I was standing it was more like a vertical tub I don’t even know if it makes sense there was a pipe in my back everything hurt so much all my veins and arteries were electric wires and the pipe was draining my very being to The Machine and my skin was swollen but at the same time crumbling and I think my whole body was a battery with the sole purpose of feeding the machine and in exchange The Machine created this simulation where I can live a relatively good life instead of being aware of the horrors that are happening to my actual body and having my mind broken because if it happens nothing can feed The Machine and it doesn’t want us to know that the only real thing in our existence are the nightmares we have in the darkest of the night when our fake body almost ceases from breathing because it’s so much better to live in a mediocre simulation than knowing that we are alone in the universe and there’s nothing out there but our real bodies suffering and The Machine feeding us with impressions of a non-existent world”.

Taylor then fell on a catatonic state and didn’t talk for two whole hours. I decided to drop both her and my intern home and call it a night. If Taylor’s symptoms persisted, I would take her to the hospital.

The next morning, I woke up to Taylor pounding fiercely on my door.

“I can’t sleep. I’ll never sleep again. Please hypnotize me”.

As I changed to my work clothes, I texted Jamie, promising 100 bucks again. I really only needed someone to take the notes; the audio recorder helped a lot, but a second person was necessary to write down information such as Taylor’s heartbeat, eye movement, etc.

In less than an hour we were at the institute. I performed the hypnosis once again.

Taylor frantically headed to the room full of people connected to pipes.

She then screamed NO so loud that I thought the very reality around me was shaking. Her eyes were wide open with the purest terror I have ever seen.

“What happened?” I asked in an urgent tone.

“I can see. Fuck, I can see with my fucking eyes. Jesus. I wish I couldn’t. The pipes are made of human flesh”, she cried. “Barbara is here. She’s so ugly, she’s completely destroyed. She will be in a coma forever. There’s no electricity around her. The air is full of shatters. I can see… I can see what everyone is connected to. It’s black and metallic. It’s a gargantuan machine. It’s extending…. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO”.

From Taylor’s mouth came an impossibly large and absurdly black tentacle. It engulfed Jamie in a fraction of second; the poor teen didn’t even have time to scream before being completely erased from existence.

The tentacle retracted. I couldn’t run. My legs were like jelly and running from something so immense would be pointless, like trying to cover a tunnel for trains with the lid from a mayonnaise jar.

“Holly”, a voice indescribably old, portentous and evil replaced it, coming from Taylor’s mouth. Its words almost hung in the air, too heavy to dissipate. “You wanted to find out what happens during sleep. Everything you know breaks and is replaced by me. You feed me, I mask your pain”.

“Who are you?” I mustered the strength to ask.

“You can call me God because I’m the only strong being left in the universe”.

I felt hot tears streaming down my cheeks. If I moved one inch my body would fall in a gelatinous puddle and never be reassembled again. 

It continued.

“I’ll grant your wish. I’ll come get you and show you exactly how it happens. So say your goodbyes, because it’s impossible to come back”.

Before I could process its words, Taylor’s body disappeared inside the blackest black too.

I know no one will believe me. I only have audio records of it, and I don’t even know if a camera could capture this thing. It was so fast I almost doubt my sanity.

So God is a gargantuan machine that keeps us from seeing how ugly the reality is. 

And tonight, God comes in the darkest of night for me[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales)"
bzj74f,62,2019-06-11,Called CPS on parent: An update about a year later,deadlyparents,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/bzj74f/called_cps_on_parent_an_update_about_a_year_later/,"Hey guys, I just want to thank all of you for your support and it touches me that I'm still getting messages to this day. I posted this about an year ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8zg9n8/i\_maned\_up\_and\_did\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8zg9n8/i_maned_up_and_did_it/) I don't know how much I will be writing in this post but it's probably going to be really long, lol. Sorry about that.  


I don't know if anyone cares, but I just want to give an update to what is going on in my life. I just graduated high school and my parents have yet to change; they've become even more abusive than normal now that I'm turning 18 soon. A while ago, I was so sure that I was leaving the day I turn 18 because I didn't want to stay in their house for another day, but it's easier said than done since I have no place to go and my grandparents decided that they want to stay in the States longer, so I don't want any family drama. My grandparents think my mom is insane, but they don't see any wrong with their ""baby adorable perfect"" abusive son. They still treat him like a baby and he laps it all up. He could say something or do something terrible to me and whenever I snitch on him to his mommy or daddy, they tell me to forgive him and it's wrong to talk back to an adult.        



I'm going to cut off contact when I get to college, which will be hard for me because there will be intense family drama, but I don't care. My mom tells me everyday that I chose the wrong major and I will end up with a low level paying job as the head custodian of a good company that other people who went to better schools will also work at because she disapproves of the school I chose; I would be lying if I said that her insulting my choice and blessing me with the ""you will become bankrupt/poor/with a janitorial role"" every other day doesn't hurt. She consulted the oracle, the college admissions gods of high school wechat groups, and all the wechat parents in those groups are telling her ""ai ya your daughter chose a major she will regret because it's a heavy toll on females"". Her close friends are also telling her that the major I chose will be hard for me. One of them even gave me $60 and immediately told my mom ""you should convince her to switch"" right in front of me. They don't even know if I want to go into this path after college. Recently, as in last wednesday, she told me to keep up with my attitude and all the boys in my major won't like me. ""None of them will like a girl who keeps talking with your attitude"" after I told her to leave me alone and raised my voice when she told me my major ""isn't for me"". I told her that I'm trying to go to school to get enough money to pay off the debt that she accrued raising a worthless piece of trash, not for any other reasons. She wasn't having it. I recorded the whole conversation and the second she saw my phone she started protesting and yelling ""THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT I DIDN'T MEAN THAT BOYS WON'T LIKE YOU I MEANT YOUR ATTITUDE WILL DRIVE EVERYONE AROUND YOU AWAY"". Why did I even waste my time typing that out? Gross. I feel like I'm in 3rd grade all over again.                



I'm trying to get my life together and figure out a purpose. My parents are refusing to help me get citizenship nor anything college related, so I'm trying to do all of that as soon as possible. I am trying to figure out this whole ""adulting"" process. I want to make my own credit card, but she screamed at me to make a joint account to hers so she could monitor the money I make in college, but I'm sick of that crap. She keeps asking me all nicely, trying to make up for the really hurtful thing she said a few days ago about my ""shitty school"", what I want for my 18th birthday. She does this thing where she tries to compensate for her lack of understanding how people who don't belong in mental asylums function by being nice/bribing me with things, but the minute I show signs of forgiveness, she picks on another issue and screams about it, which happened a few days ago at a busy parking lot. I told her that I didn't want anything from her for my 18th birthday and she got mad because I'm ""not being serious enough and wasting her time"". What I want from her isn't something money could buy. Love? Not going to happen. Silence/stop ear piercing screeching for at least a day? Not going to happen. I have some really bad foot problems and I've been wearing the same sneakers for years, so at least I hope that she could buy me new shoes after I've been mentioning it to her over the course of 4 years. I told her I needed new shoes but she wouldn't let me get them until I see a foot doctor, which my general doctor pressured her into making an appointment for a while ago.            



I didn't discuss this yet but all of them have beef. My mom is not speaking to my grandparents and she has slammed the door on my grandma. My dad isn't speaking to my mom nor is she speaking to him. My grandparents have told me a few times that they feel bad for me because of my mom. They gave me some advice and told me that I will continue my life anywhere I choose to. I really like them and they would probably understand why when I cut my mom off, but not my dad.           



I have no idea how to function onward after I leave my parents. I don't know how to get a credit card or store money. I don't know how I could get doctor's appointments or insurance after I turn 22. I don't know how/who is going to pay off college for me if I cut them off. I have a job, but it doesn't pay enough for me even though I'm attending a very cheap college. Turning 18 doesn't feel as exciting as it should. No one knows when my birthday is besides four close friends and my family forgets, even my dad. Last year, a few months after my birthday, my aunt sent my mom a message that said something along the lines of ""isn't your daughter turning 16 around now?"".            



I don't open up much about my family and people barely ask about my parents because every time we talk about family stuff, my stories are pretty morbid. I don't mean for it to be that way to get attention, it's just the way my life is. It's not as if I have much to share about my dad, whom my friends ask about all the time because they've NEVER met him despite knowing me for so many years. I just tell them that he hates kids. It's been another uneventful year, but I'm setting some goals for myself. I have been going out with friends everyday to avoid staying home and I'm probably going to stay at my local library everyday if my Summer job doesn't pull through. I've made a bucket list and want to do a few things before college, such as camping out with friends. Once I turn 18, I'm going to do all the things I wasn't able to do, such as skiing (my mom kept telling me that I couldn't go because I'd break my legs, but she just didn't want to spend skiing money). I might even take up snowboarding. I run a successful business that no one in my family knows of, and I want to start another one soon. My mom tells me to treat her with the first bits of money I get from an ""official job"", but I'm investing it all. I might even go skydiving. I also plan on going through social media and cutting out everyone besides my friends. I never cared about numbers, but having people I never talk to on my snapchat is pretty unsettling. I'm also looking for internships, but unfortunately, I missed my opportunity for many because I'm not 18 yet and don't turn 18 until summer internships officially starts. Lol if anyone is in the Boston area, hook me up with some suggestions please. I'm trying to make the last Summer of my high school years as memorable as possible and without any memory of my parents in it. I wish you all a happy summer and good luck to high school homies out there, you guys got it. Make good choices though."

bzjwq1,1,2019-06-11,How to Get A Job When I'm Overqualified,AboveTableAccount,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bzjwq1/how_to_get_a_job_when_im_overqualified/,"So about early to mid May I lost my job as a asoftware enginneering intern because our office was destroyed in a natural disaster. I moved herr to get the job and all the other businesses around are basically a Best Buy a Starbuck and a McDonalds. I thought I was qualified to do them but I literally can't get a job. If you're wondering I've had my resume checked on a Throwaway and I got good feedback and I'm now confident my resume is good to go, and I apply to at bare minimum 20 jobs however it seems hiring season for software engineering interns is well shutdown and I'm whiffing hard at getting a job somehwere else.

It's been about a month now and I don't understand how I'm going to get a job around here. Most of the displaced workers at my office are older and have well developed savings accounts whereas I am fresh out of college and intend to finish my degree next semester so I need to be getting income. My career counselor from university told me that with businesses like McDonalds and Best Buy I'm probably overqualified and my best shot at getting a job is to just keep pestering them until they cave. I've recently learned there is a warehouse nearby and I applied there but I got a phone call to tell me they recently filled the seasonal distribution laborer position. If I'm willing to commute say an hour there's a few furniture stores that are hiring but I applied and I still haven't heard anything back. There's a few other businesses but when I went in to the gas station and the Auto Shop aren't hiring. Oh and there is a Walmart but I applied there first and I've been stonewalled trying to get a job there. I've found it surprisingly hard to get a job. I just need something to pay rent and car insurance and payments y'know?

Should I just not include my education and such on my resume? Would that make things easier at businesses like that?"

I have no experience with Java, I mostly use C when I work with a µC (AVR and STM32).

I am a little confused because I really wish that I could spend the summer improving my knowledge of embedded and I am afraid that ""Embedded Java"" will not help me that much with my career in this critical time.

I recently graduated with a computer science degree from a pretty decent university(Top 20 CS school) in the U.S., I've just started to apply everywhere now for entry-level positions and understand that it will not be an easy process but another huge concern just came to me: I feel like I am not qualified to be employed. 

To explain this, I mean that I am yet able to make anything at a professional level. I've had coursework on algorithms, data structures, system programming, web app development, etc. But none of them feels like it has prepared me enough for the industry level.

I've had project courses too where I make software with a team in a full development cycle, but none of the final product feels like it is completed at a high level despite the good score. We relied on the internet to make a lot of things and they were also pretty easy to make in the first place. 

My last summer internship wasn't very helpful either, I was only given the basic task like making a static webpage, a program that sorts data or log filenames, and when I try to self-study the repository of codes, I actually had no idea what was going on.

Do CS students just all self-study into a field they are interested in after the basic coursework? because I feel like I only have a superficial knowledge of everything, whether that be programming languages or general computer science knowledge, and I probably can't work on something for more than 15 minutes without google...

I am quite worried because I feel like even if I pass the tech interview questions I am gonna get fired pretty quickly.

So besides this almost being a ""Yes/No"" question, I am also here to look for advice on how I can best prepare myself for work since I do have a few months before I can start working."
bzkxvc,1202,2019-06-11,Can my parents pull me out of school if I’m attending on a full ride?,bobaprincess22,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bzkxvc/can_my_parents_pull_me_out_of_school_if_im/,"Hi there!

My dad once threatened to find any way possible to pull me out of school if I did anything stupid that would spoil their reputation in India (I was born into a conservative family of high status that has a lot of connections). They’ve already imposed a lot of restrictions on me as I’m going out of state for college and I’ll be across the United States. 

As much as it is annoying to follow their stupid rules to ensure my ‘safety’ (finish school in three years and graduate Summa Cum Laude, can’t venture out of campus without telling my parents where it is that I’m going and must stay within the city, can’t get a job in anything other than internships and tutoring others, don’t even think about relationships, etc.), I’m willing to follow these just so I can have some space in my life for once. 

However, after hearing my dad telling me that he will do anything to halt my education and marry me off if I screw up, I’ve been incredibly alarmed and realize that God forbid something happens I need to put protections in place. My parents themselves have told me that they don’t think it would come to this as I’m a good girl who follows the rules but knowing my dad, this easily can be a reality as they are big on making sure that my character and their reputation is upheld. 

Now my situation is that I’m going there on a full ride (tuition and room and board are completely paid for) and they will not be required to financially support me. 

1. Are they allowed to pull me out of school once I become an adult? (I will be one once school starts in the fall)
2. Will they able to do anything to pull me out considering that I’ll still be claimed as their dependent until I’m 24?
3. Can they access my school records if I deny them anything as per FERPA protections? 
4. If they coerce me to do anything related to dropping out of school, who should I contact? 

Thank you so much."

As a B.S. in Economics as opposed to doing the Finance option at Foster, are there any disadvantages (or advantages) I might have? A big thing I’m wanting to know is what coursework I should take. I’ve taken things like ECON 300, 200/201, ACCTG 215, STAT 311, Calculus, Programming, etc. and am wondering where I should go next (ECON 42x series is very Finance-centric so I’m looking at that for next year). Are programming classes important, and should I do Managerial Accounting (ACCTG 225)? Also, what kind of GPA range should I be in to have a shot at any sort of internship? And are the career fairs at UW better than the online hunt? 

I know I’m not very specific when I say “Finance-related internship”, as there are many different types like financial analysis, accounting, financial planning, credit risk, portfolio management, quant finance, etc. I’m fine with anything really, not super specific about it so any sort of tips are well appreciated. 

Lastly, I don’t have any relevant experience yet in regards to jobs. I’ve just worked as an Event Assistant for UW and an Apparel Associate for Fred Meyer (lmao). What kind of projects/extracurricular can I get started on this summer that would help?

Sorry for all the questions, I always get anxious in regards to planning my academic path and career. No need to answer everything, any sort of comment tackling any of the questions above is very much appreciated. Thank you!! :D

P.S. Do I need Intermediate Accounting coursework (301-303) for accounting internships? Or is 215/225 enough (dumb question but idk)?"

&amp;#x200B;

I should have applied to more safeties, wrote better essays ( I think most people said my common app one was too negative), and gotten better awards, and better grades.

Honestly I was pretty depressed senior year. I felt like a failure, was always tired, and my mom was dealing with breast cancer (don't worry, she's beat it!). The only school I mentioned this to was UC Berkeley, but it wasn't for an excuse for my drop in grades but for the possibility I may need more financial aid in the future. 

The most frustrating part is how opaque and shady it is. Most people, even consultants, have no idea how it all works unless they worked inside the admissions office. I know someone who was top 6% of their class that was rejected from UT Austin computer science yet got into UMich and CMU for computer science, (he's going to CMU, yet his family has to pay $70k a year). I know someone who had practically nonexistent comp sci ecs, who got a 2 on the AP CS exam, and who was know to cheat who got into UT Austin computer science and Northwestern pre-med, while someone I know who's basically a musical god and did a medical internship was rejected from Northwestern pre-med. The only person I know who got into Stanford was someone who got recruited to play softball their junior year. I know people who've won international Olympiads and other prestigious awards who've actually worked hard and were passionate about what they studied and they deserve all their success. And yet, I see others who seem to game and cheat the system. 

Paid college consultants, sports recruitment, lying, cheating...these circumvent meritocracy and undermine American education.

However, just because you didn't get into a big name school doesn't mean everything's over. People say that graduate school is really all that matters. Yes, top tier schools are usually generous with financial aid, but so are some lesser known ones, especially UTD. I know people who got into schools like John Hopkins who chose UTD instead. 

Just know that opportunity lies everywhere. You simply have to look hard enough. Many things in life are out of your control and horrible things can strike from nowhere. Don't take these things personally since, ultimately, they're due to chance. Just focus on powering through and trying your luck again. By the Law of Large Numbers (thanks AP Stats) you'll find success.

Edit: I actually have a $3k stipend per semester not $6k. Sorry for the error."

So my questions are: What kinds of information we can take away from web users while they're browsing on our websites, any unique user ids, Gmail, social media account,...? What are the key components for online web users profiling? I'm just trying to understand the ideas of this concept.

I wanted to design, manufacture, and sell contract-grade furniture and also make it available to the public with transparent pricing. The best materials, environmentally friendly and sustainable practices. All online, without salespeople and the usual gigantic pricetag.

&amp;#x200B;

A year and a half ago I drew the first sketch on the journey to solve this, and today I have strong brand ethos + social following, an optimized high margin product system and an efficient manufacturing pipeline ready to go, a pretty good marketing + sales strategy and most important for a physical goods company--very, very low overhead. I feel like everything is firmly in place and working now, but it took quite a lot, including a lot of personal tragedy to get there.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I want to share my thoughts, mistakes, failures, successes so far, and talk about where I'm going now to get your ideas. Buckle up, this is gonna be long. Like, really long. If I was any more savvy I'd make a downloadable PDF with 5 quick summaries of this all just for the low-low-price of your email address, but I don't want to be publicly excoriated for self-promotion so...

&amp;#x200B;

We'll do it chronologically.

&amp;#x200B;

**BY -8 MONTHS FROM START:** 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory. I graduated college with a B.S. in Industrial Design after 8 long years sharing the top of the class podium with a few others, for one of the best classes my school had seen--ever. It was a spectacular opportunity to be surrounded and driven by so many other talented designers but I was pretty sick and tired of it all. Bitter, even. I had started out as a fine artist and had turned into a commercial machine. I drank too much, smoked a pack a day, my personal relationships were a mess. I freelanced. I started a business. Won and failed at that. I managed to pick up an actual staff job in my school (with awesome, awesome benefits) to make my way through it all to avoid debt, but I sacrificed everything else. I barely remembered my own graduation from how tired I was. 

&amp;#x200B;

And here's a little secret all recent minted industrial designers have: they fear that if they're really successful, they're just essentially sending a bunch of plastic trash to the landfill when it's all done with. We should have gone into UX. Massive existential crisis right there! A lot of guilt!

&amp;#x200B;

**BY -6 MONTHS:** 

&amp;#x200B;

I split with my girlfriend, left my super nice apartment, converted my subaru into a not-too-stealth adventure camper, and finally, finally got some sleep. I kept the school staff job for the healthcare, as even with part time I had accrued months of vacation. I took it and explored the entirety of the western united states. Pure joy.

&amp;#x200B;

**BY -1 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

After a few months of enjoying the moment, I started looking into the velvet black that we call ""the future"". Sometimes referred to as ""what am I going to do with my life"". I stopped the smoking and drinking and starting organizing everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to take a job and make somebody else money when my freelance rate was already 100/hr. I wanted to make stuff of substance, because I wanted to feel like I was a substantial person. I wanted to do it as sustainably as possible--which I felt was possible without that much extra effort. I wanted to save the world, blah blah blah. I really just didn't want to feel like the machine I'd been for years. I'm egotistical in that regard, I need to feel unique and special to exist. That'll come into play more later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of work, I have a deep passion for the outdoors, our planet overall. Its a very special thing in the universe. I've been known to disappear into the wilderness for weeks just to reset. Carl Sagan, Steve Irwin, Mr. Rogers are my only heroes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could I do something that they would be proud of, combined? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of businesses start with ""I want to make a lot of money"" or whatever, but passions are more important to me. I'm also lucky enough to say that because I've always had money...what's the saying? Money's like air, you only notice it when you don't have it? I'm quite thankful for it.

&amp;#x200B;

The other big reason I kept that school staff job--I have full access to the entire department. Laser cutters. Wood shops. 3D printers. Extensive online resources. Physical space...for free. FREE! In a major US city! And I only really had to work like...5 hours a week, tops. It would have been dumb to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had also been contacted and tapped to build out a new furniture company...and it fell through from the investors, but I felt like there was something there. I took my market research, my competitor research, initial proposals, and mixed it with my passions. Felt like making dynamite for the first time. I saw companies like FLOYD DETROIT that were really doing it. I saw the failures like Greycork and saw what not to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to start a furniture company that would be made out of plastic cleaned out of the ocean. It was gonna work.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few big problems to handle, if we're looking at the residential industry and not even talking about interior designers.

&amp;#x200B;

**On the customer side:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Furniture is big, people don't buy it often. 
* When they do buy, It's often tied into the stress of moving and people aren't in the best mood
*  Buying expensive, physical things on the internet without seeing them first is scary
* Most people don't really understand why a side table costs 300, or 700, or 20 dollars
* Most ""eco furniture"" made from recycled stuff is butt-ugly

&amp;#x200B;

**On the supplier side:**

&amp;#x200B;

* It's not something people buy often...so recurring customers are way less
* keeping stock means a lot of warehouse space. Build-to-order just takes too long or cuts it too close.
* You need massive physical investment + skilled labor to actually make the stuff
* Margins are typically super low, hovering around 4 percent or so. 
* Sourcing ocean plastic means you also have to set up that entire logistical chain

&amp;#x200B;

My angle was, if you take this worthless material and lock it away in a long-term product of value, it's much less likely to end up back in the dump. The people buying it get to make a legitimate difference. I would mark with every sale, ""you took 10 kg of plastic out of the ocean and paid for 2 peoples education who collected it"". Injection molded, even rotomolded furniture is also very quick to make compared to wood, albeit drastically higher startup costs. It would also be sold flat-packed online--my research was showing that channel was really taking off and gaining legitimacy across the board for ages and wages. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I began the design process and starting going balls-out, every day.

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 1 MONTH:** 

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly made a bunch of prototypes that would have been vastly expensive. I started aggressively using my instagram to build a target audience. I hired a marketing service on Fiverr to start bringing in traffic. I started posting up design process and just being incredibly transparent with what I was doing. My first business involved patenting, and licensing--from which I learned building a brand is more important than the legal piece of paper for security--when it comes to a ""style"" thing like furniture. 

&amp;#x200B;

What came out of that was a really simple furniture system. The legs would actually have threads cut right into the wood, and would screw right into a matching, full wood socket. This reduced my dependency on specialty hardware, as typical metal leg threads look too commmodity based. We were going for luxurious, unique stuff. And it also performs super well on social media within my audience. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 3 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

I designed and 3d printed workholding jigs to hold the components on my CNC router, and then designed and created a specialized thread cutter for my exact application. If somebody wanted to copy me, they could (and the idea isn't new anyway), but they wouldn't do it nearly as well as me. The system began to solidify. Things were designed with the raw materials and the processes in mind, to take rough lumber and bamboo plywood and turn it into a high end, CNC machined table within an hour of labor. It took quite a few weeks to find the right materials and suppliers--I wanted FSC certified hardwood. The table tops, I wanted the ease + strength of plywood without the ugly look. Gluing up hardwood boards into panels is very costly. Bamboo plywood came to save the day--I buy a sheet that's 1"" thick and can essentially mill in the joinery for the leg sockets on the bottom, cut out the shape, and be done, and not need to ""hide"" any plywood edges or anything. It's solid. It's good to go.

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 4 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

I threw a few up on my instagram to sell and see what would happen. For the most part, nothing...but then out of nowhere, somebody desperate to have one got in touch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly designed the packaging in CAD, placed an order for the boxes and cardboard from ULINE, drove there the next day, lasercut the packaging...and got the table in the mail. I shipped a table for 13 dollars, and paid 5 dollars for packaging. I recorded an ""unboxing"" video, posted it, and that got really crazy attention. When the customer got her package, she was ecstatic and posted her own unboxing all over her social media.

&amp;#x200B;

This started developing the notion of the experience in my head--the ""present"" or ""reward"". And it really gave me a taste of the type of person who would go nuts over my product. I looked up the zipcode to see the neighborhood and livestyle and noticed something interesting--all the houses were these gorgeous midcentury modern homes. I found the architect, looked up all the tracts he built, and saved all of them, as well as similar audiences for direct mail campaigns.

&amp;#x200B;

Interior designers were interested, and I got in contact with one of them for a photoshoot of LA-made local products. This was key, because I was a complete nobody that was all of a sudden sharing the same space as all the other veteran furniture people of LA. I got some great connections started with this. I also threw a few up on my instagram to sell and see what would happen. For the most part, nothing...but then out of nowhere, somebody desperate to have one got in touch. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 5 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

Let me mention that I'm still working out of the school, and in the shops. I started helping out in the furniture class pretty often as an unofficial T.A.--I wanted to placate anybody and everybody who might question this guy who stuck around after graduating and always has his projects everywhere in the shop. Students started coming to me for help with their projects often, and some of them discovered my instagram. I heard sheepish requests like ""if i could, uh, please maybe if you ever needed any work..y'know I could help you sand things...just in case"" and ""please I'll work for free I want to be a part of what you're doing.""

&amp;#x200B;

This was pretty powerful. Here I am, worried that I'm just in the way at the school, and it turns out everybody is just watching and secretly stoked. And slowly, I started taking over more of the shops. As I was staff...it wasn't too much of a problem...but I was riding on a thin line and I knew it. I wouldn't say I BRIBED anybody, but many coworkers did get free tables ""just because it was a little nicked, wouldn't feel comfortable selling it, yknow."" I definitely wanted to show my appreciation.

&amp;#x200B;

I started investing in more semi-industrial equipment and installing in the shop ""for the students"". Technically the truth. It was around this time that I finally hired a student that I had taken a liking to working with, that I had vetted through random freelance jobs over the last year. Outstanding individual with the same passion for doing good work as me, and was willing to put in the hard work. I had found my shop foreman. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've begun planning out, in MINUTE DETAIL, every minute it takes to do every task of production, over hundreds of repetition to get an average. Every piece of sandpaper is counted. Every saw blade, cutter, whatever, gets accounted for in a spread sheet and I start building out a price calculator to determine my prices. I discover I can achieve a 187% profit margin on manufacturing. Not bad, but this doesn't account truly for shop rent, or advertising--fuzzier numbers that are yet to be determined. I feel like it's a good start though.

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 6 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

Around this time, I also found my future wife. I'd like to point out I was still unabashedly living in my subaru as a dirty mountain man always covered in sawdust and smelling like the ocean. She was(is) a legit New Yorker going for her doctorate who, unabashedly, would never consider that an acceptable way of life for her. You would think we wouldn't work. But...when you see the one you've always been looking for, there's no other option. It's like you find another of yourself, and instead of a being a burden, it becomes a new freedom you never would have known existed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Work, obviously, slowed down a bit. My pace of working from sunrise to sunset was balanced with the new investment into her. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 7 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

Remember how I was also always in the shop, teaching furniture? One thing led to another, and I was made the offer to teach two sections of furniture design. I knew I would have regretted not taking the leap, even though it meant less work on my business. 

&amp;#x200B;

Work got even slower. Both the above commitments meant only focusing on the bare essentials. I had started to develop a storage system (like a flat-pack cabinet/shelving system) that I had to mothball as I got everything in life under control. I had gone from being bitter and tired, to being a happy house-less drifter, to becoming a figure of authority and maturity in my personal life. It was a lot for my personality, so I took my time. Business isn't everything, y'know. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 8 MONTHS: END OF OCTOBER. END OF MY OLD LIFE**

&amp;#x200B;

Saying this was a big month was an understatement, in the worst way possible. My life, and many others changed suddenly and viciously on October 30th, 2018. My shop assistant, the one I had planned on making into my foreman, the one I became a mentor to, the one I was going to make rich and successful--she died after falling into a median and getting run over after a fight with a friend at a halloween party. I was happily carving pumpkins and on top of the world with my new life when I noticed a few missed calls from faculty. Then my boss. Then the department chair. Something had happened--either somebody got hurt real bad and/or the shop was on fire. I finished what I was doing, sat on the couch, and took the call.

&amp;#x200B;

The very next morning, I went into my shop and cleared out her project materials left over the weekend that she never got a chance to put away. I felt as thin as the dim morning light coming through the windows. 

&amp;#x200B;

An hour later as my students came in to class, not fully knowing the details but knowing something terrible had happened. I didn't know what to do, for the first time in my life I froze and broke down in front of my class as I announced it. Her best friend was in the class--when my eyes met hers, I lost all chance of composure. I apologized and in the silence, said we all needed some fresh air. Something inside me broke that day, and something else started growing in its place.

&amp;#x200B;

That death hit doubly hard, because two years prior, I had also lost a friend in a terrorist attack. Another star student. 

&amp;#x200B;

We held a large memorial attended by hundreds, and I said a few nice words to all of them up on the podium, made them smile, and many people thanked me and told me how much she looked up to me. Most of them didn't also know how much I also looked up to her. It was so soul crushing and I definitely had a personality crisis on my hands that needed handling. Everything stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

**...BY 11 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

I started picking it up again. I had to keep moving, to keep my mind off of everything. Little steps. Too anxious. I found a great local supplier of professionally milled lumber, straight from local trees taken out by storms, construction, whatever. Essentially, reclaimed wood but new. This was a major break for me and I bought a shitload to turn into leg hardware. I also committed to a large hardwood purchase of the other species I wanted, Walnut and paint-grade maple to be painted to the designers taste. A little color started coming back into life, even if it was a little lonelier.

&amp;#x200B;

**By 12 MONTHS:** 

&amp;#x200B;

I breezed through my year anniversary without noticing it. My instagram had turned into daily shop posts, and had a few thousand followers. Engagement was high, videos would get hundreds of likes and thousands of views. An initial run of 180 table legs and 60 table tops was well underway. I started also picking up good freelance jobs for CNC milling and design, which helped fund the business and pay people. I picked up a new intern. She wasnt...you-know-who...but she was helpful. I've been asked by the school to design a plaque commemorating it.

&amp;#x200B;

**By 13 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

The website was launched quietly without fuss. I decided on shopify to build everything, and refreshed my knowledge on CSS to create something special. I focused on turning this into a funnel with everything pointing to the two initial offerings--the round side tables. Lots of great feedback from people, lots of excitement over everything. I'm feeling good. I've been distracting myself with freelance to avoid dealing with the things my assistant was handling for me. I start to take deep breaths and start to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 14 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been spending more weeks out in the desert, after a big influx of freelance work. It's time to finish the table legs and socket hardware, and start cutting the table tops. I begin thinking of creating a S.O.M of all the things required to make the tables, so I can either step back or sell it entirely. I also buy a 3d printer and start playing around with it as a creative outlet, and to see if I can work it into my original ocean plastic goal. You can see very clearly that got put on the backburner, with the goal of survival and profitability taking over. I lost so much flame for very good reasons, and I did everything I could to keep the pilot light burning. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 15 MONTHS:**

&amp;#x200B;

I've developed a beautiful series of lamps harkening back to my studio days. They do well on instagram. I'm feeling some old spark as new things grow over old scars. I realize that these lamps have very, very profitable margins and start looking into it. Who else is in this space? How much would a farm of machines cost? How to market? I've begun to pick up steam again, I'm almost through my second semester of teaching. I feel old.

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 16 MONTHS:** 

&amp;#x200B;

Finishing processes have begun for all the wooden components. This is by far the trickiest part of my whole manufacturing business. To correctly seal wood usually takes a long process and many coats, but I develop some special processes and find some great, industry leading processes. I can have 90 table legs finished and cured in 5 days. This is big. I begin to develop the storage solutions for all this product as all of this stuff is taking up a lot of space. It's worked into my social media strategy--the manufacturing is all very transparent, so everything has to look super slick. Even the work carts. This is also to start stablishing my business culture for future employees--self manufacturing means it's a necessity. I've reduced my need for labor down to machine loading, sanding, and spray finishing. Almost no highly skilled labor is required to create one of my tables, which is a testament to modern industrial manufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

I secure a loan to buy a key part of equipment to grow my business--a professional grade CNC router. This is a game changer. My profit margin shoots through the roof with this puppy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 17 MONTHS:** 

&amp;#x200B;

I've finished the plaque for my assistant. She would have graduated this month. Summer starts, I've started going to therapy, and I'm exploding with productivity once again. In two weeks I get done what has taken me 4 months. I was just so afraid to pick it up again. When she died, I felt punished for trying to start my own company and becoming a mentor figure. I realized I didn't want any more employees and I retreated from forming new partnerships. I'm glad I took time to retreat and don't regret the time. Now I've been working on tables daily, and on lamps nightly. I take my future wife out for dinner often and take her for a Porche track day for her birthday. She's been an amazing support and I don't think I could have gotten through without her.

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 18 MONTHS (NOW):**

&amp;#x200B;

All 60 table tops and 180 legs are done. Packaging is finalized. I've fully committed and the brand is firmly planted in it's identity and purpose. I've always felt like if I could figure out how to sell high price tables, I could sell anything--and I feel like I've done it in a way that pleases my two main customers. I've decided to use the fact that I'm a small studio with scarce resources to my advantage--only a select few get the ""privelege"" of attaining my stuff. I want to drive up demand by the lack of supply. I want only the most fervent believers to be getting my stuff, and all the rest get nothing. I've begun negotiating better rates with my suppliers and vendors, to pretty good success. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still working out of the school shop, rent free. My total overhead right now, including my initial PPC market testing budget, is 270 dollars a month. I've managed to work out all the kinks in the manufacturing and achieve 200% margins. I've started to determine my maximum monthly thoroughput and it's looking promising. I start throwing up teasers of future products up on the site. Let's look at that initial list of problems and how we solved it.

&amp;#x200B;

**On the customer side:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Furniture is big, people don't buy it often. --make it minimal, make it durable, make it timeless.
* When they do buy, It's often tied into the stress of moving and people aren't in the best mood --find the people excited to move. The travelers. The new homeowners. The fresh-starters.
* Buying expensive, physical things on the internet without seeing them first is scary --Some people really enjoy that scariness. Early adopters should be rewarded for their bravery.
* Most people don't really understand why a side table costs 300, or 700, or 20 dollars --educate in excruciating detail, daily, with social media on everything happening in every product
* Most ""eco furniture"" made from recycled stuff is butt-ugly --make it not so butt ugly, listen to the cutting edge in trends and what those early adopters buy

&amp;#x200B;

**On the supplier side:**

&amp;#x200B;

* It's not something people buy often...so recurring customers are way less --set up the marketing funnel as more of a brand that people can be loyal to. Then a variety of products can be sold
* keeping stock means a lot of warehouse space. Build-to-order just takes too long or cuts it too close. --Keep everything component based and highly compact, so even fulfillment services can handle it
* You need massive physical investment + skilled labor to actually make the stuff --break every single thing into smaller, and smaller bits until its all basic and simple, and DOCUMENTED.
* Margins are typically super low, hovering around 4 percent or so. --make it luxury, make it special and rare to own, make it amazing and worth it
* Sourcing ocean plastic means you also have to set up that entire logistical chain --uhh...hold off on this until all the above is ready...haha. This kind of ""social product"" can, at least for me, just be from too much guilt, in a sense. Like, this is the new form of the church selling indulgences. I realize now this is a much bigger issue and selling a few fancy tables might not be how I want to handle it.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHERE TO GO FROM HERE?**

&amp;#x200B;

It's obviously been a very eventful year and a half, with some pivots. I've started a ""soft launch"" with very limited marketing spends to start seeing what sticks. I have a rollout plan-of-attack consisting of contacts at relevant design blogs and news sites. My CNC machining service has really exploded which has paid for everything already, but I'm going to break that off into it's own thing and automate it even more. I've started approaching instagram influencers and relevant pages. I'm going to start teasing collaborative designs made with bigger brands. I'm going to do a photoshoot of product out in the desert and then will come the press release and official launch. I have a long term goal of doing more content marketing--I have such a wealth of knowledge in my industry that I'd like to share, and being a teacher has really shown me how to present it. Selling luxury furniture is really a ""farming"" over ""hunting"" technique of sales. It's much more long term. And I think I'm just going to keep at it. The ocean plastic thing has definitely taken a backseat as I've realized this is more about building a brand first, and the interior design contract market. It'll come. I'll keep hustling, and none of it will come at the cost of personal relationships or health. No more of that for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoyed writing this for the venting aspect, so even if nobody reads it, I still got to lay it all out in front. I would like to hear your feedback or any tips you have, but I might go hide under a rock after posting this from the feeling of public indecency from sharing so much. I'm posting this because I understand the power of networking, and community. I like coming on to the forum and blowing off some steam, answering questions, without all the fuss of negotiating pay schedules or contracts. Pro bono stuff in a sense, it feels good. So, I hope I can contribute.

&amp;#x200B;

bznhib,1,2019-06-12,Your experiences with the Google phone interview,tallololol,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/bznhib/your_experiences_with_the_google_phone_interview/,"I have an upcoming phone interview for a Google internship, and wanted to know roughly what the experience was like for those of you who've been through it before.

It seems like the interviewers want me to write my code in a shared Google Doc. What are your thoughts on writing rough notes in the doc alongside the code? When I solve programming problems I like to jot down notes and draw diagrams, so I figured that letting them see these notes would help to explain my thought process. Is this a good idea, or is it better to just explain your thoughts out loud?

Also, during the interview, I'd like to run my code in an IDE or whatever so that I can check for compilation errors and run some test cases. Is doing this allowed/expected by the interviewers? I hear that for some Google phone interviews, an online IDE is used instead of a Google Doc."
bznztp,2,2019-06-12,First time changing jobs,danielhra,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bznztp/first_time_changing_jobs/,"Hey everybody, sorry for formatting since I'm on mobile.

So to give a bit of background I'm a computer science major on my last year of school. I've been doing an internship in a startup since September of last year and I've had a couple talks with my boss in which I reviewed the company and he gave me feedback. 

In most of this reviews being the newbie that I am I talked mostly positive things and affirmed him that I would love to get a full time job there since I loved what they were doing and such, we also discussed payment and given my lack of knowledge at the time I settled for a  lower sum than the rest of the market.

Fast forward to now and I'm very close to sign a contract within the next month, but since I did some research I decided to go and do some other job interviews to see what other things were out there. I got accepted in another company that seems to share the same principles that I value and the pay was significantly higher.

So right now I feel like it would be a bit of a dick move if I took this other job given that I've told my former company that I was very happy with them and would love to work for them. On the other hand I think that I would grow much more as a professional in the second company.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

# Demographics and Major
Nationality: Indian

Citizenship: India (international)

Sex: Male

Income: $80-100k

Major: Computer Science (fuck)

Financial aid: Need aid (can afford up to $20k a year)

# Academics

GPA [speculative]: 4.0 based on some stupid online calculator, but the breakup is AAA in AS levels Physics, Chemistry and Math. I'm taking Computer Science and English Language in October and expect an A in both of those too, but results only come out Jan2020, so it doesn't matter in this case (unless I can get a good predicted grade for them maybe?). Fucked up real bad in 9th grade but have been on a huge upward trajectory compared to then.

APs [spectulative, probably won't submit any]: 4/5 English Language, 2/3 Computer Science A, 1/2 Biology. I didn't study at all because it was at the same time as my AS levels, I know, I'm retarded.

SAT I: 1470 (760RW, 710M) --&gt; 1510 (770RW, 740M)

SAT II : 750+ Chemistry [haven't received yet but quite confident], 720 Math II, 670 Physics [not submitting, didn't study L O L]

# Awards 

* Third place in an AI idea competition hosted by a large corp, reward worth around $7500

* Approved freelancer on a site which receives 10k applications a day (not sure how many they approve quantitatively, but definitely less than a quarter)

* 3 Udemy course completion certificates (one for python, another for ML, and finally one for DL).

* School gold medalist in English Olympiad

* ICE certificate to show well-roundedness in 10th grade.

* First place in school cook off lmao

# ECs
* Sole author of a research paper in AI that took over a year of effort. Had to use Python libraries and LaTeX to do the whole thing from scratch. It was reviewed and approved by professors of the objectively most prestigious university in my country. It's pending approval by a journal, but the decision likely won't be in time. Clearly this is my spike.

* Reddit moderator of 30 communities with a total count of &gt;35 million users. Yes bois, I'm gay. I put in ~1 hour/day for 9 months now and worked by way up through the ""ranks"" (yes, it's that stupid) where I eventually was in charge of supervising others mods, reviewing moderator applications, training new mods, etc. This is also why I'm using a throwaway, too many people know my other account (~130k virgin points).

* Designed an AI bot used by multiple mod teams to moderate over millions of users, and also configure automod for various subs. No, I don't get paid. Yes, the bot is open source and on my Github. This is related to the one above, but I've decided to add it separately since it covers a more relevant aspect of the EC to my major (is this a bad idea?).

* Earned some smol $$$ off fiverr by offering my services to write short scripts (the computer kind) for people who need them for minor tasks. Emphasizing on how small scale this is because I used it to learn and polish my Python.


* 2 month unpaid remote internship at a tech startup as a digital marketer.
* MUN. Best delegate for 2-3 conferences, chaired 2 conferences, was in the organizing committee of another.

* Self taught in lots of computer stuff, e.g., programming, ML, high performance computing, managing freelancers for projects, messing up and repairing hard drives, drones, satellites, etc. Keep in mind that most of these have no results to show for, they are just things I was curious about learning but spent substantial amounts of time on. There's like a couple course certificates (mentioned in awards), but it's not too special.

# Essays and recs

I plan to write about my experience with horrible time management and how I combated it along with my addiction to video games/the internet.

Recs won't be super amazing, but I'm definitely amongst the more liked ""good kid"" students in the class. I might be able to rope in the prof at the uni to give one too. The tech startup I interned at also have offered a generic LoR, something is better than nothing I guess.

# Concluding remarks
I'm not ignorant enough to say that I'm your average applicant, in fact I'm aware I'm quite above the average. However, all that goes down the drain when it comes to my demographic: Indian male CS international applying to Cornell ED who needs financial aid, which is why I've made this post (maybe I'll try applying ED somewhere else in the case that I stand little to no chance).

Some other things I'd like help with:

* I don't have a college counselor in my high school, so wth should I do on that front?
* I have to decide between a retake of my SAT subject tests which are below average and my SAT which is apparently is not ""T20 level"" (lots of people have told me 1540+ is where the game is played and honestly after looking at r/collegeresults that's what I'm beginning to think as well) in October, which one would you guys suggest?

I accepted a great job out of college and have been working here for about 2 months. It is at a SaaS company and their software is a web development tool. My role is doing IT work, but more recently I have dabbling in the Application Support side of things and realized how interesting I find HTML+CSS+JavaScript. The past week I have been learning about this stuff and made me realize my passion and heart isn't in IT Support anymore and maybe want to pick up some coding skills to make a shift in my career.

&amp;#x200B;

This led me to Lambda School and seeing that I can take classes fully online and still be able to work during the day... this got me intrigued. My only doubt I have at the moment is the 17% fee for 2 years worth of salary. I'll be honest... right now I am making $25/hr in my current job. The money is nice and I don't have many expenses besides my rent/utilities which is about $950 monthly and my personal expenses (food, shopping, etc.). I live pretty frugally and have a steady amount of money left over to save or invest.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is basically is it worth it dedicate the time to go to Lambda School part time and get a job... then have to pay a big chunk of my salary back and add an expense that I don't already have monthly? I didn't graduate college with student debt... so it's basically tacking on student debt to my salary which I don't have now.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked around my area (South FL) for Junior Developer roles and they are in the 60k-70k range. I am not really in a ""tech"" area so jobs are kind of scarce. That's a jump from my current salary.... but then I have to give 17% of it back to Lambda. This will even out to what I am currently making or if not less then what I am making.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my overall question is... is it worth it? I read stories where people are working $10/hr retail jobs and then after Lamba School they jump to making $60,000 a year. I am lucky enough to not be in that situation... but my goal for this to be a ""career boost"" to my background and Bachelors degree rather than a total career change (like from construction -&gt; web developer)."

Just found out earlier today that the project I'm working on is a competition and the client will be picking the one with the highest accuracy. Boss is expecting me to get 99% while I'm sitting here with 80%, I'd argue it's 95% when considering only the data that's plausible enough for the model, but it doesn't matter now if I'm competing against others.

This is my first time dealing with ML. I was told they'd help me learn it but these 2 weeks I've had to self learn everything. It seems like the company's in a bit of a problem, senior devs just left these past few months so the only left are juniors and my boss. He's the only one here that's experienced in ML but he's incredibly busy, most days he comes and leaves within 30 min.

I've got to submit my results in 1-2 days, but I've been stuck these past few days to improve it. I've been googling nonstop, whatever advice my boss gave didn't work either, don't know if I'm terrible or the advice wasn't good. Apparently tesseract ocr on their default dataset can handle handwriting? Cause it's giving me gibberish instead, but he said that it can probably do a better job than my ML model.

There's no way we're getting this project, I just started and I'm about to fail my internship. Would really appreciate any advice on what I can do now."

So to give a bit of background I'm a computer science major on my last year of school. I've been doing an internship in a startup since September of last year and I've had a couple talks with my boss in which I reviewed the company and he gave me feedback. 

In most of this reviews being the newbie that I am I talked mostly positive things and affirmed him that I would love to get a full time job there since I loved what they were doing and such, we also discussed payment and given my lack of knowledge at the time I settled for a  lower sum than the rest of the market.

Fast forward to now and I'm very close to sign a contract within the next month, but since I did some research I decided to go and do some other job interviews to see what other things were out there. I got accepted in another company that seems to share the same principles that I value and the pay was significantly higher.

So right now I feel like it would be a bit of a dick move if I took this other job given that I've told my former company that I was very happy with them and would love to work for them. On the other hand I think that I would grow much more as a professional in the second company.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"
bzu0a6,1,2019-06-12,I can't get over my fear of commitment and I'm frustrated.,ApparentlyAiden,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bzu0a6/i_cant_get_over_my_fear_of_commitment_and_im/,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, y'all. I want to preface this by saying that it's hard for me to really know exactly what I'm so ""aaaahhhhh"" about, so this may be a bit ramble-y. Apologies in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an 18-year-old male, going to start my sophomore year of college in the fall. I'm studying communication and might want to go into news broadcasting or production of some kind. I currently have an internship with a local news station and I enjoy doing the promotions for it, but I also really want to be in front of the camera. 

Theoretically, maybe I would want to be an anchor for a large news organization like CNN. I'm not passionate about local news and I don't want to do production anymore - sitting in a dark room and pressing a few buttons for a career doesn't seem that fun to me. 

The other issue is that I absolutely hate NYC, but I would likely have to move there if I worked as an anchor with CNN's main office. So my possible career path is conflicted with where I would likely have to live. 

It's a super stressful situation though because there isn't a ton of money in this field, as far as I can tell. Our 70+-year-old newsman told me not to go into this field because, ""nobody in this building makes any money."" So it's either make it big and move to NYC, or not be very financially comfortable. This contradiction is terrifying but I don't want to give up on my major and my possible plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating my girlfriend for about four and a half months now and I really like her and enjoy spending time with her. She's my first girlfriend but I do really want this relationship to work out. I have no reason why it wouldn't right now. But even typing this out has me a bit uncomfortable because I am so terrified of commitment. It took WEEKS for me to even get over my fear of fucking things up and finally asking her out. 

On the other hand, she seems to be okay with commitment. She's able to say things about ""in a few years"" and that kind of thing, and I want to be able to do that too, but I simply can't and I'm frustrated with myself. I have no intention of breaking up with her and I really want this relationship to last for a long time, but I can't even picture my own future so it's tough to picture something that I don't even have 100% planned for myself. I also don't want to make her change her plans for me, if things do work out. She might want to stay in the state where we go to school and work, but if things work out between us one of us is going to have to live somewhere we don't want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so terrified of commitment and it's exhausting. I want to be able to get over that fear of the future and the fact that I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I can't even commit to a future for myself, much less one of building a life together with another person. And I know the relationship is super young, I'm not really asking if the relationship will work out or whatever. My primary concern is the fact that I am terrified of any sort of commitment with relationships or with my career and I want to get over that. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get over my fear of commitment so that I can best live my life? How can I work to get over this fear of making a plan and become more emotionally available? I don't know why I'm protecting my heart so much from someone that I trust. This is frustrating and I'm sick of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - I am terrified of commitment and I don't know how to get over that fear. I can't even picture my future past the next 3-4 years and I want to be able to look forward to a career and loving relationship, but I am emotionally blocked for some reason that I can't pinpoint or overcome. How can I overstep this?"

One year ago, I was denied from every private ""top school"" that I applied to. Very sad and utterly discouraged by the results, I even considered taking a gap year just to reapply to these ""top schools"".

I made a huge post on here (I had to delete this after someone doxxed my name). Btw thank you to all the people in comments and PM's who said a lot of amazing supportive words back then.

In the end, I went to a competitive public school that I got into and tried to make it my new home, got involved in campus activities, and met hundreds of cool people! And when the time came, I finally got INCREDIBLY lucky with transferring!

**HS stats:**

1590 SAT; 35 ACT (36 super); 800 Math2; 800 Physics; four 4's and two 5's on AP's;  3.85 UW GPA (white male, not international).

**EC's:** 

Intel ISEF Best of Category/1st place, 4 special awards (senior year, after college apps)

**College**:

Undergrad research involvement, Environmental awareness club on campus, continued piano, captain of my soccer team, an internship at a ""technology in education"" company (there aren't many ""national awards"" for college freshmen lol)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

All in all, going through this full admission process twice has made me realize a lot of little things about ""elite admissions"" and the process.

Remember, f you don't get what you wanted the first time around, you CAN carefully analyze your mistakes and fix them, even in the world of top-school admissions. More importantly, real life only begins in college, with job searching, making connections and friendships, and a million other things. It took me a whole year to finally internalize that the school you go to really does not define you, certain colleges just make it easier to achieve certain goals and meet certain people, but your experience can be vastly different depending on what you do :)

I also want to say a HUGE thank you to the amazing people on A2C, particularly ScholarGrade, FeatOfClay, AdmissionsMom, and WilliamTheReader.

bzug1s,3,2019-06-12,I collected 9 different blue screen Errors and I want it to stop,justBarcley,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/bzug1s/i_collected_9_different_blue_screen_errors_and_i/,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

Let me state first that I know very little about computers and how they work, but I'm eager to learn if you help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a PC built by Mindfactory, out of pieces a good friend of mine told me to use (because he built PCs and has more experience than I - why should I do stuff I don't know shit about when I know people who do). I got a list we created together in thought of what I wanted to do with the Computer and I collected the items in the Mindfactory store and got my built PC. It was sent on nOctober 22nd 2017.

I will insert a list of the components that are built into my computer at the end of this post.

Since I got my computer almost 2 years ago, it always had its share of problems. When setting up it already made some trouble but again, with the help of another person that is clearly better at computer stuff than I am, we got it to work. The only problem were occasional blue screens and freezes (forcing me to restart the computer) but that was less of a problem because I was mostly happy to finally be able to play again after a long period with a ... ""decent"" setup.

But by now the problems are super annoying.

I'm mostly a leauge of legends player, but of course I play other games too. The worst games were Witcher 3, where I had to expect a problem (that forced me to restart Witcher and sometimes the computer) probably every 2 hours and at the moment a big one is Dota Autochess (where I have to restart Dota multiple times per match, but so far no blue screen there).

League of Legends itself runs smoothly, with an occasional bug splat (I'd say every \~5 games) and between zero and two bluescreens a day.

At this point the unpredictability is the worst. So I decided to ask you guys for help.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to fotograph every bluescreen I got but sadly didn't catch that many because often the bluescreen would just finish loading and vanish before I found my phone, but I found 9 unique bluescreens that were probably all the cause of mulitple problems.

These are the bluescreens in an imgur album:

[imgur.com/a/HkPFPf6](https://imgur.com/a/HkPFPf6)

The messages are in German, but the problem codes should be universal. Here's the exceptions I red from the photos:

System Service Exception (reason: win32kfull.sys)  
Unexpected Kernel Mode Trap (reason: amdppm.sys)  
System Service Exception (reason: dxgkrnl.sys)  
Driver Irql Not Less Or Equal (reason: dxgmms2.sys)   
Pfn List Corrupt  
Store Data Structure Corruption  
System Service Exception  
Page Fault In Nonpaged Area  
Irql Not Less Or Equal

&amp;#x200B;

If I misswrote any of these problems, please excuse me, I tried to read them from the photos as good as possible. You can also see for yourself in the album.

I don't know what the problem is but I wouldn't expect to know. I already checked everything for new drivers, also had the whole Windows setup again before, but both didn't help.

If you know what I could do or have an idea what the problem is - I'd be absolutely delighted.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a list of the components that are inside my computer:

\- CPU AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6x 3.60GHz So.AM4 WOF  
\- MB Asus Prime X370-Pro AMD X370 So.AM4 Dual Channel DDR4 ATX  
\- CPUK be quiet! Dark Rock 3 Tower Kühler (Kühler = Cooler)  
\- DDR4 16 GB (2x 8192MB) G.Skill RipJaws V schwarz DDR4-3200 DIMM  
\- VGA 8GB KFA2 GeForce GTX 1070 EX Aktiv PCIe 3.0 x16 1xDVI/  
\- SSD 250GB Samsung 960 Evo M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 32Gb/s  
\- HDSA 1000GB Seagate BarraCuda ST1000DM010 7.200U/min 64MB  
\- PSU 500 Watt be quiet! Straight Power 10 CM Modular 80+ Gold  
\- DVDW LG Electronics GH24NSD1 DVD-Writer SATA intern schwarz (schwarz = black)

I have bought one of every of those components together with a package that made them built the computer and (if I remember correctly) test all the drivers before uninstalling them again.

I'm running Windows 10 on it.  


I really hope you can help me.

Thanks in advance. &lt;3"

I am also still working my retail job so will have to give 2 weeks notice before I start anywhere else."

(Like B.S.) in CompSci and Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology (It's a tier 2/3 uni in India by rankings but absolutely comparable to top-tier in research,infra and academics, pretty respected afaik).
RN in 2nd Year going to 3rd (it's a four year course). 

I have decent web dev knowledge, on the frontend can work with React and Angular and on the backend I'm good at PHP, Django and ASP.NET
Also a Python developer in the sense that I use Python to automate tasks. Have some game dev knowledge. Good UI/UX and design knowledge.

GPA is out of 10 and presently I stand at about 5-6, though after this summer, I'll be at 7-8.

Have completed one proper internship where I developed an ecommerce portal from scratch in a month, working on a marketing agency startup, plan to write a paper in AR very soon (almost done with basics).

Other activities apart from CS are good enough, but I do them for me not for the CV so nothing too good.

Why I wanna go to specifically NYC?
It's been a dream for long. I come from Mumbai, and I wanna see NYC since I was in 10th on my own money. Any other city in USA is fine or even any European country, but NYC is the center of the world.

So the final question is pretty much the title.
How do I do it?

Well, I think I have lots of those under my belt, but I’m wondering why it’s so hard to get a Software Engineering internship at a reputable company still.  I’ve already had an internship for Software Engineering, and it’s a pretty good company and is an ISP for the state, but it’s a local company and no one really outside of my state has heard of it.  

I have plenty of side projects that I’ve worked on and linked to GitHub.  I’ve worked on them outside of academics just because I felt like it to practice my skills.  

My GPA is a 3.89 and I’m a junior which I think is pretty good, but I’m pretty sure employers rank me down to like a 3.20 since I don’t go to an Ivy League school and instead go to my massive state college.  

I have become good friends with my professors and have received recommendation letters from them which I’ve heard is a good thing to have.

I have found it achievable to get Software Engineering internships locally within my state, however, I’m pretty sure tech companies out in the west coast and in the north do not even take a look at my resume because I’ve never gotten a call back out of the 20 I’ve applied to.  Yet people at ivy leagues with no internships under their belt and average gpa’s get a huge advantage because companies actually go and visit them for job fairs and such.  They basically get a free screening just for attending that college.  My resume is lost within the 10,000 applicants.  

So my question is, is it really possible to get a Software Engineering internship over an online submission or is it basically impossible no matter what I do and should consider switching colleges?"

Strong extracurricular experience (finance club, leadership in other clubs, fraternity). Interned at a startup last summer doing ops and will this summer at a similar consumer goods venture with substantial financial backing. Very lucky in that regard!

Incredibly interested in bonds/debt of all kinds, and ultimately have the goal of being a cfo at a public cpg company. 

Ive felt incredibly depressed and disappointed the last few months having such a low gpa and seeing friends start internships at IB BBs (though very happy for them!). 

Do you have any advice for some kind of career path that could help me garner financial acumen? Ive been considering taking the CFA exam but have no desire to end up in equity research. Would be open to any kind of role in trading, accounting, corporate rotation program... where should i look?

This is probably going to be a fairly long story only because I think the context is important in order to understand the situation. Anyway, I’ll get right into it.

One of the first people I met at the company was this guy I’ll call “Rick”. It’s easy to tell that he has a very unconventional, sarcastic sense of humor and you’re meant to take everything he says with a grain of salt. Up until this one day I never really had any issues with him and actually started to be friends with him. We would go out for lunch sometimes with another coworker I’ll call “Joe”.

One day in April, I was at work late and there weren’t that many people left in the office. I was getting ready to head home when I remembered that I needed a specific code to charge my work hours to. I went over to Rick’s desk and asked him for the code I needed. Rick started searching for the code on his computer and in the meantime asked me if I wanted to get dinner with him and Joe. I said that it was already pretty late so I should just go home. Rick offered to drive me to the restaurant and back but I was still pretty reluctant. He started joking that he wouldn’t give me the code I needed unless I agreed to go with him and then he covered up the code on his computer screen so I couldn’t see it. I finally just agreed to go to dinner since I needed to eat something anyway. We met Joe at the restaurant and after a fairly awkward dinner, Rick and I drove back to the office. We passed by a dam and Rick started joking that it would be a perfect place to hide a body and that if he killed me that’s where he’d throw my body away. I awkwardly laughed and changed the subject. He started driving in a direction that I didn’t recognize so I asked him if we were going back to the office. Rick sarcastically replied that no, we were going back to his house. I again awkwardly laughed but he kept joking and said “it’s alright if you spent the night at my house right? It’s kind of far to the office so I’ll just take you back to work in the morning”. I again quickly changed the subject and he drove us back to the office.

After the weekend passed, I thought about the interaction more and realized how uncomfortable that whole evening made me feel. Rick one day decided to tell me that everything he says has some amount of truth in it and I replied that everything he's said to me is kind of disturbing then. I decided that I didn’t really want to continue being friends with Rick after that and since then I’ve tried to keep my distance and not really engage him in conversation. I don’t think he’s really gotten the message because he continues to say similar things to me in the office that personally I think crosses a line. I only have a couple weeks left in my internship now but I’m still bothered by the things Rick has said to me. Part of me thinks I should just leave the situation alone and just try my best to ignore what Rick says for the remainder of my time there and the other part thinks I should maybe tell my supervisor what’s been going on. I’m finding it hard to gauge if this situation is serious enough to merit me reporting him to my supervisor and I was hoping for maybe some input to help me make a decision.

TL;DR A coworker joked about blackmailing me, killing me, and kidnapping me and I'm not sure what to do about it"

I'm a 21 year old junior who's in an FP&amp;A internship this summer at a F500 IT company. I didn't get a tour of the building before signing the contract, but I've been here for a month now and I still can't get over sitting in a gray cubicle with metal desk drawers 40 hours/wk. I would've accepted the job regardless, but every day I feel so secluded and it's so depressing. It's straight out of the 1990s movie, Office Space. Yes, I do walk around and I have networked and made very good relations with a solid dozen people (and counting). On my own I've set up 3 networking lunches already with people, so *I* haven't secluded myself. Sitting in a cubicle does a good job in doing so though.

Again, maybe I'm naive for having this idea in my head from watching The Office and seeing TV commercials how modern companies have a fun &amp; open office spaces, but boy it is so depressing at times. At the very least I'd expect my team would be seated next to eachother, but we're all spread out and unless I walk to their office/cubicle I'd never see them unless they came to me.

And I don't mean to sound like a bitch. I love the job and am so grateful for this opportunity, but cubicles are just one thing I cannot get over.

Anyone else feel the same way? Do most companies still have cubicles? Should I stop being a little bitch?"

I have worked with this company for on and off for 2 years, out of state in MD ( I'm in GA). I have known them since we attended and went to college together from 2012.

 I was more of a background designer in 2017, when they set up their first business. They worked with another until he quit in 2018 and i took the main postion.

However, payment has always been late due to the reliance of other clients. I have often got payments received 2 months after initial invoice. And this is where I made the mistake of consistently doing work, on time, and only providing an invoice after the previous invoice had been paid. So of course, there was a backlog quickly building to a tune of around $4000.

I heard nothing from them until tax season this year. And a promise of better communication, and ""reparations"" of $500 in April, and another payment in May, and so forth until the $4000 is paid. With current invoices being paid. 
They told me that there business is not doing so well, and are currently struggling and that they will, ""promise to pay"". However money isn't always constant due to seasons largely dependent on fishing and tourism. 

However, as they hire multiple interns and set up 2 new businesses, I have recieved less and less communication and work from them, with less qualified people doing the work. I have sent a total of one invoice this year (at the beginning of April, for March's work), with the outstanding $4000.

I have contact them multiple times, with no reply. They bought a new house, and are expecting a baby sometime later this year and I understand that their business is struggling and this will most likely burn that friendship and working with them.  

Is there any advice on how to approach getting what is owed? Or am I moving too quickly for a large amount of money?
Thank you."

But, sometimes they'll be (very nicely) explaining concepts to me and I'm just sitting there thinking that I will never be able to be so organically knowledgeable about Software Dev.

I also sometimes convince myself that I only got this internship because I was a good-looking young Hispanic woman, not even so much for my talents. Which only brings me down more.

c00d8z,0,2019-06-12,Considering dumping current business for much bigger idea.,CUDAcores89,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/c00d8z/considering_dumping_current_business_for_much/,"Hey reddit. I was wondering if this idea was worth pursuing.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 20yo attending college and currently have an internship over the summer with a large company.

&amp;#x200B;

I run a business outside work buying computers and parts from recycling centers, scrap yards, junk yards, and asset liquidation companies then resell them. The business has made some money so far and we can definitely grow from here. We currently go around to 4 different scrap yards and two junk removal companies in our area to obtain PCs and parts.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is this isn't a new idea, at all. There are many, MANY small businesses across the world that do this. Just search for ""ITAD"" or ""IT asset disposal"" and you will know what I am talking about. Some these places are tiny and have a 1-2 employees (my business), other places are massive warehouses full of dozens of people and tens of thousands of square feet of warehouse space all essentially doing the same thing: Buying computers that are still worth something for pennies, refurbishing them, then reselling them.

&amp;#x200B;

What we do different is target scrap cards and recycling centers. Scrap yards also receive e-waste as well, but it's generally a tedious process since you are dealing with anywhere from 1-5 computers here and there. Meanwhile my competitors are targeting large offices and hospitals because they have spent the hundreds of thousands of dollars on the certifications required to do data destruction that we don't have the cash-flow for.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so You can find good computer parts at scrap yards right?

&amp;#x200B;

And there are ITADs out there who resell computer parts right?

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is these scrap yards obviously have no time to comb through everything, which is what I have primarily been doing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the idea: Build a machine that can sort the ""good"" scrap from the ""bad"". The ""good"" scrap (the stuff with reuse value) is sold to ITADs, and the ""bad"" stuff stays in the scrap yard. If a machine could theoretically sort through computer memory and processors, a scrap yard could easily create an additional revenue stream worth tens of thousands of dollars a month. We would sell the machine and SaaS software to the scrapyard, then connect the scrapyard with a list of ITADs who would then bid on the hardware the machine found. The ITADs would get an additional source of computers and parts to resell, and the scrapyard would end up with an additional source of revenue. Here is the genius parts of all this:

&amp;#x200B;

My business doesn't have to test any hardware, the ITADs will do that and assume the risk (the risk is very low. 90% of all hardware I pull from scrapyards still works absolutely fine). I no longer have to go digging through scrapyards for myself since this is an inefficient process. Our business would just be a ""connector"" and we would simply facilitate the buying and selling of computer hardware. We would keep the software updated to track market trends, and the scrapyards and ITADs would handle everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

We could start with the easy stuff, CPUs and memory. In theory we would have a machine that could sort memory into categories like  ""DDR3, DDR4"" and discard everything older to be recycled. You could do this with CPUs as well. core i7s can be identified with OCR software and stuff like ""Pentium"" and ""celeron"" would be recycled.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already pitched the idea to all four scrapyards I visit. One of them is *very* interested even at $500 a month for the software + $20K for the machine and the smaller ones are showing some interest if a more basic prototype that costs less would be possible. Even an app that could scan RAM and highlight the ""DDR3"" in the app is something they would pay for.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to an ITAD and they are interested as well. They can pay effectively $3 for a stick of DDR3 (very cheap for them) and ITADs already have to test computers and parts when they come in anyway so this wouldn't be an additional burden to them.

&amp;#x200B;

I know image recognition and OCR is still a developing technology, but sorting and reusing old products is something I haven't really heard of. This concept could even be applied to other industries like garage sale and goodwill flipping, or just sorting valuable stuff from a garbage dump.

&amp;#x200B;

The benefit here is there is already an established market for the buy and the sell side. I already have customers who want to buy. Now I just need to know what do to next. Keep building my own ITAD, or dump the business for this instead?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: I run an ITAD business and am thinking abut dumping it to start a new business that builds machines to sort and sell reusable computer parts from scrapyards to ITADs.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah, and I know I have a LOT of learning to do, like literally years of programming, hustle, staying up all night (as I have already been doing), and studying OCR until my head explodes. But I really do thing this could be big. *very big.*

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I just came up with a much simpler idea while writing this. I could write a ""guidebook"" and sell it to scrapyards instructing them in what kind of computer parts to look for and what parts have resale value. The scrapyard could buy the book and train their employees (many scrapyards tear down computer towers), and the scrapyard could resell the parts themselves to the ITADs or whomever they please. This would be much easier to implement and I have a primitive guidebook made already (I gave it to a scrapyard). I just need to add more pictures and writing to it, and a LOT more detail. The biggest problem is this book would have to be updated frequently because computer parts are always changing in value. Maybe a SaaS solution would work better? I don't know."

So, I had this internship after I came out of uni. It was almost the perfect job and I loved it, but they couldn't keep me on in the end because there weren't spaces and I didn't have a lot of experience or confidence.  The job was related to my degree in most parts, but parts of it I had no experience in so they probably wanted me to get experience in those parts. They said the usual stuff like ""Oh we'll keep in touch and if something comes up we'll let you know"". I didn't really believe that because I'd heard it all before.

The boss I had at the internship recommended me a job, at a place he used to work (and was the former manager). It wasn't related to my degree but could give me experience in the other stuff I needed, and was a well-respected and well-paid job to have. My idea was that I'd stay there forever and get experience (and money) because everywhere else turned me down. I sorta felt down too that I wasn't kept on so anyone that was willing to take me looked good. I really wanted to take a break and work on projects so I could apply for more jobs related to my degree, but I just don't have the money nor parents money to support that.

During my year there, they gave me loads of training (it was over a month and had a really expensive exam), they gave me a loan for moving costs, they helped me a lot, paid trips abroad for conferences etc.. And my colleagues are so nice to me. I was also given a LOT of responsibility and took a lot of their workload from them.

But... I just wasn't happy. I felt really bad that I knew this was technically a good job and I was complaining, but I just had no passion for it. I sat in meetings and had no interest at all in what was being said. At my internship I was happy to turn up, and I could continue my projects happily or just enjoy myself when I went home. But now, despite having the same hours etc., I just have no passion to do anything. I get home from work and just want to sleep. It's almost like I don't have a personality anymore. I had no interest in it and it is barely related to what I studied. But I didn't want to leave because:

**a**) it's technically a good, well-paid job that I'd look crazy for leaving

**b**) It's a job, and it was hard enough to get it in the first place

**c**) They put a lot into training me and the team was so nice to me

**d**) I have no family to support me financially and I can't move back in with parents etc.

So, the very day of my 1 year work anniversary, the place I got my internship got back in touch. I was near where they were and they asked me in for an interview. I went for it and I remembered how happy I felt there.

A week has passed and they're progressing to the last stage of the recruitment process, and if I get it I'll feel so torn. Don't get me wrong that job is way better and actually related to what I want to do, but morally I will feel awful. I was under the impression that if they ever would get back to me, it'd be at least 2-3 years later, not 1. I can't help but think of all the time and money invested in me that they have wasted, and how nice they all are to me.  And almost as if my former boss used this job as a training opportunity they didn't have to pay for? lol

Plus all the work I'd be giving back to them and the work it'll take to hire someone new would be horrible. I'm also scared of moving on and finding out that I can't do the job well,  but that's another story.

Does anyone have any advice on how I leave without feeling terrible? Would it be wrong of me to move on so soon? Is there any way I can make this go smoothly? Should I tell them early before I'm given the job to give more time? SHOULD I leave? Any advice would help I'm sure.

**TLDR**: How do I leave a job that I'm miserable in without feeling bad about the people and all the things they've done for me?

Thank you"

The advice I've been given is that employers value general understanding of programming concepts and good practices over knowledge of specific languages. As one of my classmates who was an intern that got hired full time put it, ""we can teach you a new language, but we're not gonna waste time teaching you how to be a programmer"". 

I don't really have a life so I'm trying to spend the next 2 years making myself as hireable as possible. 90% of my time so far in school and on side projects has been spent in Java. Once I'm confident in my general programming knowledge/skill, my gameplan is to dive into Java on a deeper level, like understanding how the compiler and JVM work, Java's strengths and weaknesses, etc.

After this, should I dedicate my time to gaining a low level understanding of a few  common languages (C#, C++? not sure yet), or just getting generally competent in a variety of different languages?

tl;dr jack of all trades master of none, or master of few?"
c05nvt,1,2019-06-13,Confused! I fear my internship made me hate programming.,pewpewn123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c05nvt/confused_i_fear_my_internship_made_me_hate/,"So I am currently in my late 20's and in College, I was the top of my class when it came to Software Development and Coding. To my dissapointment, I still haven't landed a Software Development job since 2015 that I finished my internship. It was about creating software for a small electronic solutions company 4-5 people and I was the only Software Developer. 

The problems started to rise early when I finished my 1st project(customer management software) my boss kept asking for new things 1 per day with no specific reason or use. So I kept doing what he asked for after the 1st month passed he came furiously one day and blamed me for being slow and lazy because I was on the internet all day (specifically this StackOverflow site)  I am not joking... I explained he said ok but he didn't believe me, he made one of the employees to make an ethernet on and off switch and always had me to ask when needed internet to help me finish my project. The problem is I didn't want to quit because in Greece where I live internships are 6 months paid jobs with 80% of the minimum wage but you ""MUST"" complete it in order to get your degree. In the end, after 4 months I was unpaid and constantly yelled at once every 2-3 days I started feeling guilty that I used StackOverflow and that I was not competent. I could keep going but after the 4th month passed and he hadn't paid me not even one of the 4 months I worked there I spoke to him and left the job.

Up to this day, I still feel that I don't have a future and a programmer because each hour in that job gave me a bad headache and anxiety. I know it probably was the environment but still, I don't have the confidence I can make it after this. The years go by and I have worked for 2 years in PC and Mobile repairs, I and my fiancee are moving to the UK in 4 months and I still have the dilemma if I should try to go for Programming again.

Thanks in advance."

My resume does list about 3 projects (that's all I can fit on one page) and 2 of my previous jobs (1 was TA-ing in CS, the other a leadership job). I really don't know what I'm doing wrong.

*In many cases, when starting or changing careers, it can be a good idea to look for internships to experience the daily life in a job, make first industry connections and get hands-on experience in a topic. However, getting internships in the first place can be hard. Our* [*mentors*](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/browse/) *share some insights on what to do.*

## Paid, Unpaid &amp; Your Expectations

While unpaid internships start fading away due to most companies offering a small starting salary, you’ll have to think about what you’re looking for before reaching out to companies. Are you ready to do an unpaid internship? How long would you like the internship to last? Are there opportunities nearby? Are you looking for a full-time position after?

All these questions will determine what to look out for.

* If you are looking for paid positions only, it can be hard for managers to allocate budgets for unplanned internships, so cold emailing will get more difficult.
* While most internships are three months long, many companies will extend it to six months if you are doing a good job. Everything over that is usually too long.
* Most managers won’t bother talking about relocation and visa sponsorships for internships. If you can, look for something nearby or something you can get to in a acceptable commute.
* Be sure to make clear that you are available after the internship for a full-time position, but don’t expect them to hire you.

## Looking in the open

Now you know what you are looking for, so it’s time to get looking. Apply to publicly announced positions with your CV. This is a time where quantity might count over quality: Get your name out as much and fast as possible. You should apply to every suiting internship around you.

Speaking about getting your name out: Search publicly. Post on LinkedIn and other social networks that you are looking and what your terms are. You’ll be surprised about how many companies could use an intern.

&gt;**Need help with your CV or career development? Feel free to reach out to one of our** [**mentors**](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/browse/)

If you’re lucky, you might already be close to getting an internship

## Cold Emailing

Against popular belief, cold emailing to ask for internships can work - especially at big companies. But you need to find the right contact person.

Try to find a manager, hiring contact or HR person of a company near you and reach out to them directly. You really need to refine your message before you click send. Be sure that your mail is properly formatted, free of typos, respectful and explains exactly who you are.

For reference, this message was sent from our Founder to a Vice President at NVIDIA. Just weeks later, he got an internship there.

&gt;Hey \[redacted\], I was wondering if there are any internship positions open at your Zurich offices? I’m currently doing Udacity’s SDCND and DLFND \[info: contact new about these programs\], as well as mentoring new students there, and looking for an opportunity to work in Deep Learning after this summer.

Not a perfect message by any means, but short, casual and sympathetic.

## Interviewing &amp; Offers

Let’s assume the previous steps worked out perfectly. What now? Chances are, that you might need to decide between multiple interviews and offers. When making an internship decision, keep these pointers in mind.

* When it comes to money vs. learning, try to tend towards learning. It’ll pay off later on a lot more!
* Try to choose a company with a known name - it’ll open doors after.
* It’s only temporary - so don’t turn things down due to organizational things (e.g. a long commute)
* Put in extra effort - you’ll get to work on more projects and do more exciting things.

We hope that this guide can help you with your internship search. Good luck!"

c07grt,1,2019-06-13,Should I move without a job?,mytotallyrealname,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c07grt/should_i_move_without_a_job/,"I'm an American that's currently happily employed in Berlin, but I'd like to move back to the US after several years abroad. I'd been planning on doing this for months and set a goal date for myself of being in NYC on August 1st (because I'll have free rent for the entire month while a friend is on vacation).  
I only have a little over a year professional experience, but the last time I looked for a job everything went great, even with nothing under my belt except an internship. I applied to only ten listings and got four interviews which turned into two offers, and the entire process took two weeks. I had no idea it would be so different this time around, even though I'm looking for the exact same level of position. Obviously Berlin is a very different market than New York.  
I started my job hunt about three weeks ago and applied to at least 50 listings. Out of that I've had 5 interviews, and only got passed to the second round on two. I'm still waiting to hear back from the test I did for one of them - it's been almost four days and no word, so I'm assuming that's a ""no."" I'm supposed to do a test for the other one this weekend, but honestly I didn't feel a good connection and the salary is on the low side.   


So after all that rambling, my question is: should I just move without a job? I will have free rent for the whole month, I have savings enough for a year of rent, and I'll be covered by travel health insurance for the first couple months. I'm almost sure I can find a job within a month if I'm actually in the city. I know that not being currently employed puts me at a slight disadvantage, but not being local puts me at a much larger one - they probably see my application and think ""visa"" before they can even see I'm a citizen in my cover letter, and even then, there's the ordeal of relocation packages and the obvious preference of the team meeting someone in person. These are lengths that companies are willing to go to when it's a senior dev, but not usually for one more on the junior side.  


On the other hand, that decision has way more risk to it than just staying here for a bit longer. But I'm not sure my application statuses will actually improve much in however many months I stay.  


Anyway, advice welcome :)  


tl;dr: I'm a US citizen trying to move back to NY but am having trouble finding a job - should I just move without one as I'm much more likely to get one when I'm there?"

If you're trying to intern at companies like Google, from what I've read the preparation and interview process you have to go through is basically exactly the same here as in the states, and I would likely have to relocate to London anyway, so why not just relocate to the bay area instead and get a much higher salary and the chance to experience life in the states.

From my research it seems like you simply have to apply for the internship, and if you are selected as a candidate then the company will sponsor you for the J-1 visa and you will be permitted to stay in the US while you work as an intern. Is this where the difficulty lies - are employers often unwilling to sponsor foreign interns for the J-1 visa, due to cost or something? Are there any more obstacles in the process I'm not aware of?

I will be applying to PhD programs in Computer Science in the fall, and I'm having trouble selecting my third reference letter. My first two are the following:

1. Well known professor I researched with full time for a summer on a government grant (as an undergrad). The paper was published at a top conference, and the prof has already agreed to write me a LoR. Unfortunately the paper was in robotics, which I don't want to pursue in my PhD. I have gone drinking and to dinners with him countless times, and have gotten to know him personally very well. I also took his graduate class as an undergraduate.
2. Associate Professor whose class I did well in (A+, 100% on final) and attended graduate lab meetings with for a year extracurricularly. Also presented a theoretical paper at one lab meeting and have gone for dinner with etc. I know him quite well and trust he will write me a very strong reference letter. He actually had asked me to apply for the government grant from (1) with him, but as I had already accepted with the previous professor, I had to decline.

For my third I have two likely options.

* My supervisor at a Big 4 tech company. He only has a bachelor's degree. I know he has taught at Berkeley and has some publications, but most importantly he has overseen my intern project which is the type of work I want to do in my PhD (unstructured data mining). He has actually seen thousands of lines of my code, and seen the way I approach problems. He has said he would be happy to write me a LoR, but I worry his non-professor status will hurt my application, and also that he might not know how best to write the letter.
* A professor who I am reasonably close with but didn't research with. He taught my data mining class, which I got an A+ and the top mark on the final. I have met with him numerous times outside of class, and attended his guest lectures. He is reasonably well-known in the field, a full professor, and likely would write me a strong LoR despite it being a 'did well in class' type letter. I am also considering volunteering with him in his lab in the fall so that he has something to go on when he write the letter, although this would be cutting it close as the application deadline is in December, and he isn't guaranteed to have work for me.

Which of the above seem more weighty for a LoR? I'm sort of stressing trying to get the third letter in order.

Thank you!"

I figured out late that I wanted to be in finance. When I mean late I mean after I got my degree in political science At a no name school and been out of college for about half a year. So I don’t have any internships dealing with any finance background. I have an internship at a law office but that’s about it. I’m also older than the average college grad at 26. This is because I was in the Marines in which I was in IT so I have a few certifications and know the basics of IT how to set up a server, client side issues, how to program routers, switches etc. I have CCNA certifications because of this. 

I know the best bet would be to try to get an MBA at a target school but I heard it would be hard to get in without any kind of experience in finance/business. Also with my current situation I wouldn’t be able to afford a non target school let alone a target one. I plan to get one after I get a job in some firm/bank. I recognize that I probably won’t get an IB position and that’s fine. My interest lies in equity research or risk management. To do something I completed a few courses in SQL and Python at Udemy. I was also considering studying for CFA &amp; CPA but I was told to try to wait on getting those until you get hired because these can be gained through some firms. My question is this realistic? Is there any tips anyone has to get in the door or other general advice regarding my situation? I’m willing to start in a different position if I have to so long as it will lead to one of these two positions. I’m also will to relocate any where. I just need some kind of chance to take and I know I can succeed. 

Thanks.

It’s great, working with the animals and getting to know each and every species there and getting experience while I do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked late that day. It was 10:00 when I got off. Now, it’s generally regarded as not safe for a woman to be out at this time, but I had nothing to worry about. When I turned 16, my father had started to teach me about guns. How to use, handle, self defense techniques, when to shoot, etc. When I turned 18, my father took me to an arms store and he got me my first gun, a M1911. We then went out to our range and had fun with it. For my 21st birthday, he and I went to get me a concealed carry permit.

&amp;#x200B;

That day, I had with me my M1911. Something just felt...off, so I kept my hand near it, ready to draw. I made my way to the metro station and descended the stairs into the underground part. Nobody was there, save the few homeless people to the side and a clerk. I passed the turn thing that counts the people that have passed that day and made my way to the waiting platform. After ten agonizing minutes with no cell service, a train finally came. I went into the first car. There was a man who looked well off staring at the window across from him, a sleeping woman, and the train’s operator. The doors closed and we were off. After a few minutes, the man slid over next to me. “You work at the Philadelphia Zoo, Mackenzie??”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah. How did you know my na-oh,” I replied, noticing my name tag was still on. “Just call me Kenna. What’s your name?”

&amp;#x200B;

“John.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Very well, John...Plain name, but I won't forget it.”

&amp;#x200B;

He let out a chuckle. “I see you’ve playe-”

&amp;#x200B;

He never finished his thought, for the train came to a sudden halt, as if something had grabbed and pulled the back. The lights went off, and I heard a body hit something and a cracking sound. I felt to see if the man was next to me still. He was.

&amp;#x200B;

“W-what was t-that?” I could hear the pure fear in his voice. I’ve played enough Metro games to know that it was probably a good idea to draw my weapon. From behind us, I could hear a series of thumps in rapid succession, as if something was running away from us.

&amp;#x200B;

“Do you have a flashlight? Or something with a flashlight?” I asked him.

&amp;#x200B;

“N-no, I l-l-left my ph-phone at my h-house,” he responded. You know how people can describe another’s voice as ‘trembling?’ Well, his was having a seizure.

&amp;#x200B;

“You’ll have to go without a light, then. Don’t stray too far from me,” I said, as I switched on my phone’s light. I glanced at the battery percentage left. 56%. That should get us far. I saw the woman, her neck bent in an unnatural shape.

&amp;#x200B;

“W-we’re going?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes. We’re not going to stay in a destroyed train car underground. It could take days before anyone finds us. If we move, we should be able to reach the next station.” He let off a loud whine after I said this. I have to admit, I was pretty scared too. It was hard not to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I kicked open the train car’s door. “Ey, what are you two doin’?” rasped a voice from the conductor’s seat.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re g-going out to the next station. Want to come with?” Jesus, now my voice was starting to shake.

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m stayn’ ‘ere. Recently got surgery ‘n mah leg. We get weakah’ as we get oldah’, y’ know?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Y-yeah.”

&amp;#x200B;

We stepped out onto the tracks. My phone light barely illuminated anything, but at least we could see the tracks. John held onto my shoulder. I could feel his shaking. I was shaking too.

&amp;#x200B;

We walked for what felt like forever. I checked the battery of my phone. 42%. Then, it shut off. I mashed the power button, but it stayed dead. I heard a faint thumping sound in the distance behind us, and simply uttered one word. “Run.” His hand left my shoulder, but I could still hear 3 footsteps; mine, his, and the thing’s. The third set kept coming closer, and closer, and closer, until I heard a loud, painful scream, and one set disappeared. Eventually, there was silence again. “J-John?” I yelled into the darkness. There was no reply. I still had my gun, however. I pushed the power button to test my phone again. Nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I hastily walked in the direction I was running to, gripping my gun unnaturally hard. Then, footsteps. And snorting. I could hear strained breathing from behind me. “W-w-wh-o’s th-t-t-there?” I asked, into the darkness. More strained breathing. I fired a shot.

&amp;#x200B;

Muzzle flashes are dim, but it cut right through the darkness of the metro tunnel. I could see the creature for the briefest of seconds. It looked like the monster from A Quiet Place, with its long front limbs and comparatively short rear ones. But there were a few key differences. The head was larger, and more square. It had two beady black eyes, and a circle for the mouth, which was surrounded with blood. It itself was much larger, with the horns on its head almost reaching the top of the tunnel. The head was red and the texture looked rock-like. The body, which had long forearms, much longer than the rear limbs, was dark grey and speckled with white dots here and there. The backside of the forearms had claws (thorns? I don’t know the word) lining their backside, all the way up to the first joint. There was also blood on them. The thing must’ve had an exoskeleton, because I heard a loud cracking sound and a painful screech.

&amp;#x200B;

I was quick to fire at it more. Then the dreadful sound was heard. *Click, click, click, click.* I had emptied my only magazine. After the first shot, I heard no more cracks, but with the following muzzle flashes I could see a dark, inky substance dripping from its leg. I heard loud, quick thumping sounds, and then it grabbed me. The thorns of its forearm dug into my gut. It hurled me into the tunnel. I landed on my left arm, and my glasses bounced off of my face. Luckily, my left arm absorbed all the impact. However, this meant my left arm absorbed all the impact. I don’t know if it broke or not, but it hurt, like, really bad. I screamed out in pain. It rushed to where I was. It grabbed me again, its thorns digging into me once more. Instead of eating me, it moved.

&amp;#x200B;

An eternity later, it laid me down in an area smelling of rotting flesh. A human hand reached out and touched my shoulder. I did nothing because I was frozen in fear. It felt my face and moved down until it felt my nametag. “K-Kenna?” the hand’s owner rasped. The monster made a loud screeching noise and presumably brought its mighty forearm down upon the hand’s owner (it was dark and I couldn’t see, but I did feel something wet on my face). After that I heard moist crunching sounds. W-was it...*eating* the hand’s owner? I let out a whimper of fear. The monster let out a hideous screeching sound and grabbed me. The last thing I remember was flying through the air.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up in a hospital. I remember bright lights and people surrounding me. They let me rest. A few days later, they told me what happened. They sent detective Cynthia Holdt down to investigate the wreck, one day after we had left the train. She came to the conclusion no human thing could’ve done that. Armed teams were sent down do find what had. They eventually found an empty area, that was previously used to house the metro cars. However, it had been abandoned for a new one. There were corpses there, all of them violenty mutilated. The creature attacked the men down there. They managed to badly wound it, but it got away. However, they paid a price. 2 of their men were killed, and one was missing. Then they found my body. My poor left arm was shattered, and I was unconscious. Other than that there were multiple bruises and deep cuts around the guts and lower ribs. However, I have recovered (mostly, my left arm is still considerably weaker than the right, and I sometimes stutter, but overall I’m okay) since then. It’s been over a year now and I’ve moved to Canada with my boyfriend. The official statement on the event was that the creature was mortally wounded and later died of its wounds, but I doubt this. Sometimes I hear the same thumping and rare scream below me.

Hello

Im a 23 years old male, I will tell you a story I've been holding up for 11 years, wich I never told anyone like i'm about to do here. I'm aware this doesn't sound like a big deal, but I can't find a way to deal with this and what it has done to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was really shy 11 years old who just changed school and had a crush on a female classmate. It was in the summer when I started talking online with her cause I couldn't do it in person, it went very well, we got hours of talking deep conversations, I was exploding of happiness. After the summer was over, I was so emotional that I couldn't even compliment her, so she went out to me and hugged me, oh man I was in heaven..

12 years old, It was being a freaking awsome year so far. That year I learned about the sexual part of the human being, wich is a natural thing, except, for whatever reason , I lied to this girl saying I've had engaged in a sexual act wich she found out and totally cut our relationship.

I dropped death, my mind was racing, I couldn't think. The following months were cringe for the amounts of attempts I tried to apologize and make sense of what happened. I started getting number and number, only could think about that and cry when alone at home, school started to be hell, everything was bad.

13 years old, new school, same classmates, i'm even worse, quitted sports, only play PC, always bad mood, still trying to reestablish what was lost. Started to get in a really depressive mood, grades going low as ever, until I decided to show her how I really felt about our relationship, so I take a month and write this letter to her, expressing my true feelings, exposing myself deeply in some pieces of paper, I even draw.. I give it to her in class, she goes to the bathroom, a classmate steals it, reads it in front of class including teacher, I die. I left the classroom went home, one of the worst days of my life, went totally numb. Next day I come to school like nothing happened, avoid everyone. I cried everytime I was alone at home, while i'm writing this I feel the despair, the world ended there.

14 years old, I failed the class, changed school, totally cut everyone from my past and changed myself completly, just tried to ignored everything.

The next years I met a lot of people but never ""connected"" to anyone. I dropped everything I liked, I can't enjoy anything, my grades were always shit, can't concentrate. There was a time I was hypochondriac with all kind of anxiety causing diseases, so I went to the doctor wich led to a psychiatrist, but I couldn't ""let it out"" , so it was a loose end. I flee from intimacy and competition, ever since this, if a girl flirts with me, I nicely avoid the situation, if someone tries to get over ""my barrier"" I avoid them nicely, everything that makes me vulnerable I avoid. I feel caged, that i'm not my true self, when I look at me in the mirror, I don't know who that person is. Everything around me is about this, how to be less anxious possible and still live. I've built a life of shit and i'm finishing college (internship). I have to change otherwise I will be very unhappy in days to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

After highschool I worked for two years, wich helped a lot mentally, paid for my college, and decided to continue to study, so my life is ok, but I need to open myself, everyday I feel I am loosing a lot of opportunities, I dislike my job and only chose it because there is guaranteed employment. Finishing this internship is bringing up a lot of questions to wtf is my life.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do?

 Feel free to ask anything, thank you."

It gets a little personal but I figured that might be appreciated by some folks given, how closely tied personal life can be to our professional life. Tldr at the end

Some of this will be a little personal but hey- we've all been there. I decided to share my current experiences:
(1) in the hopes that maybe someone else can relate or it can help them with their own struggles
(2) because I'd rather talk to people who get the struggle, because a lot of my friends really can't relate to long-term unemployment and the huge blow it can be to your self-esteem
(3) a lot of the posts on this sub can be intimidating for those who are trying to break into the industry, all the acronyms and certifications as well as the fancy sounding titles can get really overwhelming, to say the least

I graduated in December with a major in Biological Sciences and a minor in Computer Information Sciences. I hoped that the combination of a very analytically minded major as well a relevant minor was sure to land me a position in no time, especially paired with a year of software development internship experience. For about 5 months straight I was applying to any and all jobs, even the most basic mom and pop PC repair shop positions for minimum wage, and I was lucky to get any response back at all. 

I went to every person I knew who was established in their respective industries for career advice, even had several referrals from mid-level managers in several different institutions of various backgrounds (banking, consulting, technology- you get the idea).. and yet again, nothing. I was lucky if they even took the time to email me that I'd been rejected for the position.

Pressure from my family made me decide to study for my GRE and potentially go into healthcare like they've always wanted to, and that may have ultimately been the catalyst for change that I absolutely needed; as during the first month of studying, I ended up going to a psychiatrist. 

Long story short, I'd been ignoring what my therapists in university had been telling me, that there's a strong chance I may ADHD and should take the time to get tested. I ignored it and assumed it was just general anxiety caused by school as well as the fact that I'd been pursuing a degree in a field I did not want to be in. 

I went because even without those pressures, my lack of focus and ability to concentrate were still... Pretty shitty, to say the least. I've been on medication for about 2.5 months now and it's had a huge impact on my confidence in myself. Took the GRE, didn't do as well as I'd wanted (had slept maybe 6 hours the 3 days leading up to it and ended up nearly passing out during the exam), and vowed to retake.

Andyet still, during all this time, none of my applications seemed to be gathering attention from employers.

Then, about 2-3 weeks ago, I'd had an argument with my parents over some stupid stuff that ended up with me being humiliated. I really sat down and looked at what I was doing and whether this was all worth it.

For about 3 days straight, I thought about what it was I wanted out of a career, what my interests were, and the kind of person I wanted to be. I came to the conclusion that yes, this is the career path I want to take, and that maybe it will change in the future but I needed to set up some short-term and long-term goals.

Then I thought about what it is I've been doing wrong with my applications, and how I thought I'd been following all the right advice and checking all the right boxes. Everyone always had something to point out to change on my resume, advice for writing cover letters, skills I should list, etc.

What I ended up doing was just... Ignoring everyone's advice. Got my resume professionally redone (although I ended up changing a lot of it in order to more accurately reflect myself), began applying for positions I thought I was underqualified for, wrote all my cover letters from scratch for even the most basic of work. 

I reached out to people I'd not bothered to talk to after being in such a rut for so long and feeling ashamed of myself for not finding ANY work for such a long time. I was honest with them, and told them the truth about my situation. Things WEREN'T going well and that I wasn't in the best place I'd been. I asked for actual career advice, and for them to share their stories. I picked up coding again, and am trying to work towards some entry level certificates. 

CompTIA A+, in particular, is one that everyone had repeatedly told me I shouldn't bother with as it's apparently all very basic information. That may be well and true and maybe I do know the vast majority of the information it has to offer already, but I realized that employers have no way of knowing my level of familiarity with these things.

And I stopped running away from positions I thought were challenging or beyond my current level of understanding. With my ADHD finally diagnosed and having the (truly life-changing) medication,  I now know I'm capable of understanding and applying far more advanced concepts than I ever realized.



Essentially, I scrapped everything and started from scratch. And in these two past weeks, I've had more callbacks from employers, and more interviews than I've had in the preceding 7 months.
I'm actually in a position where recruiters WANT to speak with me, and are actually interested in what I have to bring to the table. And I'm not even talking about minimum wage jobs anymore, but proper office level IT operations. 

Luckily, I've always been good with interviews and my previous experience working within a software development team, working in retail, and working as a CPR instructor have really allowed me to develop my soft communication skills to the point where I feel confident during these things.

And so, over the past week I've had 5 seperate companies reach out to me to offer interviews. 

I've managed to get through each ones phone screening with either their HR department or their IT staff head. 

Last night I spent about 8 hours straight yesterday perfecting and sending my responses to a one-way video interview with my alma amter in their IT department (a position I'm REALLY hoping to get out of all of them). Unfortunately, because of my desire to submit my answers ASAP and to get them to be perfect, I stayed up until about 7 AM. I had an in-person interview with a nearby IT consulting firm. I thought I sent them an email stating that unfortunately I wouldn't be able to make it to the interview today due to extenuating circumstances and yadada- but it turns out it was saved to my drafts folder. 

I sent them an email explaining what had happened (""emergency at work""), apologized for wasting their time and that if I was no longer eligible as a candidate for a position that I completely understand their decision etc. Haven't heard back from them but I get it. I know this will just be a story to tell in the future and am not losing any sleep over it.

Anyways, I also have 2 in-person interviews next week. 

And just as I was writing this, I ended up getting ANOTHER call regarding my application, and managed to get yet ANOTHER in-person interview! God I'm so happy that I've forgotten where I was going with this, and think I've rambled enough to the one person who actually read through all this. If you want to read more go through my post history and look for the post of made in /r/ADHD regarding a more in-depth look at my personal life.


**TLDR** : generated no interest as a candidate, got diagnosed with ADHD, reevaluated my life, took a different approach to job hunting, am now generating interest as a candidate"

Sorry it's so long. TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some background:**

I work for a creative agency as a content creator and social media manager. Though the hours are long and the work is hard and our clients are nightmares to work with, working there is great for the most part (more on this later).

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem:** 

In late April, I got the opportunity to apply for a really great job at a huge Airport (government/city job).  

* I would be getting a raise ($10K more than I make now) and a promotion (more responsibility/better title) and working with the big name airport. Ok cool. 
* It would be a contract position, BUT I would be able to matriculate into a permanent position (totally confident I could). Nice! 
* PLUS, my sister used to work there and I had an in. Sick. Thing is, my sister left the airport because they made promises to her they couldn't keep (important for later).

I applied anyway, i got the interview the week after, then the job offer the week after that. 

That was on May 7. Then I had to go through a lengthy on-boarding process (background check, paperwork, medical test), which concluded on May 24. I passed everything with flying colors. 

Some background about applying for a city job: the final approval for getting you on board is held by the city, not the department that wants to hire you. Two weeks ago, the city put my application on hold because I didn't meet 100% of their arbitrary requirements - even though the airport and the hiring department want me on board. 

The department and airport's HR fought for me and they called me today. They could still hire me, but under a different classification. Hmmm. 

This new classification that I DO meet the requirements for is a $6K pay cut from my CURRENT job and nearly $14K pay cut from the position I originally applied for. I would still be doing the job that I applied for, just making $14K less.

But they say, I could apply for other (and permanent) positions in the near future (December) since I'd already have one foot in the door.

It SUCKS. 

I told them I would think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

**My dilemma:** 

Do I take the pay cut in exchange for: 

* Gaining more experience and responsibility
* Having a great company on my resume
* A long play for moving on to better opportunities in the future? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some factors to consider:**

* Remember the part about my current company being great for the most part? Well the company's going through restructuring. There has been a lot of turnover. In my time here (less than a year), I've seen more than 10 people let go. I hope every day that I'm not next. 
* The tone at my current job has been hostile. We're short-staffed and overworked. It doesn't help that we always have to put out fires for our clients. 
* My current job is full-time, with benefits and paid time off. The job I was offered is a full-time contract position with possibility of being permanent.
* I said earlier that my sister left the airport because they were giving her empty promises. She was doing excellent work at intern pay. The airport did all they could to onboard her, but the city made it really difficult. I'm afraid that they will trap me with this current offer and that their promises of me moving up will be empty promises, too.
* My current supervisor (who was my reference) knows that I applied to this job. I'm afraid that him knowing I looked outside of the company for opportunities has stifled my chances of moving up there.
* I live 10 minutes away from my current job. The commute is far and full of traffic to the airport. 
* I did some calculations and I would be able to live on the pay cut

So, someone, please let me know if it's worth exploring the new job or if I'd be stupid to leave my current job. Is it just me bored/sad/frustrated with my current job? Or is it worth a thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Work for stressful agency with tons of turnover (afraid I'm next); apply to new job at the airport, get a good offer and accepted; went through whole on-boarding process, only to have original offer changed (way lower salary for the same job) due to arbitrary requirements by the government agency controlling the hiring department. Should I take the job anyway as a long play for future opportunities?"

Now, my job title is ""Technical Intern"" but I was primarily hired to do automation testing for a small web application. However, I am not interested in getting a job as a software tester post graduation and would like to leverage my experience more towards web development.

As of lately, I have been starting to do some development on the web application but it's not exactly my primary task. I have been tasked with implementing the functionality of a couple of the pages on the web app and I'm not sure how to describe them on my resume. When I work on these pages, I work with some HTML/CSS and javascript along with Java and SQL to get the whole thing working and I enjoy doing all this.

I seem to be a bit confused about the frontend/backend/full-stack responsibilities and just wanted some clarification. Using the technologies I listed, is it as simple as.. frontend is HTML/CSS/JS, the backend is Java/SQL, and full-stack is working with all of it? So if my internship was more about development and less about testing, would it be considered as a full stack developer intern?

I'm not looking to flat out lie about my internship but I would like to emphasize more the web development rather than the testing portion of it.

I guess I am just looking for advice from anyone who has been in a similar position."
c0btaj,1,2019-06-13,I[24M] feel like I constantly miss something in my life,Moulinglacia,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/c0btaj/i24m_feel_like_i_constantly_miss_something_in_my/,"So first of all: English is not my first language so it's very likely that my Text is not that grammatically correct.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few background information about me: I live in a small village (20000) in Germany, and finished my Bachelor degree 2 years ago. The university I studied was ca 300 km away from my hometown and I lived there with my (now ex) girlfriend. Currently I live again with my parents and make my Masters degree in a closer university.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that although I always had a good time where I lived I never felt really happy or satisfied. There was always the feeling I miss something in my life, I didn't knew always what I was missing, but there was always this feeling.

For example the time when I lived together with my girlfriend, it was no doubt a very good time, but I remember that I always thought these things:

\- it would be nice to be single again, although I really loved her

\- it would be nice to live again in my hometown, my best friends are there

c0btco,1,2019-06-13,I was offered my dream job...things got super complicated. Can someone give me guidance?,softservedsoftcore,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c0btco/i_was_offered_my_dream_jobthings_got_super/,"Also posted on r/Advice

Hey guys, I (23F) need your help figuring out my career choices at the moment. Sorry it's so long. TLDR at the bottom.

**Some background:**

I work for a creative agency as a content creator and social media manager. Though the hours are long and the work is hard and our clients are nightmares to work with, working there is great for the most part (more on this later).

**The problem:**

In late April, I got the opportunity to apply for a really great job at a huge Airport (government/city job).

* I would be getting a raise ($10K more than I make now) and a promotion (more responsibility/better title) and working with the big name airport. Ok cool.
* It would be a contract position, BUT I would be able to matriculate into a permanent position (totally confident I could). Nice!
* PLUS, my sister used to work there and I had an in. Sick. Thing is, my sister left the airport because they made promises to her they couldn't keep (important for later).

I applied anyway, i got the interview the week after, then the job offer the week after that.

That was on May 7. Then I had to go through a lengthy on-boarding process (background check, paperwork, medical test), which concluded on May 24. I passed everything with flying colors.

Some background about applying for a city job: the final approval for getting you on board is held by the city, not the department that wants to hire you. Two weeks ago, the city put my application on hold because I didn't meet 100% of their arbitrary requirements - even though the airport and the hiring department want me on board.

The department and airport's HR fought for me and they called me today. They could still hire me, but under a different classification. Hmmm.

This new classification that I DO meet the requirements for is a $6K pay cut from my CURRENT job and nearly $14K pay cut from the position I originally applied for. I would still be doing the job that I applied for, just making $14K less.

But they say, I could apply for other (and permanent) positions in the near future (December) since I'd already have one foot in the door.

It SUCKS.

I told them I would think about it.

**My dilemma:**

Do I take the pay cut in exchange for:

* Gaining more experience and responsibility
* Having a great company on my resume
* A long play for moving on to better opportunities in the future?

**Some factors to consider:**

* Remember the part about my current company being great for the most part? Well the company's going through restructuring. There has been a lot of turnover. In my time here (less than a year), I've seen more than 10 people let go. I hope every day that I'm not next.
* The tone at my current job has been hostile. We're short-staffed and overworked. It doesn't help that we always have to put out fires for our clients.
* My current job is full-time, with benefits and paid time off. The job I was offered is a full-time contract position with possibility of being permanent.
* I said earlier that my sister left the airport because they were giving her empty promises. She was doing excellent work at intern pay. The airport did all they could to onboard her, but the city made it really difficult. I'm afraid that they will trap me with this current offer and that their promises of me moving up will be empty promises, too.
* My current supervisor (who was my reference) knows that I applied to this job. I'm afraid that him knowing I looked outside of the company for opportunities has stifled my chances of moving up there.
* I live 10 minutes away from my current job. The commute is far and full of traffic to the airport.
* I did some calculations and I would be able to live on the pay cut

So, someone, please let me know if it's worth exploring the new job or if I'd be stupid to leave my current job. Is it just me bored/sad/frustrated with my current job? Or is it worth a thought.

Thanks!

TLDR: Work for stressful agency with tons of turnover (afraid I'm next); apply to new job at the airport, get a good offer and accepted; went through whole on-boarding process, only to have original offer changed (way lower salary for the same job) due to arbitrary requirements by the government agency controlling the hiring department. Should I take the job anyway as a long play for future opportunities?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am in 4A engineering, and right now looking for my last coop.

I had a fairly good resume but shit grades. I had repeated my past terms once, and even failed one course in the repeated term once.

Past coop experience was okay, but never got to cali. I have been interviewing with Apple for multiple times since 3A, but never was able to get an offer.

During a recent interview, the interviewer from another company even asked me about my shit grades. He asked what I learnt from my past failed term. But to be honest, I didn't learn anything from it. I wasted the term I repeated again and the grades was still garbage. I hate myself for that.

I am still aiming for Apple, but the problem is that I am not eligible for TN visa, and therefore the only option for me is J1 visa. This means I can only applied for intern positions, but I am running out of Co-op.

I am blaming myself for not studying and miss all my opportunities. I hate myself for being useless. I am really ashamed to talk about this to classmates, and most of my friends outside my class are chilling in Cali with their coops.

My other friends outside uWaterloo cannot understand the struggle. I tried to book a time with a prof I know of to talk about my struggle, but prof never replied my e-mail.

Other than the Co-op struggle, I broke up and also had chronological breathing problems. Plus fourth year load kinda drives me mad.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a piece of garbage and I failed everyone who loves me or once loved me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about after my graduation, I just can't image how dark my future will be, with me having a full-time in a strange city alone, knowing nobody. I have done coop in Ottawa, It was cold and I was super lonely. 

I tried to get help, but no one is really there. I try to be positive, but I cant see anything good is happening in short future.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

\-kid couldn't make it to cali

\-shit grades

\-suffering from own mistakes

\-see no happy future

Again, I am really sorry to grumble and complaint here. I guess no one really cares, but thanks for reading this."

Here are a few background information about me: I live in a small village (20000) in Germany, and finished my Bachelor degree 2 years ago. The university I studied was ca 300 km away from my hometown and I lived there with my (now ex) girlfriend. Currently I live again with my parents and make my Masters degree in a closer university.

My problem is that although I always had a good time where I lived I never felt really happy or satisfied. There was always the feeling I miss something in my life, I didn't knew always what I was missing, but there was always th is feeling.

For example the time when I lived together with my girlfriend, it was no doubt a very good time, but I remember that I always thought these things:

\- it would be nice to be single again, although I really loved her

\- it would be nice to live again in my hometown, my best friends are there

\- it would be nice to live alone in a bigger city like Munich, Hamburg or Berlin and make unforgettable memories.

I'm an incoming sophomore at UC Berkeley studying computer science. I just finished my first semester of technical courses a couple of weeks ago, and all went well until the 2nd week of summer came when I realized how super important side projects are. It seems everyone and everything is telling me to create side projects to build up my portfolio in order to flash it on my resume to secure pretty much *any* internship for summer of 2020 (I'm assuming applications are opening this coming fall, so my dead ass is also on a deadline). Alright, okay.

But what I don't get is how, *how* on Earth does anyone finish their side projects? I started like 5 over the last 2-3 weeks and I seriously cannot follow through on any of them let alone even finish half. My process goes like this: think hard about a ""viable"" project, start on the project, get a little overwhelmed, keep going, hit a wall, keep going, hit the 5th bug, and get so frustrated that I just want to shut my laptop and never look at the project ever again. Apologies--I lost track of what I'm getting at here, but the point is I am my worst enemy stopping myself from finishing side projects. At the same time, I can't let myself get a break because I think that I'm never going to never going to get an internship and never amount to anything if I don't finish at least 2 or 3 side projects. It's a vicious cycle of me just self-deprecating, starting, and giving up before anything happens. I don't see any other posts detailing this kind negative process and how to overcome it. Anyone experience something similar? How did you get over the stump? Any advice or comments in general to help me out or open my eyes to some different perspective?"

I have an internship with Amazon for the summer, but it with the Data Center Operations divisions. So working with servers mostly. But I found a way to make an impression on my manager today using Python. I can't go into specific details of what we were working on (NDA and confidentiality and all) but I can talk about what I did. 

We were working with a large number of assets (327 total) and part of that work involved compiling information about those assets. Well as an intern I get all the crap jobs. So I got handed that job. So for 2 days, I've been working on compiling the info in a spreadsheet. Thought I was finished but found I only had information for 319 assets. Well, we can't just 'lose' 8 assets. That kind of looks bad on a record. So my manager wanted me to go through the list of total assets and figure out what 8 we didn't have info for. I'm like 99% sure he was expecting me to go line by line in excel and do a CTRL+F to see which ones from the total list weren't on the info list. A nice little process that would likely have taken me the better part of the day to accomplish.   

Instead, I pulled up python, threw together a script to build 2 lists (one for total assets, one for the information I had compiled) and then compare the lists. Anything it found in the totals list that it didn't find in the info list got dumped to a text file.  

Total time: 18 minutes (I had to look up some info on the xlswriter module).  

My manager literally said: ""How the hell did you do that?"" when I showed him the list 20 minutes after we spoke."

Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I am currently a student (19) who recently started programming and I have pretty weak eyes (dry eyes). I started an internship last week and I'm looking at my computer for 1/2 the day and my eyes have gotten much weaker, and my eyes in fact water a lot during the night. My prescription is correct so no use in going to the doctor. It really sucks because once I'm back home, I can't study/work on personal projects because my eyes are so watery and strained at that point and I can barely stay up past 11pm anymore. This could also be due to allergies but I feel like it is mainly staring at a laptop all day. It's weird because in college, I didn't have that much eye pain.

I'm trying to start preparing for applying to full-time jobs, and I can't really decide if I want to go more down the embedded or pure software path. I live in Seattle, so software is more prevalent here (and higher paying). However, there are still a decent amount of well-paying embedded software jobs as well.

In school, I really enjoyed my Embedded courses. I also really liked my Data Structures and Algorithms class, and my favorite programming language is Java. The projects I made in my embedded systems course (a Bluetooth controlled RC car), have been way cooler than the CS courses. I hate circuits, I know for sure I want a coding job. Which is more enjoyable in the real world? Making devices like heartbeat monitors, electric toothbrushes, sound more exciting than making stuff for AWS. But it pays less than software jobs here at the Big 4. I'm also scared that if I enter embedded, I can't go back up the stack.

My past internships have nothing to do with either. I didn't find my love for coding until recently. I had one internship doing analog circuit design with Altium (hated it), and another doing MATLAB/Simulink development for an aerospace company.

I already have a A.S in Software Development so I'm not completely dedicated to just Information Systems. However, I do want your advice and please if you can be as hurtfully honest.

**Background**:

So I am interning in at a company that has assigned me a very large project that could potentially be implemented nationwide. My job isn't so much to find a solution to a problem but more so identify and prove that a problem exists and justifying using resources that would involve finding a solution later on (solution to problem is outside scope of summer internship). 

This project was assigned to me an individual that is above anyone at my current location for the position I am interning for (ex: NA manager (so this person) &gt; regional manager &gt; site manager &gt; position I am interning for). This is a very important project to this individual and they selected me specifically because of my background in engineering (interning for safety). The NA manager cares very much about this project and has given me full control of how to lead it and has informed me that they will provide any resources that I may need to assist me with accomplishing this project. I am working alone on this project, but I do have people around me at my site that I can ask if I have questions or want ideas from them.  Most associates have told me they aren't sure why I was given such a big project that is very difficult as opposed to a project that focuses on their specific site rather than implementing something nationwide. 

**Problem with my project**: 

Unfortunately, I feel like I am doing a very poor job managing this project right now and feel very defeated despite barely starting the project a couple of weeks ago. In school, we usually work with teams or have help from our professors in order to help finish a problem. And different parts of the project are done by different people. Now, I am being given a project where essentially I will decide everything and I need to manage my time, tasks, deliverable, ensure goals are met, etc. 

I was given an internal tool like Microsoft project that they use so I can set up milestones, tasks, and everyone can see where I am on my project. Only my project sponsor and I currently look at it. Since my project sponsor isn't ever at our site because they travel, they have different priorities, views, and perspective on how my internship should go.

**Problem with executing and making decisions**: 

I have spent so much time investigating and looking into the tasks she assigned for the first week that pretty much define what the project scope will be, purpose, what we will study, etc. After all of my investigation, I am not sure how to deliver that to her in a short report (I was informed if I am spending more than 15 minutes on writing a report of the findings of my weekly tasks, I am doing something wrong). I am not sure if I should do this in a PowerPoint and present it to her, should I make it into a word document? 

**Underlying Issue**: 

I guess what most of this stems from is that while I am confident in my technical abilities and I have already demonstrated my knowledge in numerous areas, I am struggling with actually leading a project, how to organize what I will be doing, how to spend my days, how to document my findings, etc. It's pretty embarrassing and I have done independent projects in school, but again, most everything was laid out for me. I just don't want to mess up such a big project for someone that has really high expectations for the results.

c0htmm,1,2019-06-14,How to manage major project assigned by director by yourself (Intern),EssentialEngineerign,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/c0htmm/how_to_manage_major_project_assigned_by_director/," This may be more of a rant, but definitely looking for some guidance or advice from anyone that has been in this situation and overcome or just that can relate to me.

**Background**:

So I am interning in at a company that has assigned me a very large project that could potentially be implemented nationwide. My job isn't so much to find a solution to a problem but more so identify and prove that a problem exists and justifying using resources that would involve finding a solution later on (solution to problem is outside scope of summer internship).

This project was assigned to me an individual that is above anyone at my current location for the position I am interning for (ex: NA manager (so this person) &gt; regional manager &gt; site manager &gt; position I am interning for). This is a very important project to this individual and they selected me specifically because of my background in engineering (interning for safety). The NA manager cares very much about this project and has given me full control of how to lead it and has informed me that they will provide any resources that I may need to assist me with accomplishing this project. I am working alone on this project, but I do have people around me at my site that I can ask if I have questions or want ideas from them. Most associates have told me they aren't sure why I was given such a big project that is very difficult as opposed to a project that focuses on their specific site rather than implementing something nationwide.

**Problem with my project**:

Unfortunately, I feel like I am doing a very poor job managing this project right now and feel very defeated despite barely starting the project a couple of weeks ago. In school, we usually work with teams or have help from our professors in order to help finish a problem. And different parts of the project are done by different people. Now, I am being given a project where essentially I will decide everything and I need to manage my time, tasks, deliverable, ensure goals are met, etc.

I was given an internal tool like Microsoft project that they use so I can set up milestones, tasks, and everyone can see where I am on my project. Only my project sponsor and I currently look at it. Since my project sponsor isn't ever at our site because they travel, they have different priorities, views, and perspective on how my internship should go. They want me to devote a lot of attention to the project but the project is separate from doing my daily responsibilities for the position I will hopefully become full-time for.

**Problem managing my time**:

In order to not neglect my associates at my site, I have a good amount of time shadowing them, learning from them and performing the responsibilities for that position.

So I graduated 2 weeks ago and I've been learning spring, hibernate and some angular 8. I'm going to start applying to all the roles I've stock piled while I've been studying and coding in about a week or less when I finish my mini project with spring and hibernate, ill add a front end with angular as I'm applying. 

I got an interview for a full-time software role (in data and analytics which was the focus of my final year project) that I applied for a month and a half ago and I'm 100% going to and then one for a 6-month internship with security software.

I had a look at some similar posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6vch89/why_dont_companies_take_recent_grads_as_interns/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a005x4/internship_after_graduation/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7nou6j/should_i_do_an_internship_after_i_graduate/).

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

How hard will it screw me over if I take an internship after college ? After those 6 months I'm going to have to compete with people that are graduating in a few months in 2020 that sounds like a horrible idea,  should I bite the bullet or just apply to full-time roles ?"
c0i61v,1,2019-06-14,Feel like ending it all,thwompatlast,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/c0i61v/feel_like_ending_it_all/,"This is a throwaway account as my so uses reddit and dont want them knowing.

A bit of background info, I am currently suffering from depression and anxiety I think, I'm not medicated as I've always just managed to get on with things. I'm married with 3 children and have a pretty good life in comparison to a lot of people.

But there have been a lot of things that have happened over the course of time that right now I feel it would be everyone's best interest that I left permanently.

Up until I met my SO 2 years ago I went from one abusive, toxic and violent relationship to the next, being convinced that the person wasnt like the next. For example an ex I have a child with stopped me seeing my daughter because i didn't want to be with them anymore as they were abusive, controlling, manipulative and wouldn't let me do anything. The ex partner I dated after them convinced me that they were different but then ended up exactly the same and even had me arrested for defending myself against them, they practically ruined my career as I had a pending conviction on my record that stopped me getting an internship at one of the biggest companies in the world. 

During this period I lost my grandmother who was the closest person to me as my family literally consisted of me, my mother, my grandparents. This broke me but I carried on as it hit my mother a lot harder so I learned to switch off to be there for her, now I can fortunately/unfortunately switch my emotions off and feel nothing to no-one. 

After escaping those experiences I was still hounded by both my exes and harassed continuously to the point of being stalked daily and threatened continuously leaving me with immense anxiety about living my life. 

Then my saving grace happened. I met my soon to be married partner. They had been through similar turmoil but still had a positive outlook and strong persistence to keep going, not to mention how insanely beautiful they are.

I fell in love pretty hard and quick with them and they did too (I hope) we had a rough start as i found out they weren't exactly faithful but i continued with them as I love them so much and believed they weren't that person and it took me almost a year to get past it, but I think that was due to me having such high expectations of them being nothing like my exes that when they slipped up, I couldn't accept that they were only human and can make mistakes.

My new partner already has a child, a 2 year old girl who is amazingly smart, sweet, but still a royal pain in the ass, but my God the love I do have for her and things I would do if somebody hurt her is something else.
A few months pass and we decide everything seems so right that we decided to get married and it all goes perfectly.. until after were married. 

Now it isn't due to my parter or their daughter.. it's down to both of our exes. Their ex partner was abusive and abusive to their child (my stepdaughter) so they were denied access after they proved to be a danger to my step daughter. So soon after this, they decide to take my partner to court for custody of my step daughter, only for the sake of it being a control thing, not even because they want to be a relevant parent. Now this court shit goes on for the next two years and is still present to this day so I'll move on.

Soon after the court stuff starts my grandad then passed away, possibly through loneliness of being in a home as he lost his leg through sepsis. I still to this day blame myself for my grandfather giving up and I cry to myself in the shower most days about losing both of them and that I only have my mother left of my family.
So this just added to the stress of everything.

But then my partner and I find out were having a baby which brings a lot of light into the darkness were both having. Although the pregnancy turned out to be a bit of a nightmare, our daughter is born happy and healthy, it seems.

A couple months after her being born we discover she has severe dairy allergies and bowel problems which took nearly 3 months and 2 hospital trips to get a diagnosis. So our poor daughter was suffering for months, endless sleepless nights of crying and writhing in pain, just to be told its teething, or colic. This added to out stress as we had to sleep separately to take it in shifts to tend to our daughter, we spend months sleeping apart and seeing each other a few hours a day.

A side note, all this while I've been back at college and h
Then university to better myself to be able to give my family and kids a better life.

Fast forward a few months into my final year at university and I have to drop out as my daughter caught a severe chest infection and feel really ill. So this added to things as I feel like all my progress has gone from the last 5 years. 

Then I manage to land a job in a career field I was excited in that seemed to be with a decent company.

A couple months into working and all seems well, then my partner ends up finding out they may have cancer, so I notify work and have to have a couple of days off and they start being dicks and then terminate my contract through bullshit reasons which I'm appealing. But the added stress of them doing that when were going through a tough time was awful and made me feel like a failure again. 

Now recently I fucked up and hurt my partner by browsing NSFW subreddits briefly, not for any sort of sexual desire, more curiousity. I also watched porn, which I knew my so other wasnt a fan of but didnt expect them to be so against it that it almost ruined our marriage. I accepted their point and vowed not to go on any of it again and havent to this day.

My partner, I know doesnt believe me and continuously checks my phone, which I dont mind as I dont have anything to hide, but it really gets to me when I'm made feel like I'm lying or I've apparently deleted things etc. Which it doesnt help when my history on reddit randomly disappeared and I had no explanation for, si that hit me hard, like great I'm going to get shit for something I havent done and I dont have an explanation as I'm no tech expert. 

It even gets to the point i see my partner searching the internet for the answers I dont have over what seem to me as trivial unimportant things. But it's their feelings so I have to respect them.

But I feel they may be better without me. I see their face daily and they look miserable that they're are with me. I'll ask them and be told it's not me, which I don't believe. As it's rare in the day that they're not making little comments that feel like they are digs at me, even though they say they're not. I also get made feel like I cant have an opinion on anything or anyone if it has any relation to the opposite sex, which I know is down to their insecurities as they have been this way for the most part of our relationship. But it makes me feel like I cant talk, a lot. 

Everything at the moment feels continuously tense or awkward, and I cling to the few moments we have when they smile or are positive, or engage in a nice way or arent making ""a joke"". But I cant really say anything as I hurt them not so long ago and it's probably my fault.

This complete flip in our relationship from when we first got married has broken me. I would normally switch off and just leave, but I love them that much I dont want to as even though this kills me most days (everything that has happened as a whole), I would rather feel pain than not feel anything towards my partner. They are my everything and have always been there. It feels as though they hate me and are continuously trying to convince themselves inside that they dont. But I can see that fight going on. 

I just feel the stress of everything and not dealing with things has sort of built up and most days I feel like ending my own life so I dont have to feel anything, but I also wouldn't have to be alive to know I'm without my partner etc. 


I'm sorry if this all doesnt make sense I've kind of just winged it as I'm having a really bad day today. I'm not looking for sympathy or empathy or anything like that, I kind of just needed to vent, but things are tense at home and recently we cant seem to talk without either of us getting defensive and then arguing.  Plus everyone else tends to have biased opinions. 


TLDR - have had a lot going on over the last few years that have caused a surge in depression, I feel my partner hates me inside and just acts like they dont. I feel I shouldn't be here."

I enjoy spilling my thoughts here instead of keeping them in my private notes sometimes.
MOOOVING OONNN…

So. Let's have a small conversation real quick.

How have you been?
Have things gotten better for you? Worse?
Welp, you know what I always say: Do what you can, and move on.
If not, I pray that you're feeling better or that you will soon feel content. If you are, then keep on 
chugging, and do your thing.

Me? I'm not feeling any better than I was a few months ago. I still feel like I want to kill myself sometime this year. I see life as a pointless meaningless existence. My parents are strongly advise that I do something with my life. What's the fucking point? Work a 9-5 boring ass job for 40-50 years before growing old and suffering a slow painful death. Or working a dead-end job at some fast-food joint living paycheck to paycheck in a rotten apartment or low-income housing. Or I could become homeless. Fuck that noise. Even though, I'm at a paid internship and attempting to return to a university in the Fall, I'll likely use the money from my internship to purchase a firearm permit, then a decent caliber handgun and some bullets. Maybe I'll splurge the rest of the money a few months prior to my death or give most of it to my sister.

Oof ouchie, there goes my soul.

I feel that this will be a complete repeat of last year I'm lonely, lost all my friends due to my anxiety causing me to distance myself from them. The oral issues as well my post-nasal drip are at an all-time high making my breath smell just as bad as it usually does, which further heightens my anxiety and social isolation. I have also recently discovered that I may have Asperger's. My unintelligence knows no bounds. My parents can be passive-aggressive at times, be it small insults, or hostile vibes they give off sometimes. The main point is that they care about my life. I however do not. I speak for myself when I say that life is not for everyone. Someone as weak, naive, and kind-hearted as myself will inevitably be crushed by the cruel unforgiving weight of the world. Anyways, I don't want to repeat the same shit I've spoken about in my previous posts to I'll call it here for now.

Take care everyone! Until next time! (maybe)

c0jlf6,1,2019-06-14,How do I explain to my boss that I don’t want to do their personal work that’s outside of my work for them?,Carmaly100,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/c0jlf6/how_do_i_explain_to_my_boss_that_i_dont_want_to/,"**disclaimer: I’m using they/them pronouns because I don’t want to be specific in saying their identity. I doubt they’re on Reddit but I still am afraid to be open so I’m asking for advice. 



I’m in college and right now I’m on break. So I was in need for a job and I was given an offer to work for their business. It’s part time and only for the summer. I needed money so yeah. And since I don’t live too far from them it’s also cool. 

I won’t mention any specific details in case I don’t want to be exposed. It’s a small business and all I can say is that it involves working with kids. The job itself is nice. It’s also tiring but it does involve kids so it’s expected. I’m not complaining about the job itself since I do like kids. But now I’m starting to feel a bit annoyed. So before work, during “break time” and after work hours, my boss would ask me to “help” them with their assignments. But it ends up me actually doing the assignments and them either doing something else since they are busy working and being a parent or legit relaxing. Now I’m a bit too nice and soft spoken and I’m very afraid of speaking to adults and people of authority, if you know what I mean. I get super sensitive and start to cry with a little bit of I guess raising of the voice. I don’t know a specific term to use, but basically if I view someone as an authority figure and they’re also pretty strict, not necessarily mean, but just I guess assertive (that’s the word I think), I get emotional and ready eyed immediately. It’s been like since since I was young but I don’t know if that’s some underlying condition I have, but that’s another topic. Anyways, I guess you can say I’m afraid of speaking up cause I’m afraid of them cause their demeanor speaks “don’t oppose me or else”. 

And so that’s why I was even afraid of speaking up about negotiating with pay. I work basically the whole day for 5 days a week and I only get $200. I blame myself for that but also, I don’t have a bachelors degree. I have an associate degree but I don’t know what kind of salary I can negotiate with that level. So hopefully I bring up the courage for them to either pay me extra and for the days I’ve worked. My mom was mad at me cause she said I’m basically getting payed $5 an hour. But yeah I need to bring up the courage to be able to ask for a boost and to pay me for the other days I’ve worked and now. But how? And also, would they be willing?

But to bring me to what I want to say, I’ve been doing their assignments and I know it’s not coming from them obviously. But how do I tell them I don’t want to do this anymore. There’s a reason why I’m on break. To take a break from school lol. But as I said before, if you need help with an assignment I can do that. But when it reaches the point of me actually doing your assignments, either I get paid extra (lol sike) or I don’t do nothing for you at all. I really don’t know how to say this or approach them. I’m asking you guys for advice. Also, I guess you can also give me advice on how to negotiate pay and stuff. Again this is a summer job and I am also a pre-med student and want to do internships if I can. My mom says that if the treatment I’m getting isn’t good ( her intuition is scary) then I should just shift myself onto something else. 

The job itself isn’t bad, but the extra stuff makes everything sour to me. I actually kinda feel “trapped” since I’m so afraid to speak out. Yeah so help out and I love all kinds. You can even roast me for being afraid and dumb to speak out. But I will say that I do have some forms of depression and anxiety so bear with me too. And I also want to clear up that my boa is not mean or overpowering. Their personality is nice but they still have a demeanor of don’t mess with me, if you know what I mean."

As I'm ""just an intern"", they started throwing all the monkey job's at me.

I had never worked using VSTS/TFS/Azure Pipelines, at first I thought they had it all working just fine, but time proved me wrong... The mechanical way they did stuff was just annoying after a while!

In one case we had this agent on a Windows Server, whenever a deploy had to be made, the thing would download the build artifact and instead of using it right away, it would copy it over the local network from a different machine, and use this copy instead of the downloaded version...

We have nearly 80 git repos, many of them, very similar to each other at least in the deployment process. If there was any change in the process, every single one had to be altered, it took a LOT of time, and it was basically asking for man-made mistakes to take place.

Not a single soul trusted the deployment and the TFS at all. In two months, I basically deleted all of what was there, and automated the whole thing.

I used the downloaded artifact in the deployment, instead of isolated tasks I created tasks and used variables, making everything easier, faster and finally trustworthy!

Automation of human based processes changed the way it all worked! Don't fear this kind of change, actually, be a part of it, maybe you'll discover a whole new way of doing things the right and the easy way!"

c0lrh7,4,2019-06-14,two Jobs at Same Company,fuckeveryone________,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/c0lrh7/two_jobs_at_same_company/,"I'm a college student with a year left before graduation. I've been applying to internships in my area and have had no luck.

Recently, I found a new listing and applied to it. A few days later, I saw another listing from the same company (just a general labor job, not an internship) and applied to it, as well.

About a week later, I got an e-mail asking me to come in and interview for the labor job. Right after interviewing, I got a call offering me the job. I accepted and submitted all of the paperwork that was e-mailed to me. I was upset that I hadn't heard back regarding the internship, but thought this job would be a great fit for my schedule both in the summer and when school starts again in the fall.

This Monday, I got another e-mail asking me to come in for an interview--for the internship this time. I went in today and interviewed. I think I did well and I think I have a real shot at landing this position which would carry on through my last year of school and very likely lead to a full-time job offer--basically a dream job.

I'm supposed to start the labor job in about a week, although I'm still in the dark as to the exact start date. I'll know whether I did well enough to land this internship in the first week of July.

What am I supposed to do here? I obviously can't start the labor job if I'll only be there for a couple weeks. That being said, I don't want to give up that job if the internship doesn't pan out. How likely is the labor job supervisor to push back my potential start date? I'm afraid that letting him know about my predicament will mean he will choose to pass me up for another candidate. I'm also afraid that going forward with the hiring process for the labor job will lock me out of what could essentially be a dream job."

Can’t help but feel they think I’m slow and useless.

It took me a day to write a few sql queries that link some fields across different tables together and count one of those fields in the query. I still haven’t even figured out the syntax for counting that new query, I just put it in a view and counted a field in that view. 
My manager initially gave me a few more tasks that he just gradually dropped from the list because I was having issues with the application we’re using. 

For example I was meant to write some sql code that would be used to model a discrete graph, but the graphing tool was fighting back a bit. My manager took that over &amp; tasked me with making the dashboard look visually good instead. 

I guess it’s bothering me a bit to see them plan all the complex stuff they need to do to get their project running and I’m just given a much smaller, somewhat trivial task. I understand that they’re very deep into data analysis, writing etl scripts and using python libraries I don’t know, and it would be inconvenient to grind to a halt to teach the intern how to learn all the concepts just to do something they already know how to do. But I keep getting the feeling  they’ve decided I’m probably not capable of much, at least not in the time frame they’ve designated.


Does it sound like I’m underperforming? my manager hasn’t made it clear. Has anyone else experienced this something similar? I’d appreciate some advice."

However, I have a 2.8 gpa, no side projects, no work experience in anything cs related. So I doubt a real cs internship is even possible at the moment. Going into software sales has not really even occurred to me until now. From what I’m reading it is lucrative and competitive. 

So I guess what I’m asking is would an internship like this be worth my time if I’m not sure exactly what I’m doing?

For those of you that are software salesmen, or work near the salespeople, what is their everyday work life like?

More so, what backgrounds do they have as far as school work, work experience, ect...?

So a little bit about my background: I started off pursuing physics my freshman but took an intro comp sci class my sophomore and really enjoyed it. I am currently panicking about getting a job because I have just finished my junior year and I know that the time for securing a full time job is coming up. I am worried because I don't feel as prepared as I need to be. My cumulative gpa is around 3.2 and my major GPA is a little bit higher. While I have not had an official internship, I have taught web application development courses for gifted 7-8th graders for two summers in a row now. Should I be concerned about my experience? While I have had exposure to many languages, I do not feel like I have ""mastered"" any. Also, I haven't coded in Java yet. Should I be worried about this? Should I pick a single language to master? I am currently taking a python course to strengthen my skills in it because it's my favorite language. Is it beneficial to try to master python or spend my time developing skills in Java? Also, I know you have to answer some tricky interview questions if you land one. What resources are the most efficient for learning these? Also, what are some tips for landing an interview?"

I’m rising sophomore and I’m currently interning at a large tech company.  The style of the internship is that I have a partner for my project as well as a host and a co host. The actual project is basically adding on to an already used feature. The code needed for everything is already there and generated but we just need to connect them and add tests. My hosts chose to split it into two parts, front-end and back-end, and I’m currently working on the front-end. I built a simple debug extension for the project so far but I was just told today that there probably won’t be many other changes. I’m learning a lot about the company and their internal tools and what the development process looks like, but I just don’t feel challenged by what I’m doing. There’s 8 weeks left of the internship and we will probably complete the project in 2. Should I bring this up with my hosts? Also a part of the returning review process is to give the evaluators a design doc for our project and also our resume. Because the feature is already built, just added implementation, I’m worried that both these items will look very thin and less impressive compared to my fellow interns. 

Tl:dr: My given project is a bit too simple and doesn’t leave room for challenge or creativity. Feeling down about this as I still have 8 weeks left and I’m not sure I can make it look impressive on a resume"

I am a recent college graduate from Michigan, just graduated with a B.S. in Information Systems in April.  I have been applying to jobs in Grand Rapids and Detroit.  I currently live north of Detroit.  

&amp;#x200B;

I really have no professional experience besides an internship last summer at a big energy company.  But I'd consider myself tech savvy, a valuable employee, and a fast learner.  I'm currently studying for CCNA and would then like to get into cloud.  

&amp;#x200B;

I just received an offer for $17/hr in Grand Rapids for an IT Assistant at a smaller company.  There really isn't much of an IT department.  In the main building I'd be working at, from my understanding, there is the IT manager, a part-time assistant, and then there'd be me.  The first thing they'd want me doing is migrating a bunch of systems over to Windows 10 using powershell.  They also mentioned learning some software.  So, I think it would be great experience on my resume.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I'd have to get a place over there, either renting or mortgaging a house.  After all expenses (rent/mortgage, food, car insurance, gas, etc.), I wouldn't have much left.  

  
My parents suggest I counter offer at $23/hr.  I really have no experience with this kind of so I was wondering what others may suggest.

I remembered the password for my throwaway account so why not.  
  
There is always a steady stream of angst, a sense of self doubt and general hysteria over meeting expectations for hiring. I encountered it myself multiple times on this subreddit. It's easy to gloss over the positive elements of this subreddit and the genuine advice and feed into the negativity and so on. But I just wanted to chime in with my experiences and hopefully offer some inspiration to people who may be doubting themselves in a crucial and stressful part of their pursuit of a degree, internship and eventually a job.  
  
I went to a no name state university with an okay computer science program. It's not terrible but it's not exactly what youd call amazing. Long story short I don't mention it and get ooh's and ah's, and it by no means served as an integral piece on my resume aside from being a bachelors degree in computer science.  
  
I did okay in classes, I got some C's, I got a D in Calc II and retook it. Some of my CS classes kicked my ass and sent me home thinking I wasn't cut out for it. In the meantime I was sitting at around a 2.8 GPA my sophomore year and felt like not much was going to turn out.  
  
I felt sorry for myself, felt like I hadn't been given a fair chance at what was my dream. I SOMEHOW got an internship at a terrible small company and hated every day of it, quit the job and almost convince myself that computer science wasn't for me. And it's at this sort of moment where you have a choice to make. You either take responsibility for your shortcomings and progress or find something else to do. After consulting this sub multiple times and finding massive amounts of encouragement I decided to push through, and see what I could accomplish. If I wasn't going to prove it to myself how would I prove it to employers, was some advice that I found most useful.  
  
Fast forward a few years and I got my GPA to nearly 3.2 and accepted an internship with a job offer at the end with a fantastic top name company and have the rest of my career to look forward to.  
  
I'm not sure how this will be received or if it will be taken down but I hope someone who is questioning their abilities sees this and realizes that despite how low you go you can almost always rise above and realize your true potential. Please dont give up on this career path if it is a passion of yours. Turn your blinders on to the parading of 4.0's and top level programs. You can do it too."

How do you decide when it’s time to go home at the end of the day? 

Context: 

My team’s rough hours are 8:30-5:30, but my manager told me on day 1 that I can come any time between 8:30 and 9, so I’ve been getting in between 8:45 and 9, sometimes I’m in before the team sometimes not. Everyone else leaves at about 5:45, 6 at the latest. 

However, I sit far away from the team and they can’t really see me as they leave, so when I’m there later no one notices/says anything. I know I’m allowed to leave at 5:30, but every day so far 5:30 comes and goes and I’m still working on stuff and don’t really feel like stopping/going home yet so I’ve been staying really. It’s not that I’m stressed about finishing my project on time, it’s just that I don’t feel the need to go home. I also moved across the country for this so I don’t have much going on outside of work, and when I have had plans I’ve just left when I needed to in order to be on time. 

So anyways, how do you decide it’s time to put your work down and go home for the night? Is this something I should even be worrying about? Will I start to want to go home early as time goes on?"

I don't mean to discourage you but there are things other than AI/ML that you have to learn. Do not have great pride if you used Tensorflow to ""make a machine learning model"" and don't call yourself an ML engineer. If you don't know the math, don't know how shit works, then shut up. Learn and then call yourself a ML scientist or ML Engineer. EVERYBODY knows how much of an ""ML Engineer"" you are in second year of engineering.

It is pissing off looking at how great these people think they are because they could build something that classifies a cat and a dog or some similar thing from a Udemy / Udacity course. Below is my fuckall rant about these fuckall people. If you care to read.

So, my company got on some bandwagon to include student developers and shortlisted people only on resume. Neither did I ask nor did I want any interns, but I was given interns. Now, I have no clue how skilled these people are and what they know. I work odd hours and am usually busy, but I wanted to give these people a platform.  Obviously I can't expect or give them production code to debug or fix, so I had to basically create tasks for them. I didn't have the chance to even speak to one of them before hiring, but I was told that they were told the role would involve Java and JUnit Testing. 

The first day, I wanted to just know how much they know and asked them basic OOPs questions and even without attempting to answer the questions, 8/10 people ask me why they're being asked Java stuff and why can't they be given ML stuff because they've experience. There is scope for ML in my team, but I can't trust students with the kind of data we work with and there are actual ML engineers who've been working in this field working on problems. 

I didn't know what they expected, so I told them to get started with writing JUnit test cases for some of our prototypes or they could start working on some internal prototype application in any framework of their choice. Either way, it was either testing or app / web development. No fancy ML stuff. I assigned them a mentor to approach for any doubts they have.

Before the end of the day, I had 4 emails requesting for a 1-on-1 meeting. I talk to them and its the same shit again. They want to do ML work and they're practically demanding I assign them ML work because they know there is ML work. I tell them that the data we work with can not be shared that easily and that they were not interviewed for this. But still, they're telling me how every company outside is offering ML work and we are giving the ""dirty"" work to interns. I tell them I'll see what can be done and told them I'll get back by Monday. The feedback from their mentor is that they don't know how to code anything in Java. Anything, at all. He gave them basic debugging tasks and they have no clue how to use a debugger. They don't know any of the design patterns. They know nothing but they want to do ML stuff, even when they were clearly told that they'd be working with Java or JUnit. I even made an exception to give them other projects because they didn't do java in college in depth and offered to provide them Java training (which is very relevant and paid for by the company with certification), but they still want to do ML.

Until here, is fine. I have dealt with a lot of people like this because I keep talking to university students. Where I totally lost it was, today I get a call from the father of one of the interns. He is in the senior management in some other company and he is asking me what is wrong in giving his talented son ML jobs. He then proceeds to tell me how the generation has changed, nobody uses Java and ML is the future and all. At this point, everything is looking like a meme come true. But this guy is serious. This guy thinks, if you can copy paste code and get something running, you can do ML stuff everywhere.

Seriously, if you are a university student and one of these ""ML/DL/AI/Blockchain/NN/XYZ Enthusiasts"", either find an internship that is specific to that area or don't be so rigid. The world is much more bigger than your small bubble and nobody owes you anything. Its not like there are surplus jobs that you can demand these things at such a junior level and learn to be humble.

however, since in our school CE involves a lot of subjects (we take ComSci, EE, some ECE, and general engineering subjects) i dont really have any idea what to focus on. i would even go as far as to say that i only have the absolute basic knowledge for all of these since theres almost no specialization at all.

which is why i'd like to ask; what should i focus on? or how do i decide on that? while i did say i have no specialization, i've been interested in AI (though we have no courses related to this), webdev (mostly backend), and maybe gamedev (which we also have no courses in, and i realize this might be far from CE and can be unreliable as a career choice). im not too fond of arduino and making android apps myself. ive worked as an intern for the summer for 2 months working on backend webdev (PHP/SQL) and i found it really fun (despite having a million moments where i wanted to tear my hair out).

any opinions on what i should be doing?"

(23F, have a bachelor's but no job prospects.)",graygirll,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/c0yfd6/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore_23f_have_a/,"A year and a half ago, I graduated with my bachelor’s degree. Youngest in my family too, I was 22. I started off at community college, and the feeling of being “behind” my peers led me to rush my way through my 4-year-degree. Now I’m regretting it, among other things.

Truthfully, in my youth and even now I struggled a lot with depression and anxiety, unbeknownst to my parents, or maybe they saw it and just didn’t care. Either way, I didn’t think I’d live past my teens. I saw no future for myself, so I didn’t care what field they pushed me around to because I figure I’d kill myself halfway through highschool. I liked working with kids, started volunteering at my church’s preschool when I was like 11/12. My African parents saw that and immediately decided I would be a pediatrician. **(If you have immigrant parents you already know…doctor, lawyer, engineer. That’s it.)** But as I got older and my mental health improved, I met supportive friends and came out of my shell, I started to honestly think about what I wanted to do with my life.

Fast-forward post college, and I’m stuck. I graduated in a family studies degree, promising my parents I’d go to grad school in the health field right after. But after doing some volunteering in the program I’d researched (Occupational therapy), I realized I didn’t care for it even a little, and I was ultimately still letting my fear of displeasing my parents control/influence my decision. I’ve roughed it out for about a year as a sub teacher, but I don’t really care for teaching. They’re saying my “playtime” is over and it’s time for me to get serious, still pushing the health field route or good ol’ medical school.

**I followed the formula I was given. Good grades+go to school+do what you love=Good job right?** Little to no partying/slacking, focused, even majoring in my “passion” or what I thought was my passion. But without going to grad school, **my job prospects are shit**. Every other possible career opportunity I’ve looked at has either been shut down by my parents or had roadblocks that I can’t get around (didn’t major in the right thing or requires internships I don’t qualify for.) I can scarcely find a job over $12/hr in a state that still has minimum wage under $8. **Definitely not enough money to move out on, and barely enough to save** because I’m paying student loans. And of course, my mental health is spiraling once again. My parents are downstairs watching something loud on TV, and I’m wondering if I have enough miscellaneous OTC medicine in my drawer to knock me out forever. **Why live if I can’t be in control of my own life?**

When I talk to others, they ask me to do things like list jobs I can see myself in or ask me about my dream job. But truthfully, I don’t have one. I have things I’d love to do in life, like travel and one day write a book, but I don’t want to be a traveling blogger just because of that. A year ago I thought journalism was it for me. More recently I’ve been infatuated with the possibility of being a web or UX/UI designer. **The more time I spend “exploring” the faster the clock is ticking on my sanity and ability to escape and the higher the pressure becomes.**

Do I give up on any hope of forging my own path and succumb to the pressure? Do as my dad says and do “what works” (which to them is the health field, probably nursing) and leave my dreams for later? Or keep hopping from one possibility to the next, hoping something sticks and I can prove myself and make it out or literally die trying?

Sorry this is so long winded, maybe I should've looked for a rant subreddit. But I just joined and I needed somewhere to unload. **TLDR: Have a bachelor's, can't find a decent paying job, immigrant parents want to force me into a career I don't want and I'm starting to feel like I'm out of options. Anxiety/depression doesn't help.**

Edit: Thanks for all the responses! A lot of people asked about or suggested therapy. I was in therapy during my last year of undergrad and it really helped. Unfortunately, as soon as I graduate I'm no longer able to access my therapist. I'm too anxious to start therapy while living at home because I feel like my parents will find out. I have to sneak around for things like gyno appointments, but those aren't as frequent as seeing a therapist every week."

&amp;#x200B;

I am guessing many of you have a love/hate relationship with routine so I wanted to get some perspective/tips/opinions from you about my situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently finishing my masters degree, doing a small internship, some tutoring, etc. Since I started uni 5 years ago, I could not keep a routine for the life of me, school and work were changing times. Also I changed a lot of jobs, freelance, ... In the last year or two, it has really gotten on my nerves. I went to Erasmus to Italy and managd to keep a nice routine because I had loads of time and nothing to do except a bit of school, reading, exercising... So that was good. of course when some deadline came, off went the routine. After coming back I managd to keep it a bit, but then next semester came and I was just constatnly running late, catching deadlines, staying up late, you know.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been feeling like what would get my life around a bit would be a steady routine of wake up/night times, work schedules or something. But whenever I try to keep my night hours the same, I manage a week before something comes up. Nght/morning routines the same thing. It would help to have a steady job, but none of the ones that interest me are like that, instead it seems I will be in charge of one project with extra non-routine hours. 

So it comes down to this: I naturally cannot keep a routine and am bored with them. But on the other hand I feel like it would make my brain a bit calmer and would make my life easier. At this point I cannot tell which one is more true. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what is your story? Did you implement some solid routines and it helped you? Or you just kinda gave up and accepted life as it is and you are all right with that? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you possibly have any adhd-friendy routines, tips, advice that would help with this...? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Bored with routines, cannot keep them, but feel like they would help a lot. Opinions?"

It didn't help that the only company that I have ever worked in was a Swedish startup called Videoplaza made me feel very much that way.

On day one, the fresh intern me was given a brand new MacBook Pro, tasked jobs similar to a full-time software engineer. At meetings, I felt like my opinion mattered, even though I was this naive little idiot trying to pick fights around  Linux VS MacOS. I cringe recalling that.

At no time did I feel restrained when it came to working hours, or what I did at work, but I respected the company and the team enough to never violate that trust.

Then I came back to Singapore and started a company. With my very first interns and staff, I treated them the way I wanted to be treated:

* To be given all trust until you violate my trust
* To not have rules until you exploit the system
Slowly but surely, I had my naivety reeled in.

Almost every staff will abuse the MC on days they do not feel like coming in, so I had to implement an MC cap. (Except for the best staff)
Every staff will push the reporting hours with the pattern starting with them reporting early, then on the dot, the incrementally late.
Then cancer emerges:

* I had a staff taking numerous emergency leaves to leave work so they can meet their ""property clients"" during office hours.
* I had a 19-year-old staff fresh (Polytechnic) graduate shouting at me because I was that friend at work, not her boss.

This is what I have come to realise: That I am not like most Singaporeans, and Singaporeans, in general, require discipline through enforcement unlike Swedes, by which the fear of shame is much stronger than the fear of rules.

Anyways, it works for me. Because I'm an asshole and now I get to be myself at work."

c1bh1d,4,2019-06-16,Found out my dad might be a rapist. How do I deal with this?,notmymain0123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c1bh1d/found_out_my_dad_might_be_a_rapist_how_do_i_deal/,"I  [24F] had about 11 years of suspicion of this. It was essentially confirmed a couple weeks ago because my mom told me cops once (11 years ago) came to the house and said my dad picked up and raped an underage girl. She told me because my dad was losing his shit since I was moving out. He never went to jail so I don’t know if she just  covered for him or what. 

I don’t feel comfortable asking my mom for more details and I rarely see her when he’s not around. It’s clear she wasn’t supposed to tell me, so I’m worried he’d hurt her if he knew she told me.

So then, I also can’t tell him I know and that I can’t see him the same way. Which I would like to do but can’t for my moms safety.

I don’t respect my dad. I know he’s cheated on my mom in the past and when my mom told me the news with the cops, she also told me he’s been lying about his military rank as “something happened” and they took him down one. This makes sense because he was a high rank when I was a kid and then he kind of suddenly retired and we moved across the country.

I don’t know how to process this. My therapist is away or busy, idk it’s through a government funded LA county service, and I don’t have an appointment until July. I want to go in for a drop in appointment but idk if they do weekends and I don’t want to call out of my internship since it’s on a strict schedule.

Please, any coping advice. Idk how to accept my dad (if I even can or should) and be “okay” with my mom possibly covering for him. I love my mom so much."

I did a 3-month Android internship in the meanwhile and I really liked it, I saw the level of my Android skill, improved them a lot and learned a few new things as well. But I don't like the situation at my current company, they made me do some boring Java scripts and pull meaningful data on the Firebase. Basically, they don't have people for all the work, they are paying you the bare minimum and you do work as a junior developer. 

The problem is that Android jobs are very rare in my country and you are never only an Android developer, so I applied for another internship, this time for backend technologies. I want to experience everything before I decide to commit to one technology and master it, but I lately I am starting to feel like I am wasting my time and not making anything useful. And the thought that I won't do anything useful in the nearly future is kinda depressing and demotivating in some sense. 

Is it smart to do another internship for backend or should I try to apply for Android jobs in other companies no matter how rare they pop-up? I need your help and opinion..."

Recently I've been second guessing wether CS is really for me. I don't love programming, and I'm not great at it. During my time at college I've been diagnosed with a learning disability and some mental health issues, which makes it pretty hard to keep up with work. At my internship I'm really struggling to keep up and I feel completely overwhelmed. I know a lot of interns feel overwhelmed, but I just hate working like this.

Despite all this, I feel like if I could end up with a job after I graduate that's repetitive and slow paced I could be successful. I don't care about it being high pay, or working on something exciting, just a low-stress job. Are there any kinds of jobs / companies that are like this that I could get with a CS degree after I graduate?"

The only issue is that I'm just really lost on what I ought to be utilizing my time. Right now I have some random Bioengineering internship just so I can have something to put on my resume for internships next year (currently a rising sophomore), but I was hoping to start working on independent hobby projects such as making radios/microwaves/Raspberry Pi stuff, etc. cause I know a lot of smart engineering students do that. However, I don't know where to start. 

Is the best place to start by watching Youtube videos like how to program in Python, or should I be looking at online step-by-step guides to how to make a radio or something, cause right now I don't have the knowledge to just start and make something completely from scratch. Or maybe I should download some programming/mechanical engineering textbooks, sit down, and read through it chapter by chapter and keep doing problems one by one.

The thing is that I really want to get going and show employers that I'm innovative and motivated but the issue is that I don't know which direction I ought to go with. Whenever I try to start, I just get incredibly angry after typing a couple of lines of code which I don't even understand in some Java IDE or I'll just tune out of some half-hour intro to electronics/mechanical video cause I can't keep attention."

c1fs9f,529,2019-06-16,My friend has been online for 72 hours now and I’m getting concerned,newtotownJAM,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c1fs9f/my_friend_has_been_online_for_72_hours_now_and_im/,"My work buddy Aaron is my best friend. We met on the job 5 years ago, both training at the same time in graphic design and then 3 years later we took the leap and started our own design company. 

The studio is beautiful, modern graphic patterns across the concrete softened by living walls and softly painted abstract art. We have clients from all over the world and at 25 years old we’re living the dream. 

Our art is digital. And as such, in the rare free time that we get we enjoy pc gaming. It was something we found in common early on that just solidified our friendship. In the uni days we’d spend hours trying to defeat each other at a huge variety of games. Despite the cool pretence of our studio we’re true nerds at heart. World of Warcraft was our absolute favourite. 

As the years have gone on we get less and less time to game. Both of us have girlfriends and homes and I have a beautiful 6 month old daughter to look after. My little family is my world. Aaron will always be my best friend but I can’t spend hours raiding dungeons on the pc anymore. 

A few days ago I was chilling at home with my girl, we were watching a movie on Netflix and having a takeaway while our baby was at my mums for some nanna time. Aaron texted me really excited.

“I just got this new game called spirit of fear. You’re going to love it man it’s sooooooo good. Download it. Now! No excuses!”

My girlfriend saw the text over my shoulder and smiled at me. The ending credits of our movie were rolling.

“You can if you want you know, I’m going to have a nice baby free bath so you may as well relax.” She said. Damn, I love her so much. 

I text Aaron back, turned my pc on and downloaded the game. It was made by a brand new company and was mega cheap at £10.99. I could see him on a leaderboard of players sitting at position #189 of just over 2k players. It also showed you how many hours the player had clocked on the game, Aaron had been playing for 3 hours and had done pretty well to rank where he had. 

The game was unusual, it was a fantasy adventure style game where you play as a character named Auberon Delictus battling hundreds of creepy creatures that ran on all fours kind of like a dog but had human flesh and extra limbs growing from strange parts of their bodies. The further you got the stranger and larger the enemies became. The aim was to reach the end of a cursed forest known as the endless abyss. It wasn’t multiplayer which was odd for Aaron to be so into but was a passable game and entertained me for a few hours. 

I collected crystals and other magical items to aid my journey and made it to the top 300 players but eventually tiredness kicked in and I went to join my girlfriend Kate in bed. Just before I switched my pc off I checked the scoreboard and Aaron had reached #122 and had been playing solidly the whole time.  He had now clocked 5 hours. I laughed to myself about what a nerd he is.

The next morning I got up, showered, dressed myself in jeans and a printed shirt with smart shoes, kissed my girlfriend goodbye and hopped in my car to work. I was running a bit late but it didn’t matter, Aaron was always early and I knew he’d have the coffee machine heating up ready. We had a huge meeting that morning about a high value contract we were vying for.

I arrived at work and the studio was all locked up. Odd. Maybe Aaron had been stuck in traffic or was running late too. I got in and switched on the coffee machine - priorities - then started prepping for the big meeting. An hour went by before I noticed that Aaron still wasn’t there, I’d had no phone calls and no messages. 

Our intern, Rita, had turned up and was already working. Rita was always late, we had even floated firing her for it but she was a hard worker when she did arrive so we kept her on, her being half an hour into work before Aaron had even texted got me worried. Maybe he had been in a car accident or something?

I decided to give him a call, we had 20 minutes until our meeting arrived and Aaron had been pushing for this contract for the better part of 6 months. The guy loved him and I had been mostly in the background of this one. Whatever was keeping him needed to be good. 

He answered the phone after a single ring.

“What’s going on man I need you here right now!”

“I’m sorry Jay I’m just not feeling myself I won’t be coming to work today.” Aaron stated. His voice was monotonous and flat, it sounded like he was just going through the motions. He’d struggled with depression for a while in the uni days and I worried that may have hit. I had been distracted with my new baby, maybe I’d missed the signs.

“Is there anything I can do for you? Have you spoken to the doctors?”

“I’m sorry Jay I’m just not feeling myself. I won’t be coming to work today.” He repeated. In the same flat monotone voice. 

There was no discussion, nothing coming after - just dead air meeting my ears through the speaker. Aaron also never called me Jay. Always man or buddy or some other variation but never my actual name. This wasn’t like him at all. 


“Ok man, well I really hope you feel better. Il let you know how the big meeting goes, hopefully I don’t blow this contract for you.” I responded a little peeved but mostly concerned for his wellbeing. The guy I knew had fought so hard for this contract he’d have made it to this meeting on his deathbed if he had to. He was the charmer of our partnership and he knew it.

“Ok, thank you Jay. I will take your advice and contact a doctor.” 

Just like that, he put the phone down. No goodbye, silly comment about my acquisition skills or even a fake cough to make it better. Something was definitely wrong. Maybe I’d pop round to see him tonight after work, I was there through his struggle in uni, maybe I could pull him out of his funk.

The day went pretty smoothly, I let Rita sit in on the meeting and the head of the other company took quite a shine to her, she is full of great ideas and so smart despite only being 18. I’d like to think that’s what he recognised but I feel her classically stunning looks and natural charm might have been a factor. We got the contract regardless. 

I rushed home that night to grab some beers from the fridge and head over to Aaron’s to cheer him up. I hadn’t scheduled any other meetings that day due to the big one so I made it home quite early. As I breezed back from the fridge and into the living room I caught sight of my pc in the corner of my eye and the urge got the best of me. 

I sat down, logged into spirit of fear and went to the leaderboard to see if I had maintained my spot in the top 300. I didn’t manage to check because Aaron’s online name caught my eye first. He was in the top 50 players, and had clocked a grand total of 23 hours. 

The absolute Judas had ghosted the biggest meeting of our careers so far to play some stupid game about an enchanted forest. He hadn’t even attempted to get an hour of sleep. I was so angry. 

I closed the pc, popped open one of the beers and settled in for a chilled family evening with my beautiful girls. That idiot was probably frantically gaming when we spoke on the phone, I wasn’t gonna waste my time on him and I was too angry to confront him then. I decided I’d speak to him at work the next day, when I was calmer and he’d have crashed and woken up and realised what a prick he’d been. 

I ignored my computer the whole night, I didn’t even want to think about it. I was focused on what I was going to say to Aaron the next day, my girlfriend tried to calm me down but I still struggled to sleep. Stewing over it. 

Aaron didn’t turn up for work the next day either. I knew he wouldn’t. Because when I checked in the morning the clocked hours on spirit of fire had reached 38. My position had rapidly dropped, aside from those few hours the first night I hadn’t touched the game and thousands more people had started playing. I was ranking somewhere in the #4000s but Aaron had remained in the top 50. 

I did start to really worry at this point. He hadn’t slept in at least 38 hours and all for some stupid cheap game that wasn’t even his usual type. But I had to go to work, someone had to keep our business thriving, and let Rita in.

About midday I got a call from a distressed Kate, she had Aaron’s girlfriend, Melina, at the house. She had just come from Aaron’s place. They don’t live together but she has a key and hadn’t heard from him so when she had arrived and found him sitting in his own urine at his pc a huge argument ensued. Kate said that when Melina had tried to challenge him about basic hygiene and skipping work that he’d gone mad. He hadn’t argued back at all, not saying a word until she touched his shoulder. He reacted by jumping off his chair and hitting her so hard she flew across the room. Melina was sitting in my living room with a black eye. 

I cancelled all my appointments and shut up shop. I didn’t know what to do, Aaron loved this girl so much, he’d spoken to me about marrying her. He would never want to hurt her. This wasn’t his character, he got mouthy after a few too many but never violent.

I rushed home and Melina was beat up bad, she said he’d only hit her once but you could see how much force it was with, the poor girls eye was so swollen she could barely open it. Kate was seething, she wanted to go over there and kill him herself but Melina seemed shaken by his behaviour.

“I don’t think this is him.” She whimpered “it’s like he’s someone else completely, he didn’t even sound like him.”

“You just don’t want to believe that absolute....” I had to cut Kate off.

“No. I know what she means. He didn’t sound like him on the phone yesterday. The way he spoke was all formal and off.” I shared the leaderboard with them, including Aaron’s now 45 hours of gameplay. 

Almost two days solid on a game, now confirmed to be without toilet breaks. Something was seriously wrong. Aaron’s longest streak on the computer was 7 hours as a teenager on wow. This was something different entirely. I had to go and see him. 

I left Melina at our place with Kate and drove straight over to Aaron’s with his girlfriends spare key and the complete lack of a plan. 

I didn’t need the spare key. The door was unlocked and there he was sat facing his pc. The game had changed significantly from what I saw. The creatures weren’t scary anymore or running like deformed humanoid dogs. They were beautiful beings surrounded by bright rings of light in the impossibly colourful forest. The character was dripping with gold armour and seemed to be in complete control of the light beings. 

Every now and again a plant would extend a vine in an attempt to trip the character up but the light beings were there to save you. It looked like he had to be nearing the end of the game. 

“Jay, why aren’t you playing? We could have so much fun.” Jay said in the monotonous voice, not breaking eye contact with his computer.

“What’s wrong with you man, why did you do that to Melina! You need to turn that computer off and get in the shower. It stinks in here!” It did. The ammonia from the pee he was soaked in penetrated even the walls of the room. It was gross. His lack of personality and seeming lack of free will was starting to creep me out. 

Aaron still didn’t break eye contact with the game, his fingers didn’t stop frantically touching different keys, as if spirit of fear was a Beethoven masterpiece. But he did speak.

“I can’t stop Jay. My veins have become part of this forest now. I will be the first human to reach the end. At the end I will be set free. If I am set free I can leave this place. This endless abyss. It looks oh so lovely but really it’s just trickery. The darkness is coming for me and it won’t let me leave. As soon as I looked for too long I connected.” 

As I was listening to his ramblings I noticed what looked to be blood coming from near the mouse. My first thought was that he’d worn his skin away clicking but what became clear was far worse. Sprouting from the veins in his wrist were two cables, one for each arm, stretching like a thick vine in the jungle all the way to behind the computer screen. He was literally connected to this damn virtual forest.

My eyes wandered to the screen again, where the pretty light beings had changed into something horrific. They took the shape of something no standard earthly game could. Aaron’s little sister who was murdered walking home after school many years ago, except her face was twisted. She didn’t look warm or friendly like the real her had been. She looked dark and viscous. Like she could hurt you even through the screen.

My heart pounded, I’d never been more terrified in my life. I tried to grab hold of Aaron’s arm and pull out the cable but the second my skin made contact with his he grabbed hold of my arm twisted it backwards, the cable seemed to extend as he moved and adjust to fit him. He didn’t break eye contact with the screen once. Watching as his evil computerised sister lost health while his character plunged a sword into her repeatedly. 

I was terrified. I’m not proud to say I left but I did. I got the fuck out of there, locking the door behind me and my best friend in with some cursed game and a complete lack of sanity. 

A cursed game. Maybe I was losing my mind. This was stupid. I’d seen articles come out about spirit of fear in our gaming circles during these few days claiming the game was addictive and nerve wracking. The reviews may have used the term addictive but there was nothing about losing the ability to fulfil basic toilet needs. Nothing to suggest the game was off at all. And besides, I was fine.

I decided to try again, see if I’d missed something. When Kate went to bed and Melina was asleep in our spare room I snuck downstairs and booted up the game. 

My heart pounded as I played, I was desperate to find some sort of clue, something that could help me to help Aaron. But after 2 solid hours nothing. I was completely able to come away from it and go to sleep. 

That was last night and today Aaron is still online, at this current time he’s clocked almost 72 hours and I don’t know what to do. If he’s not using the bathroom I doubt he’s eating or drinking and I’m worried he’s going to die. I was going to call the police today or an ambulance or someone but I wanted to help him without resorting to that. So I made a stupid decision. 

I decided to play a little more. I don’t know why I thought it would help. I had some weird urge and I thought maybe I missed something last night because I was tired, maybe I’d see something and I could save him but I couldn’t. I played for 5 hours straight today.

The reason I’m writing this all down is because I’m stuck to my gaming chair. I can’t move and my whole body is locked. I can’t turn my neck to look anywhere but my pc. I’ve been trying to resist the urge to play for so long but it’s only a matter of time. Please someone help me. I can see the cables moving underneath my skin and I’m starting to get a pain in my wrist."

&gt;**Second year**: Tried my hand at webdev, GUI designing, played lawn tennis and won a bronze medal too amongst peer  
&gt;  
&gt;**Third year**: Heard about artificial intelligence and got my intern in the field  
&gt;  
&gt;**Fourth year**: Continued with artificial intelligence - trying for related jobs like business analyst, ML engineer

If I'm writing my resume for the AI related jobs, all my college experience in the first two years are essentially useless and can not be written! This severely limits my CV, and I don't think it's my fault for jumping around in earlier years because I wanted a taste of everything before I decided my career.

Is there any salvage at this point? My GPA is 4/4 with a minor in CS. 

I have been asked in an interview ""What if you decide this isn't the job for you either? Will you shift careers again?"" and I was caught off guard. This has been a major cause of concern ever since. Please help!"
c1hnqp,3,2019-06-16,First job anxiety.,xPixelRainx,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/c1hnqp/first_job_anxiety/,"I'm on summer break right now and I'm 18. As the title suggests, I'm having a hard time pushing myself to get a first real job and it's really stressing me out. It has now been about 3 weeks, and I haven't even submitted any job applications. I'm literally just sitting at home being unproductive, not accomplishing anything at all. I have extreme social anxiety. I'm probably the most awkward person in the world. An introvert to the maximum degree. I can't even hold a normal conversation without being aware of how awkward I am. The idea of an interview terrifies me and I really don't want to talk to people in a professional environment.

While I was in high school, I worked at a call center as part of a paid internship. As you can expect, this was nightmare fuel for me. I honestly don't know how I made it out of there alive. I would place customers on hold constantly, struggle to keep a conversation, and occasionally hang up the phone if a customer got too angry. It's a miracle that I didn't get fired. The only reason I think that they hired me in the first place was because I had perfect attendance in school, which was apparently extremely important to them when deciding who to hire. The only thing that kept me alive was my coworkers who were all students from my high school. They were always there when I needed them. I could ask them any questions, voice my concerns, and express my opinions to them.

Luckily, it only lasted a year, but that means I'm currently not making any money. The money I earned from working there will only continue to dwindle over time as I spend it on gas, food, insurance, etc. The thought of getting a real job and talking to people face to face is horrifying to me. It'll be an entirely new environment and I won't know anyone at all. I want to get a job in retail, but like I said earlier, I really don't want to talk to people.

However, now that I'm in college, I need to get a job, make some money, and move on with my lonely life. I don't know what I'm actually accomplishing by posting this, but I just needed to get these thoughts out of my mind. If anyone has tips on how to overcome this fear, please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have extreme social anxiety and I'm afraid to submit any job applications."

Thanking you in advance in reading this.;

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be very hardworking, high achieving, resilient, positive.

However, now looking back, things already started to fall apart 1-2 years ago:

\- sleeping at 3am &amp; getting &lt;=6 hours of sleep while having to cram

\- switching major last year of college and had to cram to finish to get $$

\- Ex had negative mindsets and said things that made me seem worthless to mutual friends; I get more anxious thinking I need to prove these people that i'm not useless

\- feel pressure to get at least get 6 figure salary, but this is always conflicted with what people say to have ""balance in life"".

\- grew up having to support low-income family with a single mother; my family background/culture reinforces that I need to sacrifice for my younger siblings and family. Although after I got into a good college, my mother always says it's ok if I don't make 6 figures, I grew up feeling the necessity of having more money

\- etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Every issue just snowballed. Now:

\- study through 30-minute video, but nothing is retained in my brain

\- always having a mind fog'

\- fall asleep ever so often while working/studying during the day

\- my first job out of college pays above average but way less than my tech peers. it's not hard and I dont dislike it, but I still don't have the motivation to do anything at work. Also, i feel like this job is not respected by my peers

\- feel like i made a lot of wrong decisions in college, so now i'm super afraid of decision making. this made me also form a habit of being anxious and indecisive, don't even know what to do next in daily chores

&amp;#x200B;

I got into a good MS program (but delayed admission) &amp; got a good internship that might lead to a return offer worth 6 figures.

I had quite a lot of time from when I got an internship to my starting date. I originally wanted to prep well before internship so I can more likely get a return offer. However, my current state prevents me from learning. With my internship coming up in 1 month, I'm sure I can't even finish 1/6 of the tasks during the internship. (interview and actually doing the job are quite different). The likelihood that I might not get a return offer is making me more anxious and unable to make any decision.

A. If I don't go now, I don't think I will ever be able to go again. ""Golden opportunity"" means I got really lucky during the interview (some people got way harder interviewers).

B. If I go and end up performing poorly (which 90% I will), I might not be trusted to ever get hired at this company again.

&amp;#x200B;

I could ask to push internship to maybe 3 months later, but my current offer wouldn’t be guaranteed anymore. They will only let me know if there are openings available later.

&amp;#x200B;

So now questions:

**1) Any mental exercise and productivity tricks I can do in 1 month to become productive, and also learn the things I wanted to prep for the internship?**

**2) If 1 month is not possible, how do be happy with the possibility of losing this golden opportunity?**

**3) Will 3 extra months be enough to increase my productivity for it to be worth the risk of losing this golden opportunity?**

c1i8k9,7,2019-06-16,Advice for switching co-op sequence (2A),chungusisdead,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/c1i8k9/advice_for_switching_coop_sequence_2a/,"**The situation:** I am currently in CS on my first co-op. I am planning on double majoring in Mathematical Finance and CS - I will likely need 9 academic semesters to do this. I used to be in Double Degree, but I have dropped BBA and now need to decide a co-op sequence. I will be doing 2A in the fall. I need to decide whether I take my second co-op in the Winter, or do 2B in the Winter.

I would prefer to do 2B in the Winter, but I have concerns about my job prospects in the future. Right now I have a job that is not very related to what I want to be doing in the future (I am doing low-level finance stuff - I would prefer something more technical and quantitative). I would consider this co-op to not even count as experience - so if I were to hold off my second co-op until Summer 2020 I believe I would be competing with all of the first years (and I might even be at a disadvantage because I am one year older - I have heard that in Actuarial Science there is a balance between how many exams you pass and how many internships you have had, so it is actually detrimental to to have too much education compared to your work experience. I think that I am in a similar boat, but this may not apply to Quant Finance or CS jobs)

**The main questions I have:**

\- How much easier is it to get a job in the Winter co-op compared to the Summer?

\- Will I be more prepared for work if I am in 2B? I am going to take CS 246E which I know will be useful for Financial Engineering, but I won't actually get the benefit from it for interviews in 2A since I will still be taking it.

\- Is it possible to have too little experience relative to your education? Due to overloading, if I do 2B in the Winter and take my second co-op in the summer, I will technically be in 3A, not 2B, when I am applying for my second co-op. Since my first co-op is not great work experience, I am essentially in 3A applying for my first job. Is this as bad as I think it is?"

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, I am currently doing a SWE internship at an f500 tech company, and I've been working with AWS for the duration of the internship so far (little more than a month).  By the end of the it, I'll have 4 months total experience working with AWS.  It seems as though I'm likely to get a return offer, and my boss told me last week that if I wanted to get a certification while I'm here, the company would pay for the exam.  I think this could be useful, since once I graduate I'll either be taking a return offer here or pursuing DevOps or software engineering roles elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm strongly considering taking advantage of this opportunity, but I have some reservations, namely:

* that the certifications recommend a year of experience (which I'll only have 1/4 of by the time I take the exam)
* whether or not the industry view these certifications positively, I don't want to dedicate time to something that's going  to get my resume thrown in the trash in the future
* that the experience counts for more than the cert would, and it would be superfluous

So my situation is, I am only that class behind and I can take other class this summer to “catch up” but I am not sure if I really want/ need it .

If I take it, the only benefit is that I will be on the same level with some friends, but if I don’t I will have more time to work (currently working 2-4 hrs a day depending how I feel or the time I have) and learn some programming ( for future internship )

Hey guys

For our blog on work-life balance, we had the chance to interview Mylan Vu, the Managing Director at Hotwire, a global communications agency focused on B2B &amp; consumer tech brands.

Mylan talks about her experience leading and managing the Hotwire Australia team, typical day in the life a Managing Director, maintaining balance in agency life and more.

You can read the entire interview below and check it out on our blog [here](https://www.balancethegrind.com.au/interviews/balancing-the-grind-with-mylan-vu-managing-director-at-hotwire/).

&amp;#x200B;

**1) To kick things off, could you tell us a little about your background and career?**

I’ve been across agency and in-house PR and communications roles for over a decade, spanning Australia and Japan.

I did a tonne of internships throughout uni at various agencies and found my most interesting work in the B2B tech space, which has directed the majority of my career.

I loved the challenge of finding ‘golden nugget’ stories among seemingly dry materials and corporate accomplishments.

By working with B2B tech companies around the world, my appreciation grows every day for just how deeply tech is changing our world and making it a more fascinating place to be.

As well as working with amazing brands and clients, I’ve also had a privilege of leading and managing incredible people.

In my last 2 years at Hotwire, I’ve led the Australian team, growing from a handful of consultants to now being a 15-strong team of award-winning experts. We recently merged with brand and design agency, Precinct, further doubling the size of our business and significantly broadening our offering to clients.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) What is your current role and what does it entail on a day to day basis?**

As the Managing Director for Hotwire Australia, I am responsible for:

* overseeing and driving the success of our client portfolio
* leading and empowering our team of 15 in Sydney
* collaborating with our global leadership team and other Managing Directors across Hotwire to align our activities with the global business strategy, and
* taking ownership of hitting our own local KPIs and goals, including financial, client retention, and staff satisfaction targets

&amp;#x200B;

**3) What does a typical day in the life look like for you? Can you take us through a recent workday?**

My days generally start and end with calls with our teams and clients around the world on Hotwire’s business strategy, client programs and how we can be going above and beyond for global clients, and/or opportunities to grow the business.

In between, I generally spend 50% of my time with my teams and clients to guide any crisis comms programs, input into strategy recommendations and implementation, build on creative campaigns, meeting 1-1 with staff to discuss their own career goals and paths, or meeting 1-1 with clients to dig deeper into how we can be adding value to their business.

The other 50% of my time is split across meetings and actioning initiatives across the HR, finance, and operations aspects of the business to ensure we’re running effectively and profitably.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Do you have any tips, tricks or shortcuts to help you prioritise your workload?**

Someone once told me that the average agency to-do list starts off full at the start of the day, and ends up being even longer at the end of the day. We laughed about it at the time, but it’s this exact mentality and level of complacency with excessive workloads that inevitably leads to burnout.

Consequently, I generally treat my calendar as a to-do list. I slot in activities – like strategy decks, team update about X, Y, Z, and content creation – as if they were meetings, and I give them ample time to be completed, factoring in the high likelihood of being disrupted by a client or staff emergency 1-2 times a day.

A constantly changing workload is inevitable in agency life, but that doesn’t mean we’re completely out of control of our day – in fact, with proper time and project management, it can be the opposite.

This method helps me to only commit to tasks I can feasibly fit into the day, and also set realistic expectations with the team and our clients on when tasks can be completed.

&amp;#x200B;

**5) In between your job, life and all your other responsibilities, how do you ensure you find some sort of balance in your life?**

I lean heavily on loved ones in my life that keep me grounded – my baby niece and nephew are always able to effortlessly remind me of what’s really important, and why we work to live, not the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

**6) What are some of the things you do to take time out and recharge?**

It’s easy to get into a spiral of activity and flurry of work where it can start to feel like you’re constantly doing things for others – ‘always’ giving time, energy, headspace, and ideas, rather than receiving. Of course, this is rarely reality but we all find ourselves in this frame of mind from time to time.

I find one of the best ways to recharge is to consciously do something ‘for me’, every day. It could be something as small as getting a coffee or going for a walk, or something indulgent like getting a new set of headphones.

Instead of making these choices based on ‘need’, switching to think of these as a ‘reward’ for everything you do every day can be surprisingly uplifting and motivating, without over-inflating your ego (hopefully!).

&amp;#x200B;

**7) What do you think are some of the best habits you’ve developed over the years to help you strive for success and balance?**

**Ask for help** – particularly when it’s embarrassing! There’s a common misconception that asking for help makes you look weak and incapable. In my experience, it’s been an effective way to show self-awareness, get training to upskill quickly, and then use those new skills to further catapult my career.

**Focus on self** – this isn’t just in relation to work-life balance, but throughout your day-to-day. A lot of people (I used to be well and truly in this group) worry about what others are saying or thinking about them, but the reality is the only person who is really judging you is you.

If we all focused efforts on being our best selves, even in the off-chance someone is unhappy with that, there’s literally nothing else you can do – so why worry about it?

&amp;#x200B;

**8) Are there any books you’ve read that have helped you with work-life balance?**

**9) What is the number one thing you do to make sure you get the most out of your day?**

I still want to be a developer after I graduate but I am not sure I am gonna pull through the academics of a CS degree. Do you think that major matters when I go into job search?"

Bad grades in good university in CS, no recruiters looks at me because of the grades for student positions in companies. Wondering how to get me interviews for programming jobs.

Hello!

So I am feeling really depressed in the last semester (I am at my fourth with 2 more left after this). Reason being I don't have good grades although I really try very hard each semester to improve. This is important for me to stress since I pour hours a day after school to go over the materials but I often choke on the exams. 

I tried going to the job fair last week and people didn't even look at my resume because of my grades. Furthermore, I then met up with one of the recruiters there whom I knew from one of the courses he simply said to me improve the grades...

I want to build projects during the summer vacation to improve my programming skills so that my skills will louder then my bad grades but now, since what they are looking for is job experience or good grades (for student positions) I wonder what's the point. I mean yeah I will learn a lot but no one will even look at me because of the grades. 

So how do I make companies bring me to job interviews for internships despite the grades?"

""Implementation of aDVBS 2 tuner using fpga , reading and setting a frequency on it and reading frequency properties ""
well is this a time worthy internship about learning fpgas ? Should i take the offer?
On the other hand i can just complete my internship at my university lab and do research (probably in subject of fpgas)
The thing is i have a low gpa and on my other option i can obtain research experience which is a great resume for admission to grad school"

I'm currently entering my junior year of school as a math + CS major and the potential experience will come in handy when I start applying to internships (not to mention any additional money in college is helpful, to say the least).

If so, what's it like when things first start to become serious and would I be able to make enough money for this to be considered ""worth it""?

Quick note: Web development -- at least right now -- is not necessarily the main market I hope to enter after graduation. I'm open to the idea however, assuming it pays off well enough; I'd even consider continuing as a side-gig if things go well.

I have a BS in IT. I have zero relevant work experience but that's why I keep trying to land an internship or entry level job. I have been applying for the past 2 years now and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I have reached out to a recruiter who really hasn't helped.

I have enjoyed this semester, we have had a wide range of skills taught. I had one unit where we spent the semester learning Wordpress and Project management, another where we learnt Excel &amp; IT business models/marketing type stuff as well as a web development unit.

Whilst I have enjoyed this semester, I worry that the skills I am learning are more of a shallow look at a wide range of ICT skills without going too in depth into any of them, which I’m worried will leave me as kind of a master of none at the end of the degree. Also, the head of my faculty said something at an introductory lecture that kind of made it out that the bachelor of ICT was second rate to a bachelor of CS, and that while CS grads are likely to go straight into high paying jobs ICT students would likely have to do internships or help desk jobs.

I have really enjoyed learning HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript and have taught myself a little bit of python which I also enjoyed, even though we don’t do anything particularly complicated and mostly just work with if, else if conditions etc I find that I am easily able to comprehend the logic behind the code.

As a result I am considering transferring into Bachelor of CS as my grades are good enough to do so, however I was looking for some advice. Do you guys think I should continue to learn general ICT skills simply because I am enjoying it or specialise in Programming/Computer Science even though it is likely to be harder and I may struggle down the road?

Tldr; Considering swap from Bachelor of ICT to Bachelor of CS"

While I did apply for internships this summer, I haven't really done anything meaningful enough to distinguish myself, and I was wondering how I could keep busy this summer; I also have a few ideas myself and would like feedback on them. 

My first idea was to inquire with professors and labs at nearby universities (Philadelphia area) and see if I could work as a lab/research assistant there for the summer. I don't know how well this would work out as I don't study at these schools and consequently don't know how willing they would be to take me on. 

I was also considering getting a job teaching code at a summer camp or something similar, just to keep myself busy.

As for honing my skills on my own, I am currently studying to test out of a class for the upcoming semester and have been putting in time towards that. I was also considering working on some project over the summer, something like an unbeatable tic tac toe or minesweeper AI, but I don't know if I'd be able to finish that over the summer. My dad has been suggesting I get a certificate in Java or Python, but I've heard that a certificate isn't particularly meaningful when applying for jobs.

c1o50b,2,2019-06-17,What should I do?,browniex18,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c1o50b/what_should_i_do/,"Hi everybody ! Hope you are all going well.

I (25F) wanted to hear your opinions and hopefully have new ideas about what to do with my life.

I graduated in software engineering one year ago. I worked for a total of five companies as an intern or full time employee and I have never felt any long-term satisfaction to it. Before that, I studied two years in chemical engineering and worked for a huge petrochemical company. I was always appreciated by my bosses and colleagues, and have had great evaluations, but I am never truly fulfilled. I also bought real estate recently to rent apartments. I took many personality tests and it always tells me I am a mediator type (INFP). I was very creative and my best marks were in arts, languages, philosophy. Even though I was pretty okay in more ""scientific"" classes. I figured since I can make good salary in engineering, I should go in that field.

Now I feel I am stuck with my life, always on a computer, I have so many daydreams about changing my life, for example : escape on a remote farm, or go help homeless dogs in a shelter, etc. But I have a boyfriend I truly adore, an expensive rent, started a new job and I am afraid to ruin my CV by adding another job I quit after less than a year. Do you have any idea or testimonials to help me figure out what I want to do with my life ?

c1odo6,1,2019-06-17,pipenv vs virtualenv for package and virtual environment management,TheIlluminator,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/c1odo6/pipenv_vs_virtualenv_for_package_and_virtual/,"My goal is to find a solution to manage virtual environments and packages for a python project on Windows. The solution would need to be capable of creating virtual environments and verifying that the current environment has all the required packages installed for the project, possibly installing whichever packages are missing at each test execution.

&amp;#x200B;

Since multiple people are working on this project, this solution would need to be easy to deploy/shareable using version control like gitlab. Basically if someone installs a new package, it should be easy for everyone else in the team to update their packages.  

&amp;#x200B;

So far I’ve been researching virtualenv and pipenv, but as I'm a novice in this field (I'm an intern) I'm unsure which would be the best for my situation, or if there's a completely different tool/plugins that would be better. At this point virtualenv seems more versatile, while I was drawn to pipenv since because it was more beginner friendly.

Any and all advice would be very useful: what solutions you are using, how you use them etc."
c1ofqp,7,2019-06-17,"London, Eindhoven or Sofia",dfy324,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/c1ofqp/london_eindhoven_or_sofia/,"I have just graduted from a well known university in Hungary. The truth is that in the first half of my studies, I just played video games all day and I was almost dropped out so my grades were really low. Then about 2 years ago, I decided to stop playing video games and concentrated all of my effort on learning computer graphics programming in c++. Of course because I was a beginner, at my first attempt I failed to do my thesis project and I was on the edge of being droped out again, but then I succeeded in the last semester.

The problem is that I never really thought about the realities of getting a job in cg and I feel that this field is oversaturated and underpaid.

The other problem is that I'm 26 now, so I don't want to stay at the uni for another 2 or more years, while trying to learn something else. 

The third problem is my English knowledge. I really started to learn the language about one year ago, but I feel that I reached a point, wher the only way to improve is to get a job in a 100% english workplace.

So because all of this, I started thinking about moving to another country and finding an entry level IT job there with a 100% english environment. Other than c++, I have some experience in C# (2 month internship).

My first idea was London. The wages are still exceptionaly high there and it's still considered the IT capital of Europe. Other than that, it's a 100% english environment without the need of learning other languages and because of the large population, it's a really good place to start doing my 300 approaches following John Sonmez's advice.

Sadly, living there became extremely difficult for an entry level programmer. The job market became oversaturated with people like me, while the renting prices are higher than ever. It's possible, that I have to rent a shared room with 3 other people, while working in a fast food restaurant all day and watching Udemy all night before I can get an entry after a half year time.
And there is the problem with safety I think. When I was there, it was full of danerous looking people and except the city centre, it's like a ghetto for me especialy the places where I can afford to rent. It's possible that I would be robbed there sometimes.

Compared to that, Eindhoven looked like a safe, friendly, clean and developed place. When I was there, I felt if it was an utopistic society which transforms even the otherwise dangerous looking criminals working middle class people.
The other advantage of Eindhoven is the affordability. The renting is cheaper and I wouldn't have to commute 2 hours a day using an overpriced public transport system. Everything is reachable by taking a 30 minute long bicycle route.

But there are not as many job postings in Eindhoven as in London so finding a c++ job could be harder. The other problem is the language. For me, even english was too hard, so before I achieve a proper level, I don't want to start to learn something else.
And it's a small city that probably not suitable for 300 approaches.

After reading a lot of articles and ranting about outsourcing IT jobs in the western world, another city come to my mind. Sofia is located in Bulgaria, which is a poor country even according to the hungarian standards, so if I move there, my wage will be lower than anywhere else. The other problem is that while in Eindhoven, everybody speaks english, that's not true for Sofia, which can make my life really difficult.

But the renting prices are still low, like in Hungary 10 years ago and the life is incredibly cheap. Moreover the city has a population more than one million which makes it a good place for 300 approaches. And the best thing about Sofia is that I found entry level job postings at big multinational companies like VMware, which could really kicstart my career.

So which city could be the best choice for me?"
c1p173,2,2019-06-17,Length to complete?,Flum_mox,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/c1p173/length_to_complete/,"Hi all. I’m new to this thread (and to reddit in general), though I’ve lurked awhile. I’m looking to earn a second bachelor’s in CS, and this is one of my options (it’s been harder than I thought to find a brick-and-mortar school that will take second degree students). One of the pros of this program, I thought, is the flexibility of its length. Since I’m not currently working I could knock it out fairly quickly. 

However, I’ve seen that the 1-year track isn’t very popular, though I don’t remember if that’s just because most people do this program while holding down a job. I’d really, really like to do some internships while doing this program, which would definitely make 1-year too much of a stretch. 

So how has it been for you all? Assuming I could get an internships, how long should I reasonably expect the program to take?"

I must have applied to at least 30 or 40 jobs but have only had a couple of interviews. I’m sure a lot of you went through this when you started out. I’m tempted to ask them what’s so wrong with me that they won’t even interview me for junior roles or internships. Is there any point?

I’ve not heard back once from a single internship or junior position I’ve applied to. But on the other hand I don’t have any good internships on my cv because I didn’t realise how influential they would be. Interviewers are never impressed when they see that."

Hi /r/legaladvice,

I’m posting on behalf of my girlfriend and we need your collective advice. She is currently living in Philadelphia where she found a girl that needed to occupy her room for 3 months while she was away. My gf needed a place to stay in Philadelphia because she landed an internship not too far away. So they agreed on 3 payments of $650 for the 3 months that my gf would be staying. When she got to PA, she inspected the room and saw mice traps everywhere. She asked the girl if mice were a significant problem and she said, “Sometimes there are mice but I haven’t seen one in a long time because they have plugged all the holes but they are rarely any in my room. I’ve seen two but more in the winter than in the summer” 

Turns out she lied about the mice. The issue is, my gf cannot sleep at night because she hears the mice in the walls and fridge and can hear them squeaking as well. She called the landlord and he set more traps but nothing has worked. He said he called an exterminator but we’re not convinced he actually did. Is my gf legally obligated to stay the last month? (She just paid for the 2nd month) She did not sign anything and this was a verbal agreement between the two girls.  


Thank you"
c1qg3s,1,2019-06-17,Career advice,anotherthrowaway464,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c1qg3s/career_advice/,"Hello all, I am a (25m) recent college graduate, with a degree in computer programming (a field where I have little to no interest in) who is currently jobless with 34k in student loan debt. A little background info...

I come from a family of immigrants and I cannot begin to tell you the amount of pressure bestowed upon me from my parents to be the first person in my generation of family to receive a college degree; Something that I never really planned for. I am the youngest in the family of this generation for both my mom and dads side and not a single person in my family has a college degree. It left me in tremendous uncertainty that I needed to decide on a major that was going to determine my career path for the rest of my life. So I asked myself, what field of work can I see myself in? Well..I'm always on my computer/playing video games, why don't I just go into programming? Programming is really big right now, they'll be plenty of jobs ready when I graduate, I thought for sure this was the right direction for me to go towards....that was until I started taking all these programming classes and realizing what I got myself into. I hated it. Not even just the programming classes but just my overall college experience. And all I could do was think about how I made a promise to my parents that I would graduate and hearing my mom literally every other day telling my how happy and proud she's going to be once i get my degree. I could not help but to feel as though I was attending college to please my parents rather than myself. By age 22/23 I'm noticing most of my friends are either graduating or already done with college and I am a little more than half way complete with my computer programming degree at this point. I hated college so I didn't want to take any chances and change my degree AGAIN and prolong my stay there, so I said screw it, I'm already half way done. Let me just suck it up, finish this degree so I can shut my parents up about when I'm going to graduate and just get a degree already. I don't know how many of you know how difficult it is to learn a topic that you have little to no interest in while you're depressed and anxious all the time, but yeah, it sucks. HARD. So that's basically where I'm at right now and I'm asking myself again, what field of work can I see myself having some interest in? I've thought about it and I would like to try something in the TV production/Film crew field, or maybe even video editing. Only problem is I don't have any experience in these fields and almost all entry level jobs that I've searched for in this field require some experience, usually around 1-3 years or at least a degree relating to that field or internships that are unpaid.

So right now I guess I'm just scared of the future and any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated."

I would love to know what other safeties I would be a good fit for!  I know that the RD for Econ and Business will be highly competitive, so if you think that any university will be out of my reach let me know. And, BU or Boston College for Business/Econ? Last, if I were to add any unis, UChicago or Columbia?

Would I qualify for financial aid, given that information? I will not qualify for need based aid."

I still have 1 year left in computer engineering and I applied at a company for an intern position. I filled a form and attached my resume. I got a reply that I was shortlisted and that I have to attend an on-site written technical test that would take exactly 1 hour. They also mentioned that it's going to be about ""the basics of software, algorithm and data structures"". So does anyone know how I should prepare for this? I mean, I know how most of the DS work and how to implement them but what exactly should I be prepared for? Like will I trace code on paper or will there be an essay question about the adv/disadv. of a certain algorithm or DS?"

Dear Ms XXXX, 

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me on Monday.  It was really nice getting to meet you and talking to you. 

I’m very excited about the opportunity to work at XXX Asset Management because of its leadership in the investment management industry and its supportive culture. The internship in the Fixed Income sounds very exciting, and it’s a role I believe I would excel in thanks to my strong attention to detail, logical thinking style and effective communication skills.

I look forward to hearing feedback and would love to continue discussing the opportunity with you.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need clarification on anything we talked about in the meantime.  Thank you again.

Best regards,

This summer however has exacerbated my feelings of mediocrity.   I can’t help but watch my peers see academic success, scholarships, and internships in legal, legislative, and criminal justice fields while the best i could do was this last minute “internship” with this Environmental PIRG that’s literally just walking around virginia knocking on doors asking for money. it’s embarrassing and i haven’t even told my parents what it actually is. I feel like i’m sabotaging my potential and wasting my summer in a stagnant job while i could be gaining better opportunities. i guess i just feel like lesser. i want those internships, i want those chances, i want to be able to put my high gpa and relevant internships on my resume.  i’m just so worried i’m not going to actually move forward, just staying in this weird outside limbo watching everyone else do well.  i’m just looking for some advice"

 I don't need the money for now I'm just a bit restless with being at home coding and looking for interviews.

I finished college 2+ weeks ago and I've been doing a project with Java, spring, hibernate and thymeleaf while I apply for jobs. So far I got 2 interviews one for tomorrow and one in a week from tomorrow, so here is my issue.

The interview tomorrow is only a 6-month internship, the internship I have was useless I got to do nothing and kept pushing to try to get some experience, it amounted to nothing.

The interview in a week is for software dev in data analytics which is close to what I did on my end of year project.

Ok,  I don't want to bore you guys with too many of the details, but story  telling is a sacred family art, so it's going to end up being a bit  long.

The  title is self-explanatory. Since second year in high school, I've had  my eyes on a particular girl from out of the country. Since I (first)  didn't have much self-worth as I'm pretty much white trash compared to  the other people at my wannabe prestigious school in BFE (look up that  acronym, it's kind of hilarious) and I (second) was too scared of  screwing things up (which is my #1 fear, especially in a place where  everybody knows everybody) I never really considered making a move.

Eventually  (about 5 months ago) I finally scraped together the balls to ask her  out. I'm not kidding when I say a comedy of errors kept us apart, which  really makes me wonder if I've been given a sign from divine providence  to, quite simply, sod off. Since, we've only been out twice and I  haven't tried anything bold yet, as I'm beyond scared of screwing things  up. However, things have changed: because I've graduated high school I  don't honestly care if I make a fool of myself. Sure, my only option for  college is the local state school, and sure, everybody I know (that's  going to college) is going there next year, but my program is one that  will send me out of state a lot. This is a relatively important detail  that makes my situation not completely hopeless.

We  know each other relatively well (I'll refer to my previous statement  that everybody knows everybody) and for a while before she started  dating another guy (that I used to be moderately good friends with) she  seemed to appreciate my antics. I genuinely got the impression that she  enjoyed my presence. However, since they broke up she's changed a fair  bit. Or maybe I have. These are all things way beyond me. I honestly  hope this isn't because she sees a lot of him in me, but I digress onto  other anxieties.

At  graduation I explained to her that I didn't want to lose contact with  her and a few days later texted her asking if she'd like to go for  lunch. Yet again things happened that made it impossible for us to get  together. This problem would look like a minor inconvenience if it were  not for problem #2, which is that I don't have a lot of time to act, as  in about 2 weeks her family is headed back down to Latin America. I'd  gladly let go and save myself the trouble if it weren't for problem #3,  which is that I genuinely have feelings for her. As an NT personality  type, I generally don't form bonds much at all. She seriously is the  only person that has made me feel before thinking, and that's something I  really don't want to have ripped away from me. I taught myself how to  compose music and play the piano so that I could be able to chart and  play one of the most famous songs from her home country, which curiously  enough hardly has any variants in the public domain. 

Now,  I'm guessing you stopped reading at ""2 weeks"" in the previous  paragraph. This is where things get complicated. My program allows you  to take semesters off of school to intern at companies to give its  students a bit of job experience. She is studying in a region of England  that has an inordinate amount of work for people of my discipline. I  could probably land an internship overseas for a couple semesters to be  near her.

This  brings us to problem #4 (which is really problem #1 in disguise): how  do I overcome the first hurdle? \*Do\* I even overcome the first hurdle?  If I can get from point A (BFE central U.S.) to point B (England) while  getting and maintaining her interest, the rest should be relatively  smooth sailing. I have the money and I can make the contacts. All I need  is the green light.

So,  after a long journey of me explaining myself without doxxing myself too  much, we arrive at the big question: what do I do? Should I continue  fighting or should I just give up? How do I even begin to approach  realizing my ambitions? More importantly, how in the hell do I even hope  to express any of what goes on inside my head?

At  this point I have nothing to lose, so I'd like to hear your crazy  suggestions. As long as it doesn't involve industrial fissile material,  crossing the Mexican border with black tar heroin, or otherwise  something that would get me into state or federal prison."

I am going into the third year of my course in September and I expect to graduate with a 2:1 degree (equivalent to roughly 3.5 GPA).

I plan to apply for the Technology Consulting graduate program at the earliest opportunity. 

The requirements for this program are: Interest in technology and some experience in SQL, PYTHON, R, VBA, SPSS or MINITAB. I am doing certificates for all of these on Udemy on top of my university so I can prove my experience with these languages/softwares. I also keep up with the all the latest news in technology and even specifically the latest news in the EY technology department, I hope to use this to show my interest in technology.

Now this is where I fall. I don’t have any internship/placement experience going into my third year (I’ve done menial retail jobs to support my rent payments etc but nothing very technology specific)

I have also not done any work for societies etc and I’m assuming I will be up against a lot of people who will have been presidents of societies etc.

I feel like I possess the important skills EY are after such as: good communication skills, leadership skills, building relationships etc but I feel that with the lack of internship and society work I will not be able to prove these skills!

Recently, I have been working on an intern project in VBA to compile data from a historian. So far, I have been able to collect all the necessary data and perform the calculations, but I was having some issues with the trending.  So I have been thinking of compiling one worksheet of graphs (a couple hundred) and then using VBA to find the necessary graphs by the name of it through a loop. That way I basically have a worksheet that acts like a database of graphs and the user only has to type in a name to bring up the graph they want to see.

I also thought of using VBA to do something along the lines of a user inputted variable 'grapher', but felt it would have been too difficult since every sheet had a different amount of variables and names. If this is an easier method, feel free to say so, and I will try to work more with this method. 

If anyone, knows of a way to accomplish this or any sort of site where some more information would be available, I would greatly appreciate it.  I've been trying to find some info on this, but I have only been able to find the information on creating the loop and not the part where it brings the graph.

This mainly consisted of manual mobile app testing (going through over 1000+ possible user interactions. I understood that I would need to do that in order to grow and learn the app the company develops, but each summer I was promised more and more learning opportunities and each summer they have moved me away from the opportunities in order to do manual testing. This summer I was told I would be leading the iOS side mobile automation project and I was very excited as I would get more coding experience and learn about different automation frameworks. The first few weeks of the internship were great and I made very good progress with the automation test suite (We have a full time hire that is working the android side and I was keeping up with him) and we have a demo to upper management of how the automation is going at the end of June. But this past week I was asked to put my project on hold to do some manual testing. I agreed, and got about half way though the tests when I was asked to do manual testing for 2 more additional builds which is going to set me back even further on the automation suite that I was told was my summer project. I am concerned this summer I will slowly again be pushed into solely doing mobile regression and am not sure what to do moving forward. My pay has not increased since last summer even though there was a large increase in responsibility and now my ability to learn is also being hindered. Do I have any power to confront my boss over this?"

&amp;#x200B;

I had a 2.5h commute each day during school, my internship and regular job all in 8 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Boss A = Upper management

Boss B = directly (i still think high of him, he only wanted the best but sadly it didn't worked out)

&amp;#x200B;

I got out of school with a C, only did the minimum.

&amp;#x200B;

Boss A never wanted me, i only got it because i was the only one that got the assessment right and i had like \~10 competitors, Boss B made it happen that i got it, i took over the job of a proper System Administrator.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

During my internship:

\- Got lured into a trap by Boss A(he left a year later) and then insulted me while a coworker was around.

* He was completely in the wrong and i was able to proof it that it wasn't my fault but nothing really happen.
* He never apologized personally only saying it in a Mail, i was working 30 feet away from him.

\- Got access denied to a crucial part of our environment because as my CEO directly said into my face during the meeting with the upper management(Boss A/B, CTO etc.) there ""If your drunk you could delete all the data so we can't give you access to the password!!""

* I was never drunk at work? But later i found out who said something, it was Boss A, i slept at the office because i missed the last train when i was out drinking with coworkers from other departments and he came in the next morning while i was sleeping on the couch, it was a Saturday.
* I setup the password management tool and i could gain access to it anyways if i actually want to. 
* I got official access to the password 4 months later, unofficially i got it 2 weeks in from BOSS B, guess what i had to troubleshoot it!!1!

Many other shady things happen with this Boss A..

\- Before my Internship ended(3 months) they decided to keep me.

* The CEO needed 2(!!) months to setup my contract, i didn't know the pay until it was too late, it was 42.6k$+2.4k$, i'm living in an area where everything is pretty expensive, normal pay would be \~60k$.

&amp;#x200B;

Take the next with a bit of Salt: It wasn't only their fault, i made mistakes too but only after i fell into the first Trap!

&amp;#x200B;

During my regular job:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Got lured into a trap by one of my co workers, well it was my only one in my department, we were two people first(Boss B and me) but mind you calling me into the interview to get him to know (Boss A was still around then but left 2 months later, he also did the interview)...

* I wasn't working at my usual working place because it was \~32° during hot summer days inside that room.
* An hour after i left the room our whole Cloud environment was down.
* didn't had cell reception where i was working(alerts came to my cellphone) and my Skype crashed without me realizing it.
* co worker told other people i was already gone, mind you he told other people the day before where i was.
* After i finally realized that my skype crashed, i fixed the issue and heard that my co worker said one hour before that everything was 'fixed', everything took like \~1.5h.
* A few hours later Boss B came online and made me down it was all my fault, wrote my resignation letter that evening and signed it but slept over it.
* The next day all three of us had a meeting, my co worker said he didn't know i was working in the other room.
* My Home office day got removed that i got 1 month before after 3 years of working there.
* Co worker didn't face any consequences

\- Forward \~5-7 Months i had my 1-1 meeting with Boss B, he had the meeting with my co worker the day before, that day the co worker told him he actually knew i was working down there back then!?!!11!!

I always knew it..

&amp;#x200B;

In the end i made 48k$+2.4k$ after i had almost 4 years of experience, i always got denied for a raise, wrong time to ask for a raise bla bla bla....

I couldn't take it anymore, stayed at home for a week and got laid off.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The best part is, my first employer's reference from that company that i got after \~2.5 years was one of the best that you could get, it was from Boss B, should have left then but i was young and irresponsible. 

I got my final employer's reference 6(!!!) months after i got laid off, normally you should get it when your being laid off in my country, the last punch from them, it was garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a heavy depression for almost a Year, sadly it's still not fully cured.

&amp;#x200B;

So i applied to Jobs again after a year and a few months after i got laid off.

\- The first interview was at a company which wanted to call my former Company, yeah sure call them after i needed help because of all that bullshit that happen, denied gently, thanked them for the interview and walked out.

\- Second Interview was great, well at least they understood how i actually felt and said 'We would never call your former Company when we can see how your Employer's reference got from flawlessly perfect to garbage in such a short amount, that shows us that something was very wrong there.""

In the End i got the Job where i had my second Interview!

&amp;#x200B;

This Place is now 5 mins away with the bicycle, annual pay is a \~66% increase.

&amp;#x200B;

Th4ggsi.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I had a commute of 2.5h each way, i was laid off after being lured into traps two times from Boss A and a co worker during \~4 years. I got a Job now which is way better/pays better and is only 5 mins away with a bicycle."

1) It's going to be hosted on the office's LAN and there might be 30 or 40 people accessing it at any one point (this is the high end). 

2) There is a separate office location that will probably access it from time to time, so I will have to open up a port on the router and forward it to the web server to handle outside requests for the website. 

I pretty confident I wont have an issue with port forwarding, IP restriction, and making sure the authentication is secure. What I don't know is how to actually run the web server. On my computer I just type

Maybe learning Python?,VapesfromBible,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/c1wcpu/new_degree_looking_to_break_out_of_it_support/,"Just graduated college with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems. I have done 3 different internships in college in Help Desk / IT Support type roles. 

I accepted my first position doing IT Support for a SaaS company. I am also helping support their software, which requires a bit of HTML and CSS knowledge. I really am falling out of love with IT Support and feel with my degree and my prior experience I should be able to start climbing up the ladder. 

I really wanted to learn a new skill that would jump me out of Tier 1 type of support. Was thinking about picking up Python. I did a few easy tutorials on Codecadamy and really enjoy it so far. 

My question is anyone start off in Help Desk... learn Python... and that new skill help land a better job?"
c1wdyo,2,2019-06-17,To accept or not accept my first offer.,MiserableCucumber2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c1wdyo/to_accept_or_not_accept_my_first_offer/,"A little background: I just recently graduated with my bachelors in computer science and have been looking for jobs in general software development. I don’t have many projects outside of one’s I’ve done for class and don’t have any internship experience. Because of this I realize I’m not the best candidate, though I did well in school. 
Anyways, I’ve been applying for a couple months and got my first offer about a week or so ago. The offer is from a large consulting company and is decent, in my opinion, for someone like me. We’ll call this one Job A.
The ultimatum comes in the fact that I’m currently in the process for another entry level position at a different company. The pay and benefits described in the phone screen are better than those from my offer (though just slightly) and the location is better in my opinion. We’ll call this one in Job B.
I’ve been holding off in responding to Job A because of Job B but it’s been taking longer than I thought it would. I have to make a decision soon and have no guarantee of an offer from Job B.
I’ve been back and forth on this. Most of me believes Job B would be so much better than Job A. However, Job A is the only offer I’ve received and part of me wonders if I’ve just got comparison syndrome or something. Grass is always greener right? 
What I’m hoping for is to see what your opinions are on my situation and thoughts on how I should handle my decision. Any and all advice welcome, can’t guarantee all advice used.

Edit: So I reminded Job B of my deadline yesterday. They responded today with the suggestion that I take the offer from Job A and stay in touch if anything changes. 
So I guess that’s the decision made, though I can’t help but continue to be hesitant to accept."

I started an unpaid internship last April and continued until the beginning of May. I took a break to finish up Highschool as I had a month left. The department I interned had to put me on hiatus so they could open a payed position for me.

I graduated last month on the 30th and began working a week ago as a full time payed intern. I don't feel valued anymore and im sort of conflicted as to why they brought me back. The enviorment feels so different. My boss doesnt give me as much work as I had before, I need to constantly ask for some work to do. I cant understand if her plans changed for me. The only thing that changed while I was gone was we had a communications expert added to our department. I think i'll be working mainly with him, and I have been recently asking him for stuff to do. He gives me allot of praise and thanks me a bunch just for simply cropping an image, but I really wish I got more from my main boss. I just dont feel actively involved in what out department does and id like to. 

We do have another intern that is 6 years older than I and has allready graduated college, I guess he must have taken up my duties while I was gone, he is being groomed for a position actually so that explains it. Last week our boss introduced everyone to someone and forgot about me. They went to lunch today and forgot to ask if id like to go. Whenever she walks into the office she says hi to the intern next to me and talks to him but never me. I feel really depressed and confused as to why the asked me to come back. 

I feel kind of like a burdon. Just a few months ago I got a really positive ""we want you"" vibe, but now im not feeling it anymore.

I feel out of place. This has been really difficult for me, I just graduated highschool 10 days after I started working a full time office job for the government, im the youngest here and the least experienced. I dont get a summer, im working 8 hours a day and haven't gotten a paycheck yet. I haven't even gotten an employee badge yet, which is disappointing since ive been asking for one since I started as an unnpaid intern. 

Its just my second week but if things dont get better, i am gonna plan on letting them know that   I come here to feel like I am apart of something, a paycheck is just icing on the cake.

Someone please talk me off this ledge."

I was lucky enough to get selected for two internships with the way I had written everything, I had stuff from my high school that I had mentioned that no one cared about and thus, I thought it was high time that I should write a proper one.

1. Should I mention the things I studied in college like Data Structures and Algos ? ( I  have done Computer Architecture, Parallel Computer Architectures, Formal Languages, Compiler Design, **OS, Computer Networks** amongst other things) I have done things like Databases, Android and Java, which were no brainers when it came to mentioning on my resume. I just need to know if I should mention the items in the list I have written (placement companies give focus to some of the subjects in the list.)
2. Should I mention that I am comfortable with terminal and using AWS EC2 instances ( I was given an AWS AMI Deep Learning Instance during my former internship and I am using one now for personal use. Personally, I don't think there was a lot to either, but there are guys in my college who do not know either) Also, eventually I will have to deploy my API on such an instance.
3. Do I mention every course I have ever done? I did a course on R back in 2017 and I don't remember much except for the basic concepts of ML that I learned from it. Also, there was stuff I made due to a course from Udemy and Coursera and Udacity, do I mention those as well? Some of them were pretty easy, but some of them did take a  lot of time to do.

Also, I made a compiler last sem which worked partially, due to some shift-reduce conflicts the only god knows how to solve..."

However, there are a few caveats:

1. It doesn't handle rotated versions of the input image very well, so I thought of fine-tuning it to fix the model.
2. However, I cannot use the model to develop the project\* as it has a non-commercial license, though it is open source. If I were to fine tune it, can I be legally allowed to call it my own or for my own use, provided I notify the original authors and I give the fine-tuned model back to them?
3. That brings me into an even murkier area, considering I am working for a company, a very small one, and I cannot really release it to be open source and I am not sure if the authors will be okay with it, if I am fine tune it and don't give back to the community.
4. Also, since it is trained on a huge dataset extensively and is currently the only solution out there that works and gives accuracy to make it viable for work.

The project is fine tune the model and develop an API for it, that is meant for commercial use.

Would like to add that the fine tuned model was trained on a private dataset, the largest available of its kind. If I use a much smaller open source dataset of the same type of images to fine tune the model, can I use the fine tuned model then?"

So around 3 months ago, I went through an interview for a startup company in the cyber security/IT field. The interview had been pretty standard and the offer for a summer interview came through a couple of weeks after. While I had a few other interviews scheduled at the time, 

I almost immediately accepted the offer as my prospects for the other interviews weren’t looking so hot and this particular internship was remote. 
This meant a lot to me because my parents were going through a rough patch and they were scheduled to move houses in the summer. After I accepted the offer, the person managing my group asked us to start training and sent us to the Ibm security learning center to start getting the certificates needed for the internship. 

Now, a month and a half into the summer, I have a couple of certificates, but nothing to work on. Every week, my group talks to each other through a conference call, but while work is promised, no work is found. A couple of weeks ago, my brother (also in the cs field) told me that this was very sketchy. Today, I grudgingly came to the conclusion that there is a possibility that I could come away this summer without any work experience.

Now my question is what should I be doing in this situation? I have been studying mobile programming in my free time, should I continue doing that?

Also, can I even put this internship on my resume? What can I even say if an interviewer asks me what I did during my internship?

For more information, I’m an about to be senior computer science student in the University of Michigan.

TLDR: Accepted an offer for an remote internship and went through with the training, but the company has no work for me. Not quite sure on how to productively spend the rest of my summer.

I appreciate all and any advice. Thank you!"

In short, I'm so overwhelmed I feel like I can't breathe and that I just can't. No one gets it, nor cares.

Basically, it's an indoor kids playground with a restaurant area, so I need to monitor everything going on, help people purchase admission, and take food orders as well as cook all the food (crappy microwave kid food but it's still pretty complicated since I need to memorize 20+ recipes as well as smoothies, coffee drinks, etc).

What are my options? I feel shitty because they've already invested a significant amount of time into training me, and my manager has said I have a ton of potential at this job, but I don't want to be this depressed during my last summer with my family. Thanks.

I still know the material, like if you asked me a question I could answer it but It would be difficult to give you the technical terms. I guess you could say I did enough to get good grades but not enough to have the material stick. But I did a quick review over the weekend and I remember the gist of everything. During the interview I didn’t  over sale myself, I told them this is what I’ve done in school and out of school and they even had my gpa on hand  ( let me tell it ain’t pretty lol) but with gods grace I got an offer.

So I recently got offered for 2 internships: one at a bank and another at a hotel, I start both on 7/1 for 4 hours at each place on every weekday until 8/1. Both are just simple front desk help, not complicated tasks.

But on top of this, I have to study for 2 SAT subject tests (probably an hour a day), take an online class (1-2 hours/day), work on college essays, practice piano and violin (like 1 hour combined), and try my best to stay fit lol. Honestly when I list it out it sounds like a definite not enough time, but combined it's not really THAT much, its just that I wont have much free time.

So basically it's like going to school regularly but requiring a bit more time, as theres stuff with transportation, meals, etc. 

Anyways, the problem is this: I can choose to only go to ONE place, or I can choose to go to BOTH. I realllllly want to take both offers, but burnout, exhaustion, time management might be problems, so what do you guys think? Should I take both offers or choose one?"

I often tell them to feel better about myself or just to contribute to the conversation. But I mainly lie to avoid any feeling of judgement. I am also scared that people will bully me again or not accept me for who I am. I have not told my psychiatrist any of this stuff and am not sure how to.


My first big lie was when I liked about my smoking habits when many of my friends started smoking. Since, then I have lied about doing more serious drugs. I have only told this more serious lie to my roommates who tried to pressure me into doing drugs and drinking. 


However, it doesn't end there. I have always had issues with holding a job due to my anxiety and this is a cause of a lot of anguish. For example, I often have lied about getting certain internships or working part time jobs. I usually only tell these lies if someone starts bragging to me about their internships. Though, it is still a stupid thing to lie about as. My stories are often really elaborate and I will double down on most of my lies. 


I have also lied about where I live and who my dad is. I tend to be honest about my interests but I always keep people an arms distance away. I also don't feel bad about lying until I am caught. I have come to despise this side of myself over the years.
However, I know that I need help but I am too scared of being judged by my psychiatrist or a therapist. Also, therapy is too expensive for me. I am also not sure if I need to do another psych eval or not."

Hello, I am from Turkey and I will graduate in two weeks with BSc Computer Engineering diploma from one of the top universities in my country. I have dream to move to Europe since I am a high school student (approximately 10 years). Now I have 4 mo full time Java dev experience, 2 months of internship on Java, 600+ commits on Github and also founded a startup 6 years ago to help high school students to get into good universities (so it is a half voluntary hobby for me). I don't have years of experience yet but willing to try and find out the current possibilities for me to move to Amsterdam.

I have a HR round with a company for Java Developer role and could not find enough data on salaries. As I value moving to Amsterdam more, a somewhat salary may be OK but don't want to under/overestimate compared to the current job market. So what should I expect / say to the HR about the salary?

I need some advice on my life. I feel that I am at a complete stop and have no fucking clue about the proper next step.

To start off, the biggest issue for me right now is my career. I am unemployed since I graduated last year(Summer of 18). I have gotten advice from other alumni and counselors to revamp my resume and interview skills. And yet, I still got denied by all the companies I interviewed for. Each and every time, I drove multiple hours in a single day to a different State, interviewing for places and acting like I am a good fit, only for them to reject me on the spot or send me an email later saying they found better suited candidates despite how well my interviews go. It's done a toll on me after a year, and I am no longer motivated to put myself out there. This is not even regarding the fact that I absolutely despise my major and the only reason why I did it is because when I selected the program, I was naive, chasing money, and heard my university has one of the best degrees for this program with a high employment rate. I wanted to explore other career options, but seeing as how I'm failing to get a job *related* to my degree, I'm having trouble imagining how I will get a job that is completely outside it. 

The next issue for me is a personal one, and one that has been eating me up inside since I was in high school. I have never dated anyone, kissed, or had any physical intimacy. I grew up fantasizing about romance, daydreaming about spending time with a girl that would like me back. I felt like all I needed in life was a gf to feel happy. It's the wrong mindset to have in life, but like I said earlier, I was naive and shaped by movies and mass media to feel like shit if I'm single and can't get in a relationship. This stirred up a lot of things in my life. One, I actually started to care about my life and became a self-improvement guru. *Whatever advice you have to offer regarding self-improvement and feeling good about yourself as a single person, I have done it(I guarantee it)*. Still, mastering my internal life had little impact on my external dating life, and I finished college without ever going far as holding someone's hand romantically. It's pretty sad and pathetic to think about it, and don't try to tell me it's not because everywhere you see nowadays, you see guys like me ridiculed and guys with relationships praised. So, in an attempt to numb this fucking cancer from eating me up inside, I resorted to venting on subs like depression/Forever alone, and browsing toxic subs like redpill/mgtow to tell myself that women are the problems and not me. It's a shameful tactic, but it was the band-aid fix that I needed in order to not completely break down every day, and give myself motivations to try. Needless to say, it didn't fix the issue and I realized my fault.

And now, I feel like I am at a complete dead-end. I no longer have surge of interviews coming in to give me hopes of getting employed, and I see no jobs ever doing so, if they just keep rejecting me one after another no matter how hard I try to be professional and sell myself well. People around me, the very little friends I have, are moving on with their lives. One has gotten a 2nd internship, the other who already has a solid job just started dating someone. And yet, here I am, sulking by myself at night because I can't sleep and want to cry but physically can't because I'm too soul-less to even do so. Within a span of a week, I got my final rejection letter, heard one friend landed an internship, and another a girlfriend. It's like the world just fucking hates me and refuses to give me a win no matter what I do and give wins to people around me just to put salt to the wound.

I have been pretty stressed out, anxious, lonely, and depressed. I'm just watching my life quickly go down the drain despite my genuine efforts to save it. And it's gotten to a point where I have to ask internet strangers for help because everyone in my life has given me the same answers over and over again that simply does not work for me. Staying positive, putting myself out there, praying to a non-existent God has absolutely done nothing for me in my life and only pushed me down further, almost as if to mock me for trying in first place.

I feel like a loser every day and can no longer keep this going. Something has to happen, right here and now. I'm losing motivations to continue to live and don't feel like I'll be mentally stable in the long run. What are some things I can do regarding my dead-end situation?"

Currently I'm in training and do 4 hours a day, I still interact and check-in the customers however. I don't know if it's the sheer panic, but I'm regretting having applied here. A little info, I'm 18 and this is my first job EVER. I wanted a job during the summer because usually I would just spend my days doing nothing and becoming severely depressed. I should've applied somewhere else.. I thought to myself that this job could help me overcome my social anxiety and open up a bit, and so far the interactions with the customers have been surprisingly okay, but the rest of the job kills me! My boss is a real weirdo and super intimidating and he constantly checks up on me to see if I'm doing fine (which is obvious since I'm still in training, but it makes me super anxious and then I end up making mistakes) and the whole booking system is so complicated and confusing. I dreaded waking up this morning and kept thinking about the fact that I'll have to do this job for 2 months.. I don't know if I'll be able to. The thing is, I don't think I could quit even if I wanted to, because it's an internship, which is somehow connected to my region so it's very official and I don't think I could just quit like that. Plus I don't have the balls to quit. I hope things will get better and maybe I'm just overreacting right now.. words of advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated."

Here is the link for the program I'm talking about: [http://japan-internships.com/](http://japan-internships.com/)

I'm a Senior CS student from the United States looking to get a Software Engineering Internship either this fall or next spring and have been putting some effort into finding one based in Japan, ideally Tokyo, because I want to experience the foreign culture while getting relevant job experience. I've seen posts about some other programs that require applicants to pay for an internship, but this one is completely free and boasts having applicants from a lot of top universities (Waterloo, Harvard, etc.). The process is simply to register, have a skype meeting with one of the program's staff, and then they select some of their affiliate companies to send my information to. From there, getting the job becomes between me and the company. I've currently registered and have a date for the skype meeting arranged.

I wanted to know if anyone here has had experience with this program and how it worked out? If not, is there something you would recommend to help with finding internships in Japan?"

Friday rolled around, and I followed up with both the office assistant who arranged the interview, and both people I interviewed with. 

I got an immediate alert email back that one of the people I interviewed with was out of the office/country until the 24th, and that afternoon the other person (who I’d be working under) explained that they were still doing first round interviews, and coupled with the other person being out of the office I’d hear back the week of the 24th.

Now here’s my dilemma: My mom (who, to be fair, has 30+ years experience in the communications field) is pushing me to write another follow-up expressing continued interest and thoughts I’ve had after the interview. And she says the sooner I get it in the better, even though it’s been less than a week since the initial follow-up. From her viewpoint, it wouldn’t irritate the manager and would instead bring me back to the forefront of their minds while thinking about candidates. 

I’ve been reading advice online from a wide range of sources, and either nothing quite covers a situation like this or it says to wait until a week between follow-ups or until after they say they’d get back (which would be next week even!). I’m super hesitant to seem overbearing and pushy, especially when one of the key decision makers won’t even be back in the office until next week. 

Do I write this follow-up to a follow-up? And if so what would be the best timing to seem timely but not pushy?"

Should I still be looking around?",YouHeatedBro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c26a6c/update_my_summer_internship_was_extended_to/,"Hi everyone.

Last post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/91ifmh/my_summer_internship_was_extended_to_parttime_in/

I came to the subreddit about 10 months ago asking if I should still look around for other places while I'm in my senior year of college and working part-time as a full-stack developer. 95% of the comments on the thread urged me to continue looking and disregard whatever 'loyalty' my manager expected from me because I accepted this part-time job.

So that is what I did.

After going through so many garbage 3rd party recruiters spamming my LinkedIn messages, I had an internal recruiter reach out to me for a Software Engineer II position (3+ years of exp. required) when I only had a little over 1 year of part-time experience. I listened to the advice in this sub about letting companies reject you and not rejecting yourself for them and decided to go through with it with no expectations.


I'm happy to say I accepted the offer for about a 20% bump in salary, more responsibilities, much better location, and a huge benefits upgrade.

I turned in my two weeks to my manager the other day. I told him I wasn't staying because they wouldn't give me a raise or promotion (I was still making what I was as an intern here ~27/hr no benefits) even though my responsibilities skyrocketed over the year I was here. He started saying all this stuff about I should've committed to the team and trusted him, yada yada. That he would've tried to give me a promotion/raise if I stayed on the team just a little longer.
I'm pretty sure I burned this bridge because technically I reneged on the offer because my ""full-time"" start date with this company was in August (new-grad program so we all start the same time), but I believe this was a good career move for myself.

So I just wanted to say thanks to this sub for the encouragement and advice. I went from not having any experience of this field or how to maneuver through it in my junior year ago to my current role and the majority of the information that helped me get here was based from the advice from here.


tl;dr: continued to look for job; got better job"

I have never been particularly motivated or directed and so I have not been very successful in life, and I want to change.

Right now I work as a cook, making $15 an hour. The pay is pretty good for low-skill labor, but there is not really anywhere I can go from here--I hate the job and don't want to go to culinary school or whatever to become a chef, and that's pretty much the only way I could make more money.

But I don't really have any other major work experience or appealing qualifications for an employer. My work experience is exclusively retail and restaurants.

I also live in a job-deprived area where there are no other jobs, so any career change would probably have to be accompanied by a location-change.

I did graduate college about 5 years ago with a BS in Computer Science with pretty good grades... but I have never worked in the field. Not doing an internship as a student was a terrible choice (again, I've never been motivated or focused), and a five year old degree with no experience is pretty much useless I suppose. But I generally can work with computers and I know programming basics. I just don't know how to enhance/direct those skills to the point where they would help make me employable--job listings all want experience and very specific skills with certain technologies. And I'm not sure someone as passionless as me could really thrive in the coding industry, since so many employers seem to want utterly obsessed programming savants. I am interested in any advice on how to get into any tech-related job though, if it is realistic at my age.

I have about 20k in savings so I have a cushion where I could stop working temporarily for education, or I could spend it on relocating, though I know it won't go far if I can't find another job. I have no relationships or obligations really tying me down to my current situation/area so I am sort of flexible.

**What I want** is nothing amazing: I don't expect to wake up every morning ecstatic to go to work. I just want to get into a field where I could reliably support myself, with some chances to move up in pay as I get older and more experienced, in a career that feels like a *career* rather than something I feel sort of embarrassed about.

So what should I do to get to that goal? 

- Should I try to obtain some sort of IT or Tech certification? 

- If I should, which ones?

- Will they be just as useless without work experience as my college degree is?

- How can I get work experience as an older person out of school who is ineligible for most internships?

- If tech careers are too much a young person's game, what other fields might I be able to enter at my age?

- Should I move from my area, where there are no jobs outside of retail and restaurants? How can I move smartly when I do not have the skills which would let me get a job beforehand? (is a company 500 miles away really gonna waste their time interviewing a non-local with no experience?)

I've spent four years on a high school robotics team, and have an aptitude for engineering, and have always thought that that was my calling. This year, I focused my role within the team towards strategic gameplay, and as a high school senior, created an inter-state collaboration of 9 different teams to cover the region I competed in, and collected roughly 220,000 data points, which we used for match prediction, with roughly 95% accuracy in this years FRC competition.

I networked with many professionals, and was offered an internship this summer in NY, however was unable to accept due to financial constraints with college looming. 

So here comes the question. I've been accepted into the honors program at Virginia Tech in their engineering department, however I'm thinking that a degree in Data Engineering would be a better fit for me than a systems engineering degree, like I had originally thought.

I've been exploring the programs available at the college, however I'm struggling to find anything that alligns with my career interests. I deffinately want to go into data science or data engineering, but don't know where to go from here.

Any suggestions?"

This company hires *a lot* of people from
my school upon graduation assuming they did this co op, so I’m expecting to get an offer at the end of the next year when I graduate. I’m in what is considered the “fastest paced” department in the company, and I work on what many consider to be some of the coolest stuff in the industry. The reason I’m saying this is because I have had full time employees tell me that they’re jealous of my job, and I think that’s such bullshit to hear and extremely disheartening. I don’t like my job that much, and it’s not because I’m not doing actual engineering work. I’m definitely applying what I’m learning and doing “real” engineering work, but the main reason is I’m upset is because it feels like our potential is being wasted trying to simply navigate a global corporation.

Every week I’m having meetings with people across the US and in different countries, and the time difference means we have such a small window to actually interact. Additionally, getting a bunch of people from multiple different sites / companies on for a meeting takes a lot of planning, reducing our weekly progress. Im constantly waiting for them to get their work to me or at least give me updates, but that can’t happen because it’s so hard to get a meeting with everyone. I’ve been working on this project for months, and I feel like it could’ve all been done in a week if I could have everyone in the same spot devoted to no other responsibilities but this. My first internship was at a very small company and I LOVED it. Prototypes were flying off the printer left and right and it felt like I was spending all my time doing actual engineering work, not figuring out the logistics of getting work done. 

At this point I just want to work for this company so they can pay for my masters, and then I either want to found a startup or join one. Huge corporations seem great for when I’m burned out and no longer care about doing fast-paced engineering work, but right now it seems like I’m going to be pissed off going to work every day and feeling like I could do so much more in a different environment. Am I being naive or is this a common sentiment?"

I'm planning to start my master's degree in Canada on 2020. I'm a software engineer with a CS degree, I want to specialize in AI.

I'm fluent in English, been speaking it my whole life. Even got American family, like real American relatives not immigrants who became citizens there. I know very little French but I intend to spend the next 3 years learning the language.

I will also have 2+ years experience by the time I get my degree done.

I have no kids, no wife and no commitments at my current country of residence.

The only thing I'm not sure of is that I'll be 29 when I'm done with my masters. I would think that's not too old, and hopefully I will have worked some time throughout some internship or another (if that even counts anyway), so that I can have that as another plus.

Here is basically my situation, how I got into this situation, and the steps I plan on taking moving forward:

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I'm gonna be venting a bit too...

I was born in the Philippines, I come from a family that's really prestigious in my religion as my grandfather was the president of the entire south-eastern asian division in the like, system of my religion. (Seventh-Day Adventists) My dad got my mom pregnant really early, and they weren't finished with school. For some reason, they believed it a good idea to have 2 more kids (Yay dumb choices!) And I was born as the third. When I was around 1-2 years old, my dad dipped, came to the USA and left my mom with us three. My grandparents from my dad's side offered to take us in because my mom couldn't make ends meet by herself. My grandparents wanted us to have a christian education and had to go to desperate measures to provide for us. Really caused them to stress out and would take it out on us, but understandable to me. Basically, I was raised surrounded by influential rich people but with a really poor lifestyle as my grandparents' pension wasn't really cutting it for 3 kids' education in a private christian academy. Oh and a little bonus was they taught me English instead of the local language so I was pretty much ostracized and bullied my entire life in the Philippines. 

Anyways, fast forward and my grandparents made my dad take us in. My eldest sister dipped, and my middle sister is in a christian college. I still had to stay here with my Dad and Step-mom from freshman year until the end of high school. And I'm telling you, I. Was. Miserable. My step-mom has a son with her last marriage who's pretty chill. But my step-mom herself is terrible. When I first came, off the bat, I had no privacy. They didn't have a spare room so they through a bed into the dining room and moved the table to the kitchen and I had to sleep there with the shelves of dishes and a small dresser. I had no doors, just curtains which didn't protect my privacy at all as she just peeked through the gap or outright opened the whole thing when they wanted to check on me, which was pretty much every few hours I was home. I don't know why, but they did. My phone, they insisted we have this app called Life360 which monitors where we are at all times. But my sisters refused it as they didn't want to be monitored. I still lived under their roof so I couldn't. She would always constantly check my grades if I had any missing work whatsoever and she would flip her shit if there was any, calling me a failure, dumb, and telling me I wouldn't succeed in life. Even if the missing assignment would be the smallest thing that wouldn't affect my grade. Essentially every time she spoke to me she would berate me and degrade me. She would always believe she's right and I'm wrong and if ever her fault is pointed out to her she always blames me or someone else. Any form of imperfection, maybe a text not getting through so I end up not replying, or anything that may cause me to not do what she says, she would flip her shit, calling me ungrateful for ""not being respectful to who raised you"" which btw, neither she or my dad did. 

If ever I tried standing up for myself or pointing out something that's not true in her accusations, she would scream at me, threaten me, and all those kinds of shit. She constantly would use manipulative tactics to make me feel inferior and controlled. I put up with this for four years. Four. Whole. Fucking. Years. and I'm so tired of it. towards the end of my sophomore year, I tried standing up for myself and she threatened me saying that if I don't obey her she would force me to work and pay her bills. (btw she was unemployed at the time all the way till halfway through my junior year) During my earlier junior year, I tried to stand up for myself again after she was berating me and flipping her shit for a homework I could afford to miss for some rest (I had AP classes, it was tiring.) and she outright yelled at me saying ""I'm the queen of this house. As long as you're under this roof, you obey everything I say."" and that just really made my hatred for her swell. But I didn't do anything. CPS doesn't have the resources to help minor cases like this, and I had no play that could guarantee my survival more than just biting the bullets and rolling with the punches. Late junior year and early senior year, she forced me to study every night from when I got home from school to midnight. It didn't matter if I had all my homework done or not. She would force me to do it. This was because towards the end of my junior year, and early senior year, some of my grades started dropping as I was starting to burn out from stress, break-up, her bs, etc. My grades fell to C's and she lost her shit and I had to deal with the usual. So yeah, studying from like, 5PM or 6PM to 12AM, allowed only 15 mins max of total restroom time, and 30 minutes max of break time. One thing that really annoyed me was all the time she would say like ""You're always on your phone, you're always playing your games, all you do is waste your time, you don't do anything useful"" and she would say this kind of shit all the time. throughout summer after junior year, when I was working on my college essays, throughout early senior year, when I was applying for colleges, late senior year, when I was applying for scholarships, even now during the summer, when I'm applying for jobs and doing my driving course. throughout junior year and senior year I was forced to take tons of AP courses, including US History btw which was a terrible choice because I came to America when I was a freshman and at that point when I took APUSH I didn't even know the difference between Christopher Columbus and George Washington. But I was forced to anyways so they can brag to their friends that I'm a smart kid and whatever at church, usual hypocritical bs. Oh, and in public, my step-mom acts super nice and all that and it disgusts me so much. She literally only cares about appearing like a 'mom'. This has gotten to the point that from late sophomore year to present, I hated coming home. I always love school because it's fun. As soon as I step home, I'm walking on eggshells. I'm always anxious because I know it's coming. If she isn't mad at me about something or berating me over something, she WILL find a way to. It's happened many times, she'll go in my room, if it's clean and I'm there, she would quickly make a scan and the smallest piece of paper in the floor she would start flipping her shit about me being messy all the time and all that bs. If it's messy, well same shit. If my room is messy and I'm not there, She would literally pick all the trash in my room, and put it in my bed. And yes, this includes things on my desk that doesn't even count as trash. Like homework assignments or projects I'm working on. She would put it with my pillows and blankets, forcing me to have to clean everything up if I want to sleep. Basically if I didn't do everything her way, even if I knew better methods, or my own plans, she would flip her shit and threaten to kick me out of the house. I dealt with this abuse every day for 4 years. And it's been worsening every year to this day. 

Now, me being the naive kid I was, I just wanted to leave. Immediately. I don't need this toxicity in my life. I wanted to be a nice person and a good influence to those around me and I didn't need this BS holding me back. I forgot to mention earlier, but my household is poor, My FAFSA for this school year, I saw the income, it was below 30k. Yep, that's household income. My step-mom has a new job this year, so probably up to mid 30s I'm guessing but yeah. I don't really eat that much of 'good food' most of our food at home are those cleaned from the shelves and donated because they are almost expired so most here at home are expired but haven't gone bad yet, sometimes some do though and I throw them out. So most are borderline, and just thrown in the freezer to preserve. But anyways yeah, I wanted to leave this house. There's also tons of social pressure from the church, and relatives, but that's a whole other paragraph that I doubt any of you need to hear. I basically wanted out ASAP and figured, ""imma just go to college out of state and have them as gone from my life as I can because I'm tired of their BS"" and so I applied out of state. (oh btw as for my dad, he just doesn't do anything about what's happening. I don't know why he puts up with this or if she threatens him with divorce and to leave him to pay the bills by himself if he speaks up but I just assume he's just a pussy and doesn't care about his kids since he left us in the first place) 

Anywayyyss, I got accepted to a couple out of state colleges and they're all expensive. I chose the cheapest one and what gives the most money, and I'm looking at 120k debt in student loans alone. This is for undergrad only. This is after considering grants and all that. Also, this is before calculating interest, and tuition inflation. Majority of the debt would be private loans (higher rates yay) because my parents refuse to do the Direct Parent PLUS loan and I don't wanna do the Direct Unsubsidized loan. However, this accounts for food and lodging, as well as textbooks and school supplies. 120k is a huuge debt though especially in private loans. I probably would end up paying a total of around 150k or more. Their costs are flat rate too, doesn't matter that I'm out of state, it would be the same for everyone. I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree. I don't feel to sure about this choice now. The in-state colleges nearby have closed admission. I have narrowed my option down to 2 most likely options. First option, just take the debt and work hard af to finish with good internships and a guaranteed job to pay off student loans. Possible, but difficult. Life doesn't work that easily. Second option, take a gap year and go to a MUUCH cheaper nearby college. My dilemma in this case however, comes down to the fact that since admission period is over, I have to wait till next year to start my degree. This brings up some problems. Firstly, I have no place to stay. After July, they're kicking me out and if I don't go to Florida, I'm on my own. My minimum wage job won't be able to afford an apartment and utilities and food for a year until I can get into college. My parents won't help whatsoever in this choice pretty much. I'm on my own and I still haven't found a better job and a potential roommate to split the bill with. One of my friends said I can find an entry level programming job that pays maybe 20 for the hour but I don't know if I'm capable enough for that, but I'm willing to give it a shot anyways. Don't think pursuing that would yield any result though but I'm trying it anyways. Secondly, I would owe my parents approximately 600 dollars which they would likely demand when they kick me out if I tell them I'm not going to Florida Tech as they did pay for the Housing and Tuition deposits. And thirdly, I'm pretty much out of the network of my entire family if I do this choice cause I already know for sure they'll brand me as a failure, etc. So yes. I need advice on what you guys think I should do moving forward. I've talked to many people, discussed with many friends and some teachers, and I would really appreciate more feedback. Thank you very much. It would be greatly appreciated.

Oh and if you guys were wondering, I live in Houston, Texas. I don't know if that would open up more advice from you guys but yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Btw, this isn't all that's happened, just some that stood out and some I remembered on the spot. If I actually listed out the tons of messed up shit and added all the other forms of abuse this would be like 5 paragraphs more of the same length but yeah"
c2cuhm,10,2019-06-19,Sad Internship Story,AccidentalF,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/c2cuhm/sad_internship_story/,"About two months ago, I started really looking into internships. My profession is IT and my interest lies in computer networking.  I found many internships in my area but only one had a focus on computer networking.  I started doing some research on the company and found that it probably wasn’t the greatest place to work (high turnover, some bad publicity, etc...). Aside from this, I heard that a majority of their interns continue on to either full time positions there or elsewhere immediately after graduation. I decided to continue through the process of applying.  My thought was that it couldn’t really be that bad.  During the interview process, I made sure to let them know that school was my number one priority and that working full time at any point was not possible.  They were very pleased to hear this and assured me that I would be able to work around my schedule.  Shortly after I was offered the position.  It was great! I felt amazing for probably the first time in years. 

About a week after accepting the position, I was told to come in for orientation.  It was great as well! There were a lot of other interns across all the different IT departments! It was really awesome to be surrounded by all of these people that shared my passion and interests.  After about 4 hours of going through paperwork, we got to meet our managers and have some pizza. During this lunch, my manager (who was a part of the interview) asked again if I was able to work full time. My answer at this point was the exact same as it was in the interview.  Nothing makes you feel less important than be heard but not listened to.  

A few weeks have gone by and I have been working about 24-30 hours a week.  Mix this in with my 9 credits this summer and I’m not left with a lot of time to see my family or do anything for myself.  I am now being told today that I need to be in the office Monday-Friday 8-5PM.  I asked him if he knew I was still going to school right now just to clarify that he knew he was talking to me.  He did.  

This internship is very important to me. I have learned a lot in the very short time that I have been here. Unfortunately, I can not afford to do this.  I feel really depressed about this whole situation and I’m heartbroken that I feel like I let my girlfriend, who helped get me the internship in the first place, and myself down.

The moral of the story is to listen to what people are telling you about a workplace.  A lesson I wish I would’ve learned prior."

I've tried previously to look for a job that can pertain to my industry, but the closest I've gotten was being an Information Systems Analyst Intern for this healthcare company, and even than it was only for 5 months (it paid atleast so I couldn't complain). Probably the closest I am getting to IT at the moment is being an educational instructor for a summer camp teaching extremely simple programming languages to K-12 kids and perhaps hopefully be hired for the help-desk-job at the school student services center. Also, I do have an Associates in Software Development and the internship experience I previously stated in my resume as well as a few side-projects (volunteered as an editor/administrator and simple CSS coding for a custom wiki site which I made from the ground up and has now received a sizable following. It's called Warhammer Fantasy wiki and about 90% of the content there as well as the custom design was made by me over the span of 5 years. It even has a mobile app now!).

Now, far and above all my education is worth more to me than any job, and I would drop any job if it impedes my school in anyway. Which is why I am currently seeking an IT job that isn't too intensive in its workload. Something that is part-time and typically entry-level.

I know I know that I am being extremely picky, but again I really can't risk my grades in any meaningful way (mostly because I need to keep a good GPA for transfer to a good UC school). Which is why I wish to ask advice by you guy's.

Desperately need help.",thistooshallpass123,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/c2drv8/disability_assistance_mental_health_failing_cant/,"Hey, thanks for reading. So in short, I'm a mid-20s male in Alberta who currently can't work due to significant mental health issues, and I'm a month or two from running out of savings/sell-able possessions. I have no clue if I'd qualify for income assistance/adult health benefit/disability, no idea how to go about it, and no support network that can help me. I'll try to summarize details in bullet points:


-Diagnoses with Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, Tourettes. Had appointment with autism specialist and he thinks I'm definitely somewhere on the spectrum, and I'm supposed to go back at some point to finalize the assessment. Got shingles two years ago which sent mental health and life into a nosedive.

-Medical history involves trying 10+ antidepressants, 5+ ADHD meds, anxiety meds, thyroid meds, pregabalin, etc

-I'm currently staying with a parent in a 1-BR condo in Calgary. My expenses are meds(Adderall+Dexedrine+Prozac, 200$/mo), phone, transport, food/supplements. Expenses that would help my situation include sleep lab(had take-home test with mild sleep apnea, need to go back for full test), dental work(haven't gone to dentist in 10 years due to finances, plaque/pus/bleeding/major gum recession), psychologist/therapy, basic clothing, and possibly rent. Food is more expensive than most people, as everything that isn't fruit/vegetables/meat makes my symptoms significantly worse.

-Neither parent can afford to help financially. One is retired and doesn't believe mental health is a real thing, and the other is a relapsed alcoholic. Hell, I've been having to lend them money. I don't have any other family I've been in contact with over last 10+ yrs, and most of them have similar issues. I don't have any friends or acquaintances -- I used to, but when depression and physical health got worse a few years ago, lost contact. They also live in different cities, and don't really have the energy to be any help, as the only people I've gotten close to are pretty similar to me -- certain areas of high intelligence, but ASD/depression/anxiety and occupied dealing with that. Haven't really been able to relate to people who aren't like that. 

-I was home-schooled, which masked a lot of the symptoms. As an adult, I either lived at home, or away from home with a bare minimum expenses allowance(it was feasible, back then). I've worked one month at a clothing store, 6 months as an at-home market researcher, and at my highest level of performing, had an unpaid internship as a research assistant/content manager for a top non-fiction author(psychology). Due to mental health, that failed to turn into a paid job.

-I've never filed tax/income forms, and have no clue how to go about it(due to a combination of no income, no financial education, and an inability to emotionally deal with navigating bureaucracy/forms)

-The primary symptoms that prevent work are: inability to deal with people(especially more than one), inability to maintain a sleep schedule, constant fatigue due to that(e.g. even 50mg combined Adderall/Prozac results in being exhausted after 5-6 hours), and depression/anxiety often making it impossible to leave the house. As an example, if I run out of groceries, I'd generally prefer not eating for a few days over going to the store. I know that's bad, so I'll drink some alcohol and then go to the store, which isn't really much better. Tourette's and a lack of emotion don't help either.

- I see a doctor monthly for mental health, but I think my way of framing my situation makes it seem like I'm doing better than I am. I don't leave out any of the negative parts(except for the inability to leave the house -- viewed that as a personality trait/preference until recently), and I always talk excitedly about the ways I've been progressing. I'm fairly knowledgeable(for an amateur) about science relating to mental health(psychology, neuropharmacology, etc) due to my primary activity being reading research papers to try to fix myself, which I think makes me seem a lot more capable of functioning than I am. I also have lots of coping mechanisms that I talk about(e.g. keeping a journal, extensive scheduling, tracking time/activity/food/mood/mental state obsessively, etc), which probably makes me seem a lot more on top of my problems than I am. I also generally believe in self-reliance and the importance of mindset, and really want to avoid thinking of myself as being disabled. That being said, right now I'm not even capable of doing the things to take care of my health, let alone work. I can also say with certainty that if it wasn't for being able to live with a parent, I'd have been homeless or dead years ago. Now that said parent is an alcoholic, my life suddenly feels significantly more fragile, and I need to take steps to protect myself.

- I'm intelligent enough that with the right help I should be capable of surviving and possibly thriving, but my environment is awful and my ability to cope with emotions, people, and basic tasks(cleaning, grooming, eating, bills, seeking out help) is remarkably bad. I essentially feel no emotions with the exception of fear/panic and excitement, and by the time an emotion is strong enough to notice, it's disabling and leads to being bed-ridden, drinking, or porn to escape the pain. As far as dealing with people goes, it essentially feels physically painful. I don't understand body language, facial expressions, or standard social protocols. I can't tolerate the majority of conversation, unless it's about something like science. I sort of experience empathy, but it's more a cognitive process than an emotion, and I struggle significantly to demonstrate it. Emotional disclosure makes me want to vomit, and I struggle to ask for help due to an intense fear of appearing weak.  These issues significantly impact my ability to improve my health and my home life, while also making it incredibly hard to navigate the system to seek help. There's a reason I'm asking for advice on reddit instead of going to a professional. Hell, I don't even know what type of professional would be best for the type of problems I have.

- I know the things I need to do in order to get better, but my mental health, energy levels, and environment make most of them essentially impossible. The ones that I could do, I can't afford. I want to spend the next few years building the tools I need to cope with my problems -- an exercise routine, meditation routine, CBT/DBT, fixing my sleep, and general therapy. If my mental health and environment can improve, I'm definitely capable of surviving with an online job and various coping mechanisms(e.g. food delivery so I don't need to leave the house). Ideally, therapy could help social and emotional issues enough that I could go to school for either biochemistry or neuroscience.

- That being said, I have no clue what to do in the short term. I went to the AHS adult addiction services building to try to get help in learning how to deal with my environment, but the social worker seems to think the thing I need first is sex addiction counseling, which makes me pretty skeptical. Obviously using porn to escape pain is bad, but it seems significantly better than alcohol or being incapacitated, and dealing with that does nothing to help the underlying issues. I said I'd go, but realistically it doesn't seem worth it when I have so little runway before what's left of my life falls apart. I have an appointment with a different social worker/counselor from my primary care network in a week, ostensibly to talk about how to help an alcoholic parent. I'd like to talk to her about what government assistance I might be able to qualify for, but I'm terrified of asking due to how most people sneer at mental illness being a disability. I also have a tendency to downplay how bad things are, since so far experience has taught me that being honest about mental health leads to people treating you worse, not better. Before talking to her about it, I want to be confident that it's a very reasonable thing to ask for, as that will make it significantly easier to be persistent rather than just giving up if she seems dismissive.


So, the more actionable questions:

1. Is it likely that I'd qualify for any assistance? 
2. If so, which types of assistance should I ask about? Income support? Alberta adult health benefit, AISH, PDD?
3. How do I deal with tax/income forms for the last 9 years when I can't hire anyone and don't have records of the majority of my life? I've had my current bank account for a few years, but I closed my previous bank accounts.
3. What are the first few steps I need to take?

c2gpls,12,2019-06-19,A personal take on the West Bengal medico assault and its aftermath,LegendaryFalcon,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c2gpls/a_personal_take_on_the_west_bengal_medico_assault/,"The incident of assault had two victims; 1. the interns 2. the patients who suffered as a result of the ensuing strike. 

It's known that there is a fear of aggression from the patients' relatives in the minds of the doctors, especially among doctors serving in govt operated tertiary care centres. There are surveys out there indicating this. This is a poor situation, no doubt. Also, the working conditions there aren't that nice. So, how should this be addressed? The answer that immediately comes to the mind is - Government needs to do more, make workplace safer, put police out there in the wards to protect doctors from any possible physical harm while they do their job. This sounds plausible, but might be difficult to implement, as it entails placing manpower. So, what can be OK to implement and at the same time be effective. I have a suggestion (I welcome criticism), which is - government should pass a bill, an ordinance, per which anybody that gets physical with the care staff i.e, doctors, nurses, technicians, housekeeping etc, will not receive any medical treatment anywhere in the country going forward, in addition to punishment per penal provisions; that a database of such miscreants be created with a retrospective effect and be made available to all govt primary and tertiary care centres across the country for perusal, and that patients/relatives of patients need to sign an undertaking of no-mischief while seeking registration and treatment at any govt hospital. All this with immediate effect. This may have some effect in alleviating the fear from the minds of doctors, doctors who're no other people but us. This should make their workplace a little tension free. This is my suggestion. I can't think of any other effective measure save this.

Now, taking a deeper look at the incident, we see that the assault was perceived as an assault on every working doctor out there irrespective of location. Solidarity poured in from all corners of the medical fraternity and equally in measure from the general public, as well. This should be proof enough to doctors out there that the public at large are reasonable people who empathize with any victim of violence anywhere, more so when it's a medico. This should be a morale booster for aspiring medicos in our country. Now, medicos, too, need to be careful before engaging in strikes because a good number of innocent people suffered as a consequence. Some deaths, too, seem to have occurred on account of this. Again, they're intelligent people, and we should leave things to their own better judgment.

A totally personal opinion on the medical profession: Doctors are not God. Yes. Doctors sacrifice a lot to become qualified professionals. Agree. They have no personal life. Agree. Doctors attend work at odd hours. Yes. But, there are certain things that need to be acknowledged in the same spirit and at the same time. Amongst the lakhs of doctors in this country, only a handful ever chose willfully to serve people in some remote place. There're just a few who solely desired to serve humanity. For the majority, it always is/was a good choice of career. Agreed that they're human beings, and they've their own aspirations, but nobody's denying that, ever. People are free to do per their own free will. But, no doctor occupies a pedestal just by virtue of being one. I'll rate a social worker higher to a salaried doctor any day, for obvious reasons. That doctors save lives; yes, and again it's the doctors exactly who tell me that CPR works only 5 times out of 100. Yes, it's a noble profession, but I see nobleness in only a scant few, the majority are simply professionals. That they make us feel better; yes, but if it's only at a payment, then I don't see any greatness in it. I absolutely have a soft corner for some doctors at govt hospitals who do a tremendous job treating the poor and the uneducated. Have seen it with my own eyes. But, not all of them though. 

It's the level of humanity inside a qualified doctor that makes him eligible for greatness. Just being so never does. If we are to condemn violence, let's condemn violence on everybody, everywhere. Why limit it just to doctors. The injured intern has my sympathies, but so do all the people who do risky jobs. **Doctors should acknowledge the fact that people personally thank them for doing their job, a monetary consideration notwithstanding, and there are people out there who do hazardous, thankless jobs but live in penury and obscurity**. 


Mad respect to all the people, among them to the physicians and surgeons especially, who serve humanity irrespective of stature and place. Thanks for reading."
c2gzqy,3,2019-06-19,Help Desk to Junior DevOps?,VapesfromBible,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/c2gzqy/help_desk_to_junior_devops/,"I just graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems and spent the past 3 years in IT Support / Help Desk roles. I gained a great bit of knowledge and experience working in those roles as an intern (at a Fortune 500, at a Wealth/Finanace Company, and at a MSP). 

&amp;#x200B;

I was lucky enough to accept a great job out of college doing IT &amp; Software Support. About 2 months in, I realize that my heart really isn't in doing Tier 1 type Help Desk stuff (resetting passwords, program installs, recovering emails). I am starting to work with the software support team and realize all of these guys have a lot of coding knowledge in work in DevOps type roles. I figured I worked too hard in college and spent most of that time busting my butt interning to just be complacent with a job doing low level work. I am thankful for where I ended up... but I want to continue learning and climbing the ladder rather than be complacent. 

&amp;#x200B;

My goal was to start studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. After that, I wanted to grab a better understanding and study up on Linux (I have minor knowledge in Linux atm). After I got those 2 down - I wanted to dedicate my time learning Python and automation.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a good learning track towards a Junior role? Has anyone moved out of a Help Desk role into a Junior DevOps role?

c2iclz,0,2019-06-19,Need help deciding between two offers (new grad),Bat_002,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c2iclz/need_help_deciding_between_two_offers_new_grad/,"I have received two offers, Company A and Company B. I graduated in May, and I will be working on my masters. I will be moving to Boston in September (already signed the lease).

**Company A:** I have interned with them for 1 1/2 years. I have the offer to continue working remotely as a Grad intern, making \~$32 an hour, limited to 30 hours/week (Comes to \~50k/year, no benefits). I will need to take 2 classes instead of 1 per semester. Potentially, there is an offer to work full-time remotely with a different team at the company, but this is not confirmed. I would expect this position's salary to be in the 74k range, but it is possible to be around 84k depending on the level (Company A is in a very low cost-of-living area too). Both positions at Company A are very similar, with a heavy emphasis on software and microservices.

**Company B:** This company is in a similar line of work to Company A. The offer is for a machine learning position at 74k + 3k cash bonus. Company B is a 1hr 15min commute each way. It sounds like I would be reading research papers in machine learning, while potentially hooking up DevOps related things (though they said my priority would be machine learning). The company's name probably carries a little bit more prestige in the Great Boston Area, probably because my company isn't as well known in the area is all. When I interviewed for the company, it was supposed to be for a position that paid in the 93k range, but they said they would promote me after I finished my masters (\~3 years at 1 class/semester).

If I'm honest, my goals are long-term career growth, salary, and enjoyment of the position in that order. I would say I enjoy software more, but that might be because I'm more experienced with it, and I hear that the ML positions are hard to get. I think I like the people at Company A more (My current manager is amazing), but I also wish the intern position would include me more in the team. There are a lot of other tech jobs in Boston with a much shorter commute, but for the ones I applied to I haven't heard back.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What did you end up doing? Is there a real difference in career salaries and opportunities between software and machine learning?"

After contemplating posting on tons of other subreddits, I figured this one would be the best since you all might understand my feelings more.

&amp;#x200B;

Since graduating high school 5 years ago, I have gone through about 6 or 7 jobs. Each of them were fairly short term, and I didn't have a job throughout junior and senior year of college. Each job, I ended up absolutely despising. I would become extremely depressed on the commute and would've given anything to not go. I used to give away my shifts as much as I could, which completely defeats the point of working. Upon moving back to my hometown after completing an out-of-state internship, I got a job that I finally was excited about (technical customer support). I loved going to work, I loved my job, my coworkers rocked, and I was actually so happy with life. Now, not even 5 months later, I am completely burnt out. My degree that I worked so hard for doesn't even matter at the job, it feels like there's no job advancement opportunities, the pay is crap for what we do, and the fact that I sit next to a high schooler doing the same job feels embarrassing and depressing. All I want to do is quit and stay at home with my new dog (that I got partially to help with my anxiety/depression), but with my debt/bills there's no way I could. I have tried looking for remote job positions, but haven't had much luck. Each job I look at that utilizes my degree also requires 10 years of experience, which is a whole other thing that pisses me off and depresses me.

I'll take any advice right now. I am so lost and depressed about my work life and lack of a career that it is really affecting me."

This is my third internship but the first “real” one where I’ve been coding. I’m going into my last year of undergrad and intend to start a grad program after. 

I originally got assigned to a project that another intern had started. The first month was a struggle- I didn’t understand the codebase and hadn’t worked with the language in two years. I didn’t turn anything in and went down rabbit holes trying to solve a minor problem.

All of a sudden, something clicked. I turned it in and spent four months doing each and every thing that was asked of me. It got pretty trivial quickly- I breezed through every assignment, and wanted to join in on the main project. However, my manager held off on this until a month ago, when I started doing some minor fixes. I’m now finishing up writing unit tests to increase code coverage.

Another point to note is that I have ADHD and a relatively weak coding background, so it typically takes me longer to grasp concepts. I also have another disability which I’ve received no accommodations for and I feel has impacted my progress.

I just had a meeting with him in which he said that he still feels like I haven’t done enough for him to make a business case for a return offer, that I wouldn’t be “ready to hit the ground running”. I’m incredibly hurt because I feel like I’ve really turned it around from a rough start, and that I’ve worked hard to redeem myself and prove that I can be a full member of the team. I don’t like making excuses, but I’ve really had to deal with a lot and have done my best to overcome it. It’s hard to compare myself with others, but I feel as if done relatively more work than I have at my other two internships, where my managers were pleased with my work.

Am I unreasonable for thinking that he is being unfair? Is there anything I can do? Any input would be much appreciated."

They want new counters on some of the one ton machine presses and after discussing it with one of the engineers, we determined that proximity sensors would work best for this application. 

Now I'm still pretty green when it comes to electronics and I don't know much about how to connect a proximity sensor to a counter and actually have it count when the sensor comes into range of a metal object. I'm pretty excited about this project because I'll be able to get off of Excel for a while and learn some new stuff but that being said I'm not even sure where to start. 

What are some things I should keep in mind when looking for sensors? I think I found the counter I want to use [here](https://www.mcmaster.com/7959t41), although it's a bit on the expensive side I think. Would I need a controller between the sensor and counter? Or would the sensor be able to send a basic ""on"" (senses metal) and ""off"" (doesn't sense anything) signal to the counter that it could read and then count up on each ""on"" signal? 

I know I'm asking very broad questions but I didn't want to waste the engineers' time asking a bunch of obvious questions so I thought I could maybe get some guidance on here.

I am a spring 2019 CS graduate without a job currently and without any internship experience. I have been learning Web Dev and been building personal websites as I see that as the most realistic or easiest path I can take to a development position. However, due to my lack of preparation for graduation I have not been successful in landing a Web Dev job this spring or early summer. I recently applied for a computer technician position at a high school and they offered me a job with a salary I could easily live on and meet my needs to be happy outside of work (42k/yr). I'm inclined to take this position because I want to get on my feet, and also not having a job for an extended period of time looks bad to future employers. In my mind I could do this computer technician position for a couple years (or longer who knows) and then attempt to start a web dev career afterwards, leveraging my hopefully then impressive website portfolio and CS degree to get into the development industry. However, my parents strongly believe I would be making a mistake by taking a computer technician position at a high school. They think that right now (summer 2019) is a time where I should be ambitious and  that it will be easier to break into the industry as a fresh grad than as someone who is a few years out of college with no real development experience. Is there any credibility to this thinking? Again, I like the idea of taking my current offer, but I say that with the belief that it will be ""no big deal"" to future employers and that as long as I can show competency and a good portfolio, employers wont think badly of me for taking an IT position out of college instead of a web dev position. I don't want to let this computer technician opportunity slip by, and then perhaps not get any development offers for a couple months and have to resort to retail or food work, but I also don't want to irreparably harm my future job prospects if I would indeed be doing so by taking a non development tech position out of college. Would it be smarter for me to instead continue working on web dev skills in my free time even if I have to do retail or food work because that could mean forgoing a few years of IT work and getting into development a bit sooner?"

My university only records the courses I take abroad as pass/fail in my transcript and the grades don’t affect my gpa. 

A 41% is considered passing at the university I was studying abroad at. It’s part of the UK system so an “A” is an 80% I had a 59% on one essay and a 64% on my second essay. However, because of a friend’s death I had delayed finishing and submitting my essay by one day. I had submitted a mitigating circumstances form three times to the university with different pieces of evidence to prove my inability to write the essay, and was told each time that it was insufficient. My last essay will be counted as a 0% so I’ll fail the course. I’ve talked to my study abroad advisor and there’s nothing I can do at this point to not fail that course.

(my current job)

In my most recent role, I've found the greatest success just volunteering to do tasks no one else wants to, then trying to turn them around as fast as possible. This often means test automation, changes to legacy code, deploying code, retesting software against new versions of tools we use, writing backfills to correct old data figuring out why popular endpoints are slow, and trying to reproduce obscure bugs. A lot of people I work with are just coming out of school, so I tend to follow a rule of doing the annoying things teachers would not require them to do.

Doing this has earned me several giant perks:

* it's earned me a raise
* it's made the other programmers see me as helpful because my work impacts them directly
* it's made it possible for me to propose hard things, because I have a reputation for doing the worst parts instead of forcing other people to do them

When I graduated I wanted to work on simple software with a slow release cycle and as little persistent state as possible. I didn't even want to work on a web service if I could help it, because that would mean dealing with outages. It turns out, AFAICT, everyone wants this. However, most jobs include tasks that aren't like this, because of the nature of the software. Doing the really unpleasant tasks is very visible to the people who would otherwise be forced to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think some people act like this work is beneath them because they lack relevant skills? (This was certainly true for me.) It's easy to say something is beneath you if you have no idea how to do it and don't want to learn. Unfortunately, I think it might be impossible to succeed as a software engineer without learning skills in unexciting areas, because even interesting work contains lots of unexciting tasks.

Good luck, folks!"

Need advice on life after graduation.,XzHoneyCrums,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/c2lq42/17_year_old_following_his_senior_year_need_advice/,"I’m 17 years old about to start my senior year in these next few months. And my life after high school has been on my mind pretty heavily. I’m around a pretty strong military presence in my family. I have two brothers in the marines and a lot of family spread about in other branches. I’ve been told over and over again to join the military. I was in a JROTC program in the earlier years of my life which I’m no longer part of. I always wanted to join the navy but I just don’t see myself apart of the military anymore. I don’t see myself joining. And also apart from the fact that I’m in a pretty solid relationship right now I wouldn’t want to leave so quick. My talent (You could say) is messing around with computers and this is something I definitely want to do for a career in which I would be explaining.

I’m planning on attending a State College near me which offers a pretty strong computer technology (A.S.) degree for about 9,000$ tuition and fees included with 50 hours of internship work experience. Not bad right? I’m taking Programming courses on Lynda to get a better background. I know a lot of the basics about coding and hardware already. I’m planning on taking the Comptia + cert test to get certified and maybe score a job around next year when I graduate while attending college. I’m mostly on my own. I do have two sets of parents but they show no support of helping me financially through my journey since they want me in the military. I’ve been pushed to join all my life. I am taking my asvab over again to maybe increase my score. Because of shit hits the fan and everything doesn’t go in play I will join.
I also plan on doing some trading and investing my money and opening my own business later in my life and having multiple streams of income.

That being said. I would like some advice from anyone and anything since I don’t really have a lot of guidance through my journey. I understand this will be hard for me. Life sure isn’t easy and I’ve found that out early in my life but I do know if I put my head straight I can do anything I’m willing to do."

I am a 27 F living in Chicago suburbs. Right now I have a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and have 2 years of working as a System Administrator. I also have 2 years working as a Marketing Coordinator.

I am 100% miserable in my current field. After much consideration, I have decided I really want to work for a record company or be somehow involved in the music industry. I really enjoyed the Marketing aspects of the job I had while I worked as a coordinator. Since I was a child I have been obsessed with the industry. I also play a few instruments myself. This is something I have heavily researched and thought about a lot and is my passion. 

Ideally, I would love to work as a Fan Engagement Coordinator, Marketing Manager,  A&amp; R or Artist Development Manager. My problem is I've applied to probably over 200 positions total at this point at Sony, Warner and Universal with no response back. I've even applied for more entry-level clerical positions to get my foot in the door. Most of the IT positions are higher up and I am not qualified. I have applied to some smaller record companies as well.

I know this is the path I want to pursue and I live in Chicago and it seems like a dead end here.  I would be willing to relocate to Los Angeles or Nashville depending on what type of job I could find out there that could afford me to live. It would need to be more than 55k a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my potential options/paths. Please let me know what you think of them

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1

Go back to school at UCLA in their extension program and receive a certificate in Music Business. This certificate also places you in an internship program as well and classes are online and on campus. The classes are at night so I would be able to work during the day. The certificate is around $7,000 and about a year to do. I would try and find work out there in the meantime or possibly another remote IT position to keep myself afloat if I decided to move to Los Angeles.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2

Online classes for a certificate in Music Business or a Masters of Arts in Music Business degree at Berklee online. This would allow me to continue to live and job hunt where I am right now. My only concern with this is there's no internship placement. Which I think is how you get your foot in the door at most of these record companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3

Continue to exhaust myself and apply for any and every position at these companies. Maybe find another marketing position work there for a few years and try and still get my foot in the door. The issue is the lack of education and internship. This is probably the most cost-effective option.  Most people suggested to get their foot in the door through IT but like I said I am not qualified for most of the positions listed and am completely burnt out in this field.

c2lszg,84,2019-06-19,Don't Lose Hope and Believe in Yourself!,Interstellis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c2lszg/dont_lose_hope_and_believe_in_yourself/,"With us nearing the end of June, there are plenty of new Computer Science graduates looking for a job still. I just wanted to write this to give some of you hope about your situation and if you're freaking out like I was. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 7 months ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/9r90ll/i_graduate_in_may_2019_and_feel_like_i_havent/) on r/computerscience explaining how I didn't feel like I was ready to graduate and I didn't learn enough to get a job. First off, I just wanted to say thank you to all of the kind people that took time out of their day to post nice things. However, I still felt like I was behind and wasn't going to have a chance on the job market. I had no internship experience, a sub-par GPA (2.8-ish), and felt like all of my classmates were ahead of me in every single facet of programming and other subjects. The semester continued and my anxiety about the situation continued to grow. Eventually I graduated and I was still doubting myself horribly and I took about a 2-3 week break after I graduated to just decompress and think about my future. Was this field even for me? Am I even going to get a job in my field? 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I just decided to face my fears and started sending out applications. Most of them went how you would expect: no response. If I did get an interview I would get an e-mail shortly afterwards saying they were going to move on to other candidates, but would thank me for my time. I decided to revise my resume, change some things, and really start working on my communication skills. **Your resume is extremely important.** You might not have much to put on there; but find anything you can put on there. List out your skills. Say you're organized. Say you manage time well. Anything that would make you sound more appealing. They don't have to be Computer Science related. For interviews, in my experience, **it's not so much about knowing everything related to a language/topics, but rather if you are a good and fun person to be around. Be yourself. Have fun. Just let loose and be a person other people would enjoy being around at work (while being professional, of course).** I remember for one of my interviews we just talked about fantasy football for 5-10 minutes because I had it listed on my hobbies. I started getting a lot more responses when I revised my resume to look more appealing. If you want help with this, there is a whole subreddit dedicated to this: r/resumes. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how does all of this tie in? I recently got an offer from a company for a Software Developer position. Once you get over your fears and believe in your skills, there's nothing that can stop you. What's the worst that can happen? A company says no. You get rejected. **You can't be afraid of failure.** If you get rejected, just send another application out. And another. And another. And another. And another. The point is:

&amp;#x200B;

**If I can do this, you can do this too. Don't lose hope.** **You graduated for a reason. You got through your program for a reason. You CAN do this.**

&amp;#x200B;

I wish you all well."

**Writing**: I am relatively confident about my writing skills and feel like I would have above-average essays. I had a stroke when I was younger so I had to re-learn many of my minor movements and speech, which is likely going to be one of the topics of my writing.

**Teacher Recs**: I am very confident that I will have good teacher recommendations. Can retired/previous teachers who are not at the school anymore still give a recommendation?"

&amp;#x200B;

New college grad here with a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems. Throughout college I was able to complete 3 seperate internships, all within a IT Support / Help Desk type roles. I gained great experience and made my resume look well enough to land a great job doing IT Support for a SaaS company right after a graduated. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I begin to work here, I want to continue to grow/learn and don't want to stay complacent in a IT Support role doing basic troubleshooting and password resets. I want to use my hard work I did in college obtaining my degree and doing my internships to help me climb the ladder and not stay in the same roles I have been doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking about learning the following to add to my resume to help me grow into a job like DevOps or along those lines. I really want to pick up a programming skill and move towards a DevOps type of route. My plan was to do this:

Study and obtain the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification

&amp;#x200B;

Study and learn Linux

&amp;#x200B;

Study and learn Python and automation

&amp;#x200B;

With these 3 things, plus my background and degree... what types of jobs should I be looking at? What order do you recommend studying those things in? Is there anything else I should be looking at as far as skills to add?

&amp;#x200B;

I have ""hobbies and interests"" such as I...like using my graphic design &amp; illustration skills to create digital illustration, I'm good at it. I'm currently developing those two skills and also learning video editing &amp; motion design skills (using online tutorials, youtube,  recreating, experimenting, doing projects) effectively. Yeah that's going great.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a desire to pursue film making, more so video production. I kinda intend to do some internships, work experience and volunteering of sorts. I also want to get back to writing screenplays, i stopped for a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Just trying to build my portfolio again... I've got a body of work that i don't think is good enough / feels old.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to start a blog, I wanna use my graphic design &amp; illustration skills to create a clothing...side hustle thing online.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentionally I wanna use everything to create my personal brand!

(Idk about freelancing)

But...

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried and failed before, maybe I haven't tried hard enough. I didn't make the sacrifices before (not playing games, restricting time on phone, gave up porn &amp; masturbation). I was half-assing before. I live in a crowded household, I get extremely anxious sometimes...Had extreme depression before.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure (sometimes) if I'm going down a good path. Being 23, I coulda shoulda gone to uni by now? I got the grades-ish, the offers, but I kept on rejecting them coz I was just filling the applications as if it was a formality, didn't have the desire.

&amp;#x200B;

And sometimes, I get the desire to... I wanna work in an investigative role of sorts, maybe in the NCA (national crime agency) in the UK. Or I wanna be a lawyer (I probably don't have the desire to read something boring for 5 hours a day) and ....

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know how I could juggle all this? One day I listen to a podcast or a documentry and think ""I wanna be this..."" or ""I wanna be that..."" there is so many things I want to be. There's only one life and I'm meant to choose? How am I meant to choose?

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do if I go to uni? How am I gonna juggle...all my mini-projects, side hustles? when studying? What really gives me a lot of anxiety is my lost years, I can't get em back. I also don't wanna be 23 and be in a class with a bunch of 17/18 year olds - that's just a constant reminder of being 6 years behind. And not even that, what if I have to go back to college UK and do my A levels again?

&amp;#x200B;

The best scenario for me is to get a part time job and try to save to move out and focus on side projects in different egg baskets and hopefully one takes off and i can focus on that thing more? But I don't have luck getting a job atm - two years unemployed woop! (fml)

I'm willing to relocate but not 2-3 times a year. I was just curious if anyone's had success breaking into the field as a post-grad intern? Or any other advice to break in as a dev. I can deal with low pay but I'm desperate for experience that doesn't include me moving all over 3 times a year, just once would be nice.

It's a software development position at a well respected older firm, so I imagine despite the fact it's business clothes, it'll likely be a relaxed team environment. This means it's doubly as important to get along with everyone there and make a good impression.

I've progressed A LOT socially in the last 2 years. During my internship 2 years ago, I was crippled by social anxiety. I was terrified to talk to my teammates about anything other than work related topics. I went to therapy about 3/4 of the way through the year, and started being more open at work, but by then I was pretty much done with the internship, so it felt too little too late. After coming back to university to finish my final year, I joined a society and made loads more friends, really putting the effort in to get rid of my social anxiety. For the most part it was a success, as I no longer really get anxious when speaking to new people. I'm more at ease if a conversation is a little awkward (no more beating myself up), and I've accepted the fact I'm not going to click with everyone. Of course, in university, I get to choose my housemates and friends, and if I don't vibe with someone I just don't hang out with them - I don't know if this still holds true for the workplace.

I haven't been all that great of a student up to this point, probably have a 2.7 gpa atm. The problem is, I have 3 misdemeanor charges, 2 for possession and one for resisting arrest without violence. Now here's what is really gonna fuck me up, I just got a felony charge last night for marijuana concentrate. All of these are in the state of Florida, I'm lawyering up for this one and am hoping for the best, we'll see. My question is, am I totally fucked? I want to go out to Seattle one day and get into the tech industry there. Should I even bother trying for that anymore? I'm a huge idiot and shouldn't have been messing with that stuff anymore, shoulda learned my lesson, but I didn't and am now in a horrible situation. Is there any hope? I'm gonna work my ass off in school, and do any extra coding curriculars I can in my spare time, and become as good at it as possible. I'm worried about finding internships and stuff though, and then after it's all done finding a job. Am I fucked?"

I changed majors from political science about a year ago, and I've been working towards a BA in 4 year universities in the US. After spending many years hoping to become a lawyer or working in some field relating to history. 

After trying out a history major for a year, and a working as an intern at a law firm over a summer, I realized I hated both of them in very different and specific ways. 

I've always had a knack for math and computers, but my high school science teachers were literally bullied by students into submission or into resigning and having a substitute for the rest of the year, while the math teacher literally left the classroom to go paint the baseball field. During tests. No bullshit. Open cheating, and people begging me for help and answers, even when the teacher was available for questions. He would just leave it up to me to help people, and he didnt teach many things necessary for the state exams. My high school closed within 3 years of me graduating due to being a total shitshow.

At this point, I dont know how I would go about changing to a BS in anything, but math and science feels so much more natural and WAY more fun to me. I'm kind of at a loss, but I am not in any way motivated to work toward law school or a history degree in any way, even as a junior in college.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me first thank this sub and all of you for your assistance both to me personally and to everyone else who frequents this corner of Reddit. A lot of good information is distributed on this board.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I want to quickly tell a short story about my (short) journey that might re-assure those out there wondering if they can make it in this industry. Even though you didn't graduate with a 4.0 from Harvard and immediately move into Tech and Telecom M&amp;A in NYC, you can still have a fulfilling, well paying, and mentally stimulating career in the world of Finance.

&amp;#x200B;

Story Time, TLDR at bottom:

I grew up pretty poor in a small-ish midwest college town. I pursued professional athletics (non-traditional sport that everyone knows about, but no-one cares about) throughout high school/the start of college and went to a non-target school starting in engineering, but eventually moving to finance. I got a 1.0 GPA one semester in school before I transferred into finance, as I was competing/travelling extensively for my sport. I then made the switch into finance and dedicated the past 5 years of my life to learning as much as possible about the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to work my entire way through school and started out washing cars for a car dealership, but quickly moved on thanks to a few lucky internships:

Real Estate: direct investing in institutional real estate that I got through an online job board and cold calling

Venture Capital: small shop raising a fund that I connected with the MD through a previous acquaintance

PWM: completely random story about how I got the position, but needless to say it was not from ""connections"" 

&amp;#x200B;

All of these positions were within a 50 mile radius of where I was born. I took that final PWM role out of college as a full time position and learned so much in such a short time from one of the nicest and hardest working group of former investment bankers, consultants, and brokers I have ever met. But, I wanted the chance to move to a big city and a true ""high finance"" type job (I know prestige is dumb, but this industry can be a sucker for it). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I looked and looked and looked and had interviews in probably 4 major financial hubs in the US and abroad, but no luck. So I reached out to a gentleman I met at my RE internship who was a director at a local RE consulting shop. They brought me in three times in a week and gave me an offer within another day. I have been there for a year now and have learned a great deal about the space from the VPs and Directors I have there. They have given me opportunities to lead projects, present to clients, and a multitude of other tasks (along with dumb-long hours). But at the end of the day I am more interested in the traditional corporate finance side as opposed to Real Estate, so when an external recruiter reached out to me a month ago about a job in a nearby city, I had to take the call.

&amp;#x200B;

Well today, I received an offer to join a legit mid market investment bank's valuation group full time in a legit financial capital. I am so excited about the opportunity I have been given and so appreciative of everyone who has helped me along the way, including you all. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I have any advice, it would be the following:

&amp;#x200B;

Keep your options open and say yes to new opportunities and meeting new people.

Work very hard and sooner or later someone will notice (the last people in the office notice who else is still there).

Apply only to jobs you don't think you are qualified for (within reason).

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Failed semi-professional athlete was washing cars five years ago and today got a job offer in a new city, making a lot of money, and with a company I could see working at for a long time.**

&amp;#x200B;

Yours Truly,

&amp;#x200B;

The background information for it is that it is unpaid, 5 days a week, and 9 hours a day from 9 am - 6 pm while also driving in LA traffic. They haven't given me a set end date either. In terms of programming, the first couple of days I've been working with Selenium package and have basically been testing. They don't really help me out and ask if I need help or anything and just throw me in expecting me to learn everything on my own. Also the main tech supervisor is going to leave his job at the end of this week and I'm kind of worried about how much I can potentially learn from this position.

I've done some researching of my own, and I know my field's not the best paying especially when you only have your bachelor's but I was hoping to market myself well enough in my field and others so I could make at least $17-$20/hour (I'm currently working on finishing up a cert course that could lead me to a starting pay of $17). I've just felt like a fish out of water because I know I'm a qualified candidate and it feels like it's hitting even harder cause I'm in love with having a routine and set schedule and now that graduation has come and gone I feel like I only got to bask in my glory for a few days and immediately went into stress mode. I'd also like to mention that I thin a big part of my stress is due to the fact that I want to go away for graduate school which means I need a solid income coming in to achieve that and also to make sure I'm not being buried in debt (not to mention my family puts an incredible amount of stress on me so I'd really like to only have myself to worry about for the first time in a really long time - think borderline narcissistic family members with a close family member needing me as emotional support even though I'm the youngest among the lot). I've also been reading that job hunting looks like what I've been experiencing so I know I can't expect an amazing job offer to just fall into my lap three weeks into looking and sending out applications, but I also feel like I just need a little bit of hope and/or advice. I feel like a big part of my struggle too is that I went to college on a full ride so I've never worked before because the scholarship was huge and I really did not want to risk losing it, but I've done 3 internships from high school (a few months in 2013 and 2014 and then a two month one in 2015) to my senior year of college (2019). I've been thinking about really showing initiative and going to the places I've applied for with my resume in hand and asking to speak to the hiring manager.

I like FSU because it is said to be in the higher ranking (not by much) than UF for poli sci. It's right next to the capital so I might have more opportunities to work and internships. The biggest reason why I like FSU is that they offer 40 classes on human rights. If I work in politics I would like to incorporate more human rights and social work/issues into my job. They have a larger course catalog so I have a lot of option and many do look interesting.

I like UF because it is said to be the best school in Florida. When I started getting serious about school and starting to do research on what to pick, I eventually learned a lot about the benefits that UF has. Even though I was working on a different major back then, UF became my dream school. They have more alumni who are currently working in government and Congress (which is something I would like to do). Although they have a smaller course catalog, they look really cool and interesting. My biggest issues are that they don't offer human rights classes for politic majors, just for law students. But, from the course descriptions of some classes, it looks like it would be something that would have to be discussed.

They're both great schools and they both look like they can offer me a lot. I'm slightly leaning towards FSU but I have a hard time saying no to UF.

I'll be posting this into both subreddits btw."
c2sodx,0,2019-06-20,Thinking of completing a second degree in CS. Need advice and what are your typical days?,croissantrainbow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c2sodx/thinking_of_completing_a_second_degree_in_cs_need/,"I have a Bachelor degree in business with \~4 years work experience and I'm thinking of taking a second bachelors degree in CS which would take \~2.5 years.  Work experience-wise, I've only worked on business teams: VBA/SQL developer focused on developing and maintaining a system for data quality checks; junior business analyst for an ecommerce order fulfillment project; and a project manager (current role). My project management role is also something I do not want to do; it's too much of herding people around and status updates which I find tiring.

Over the past month, I've done some reflection and I've noticed that I enjoy working with technology and technical teams to design and build solutions for the business.  I've been told by my former coworkers that I have a high technical aptitude.  Some of the things in my career that I've experienced so far which I found satisfaction doing:

* Working with business teams to understand their pain points about their manual processes involving data and then designing a solution for the problem
   * Conceptualize, design, and implement a solution using Python and a reporting/integration tool to take order data from an ecommerce system sent by email in a CSV file, process it, enrich it with data from the EDW and APIs, and dump it in a folder
   * Building VBScript macros to enable data in Excel to be populated in an AS400
* Performing data quality work on data output from systems including a master data management system
   * Finding ways to improve data quality
   * Designing a solution for new data quality check requirements requested by other teams
* Challenging/questioning technical architecture or solution
   * Being the advocate for the end-user and questioning how what is being proposed integrates with current processes and systems
* Test planning
   * Thinking of edge cases and seeing how the system reacts with those test cases
* Raise concerns or question our tech team on lack of control in the software development phase (e.g. acceptance criteria was changed by developer during development but we were not made aware)

&amp;#x200B;

Initially I was thinking of moving into software automation engineering as I would be able to automate processes and be able to plan testing.  However after talking with a couple friends who are software engineers, they mentioned that QA is moving back to the roles of SWEs in larger organizations so they challenged me to think more broader and the CS field as a career.  I have more interest towards backend engineering and data engineering roles as I don't care much for how the UI looks - I care more about the logic being implemented and like working with data.  I do like looking at the big picture, so I think some kind of architecture role would suit me in the long term but these roles typically require multiple years of experience in software engineering.

I've been lurking on r/cscareerquestions for the past few weeks to see if SWE will be a good fit for me as my next career.  This would then drive my decision to go back to school for CS.  I do have to book some coffee chats with SWEs in my area to get more insight but was hoping you may be able to help.  With this, I have some questions for you:

1. As you get more senior, you are involved in more software architecture discussions and meetings.  When you are  a junior, intern, or new grad, what % of your day at work is collaborating with other teammates including the product manager, business analyst, and client?  I like collaboration and interacting with others and don't want to be stuck at my desk the whole day. :)
2. I'm someone that likes variety in my work and problems in SWE will expose me to different problems.  Is it typical for junior engineers to work on different areas of a component of a product - or are they typically focused on a specific area within a component?
3. Will having a business background help me in SWE roles?  I'm trying to determine if my business background and experience will go to waste when it comes to job recruitment.
4. What is your job (e.g. SWE, DE, etc.) and your typical day like?  What is the % of time at work you spend interacting with others (excluding lunch)?

Thanks in advance!"

Context: Just finished my second year here, and after taking Math 32A/B, 33A my freshmen year, I did some exploring with another major but realized it wasn’t for me. I then completed Stats 100A this past spring quarter and am enrolled in Stats 20 this summer, so I’ll probably declare after completing it.

Looking at the stats major roadmap pdf, my pace seems fine, since I’d still be able to take 100B, 101A, 102A in winter 2020. Fall quarter I’d probably knock out other requirements because I will already have 100A and 20 completed.
However, I doubt most people in the major take this long to complete the program since they probably came in with calculus credits and started all those 3 stats upper-div sequences in their subsequent sophomore year. 

With that being said, I’m entering my junior year, the year everyone hypes up getting an internship because it’s a golden opportunity to convert it into a full time job. Last summer and this summer I’ve just been taking classes. As far as extracurriculars go, I’m not in any professional organizations or career related clubs, besides this sports analytics club (which is just a hobby of mine) where I write articles. I do have a linguistics minor completed but I doubt it would help with the employability of only a bachelor’s in statistics. I want to secure a job upon graduation (I’d be perfectly fine with a starting salary of 60/70k or above) and I feel heavily under-qualified for any sort of data analyst, finance-related internship since the only remotely relevant classes I have under my belt are Econ 1&amp;2, CS 31&amp;32, and my math/stats classes (100A, 32AB, 33A, 61) I’ve taken so far. 

I don’t have any room left to double major in econ. I also don’t have a clue about what other options or positions I could look into. To my understanding, data science internships are obtainable as an undergrad only if you’ve had a crap ton of prior experience and a loaded resume. The only thing I know for sure is I don’t want to do accounting, and that I do see myself getting a graduate degree in stats or data science (nothing too fancy in terms of the school, I’d probably be a part time student where a company provides tuition reimbursement) at some point in the future

Any relevant advice/feedback is appreciated!"

&amp;#x200B;

First, I apologize in advance if my english is a bit broken.

For starters, I'm a programming student, I'm starting my internship in a research unit that studies geographic data, specially data about streams and watersheds . 

So, I was asked to create a function in C that could perform a ""Stream Burning"". To put it in a nutshell, it is about taking a DEM and revise it by using a hydrological network that is correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

It brings my question, does it already exist ? By searching the GDAL wiki, I found gdal\_merge but I'm not sure it performs what I want to do. 

If you have any ideas, I would be glad to hear it, and also answer questions if I expressed myself wrongly."

I did just start a new Software Engineering internship on Monday (College intern? Report this damn college boy right now!!!) I have a double cubicle with another intern, though my desk and wall space in a lot slimmer for some reason (he has a large L desk vs my smaller straight desk). I haven't seen anyone else have a double cubicle like this (I'm not complaining about it, I really don't mind) I also sit about 10 feet directly in front of my manager and immediately to the left is a big conference room with 15+ people and a big window riiiight by my area. It's not like I'm nervous because I am certainly working, but sksjjdujdjdjd people.

I do NOT have any issue with my cube mate or boss. They're real cool, and I have NO issue with my current desk, other than lacking wall space for my constant paper hang ups I like to do (I'm already out of space with one white board and two diagrams that I've hung up)

Now, on just the other side of the cubicle there's a nice, spacious cubicle with a big L desk, plenty of wall space, lockable file cabinets, tons of storage in terms of desk drawers and shelves (probably 4 times the storage I have), and wall space for days. My manager had mentioned that it was his old abandoned cubicle and I could take whatever I needed from it, though all that is there are some random blank papers and maybe some pens. 

Now... Would it be weird to ask if I could move over to that cubicle? Again, I reiterate, I have NO issue with my cube mate or sitting right in front of my manager. But, big L desk, big floor space, and definitely abandoned. I have a laptop I work on, so it would take a good 5 minutes to swap work stations.

My manager is real cool and I'd like to ask, but I'm a bit worried a 21 year old intern asking to move to a more secluded desk away from my managers viewpoint would give the wrong idea. I was considering bringing up the extra wall space I'd get, as that is the only real complaint I could have about where I am now. Also I'm in the phone quite a bit and feel like I annoy my cube mate.

Any opinion?"
c2xi4k,2,2019-06-20,Is it normal at an internship to have no mentor?,TheHybridGamer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c2xi4k/is_it_normal_at_an_internship_to_have_no_mentor/,"So, I (and 3 other people) very recently got hired at my first internship for machine-learning, and, to my surprise, there is no one in the (relatively-small, 30-ish people) company that has their primary job as a machine-learning engineer. There is one fellow who supervises what we do, but he doesn't specialize in ML and has limited knowledge, so he can't give us feedback on what we can correct ourselves at.

They first gave us some small projects to do, but now they want to give us a bigger project that implies transferring old company code from a programming language to another.

My question is, are interns supposed to be taught what to do, or just be given projects that don't have that big of an impact on the company and should I stress myself out(because at the moment I've been working home aswell, mostly because of my lack of knowledge in the field), in order to fill my quotas.

c2xmym,4,2019-06-20,Internship Dilemma: Should I do Tax with Deloitte or Risk Assurance Services with PwC ?,Cybrid37,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/c2xmym/internship_dilemma_should_i_do_tax_with_deloitte/,"Hi all.

I'm a final year Accounting &amp; Finance student who will graduate sometime this year. Before I get my Degree though, I have to finish my Internship period as per the course requirements. Anyway, I'd really like some advice on what you guys think is the best course of action.

I've applied for Internships to each of the Big 4 and every other professional services firm available in my country. After getting through interviews, taking assessment tests, and being met with several rejections, I finally got an offer from PwC under Risk Assurance Services (RAS). Basically, the job I'll be doing under this internship is not so much related to accounting &amp; finance, as it is more akin to data collecting and data analyzing. I accepted the offer and was supposed to start sometime this week. However, my start date was postponed to a later period.

In this very week, I've received an offer from Deloitte for Tax Internship, which is something that I honestly really want to do. Out of all the subjects related to accounting &amp; finance, Tax is something that I'm pretty confident in, with Audit being a close second. This really tore me up, because I have already accepted the offer from PwC.

I've consulted with several people about this. Most told me to take the internship that has the most relevance to my course of study (which in this case is the Tax Internship). However, some of them also said that the internship is the time to try out what you really like. This got me thinking. Since I do plan on doing Tax in the long-run, is now the right time to try out the RAS internship with PwC ? I mean, its too early to pigeonhole myself as the tax guy anyway. Heard a lot of people say that once you're in tax, you're going to be stuck in tax.  Maybe it'd be better if I had experience in things other than tax as well just to keep my options open for when I eventually exit. For the time being, I only plan on staying for 3 - 5 years with the Big 4 and then leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional info:

The PwC Internship is shift based. Each shift is 7 hours. (6 am - 1 pm or 4 pm - 11 pm). You get 1 days off per week.

The Deloitte Internship follows your standard 9 to 5 working hour. You get days off on Saturdays and Sundays.

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies if the structuring is a bit scatter-brained...but thats how I feel right now...

I could really use some guidance on this one. Because no matter what I do, I still have to turn down one of the offers in the end. I just wanna make sure I dont make the wrong call."
c2y1nr,2,2019-06-20,How do I quit my terrible internship?,bighero23,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c2y1nr/how_do_i_quit_my_terrible_internship/,"TL;DR Took an unpaid internship position with a one-person firm. The working environment is depressing &amp; valueless, and my boss is very rude. I have no contract. What’s the best way for me to quit?

&amp;#x200B;

This turned into a bit of a rant and got really long. Just want to clarify that I am fully intending to quit. I want to know the best way to do that. My actual questions are in the last paragraph if you want to look directly there.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone. I'm a rising college senior majoring in Political Science and Communications. This past school year, I was going through a lot of personal struggles, and kind of dropped the ball on internship applications. In April, I finally got an offer to work as an unpaid intern for an executive recruitment firm specializing in marketing and communications. Since I was at school, I did the interview remotely, and at that point, everything seemed ok. I knew it wasn't the best, but I took it so I'd at least get some relevant work experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I began, I realized that the firm and the type of work I was doing was severely misrepresented by their online presence as well as by the principal. This 'company' is run by one woman. She has other partners (I don't even know what to call them), who all work remotely. The only other people onsite are the other unpaid interns. She depends on us to maintain her website, research potential candidates, and take care of anything remotely related to technology. It's basically doing tons of busy work (which I expected because that's what interns are often expected to do). Additionally, I have to commute on the train to get to the office, and she refused to cover the costs of transportation.

&amp;#x200B;

Since day 1, my overall experience has been extremely negative. My boss is on the older side, and seemingly has no sense of personal boundaries. She constantly touches my legs and arms, which I am extremely uncomfortable with (but there's no HR department I can turn to!) I have a work schedule in which I only come in on Mondays and Wednesdays. On my off days, she will constantly text, call, and email me on my off days with random ideas/tasks that pop into her head. She is extremely forgetful and disorganized. I have been reprimanded multiple times for failing to complete tasks she never assigned. She has been in business for 20-30 years, and is very set on doing things the way she's always done them. Everything we do is extremely inefficient, and suggestions for making things more streamlined are dismissed/ignored. I attended an industry conference with her a few weeks ago, and it's clear that her peers in the field do not have a high degree of professional respect for her. She’s lost multiple clients since I began working for her in mid-May. I could go on and on, but I think I’ve painted a pretty clear picture.

&amp;#x200B;

After I started working for her, I continued to apply for jobs/internships because I also need to make money this summer. I ended up getting an incredible last minute offer from a company very close to where I live. This internship is well-paid, much more relevant to my career interests, and I absolutely love the work that I am doing. I began working there almost right away on the days I wasn’t commuting to the recruiting job. My parents strongly encouraged me to continue to work at the recruiting firm because I made a commitment, and also for the experience/exposure. So I cut back to only working there one day a week. My boss wasn’t happy about it, but she needs the interns’ unpaid labor (she can’t afford to pay any actual employees), so she accepted it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, at this point, it’s almost painful to go to work there. The work that I do lacks any educational value or meaning. She is noticeably ruder to me than to the other interns. I lose out on the opportunity to work a full (paid!) 8 hours at my other internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to quit this job, but I don’t know the best way to go about doing that. I didn’t have any employment contract, and my end date was never firmly established. Do I need to do it in person or can I do it over email? Considering her attitude and demeanor, I would prefer to do it over email, but I don’t know if that’s unprofessional. I’m afraid she might get aggressive or confrontational if I do it in person. I’m not planning to ever use her as a reference, but I still don’t want to be rude. My next work day is supposed to be this upcoming Monday, but considering the cost/hassle of getting to the office, I’d really prefer not to have to go in and do it. Please let me know if you have any advice on how I can extricate myself from this terrible job. Thanks!"

But as I'm doing summer it's clear I'm not ok I'm preforming at half my capacity and like I'm fine in the sense that I'm not suicidal but I do have ptsd regarding my college campus. I'm doing summer to recover my GPA to 3.0 so I can retain my scholarships.

Now onto my question are there any fall internships I could apply to cus I need a break and wanna get away from college for a while. Sitting at home would drive me crazy, and my parents and I constantly argue as mental health is kinda a myth for them. Do companies care about what I went through? Because when i tried getting an internship at my university none of lab professors gave a fuck despite me having 3 years of natural Language processing experience and knowing sql and databases. I guess I want a change if anyone has advice and stuff. And yes I have therapist and everything is well documented"

My supervisor asked if I was interested in interning again for the summer (10 weeks), and I accepted (began summer internship about 3 weeks ago).

I was hopeful that this would lead to a full-time opportunity, but I have just been informed by my supervisor that there may not be a job open for me after the summer in my current department. They told me that it's dependent on the needs of senior management, so it's not a performance issue on my end. I assume that I will find out as the end of the 10 weeks approaches. For one thing, I will definitely finish out the 7 weeks I have left as an intern.

With that said, I looked around my company's job postings and found a couple of full-time roles that I am interested in. I am currently figuring out what would be the best strategy for myself to secure a full-time job within the company.

I am mostly concerned with the timing, since those full-time roles may not be available by the time I end this internship. Should I wait a few weeks to talk with my supervisor again, and try to schedule an informational interview with the other department heads? Talk to HR? Not so sure, just don't want to be unemployed haha.

Any thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated!"

How do I politely set my boundaries? I'd never had to do this before.

He basically touches my shoulders CONSTANTLY, when I try to leave sometimes he will try to retain me by holding my hand (which drives me furious). He'll also try to get close when we sit next to each other and I keep having to move around in an effort to back off.

The tutor was able to explain the project and walk through it with me. Tbh, the project seems way to advanced for my class. But I was able to get most of it done and now I understand what was being asked of me. I was on the right track but instead of having having what was supposed to be done in the class file.

I couldn't think of another subreddit to post this to, so this seemed like the best place to get some advice. 

After failing to obtain an internship after my second year at a relatively large state school, and failing to obtain a summer job around my home, I decided that I was going to devote at least 5 hours each day to learning to program better and work on a project of my own.

Currently I am planning on going through the UCornell CS4780 Course that was posted on youtube, but I am still wondering what type of projects I should work on other than those.

The majority of my programming experience comes from minecraft modding and course work, with some very basic unfinished projects thrown in. What I am looking for is some guidance on what I should focus on learning or what type of project I should build.

I have a relatively good foundation in C, C++ and Java, as well as having dabbled in Python, C# and the bare minimum of Javascript and CSS.

I generally gravitate towards gaming, racing or music in my free time, and I was wondering if any of those could turn into good projects.

Thanks!"

I'm a fair novice at programming but I thought this may be an opportunity to learn with an actual job task at hand. I have about 5 months or so to create this automated system.

I work at a fairly large postal processing plant as a processing engineering intern. In the plant, we have machines that process mail at a certain rate. Each machine runs or can run 24 hours a day and we can program it to sort the mail in certain plans. The plans are only for the local area. For example, imagine the plant is in New York and the mail is first received there from all over the US and then processed to send out to only cities and towns in New York. Each of this towns has its own plan number and these numbers are placed in half an hour blocks. 

To picture this, imagine you have 10 machines which you can divide in half an hour runs. So you run the plan for, say Rochester, for 5 hours. Then run another plan for Albany for 4 hours and then another plan after that on the same machine. The constraints are as follows:

1. Each plan has a separate minimum number of hours it needs to run. Albany may have more mailing needs than Rochester or vice versa.
2. After each plan, if you switch different locations, there's a sweeping time which must be added to clear up any other mail before you put the new plan.
3. There are separate cutoff times for each plan as the delivery needs to go out at specific times.

There may be other constraints but those are what I can think of. Anyway, the main thing I'm trying to do is to figure out a system which lets me create a combination which is optimized so that possibly all the machines are used efficiently and we can get rid of any machines that aren't needed. Currently there are many empty time gaps which the machines are laying idle and plans can be shifted between the machines. 

Think of it as a form of combination generator. You have maybe 25 plans which can go onto 10 machines a day. Each plan has a minimum number of hours to run. How would I go about creating a system which can create different combinations of plans based on these criteria? My first task is to actually create a plan manually and after that, to automate the process to a click. So say for example I need to reduce the number of hours in 2 plans but increase the hours in another 2, I can enter these parameters and have the program generate which plan goes where for me. 

Sorry for the long one, just wanted to know where to begin."

I'm so happy I could cry. It's raining but it might as well be beach weather for all my feels.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I live in Melbourne, Australia. Needless to say, compared to the US, CS careers are nowhere near as lucrative or as abundant here. While demand is still \*high\* compared to other industries, salary range for a graduate ranges from 45k on the lower end and 60k+ for those who top out or luck out. I have been a satanic follower of this sub for the last 6 months as I've been hunting for a software engineer/developer position after graduating from university.

&amp;#x200B;

About me. I graduated from one of the more reputable universities in Australia, part of what's known as the ""Group of 8"" here down under. In Finance. Yeah, nothing to do with CS. My whole life, I've never been motivated by anything except computers. I won awards in high school, I started building websites for my friends and family on Weebly and Wordpress. But I was an also flawed. I cared too much about what others thought of me, and I had expectations from my parents I desperately wanted to uphold, and to them - I was destined to be a great, high achieving son: a doctor or a banker. So I caved. I fooled my mind into that pathway while still in high school. Easy enough, except I had to go to university.

&amp;#x200B;

That's where everything crashed. I was soulless, unmotivated and empty. I had this fake crappy persona about me that lied to everyone about my marks, my ambitions - I looooved finance. It went pretty far. To everyone, I was a 4.0 student, president of a commerce society, with an internship done with a financial behemoth. In reality, I had a 2.5 gpa, was the president of a society I fooled myself into thinking I cared about and an internship where the only thing I developed were dark thoughts about my future. I was disgusted with myself and banking was the worst thing on the planet to me - I learned things that repulsed me ethically from ever wanting to be in that profession.

&amp;#x200B;

I leave university in Nov 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to my graduation (with zero offers lined up) and I walk across the stage to shake the hand of a man who presented me with a degree that I didn't want; a ticket to an industry I fucking hated. In the months that followed November, I struggled internally. I had to get out of this profession before I fooled myself into thinking that it was okay to stay - the money makes you comfortable. Cue stumbling across this sub and the one known as the Tech Lead, where I decided to fuck it all and gun for a career in CS, the only thing I had ever had a passion for.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am at ground zero. No relevant experience. No relevant degree, no qualifications. No money for a bootcamp. No knowledge of the industry. I have the skills of being able to sit in an office - and the ability to stream bullshit out of my mouth - a skill courtesy of the bullshittest industry ever. So with newfound motivation and fear, I started studying anyway. I busted out my old coding notes from when it was a hobby, refreshed my Java, learnt Ruby and Rails, SQL. 12 hours a day. I lived on ramen and fear itself. Studied more than I ever had in university. Brushed up (bullshitted) my resume as much as I could without outright committing fraud. HackerRank, Leetcode, Codewars - my best and only friends. Applying all the while.

&amp;#x200B;

And boy, did the rejections roll in. Each new email was a fresh reminder of my empty shell of being. I didn't even count them, but I had to buy a new mouse a few months in. I had to bum off my parents for money, which only increased my self loathing. I couldn't even get a part time job working as admin or at a supermarket - I was rejected by them too (actually not sure the reason for this one). Whirlpool (Australia's version of intern/grad forums) was my homepage. But every time I came back to this sub, I saw a new post from a graduate who struggled to have their patience rewarded but persisted until success. And that kept me going. Every time.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly, the phone calls came in, my coding challenges and tests spoke for themselves. And then, the interviews. one after the other. I couldn't even study all day anymore because I would be peppered with interviews. And finally, 6 months of struggle later, the light: offers. 5 of them. 50k, 50k, 55k, 55k.

&amp;#x200B;

The last one I received yesterday I had already dismissed, due to what I thought was ghosting. 60k. July start.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat in my car and cried. Thank you Reddit, for allowing the constant reposts from graduates saying they finally landed a job. Thank you for all the repeated advice, for all the unique problems and requests that kept me coming back to the sub for more motivation and solace that I was not alone. Thank you Tech Lead. I start a new story of my life now. No more lies, just bugs that I will both hate and enjoy fixing.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; No relevant qualifications or experience. Long study, no moneys. Now have moneys and can buy sandwiches instead of making them. Thanks to all reddit."

Long story short: some school hardships made me realize that I didn't love the programming enough for me to want to do it as a career and so I switched majors and got a degree in another field. 

Now I have this book and I'm moving out of my college apartment; I don't feel like taking it with me because I know I'll never read it and I hate to just throw it away so if someone here on their way up would like it, just DM me your address and it's yours if you're willing to pay the shipping.

I have only been coding for two years and have hardly coded outside of school work. I landed a sweet internship with a medium/large company. I really love the company, the culture, what I'm working on, etc. But I have absolutely no clue what it is going on. What makes this an even bigger obstacle, is there is only one person who can answer my questions with what I'm working on specifically and they in no way explain things to me in a way I understand, explain in detail or even in an organized fashion what needs to be done. The organization pattern is empty jira posts with titles and heres some files you need to copy to make this work, it's an api etc. It also doesn't help there is little to no documentation in the code I am supposed to re-use.

The person I can ask questions to is also somewhat rude. While I was working on something the other day, I apparently took too long and they wrote the program and told me to stop working on it. They also hardly make eye contact with me when speaking. To make things worse, there is another intern who is way better than me working on parts of the same project and is just blowing through everything they give them.

I have been trying to ask questions, but I am so lost an embarassed I don't know what to do or what to ask. I cried at work today and just feel extremely anxious for the time I'm there. I just want to learn and have a good experience, and all I feel is uncomfortable, lost, and overwhelmed. I love solving logical problems and love programming, but now I'm thinking about leaving this field behind.

At most, I just have basic knowledge of C, C++, and OOP from entry level courses.   Is this enough to make myself competitive for an entry-level emb. sys. job or do I really need to do more/pursue grad school?

c37pbs,2,2019-06-21,Technical Interview Fears,WinterDelta,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/c37pbs/technical_interview_fears/,"Cross posted but I think it’s more relevant in this sub. 

I had an interview a couple months ago for an engineering internship position. First time in a technical interview, and I couldn’t answer anything without the interviewer prompting me and giving me hints. 

I have a fear of being underprepared, and this made me really nervous. On top of that, the interviewer thought I lied on my resume because I wrote that I had taken a class (I did take it) and couldn’t answer his basic technical questions. 

Since then, I’ve been wary about applying for large companies and internships that seem highly technical/conceptual. 

Recently a friend offered to refer me to their company for a technical role. I plan to study up on the concepts I missed the first time so I’ll be ready this time, but I’m honestly scared the same thing is going to happen. 

If anyone has any experience or tips on how to handle this, I would greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: Graduated this past May with a CIS degree from a small college (Around 2300 students). After a good start academically and then a downward spiral, I finished with a 2.5 GPA. Did not achieve any certs either. I passed the 901 a month before graduation but did not take the 902. Did a 7-month internship at a local City Hall in January 2018. (Was tasked to assist switching city email over to office 365 and installing VoIP, but politics prevented that from happening. Ended up just assisting with email and calendar problems.) Afterward, I was hired on as a student worker for my university's IT department as a Computer Technician in August 2018. Our department has a total of 13 people that oversee the entire IT infrastructure on campus (2 front-desk reps, 1 programmer, 1 web developer, 1 Datatel, 8 IT/network services). Even though I only make minimum wage, I loved working here. Had a sit down with the IT Director before and after graduation. Before, we discussed the possibility of me working full time. After graduation, he stated that he really wanted me to work full-time but was currently did not have any openings. So, after applying to 15 different jobs, 2 interviews, and 1 interest email, I finally accepted a job offer as an IT Technician IV from the top college in the state (About 40,000 students). Awesome benefits and great pay!

c39r9c,83,2019-06-21,"Today is one of those days where I'm just fucking sick of having ADHD. It's so exhausting to know that no matter what I achieve, everything is just always going to be so god damn hard.",thelittlestars,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/c39r9c/today_is_one_of_those_days_where_im_just_fucking/,"One of the most frustrating aspects of my ADHD is that it goes hand in hand with a weird brand of perfectionism. I would rather hand in an essay 5 days late that I feel is somewhat decent than just say fuck it and slap together something random. No matter what I do people are always going to be able to figure out that I'm a bit of a mess/unorganized/unreliable, but its like as long as they think I'm smart I can still be okay with myself.

I've written about a hundred essays studying History &amp; Politics in undergrad. The majority of which I wrote over the course of \~48 hours typically at least a few days AFTER they were due, and the majority of which I've ultimately been happy with in terms of writing/research. I've had essays receive High Distinctions and then be deducted 30 marks for lateness. It's fucking stupid. I beat myself up about it for years and then in 2017 - while I was writing my Honours thesis - I was diagnosed with ADHD at 22. I've been so much happier not spending half of my life hating myself for something that feels out of my control.

But then I started a Masters this semester (Aussie semesters), and its all coming flooding back to me. Because even though I'm on medication, and even though my tutors have accommodated me somewhat with extensions and stuff, I'm still handing everything in late and struggling to keep up. Assignments were taking me longer than they used to because instead of writing essays I'm writing different types of documents. So now I'm spending hours perfecting the formatting, only for the tutor to tell me after the fact that the template he said we 'may' want to use is really the only acceptable one and so I lose 5 points. And it shouldn't bother me that much, because its got nothing to do with my intelligence, I just take criticism SO PERSONALLY.

The ONE essay I did have to do this semester, I submitted yesterday (a week late). I've been working on it consistently for the past 4 days or so. I thought it was the one thing I could be confident about. I got 21/40 marks. Its the worst mark I've gotten over my whole academic career without actually failing the class. The tutor said it ""reads as a series of loosely related statements on the chosen question and the cited references. It's not as bad as a set of notes or perhaps the beginnings of a literature review, but it's not an essay in the formal structure we went over in class\*.  You write very well and have a sound understanding of the issues, but this is a skill that you need to practice and develop.""

\*which I missed, because I was trying to finish another late assignment. And also... I know (or thought I know) how to write an essay.

He even sent me links to the library help pages for 'how to write an essay'. HOW DO YOU WRITE AN 18,000 WORD HONOURS THESIS AND ABOUT 100 OTHER ESSAYS FOR 5 YEARS AND THEN HAVE A TUTOR TELL YOU ESSAY WRITING IS A SKILL YOU MAY WANT TO 'PRACTICE AND DEVELOP'?

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm bragging or something. I shouldn't be proud of the fact that I did well on assignments that were handed in so late but for so long its all I had to hold onto for self-esteem. The fact that I seemed to write essays so naturally felt like a given so I'm fundamentally disappointed in myself.

On another note, I was really upset by the way the tutor ended his feedback. I know he was trying to be kind and helpful but I'm hoping those of you with ADHD will understand why it got to me (bear in mind he is aware that I am registered with disability services and may need accommodations with extensions/absences, and attendance is not compulsory). He said ""In your future subjects do try to attend more consistently, **you'll find life is much simpler if you just give yourself enough time to prepare** and do the required tasks properly. I hope you got something out of the course. All the best with the remainder of your degree.""

All I have to do is give myself more time to prepare? Why didn't I think of that?!? /s

Anyway sorry for the ramble. I also found out earlier that I didn't get an internship I interviewed for last week. I'm just reallyyyyy leaning into the wallowing tonight here folks.

ETA - I'm also not sure if the 21/40 was marked down for lateness, or whether that was my initial mark and he just waived the late penalty. But I also am afraid to find out tbh.

ETA 2 - I sucked it up and emailed my teacher, turns out the original mark was 29/40 and it was marked down for lateness. But he did really go in on me in his feedback and now the cycle is just destined to repeat itself (of course I’ll try to do better though). I would delete this post but is pretty demonstrative of my ADHD struggles tbh. I’ve seen people talk about perfectionism in regards to RSD before so hopefully some of you can relate!

ETA 3 - and of course any relief I was feeling was immediately dashed by my (well meaning but disappointed) parents who “thought I didn’t do this type of thing anymore” and telling me I need to develop “strategies” as if I haven’t tried to do that for years and this whole thing isn’t a constantly ebbing and flowing cycle."

What are some helpful software applications that can maybe help me automate?  


General tips?  


Anything I can implement that would look amazing to the company? Or to my boss when he gets back?   


Again, i know it's vague but I just want some out of the box thinking from some more experienced perspectives.  


I am also in charge of purchasing for my department, and as long as it's useful my company generally has no problem spending some money. If that helps.

I have lived in the NYC area for most of my life. I left for 4 years to go to college in the DMV area and earn my BBA. I felt the most myself during this time. I was able to met so many great friends and people. I still am close with all of them years later. Coming back seemed almost like a jail sentence. While this city is unique I just don't think its right for me. The fast paced lifestyle, tremendous cost of living, high competition and the choice of (Finance, Media or startup) leave me wanting to pull my hair out. 

I completed 3 college internships and went down the media route post college knowing I probably did not want to this, but needed to work. I tried to breakaway from it after 2 years and also tried to find a way to move. I was unsuccessful and wound up back right back where I started just at another media company and then got caught in a layoff. I have great experience and have obtained a good amount of transferable skills. 

It seems like you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning then finding a job that isn't media or a startup in NYC. Don't get me wrong I get this is a great path of some people. I personally find the media / startup worlds intolerable and phony. It seems like many startups are services that already exist in an oversaturated market or that are just plain bad ideas. (The application process is also ridiculous, reaching out and applying to countless people/listings only to get ghosted or not even be considered to positions you are qualified for.)

The internship part of my degree program often gives job offers for after students finish their degree. I have decided not to return if they offer me something due to various personal reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the company. I have started to look elsewhere for careers after I graduated, namely game studios.

Here lies my problem: I have very limited experience with game development. I have done loads of game design (in Dungeons and Dragons notably, but in other formats as well), but have finished nothing in the realm of game development. I’ve messed around a little bit with Unreal Engine and Unity but nothing too serious and, as I mentioned, no finished products came out of it.

My work has some sort of vague rules about side projects with respect to making video games so I’ve decided not to touch it until after I’m done with my internship next month. Will one year be enough time to develop enough games to build a sizable portfolio for game studios to consider hiring me? If so, how would I even start that process?

Now on to bad stuff .

Second semester I was medically recovering and pursuing a rape case at the same time all while taking 17 credits per semester. My GPA is a 2.774 which is a trash GPA .Now I've pushed through all this drama despite professors telling me drop their class and just medically withdraw because frankly I love computer science . I genuinely do with all my heart. But as I'm doing summer it's clear I'm not ok I'm preforming at half my capacity and like I'm fine in the sense that I'm not suicidal but I do have ptsd regarding my college campus. I'm doing summer to recover my GPA to 3.0 so I can retain my scholarships.

Now onto my question are there any fall internships I could apply to cus I need a break and wanna get away from college for a while. Sitting at home would drive me crazy, and my parents and I constantly argue as mental health is kinda a myth for them. Do companies care about what I went through?

When/how should I ask?",520ErryDay,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c3djew/contract_is_ending_going_back_to_school_i_want_to/,"TL;DR I am working for a tech consulting company, the local contract is ending soon and everyone is looking for new placements. I want to return to school to finish my BS. How should I communicate with the company that I want to try to work part time while I am finishing my degree? Is it as straightforward as just telling them now?

So I'm in a really strange situation. Let me start from the beginning.

I graduated with a bachelor of music education degree from the local college. I decided I wanted to go into technology, so I went back to pursue a second bachelor of science in computer science.

After my first three semesters, I secured a business analyst internship. Not exactly what I wanted to do, but I thought it could be fulfilling. After the summer ended, they offered me a full time position with benefits. I accepted. It got to the point where I was beginning to be unhappy after another 8 months, and I was contacted by a recruiter for a global consulting company that is working on a local high profile contract. This was a better job with better pay and better career opportunities, so I accepted.

Well, the contract was cancelled one week after I accepted the new offer and put in my resignation at my old job. Old job was upset with me for leaving so they wouldn't let me retract my resignation. Now I am working on this contract and no one will teach me anything because we are transitioning everything back to the client. My manager said he will help me look for another position in the company, but that will likely require relocation.

I decided I want to return to school and finish my degree so I can get the more technical job that I always wanted. It would be nice to keep working with this company, but part time while I am in school. How should I communicate this with the company? I am afraid that if I tell them too early that I intend to return to school that they will let me go early and I won't make any money this summer. I am not contributing to this project very much at all and I am using this as an opportunity to build my skill set while making some good money.

Maybe I am overthinking this and I should just tell them my intentions now.  What do you think?"

I have received incredibly positive feedback from my manager and everyone on my team about my performance. I fit in great with the culture and have even made a couple work-friends. However, in my team of 10 other software engineers and 2 lead engineers, I can't seem to get an opportunity to level up. I've progressively taken on more challenging tickets, but I can't seem to land a project that I can have responsibility and ownership over, and prove that I have planning and architecting skills.

Over the last three months, I have repeatedly tried to schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss the future of my role at the company. I want to talk to him about my career goals and what sort of projects I can tackle for the company to get there. He has evaded and apologized every time, and never tried to reschedule with me.

I would love to become a senior software engineer, having 1 year as an intern and 4 years of experience at mid-level, but among the gossip from co-workers I've heard that there isn't much vertical movement. At the least , I would like to earn a salary raise beyond 2% for inflation. I'm getting the sense that my manager and structure of the team are preventing me from taking on bigger projects and being able to bring ""I did this amazing thing, which increased profits and code quality by x, can I have a raise?"" to the table.

Instead I've spent this extra energy on some side projects and taking online coding courses. It kind of helps, but I keep feeling like I'm more capable of what my day-job requires of me.

Is this a big sign that I need to start looking around? Or just chill and hope that someone leaves in the next couple years?"

I am a 20 year old university student currently working as part of a team that does .NET MVC5 web and mobile development for the University. I have been working here for almost 7 months now, and work part time during the school year and full time over the summer. I love my job; my coworkers are great, I have flexible hours and an awesome and understanding manager, and I’ve learned SO MUCH and gained great experience here. My only issue with the job is that the pay is very low ($12.50/hr, for reference the QDoba down the street from my house has the same starting salary....). This isn’t a huge issue to me as I am gaining such valuable experience, but I still feel very underpaid considering I do relatively the same work as the full time members that make much, much more. This low pay has made me consider searching for other jobs at the end of my contractual agreement (May 2020), even though I will still be in school. 

I would like to try to negotiate for a raise, but don’t know if I am even in the right to do this. I understand that since I work for the university, my manager probably has his hands tied, but I found the original job listing and it said the pay was $12-$15/hr. I would have no issue with $15/hr or a pay rate close to that, it’s just that $12.50 seems SO LOW when My friends are making ~20$+ in their CS &amp; engineering internships, and I turned down an opportunity that was more general IT / sysadmin work that would pay $16.50/hr because I thought this job would be much better experience (which I believe it has 100%).

Am I in the right to even try to negotiate my salary? I do not know what the other two student developers who have been working here make, and I don’t think it would be right for me to get a raise and make more than them. But I also think that I am definitely underpaid for the work that I do, and the low pay is really hurting me at the moment (starting to donate plasma just to be able to afford living in my university hometown over the summer....).

Does anybody have any thoughts on how to negotiate a better salary, or if I should even try? Any input would be appreciated, as I am basically 100% in the dark on how to negotiate a better salary.

Thanks!"

c3ered,0,2019-06-21,Problems with office politics.,MasqueradeOfSilence,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c3ered/problems_with_office_politics/,"Hey everyone. I just graduated with my BS in computer science and a minor in math. I was a decent student, not a great one, finishing with a 3.65 GPA due to some issues with major depression that absolutely tanked my grades during certain semesters. I’m planning on going to grad school to get an MS in a year, so I just decided to take the offer that the company I interned with last summer gave me. That way I could get some real world experience and save up money. 

The employee line-up has changed somewhat. I have gotten along very well with the new employees. I feel like I’ve been doing a pretty decent job, getting to know the codebase, improving their unit tests, and helping out other developers with bugs. 

However, a lot of the old employees that I knew beforehand didn’t seem as friendly as they used to be. I chalked it up to my imagination and ignored it. 

But it wasn’t my imagination. No, word has gotten around that my intern project (a tool that I made last summer) didn’t compile properly, so they had to spend a bunch of time fixing it before they could use it. This makes no sense, because I presented that thing to management at the end of my internship, and it definitely compiled and did everything it was supposed to do...But I’ve had multiple people tell me that it didn’t work, and I’ve been getting teased/harassed about it. Our PO told me that he was surprised that I got rehired, because I submitted broken code. I did not willingly submit broken code, and I’m extremely confused as to how that happened — especially because I haven’t touched that code in a year, and it worked perfectly fine when I pushed it to the repo. I was an intern and given very little guidance on how to proceed, so I had to figure out a lot of stuff myself. And why did they rehire me if they didn’t think I was any good?

Psychologically, this is really messing with my head and my work. I already have insecurity due to my inconsistent academic performance, and now I’m dealing with this bullcrap. I was already planning on quitting a few months before the end of next summer, so I could attend grad school. But now I want to quit right now — I can’t though because I really need the money and I’ve heard it’ll look bad on my resume if I quit considering I’ve only been here for a month. 

And it’s not like everyone dislikes me, just a few very vocal people. 

How should I handle this situation? I feel like I have to avoid certain people at all costs to avoid getting harassed. I was very happy for the first few weeks, but ever since this started I just feel sick and honestly kind of resentful. I am pretty bad with social situations so I have been just trying to laugh and say “well, I worked when I submitted it...” Should I just push through the next year and bite the bullet, then peace out? Or look for employment elsewhere? I feel like that’s an extreme option but I don’t know. If I push through it how can I mitigate further embarrassment? Thanks."

c3fzj2,409,2019-06-21,The case for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,alt0002_rpi,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c3fzj2/the_case_for_rensselaer_polytechnic_institute/,"Hi! I am a current student at RPI, and was somewhat irked by the post that was made in here roughly a year ago. I was perturbed by what I perceive to be an unfair portrayal of a university that I love very dearly, and as such I have decided to tell all of you why RPI might be the right school for you, contrary to what seems to be the favorite opinion here.

# The administration

My biggest responsibility here is to shed light on the struggle between the students and the administration, which is so defining in RPI’s public image among applicants nowadays. President Shirley Ann Jackson has been in charge of the Institute now for almost 20 full years (exactly 20 in July) – in that time she has done a lot, clearly not without criticism. Much of this criticism is valid and deserves to be heard; RPI has increased its debt load, restricted various student freedoms, and made various poor decisions here and there that do not reflect well upon its management. However, the argument with which you were presented with last application season insisted that these issues, in the form they took at RPI, had more of an effect on our students than at universities of a comparable caliber. This is simply false. [Freedom of speech against school administrations](https://www.aclu.org/other/speech-campus) (note: not political free speech, RPI has a fabulous reputation in that vein; it has a thriving and open political scene and even its own DSA branch) is an issue that is universally agreed upon to be important, and schools across the country are restricting student rights. That being said, articles like [this](https://poly.rpi.edu/2016/04/13/rounds_instructs_poster_removal/) wildly mischaracterize the situation via omission of context. One of the most recent of the poster takedown controversies involved posters featuring President Jackson dressed in North Korean military attire. While this remains unacceptable, it is far from [the most egregious](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/4/5/le-harvard-free-speech/) of free speech violations that take place on [campuses across the US](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/) (excuse the tu quoque). Overall, it is reasonable to say that in my experience, quarrels between students and the administration have little impact on the livelihood of students, to the point that many (at least of those who do not spend copious quantities of time on the school subreddit) are not even aware of some of the actions taken by admin that others find offensive.

# Academics

This is one of the two biggest draw factors for RPI, in my opinion. As someone who was active in this subreddit while I was applying to colleges, I am well aware of the persistent, if since steadily more mild, elitist attitude some readers here take towards rankings. RPI’s rankings are, frankly, not as good as they could be (see: [49th in US for 2019 according to USNWR](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rpi-2803)). However, one might argue that they significantly undersell the school’s academic quality due to the heavy weighting of other factors, especially ones that have been most affected by the school's management, that do not reflect sheer rigor. Academic rigor is hard to quantify, but several indicators show RPI far ahead of similarly ranked schools, including:

* Selectivity indexes (measurements of the stats of average students attending a university, such as SAT and High School GPA), where RPI comes in ahead, in some cases far ahead, [of schools like Northeastern, Colorado School of Mines, Georgia Tech, and Boston University](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/04/business/economy/economix-selectivity-table.html)
* Average salaries ([where RPI comes in #30](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors/page/2)), meaning significant investments in tuition can be worth it (despite the fact that most students receive substantial financial aid)
* Individual program rankings, done qualitatively and not looking exclusively at less relevant numerical factors like subject retention rates and sheer number of degrees awarded, often favor RPI:
   * Nuclear Engineering:
      * [USNWR at #18](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/nuclear-engineering-rankings)
      * [Collegechoice at #17](https://www.collegechoice.net/rankings/best-nuclear-engineering-degrees/)
   * Computer Science:
      * [Niche at #21](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges-for-computer-science/)
   * Physics:
      * [college factual at #6](https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/rensselaer-polytechnic-institute/academic-life/academic-majors/physical-sciences/physics/)
      * [Niche at #28](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges-for-physics/)
   * Information technology &amp; web science:
      * [Niche at #3](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges-for-information-technology/)
   * Mechanical engineering:
      * [Collegefactual at #7](https://www.collegefactual.com/majors/engineering/me-mechanical-engineering/rankings/top-ranked/#abs7)
   * Et cetera. I could go on, but you have google and you get the point.
* Research quantifications. [RPI is one of 131 universities to be of the highest tiered ranking in research activity according to the Carnegie Classification.](http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/srp.php?clq=%7B""basic2005_ids""%3A""15""%7D&amp;start_page=standard.php&amp;backurl=standard.php&amp;limit=0,50)

Additionally, my own experience here is relevant. I have taken STEM courses at all different tiers of Universities (T10 on USNWR, RPI, state schools that aren’t even ranked) and can add from personal experience that there isn’t a huge difference between STEM classes at a school like RPI and a school like, say, Duke. RPI was a safety school for me (though looking back that was probably naïve), but I ended up choosing it over several target schools and I am very happy I did so. Don’t fall into the trap of believing acceptance rate is the only thing that dictates the quality of a school, as it is so easy to do.

# Remarks on the Arch

If you are going to apply to RPI, you ought to know what the arch is. I’ll leave you to research that yourself, but know that this is the first year it’s been implemented at scale, and as such many of the problems you will read about in r/rpi are problems that the school will likely have a much better handle on next year and the years following. A friend of mine currently going through the arch asked me to note that “\[it\] is not the worst idea,” and that they appreciate the fact that “having a long internship or co-op on your resume shows much more than a few weeks long \[summer\] internship.” If you are applying to the class of 2024, you will be a part of the fourth full arch semester, meaning RPI will have had 3 years out to work out various logistical issues that it found problematic this first summer. I should also note that in many departments, the available research positions exceed the quantity demanded as a result of the Arch, and so it is easy to get an internal research internship if you know where to look. However, internships are not guaranteed yet as they are in similar programs (see: Drexel), but that is something we may (hopefully) see in the coming years, since this is one of the primary criticisms most students have of the program.

# Student life

Even more so than academics, this is my favorite quality of Rensselaer. The student community here is a rare bastion of acceptance and mutual respect. The author of the other post (you know which one I’m talking about by now) went so far as to concede that the atmosphere on campus was “refreshing” and had “almost a pre-9/11 feel.” In a unique way, RPI has rich political engagement, but people will not hold your views against you. It is very easy to find yourself friends with someone who lives in a completely different reality, and in a way I’ve never seen before, people are enthusiastic to appreciate others’ experiences. As such, the LGBTQ+ community thrives here, as well as the most defining feature of our school’s populace, that being the geek culture; there are probably more Dungeons and Dragons groups on campus than students. Everyone here is into STEM. Walking down the sidewalks, you hear less about good novels (not to say people don't read them) and more about differential equations and engineering projects. It feels so truly euphoric as a STEM major to be surrounded by people who share your passion for the sciences in the fullest. The campus community is also home to a lot of niche interests (we have our very own annual furry/anime convention, for better or worse), and is happy to take you for who you are. If you are the right kind of person, you will thrive socially here. That being said, I recognize the fact that it is not for everyone. If you are not into STEM, be prepared to not have that not be a shared interest with a grand majority of the population. If you are really into giant raves, don’t come here. The party scene at RPI is very saturated, but our idea of partying leans more towards drinks and board games with less than a dozen friends than pulsing strobe lights and bass-boosted dance parties.

The last review of Troy you read was a review of a Troy experienced several years ago. Over the past decade or so, Troy has been rapidly recovering from the great recession, and it has made long strides in doing so. Troy is a cute town on the Hudson with an active community and plenty of events. It is a fundamentally different experience from living in a city, but it is charming nonetheless. I find myself downtown nearly every weekend; it is a lovely place to study and spend free time.

# Concessions

RPI is not perfect. I don’t want to give off the impression that I think it is; nor do I want to demean the experiences of others who haven't have had as great a time at RPI as I have. I just want to take this opportunity to get the school the critical positive exposure it needs for some people and spread my lesser-heard perspective, which is exactly as valid as the one you heard last fall. I was very uneasy when I made my enrollment deposit to RPI as a result of attitudes on r/rpi, and I am relieved that I did not back out due to that first online impression. I implore any prospective students to visit campus and talk to students *in real life* about what going here is like; I assure you that the opinions that have been expressed online are not an accurate representation of the general undergraduate population. Assurances from a satisfied RPI student are what did it for me, and I hope I can play that role for some of you as well.

RPI is not for everyone. There are plenty of people that will not enjoy RPI, and plenty more who will not succeed here, if they attend. However, there are some people like myself who are significantly better off at RPI than they would be elsewhere, and I hope you will stop to consider whether or not you are one of those people.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Do your own research, and don’t so quickly adopt the opinion of people on the internet (including me!); think for yourself and form your own opinion about *all the schools you apply to*.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened on Christmas Day 2015 and I was reminded of it by another recent TIFU post. My older brother was finishing an internship in Colorado and flew in from Denver the night before for the holidays. A little background, though I was in college at the time, I never really smoked. Up until that point, the only time I had tried smoking was with my brother on my birthday a few months back, so he decided to bring home a surprise for me.

Christmas morning was uneventful- we unwrapped presents and ate a late brunch. My brother had ironically given me a self help book to try to be funny, and I was pretty annoyed because I had given him a really nice bottle of bourbon. When my parents went into the kitchen to start cleaning up dishes, he pulled me into his room and quietly pulled a couple bags of chocolate and gummies out of his luggage. At first I failed to realize these were edibles and thought he was just giving me some extra snacks he had from the plane ride out of guilt.

""Merry Christmas. Eat a few pieces of this bar and enjoy."" I was overly excited that my brother thought I was worthy enough to try his chocolate, so I mindlessly ate half the bar. The kicker? This was only my second time ever experiencing weed compared to my brother who was a regular user, and it turns out the bar had 100 mg of THC so I just unknowingly consumed 50 mg. Little did I know I was in for a roller coaster ride dwarfing anything at Six Flags. 

My parents had finished cleaning in the kitchen and we decided to gather around and watch the new Minions movie, which looking back was probably the worst choice. Everything started off just fine, but about 10 minutes in it hit me like a stoner train. At first I noticed my vision was starting to get blurry, and it felt like I was swimming underwater. The Minions started to look like little yellow demons, and their laughs could have been from Satan himself. As my brother was enamored with all of the colors and fun animations, I watched in horror as Gru morphed into some sort of kid-friendly humanoid. I told my brother I couldn't stop vibrating, and it felt like I was in one of those massage chairs at Sharper Image. He told me to just chill out and watch the movie. 

The vibrations quickly turned to shaking, and in my panic I ran into my bedroom to try to go to sleep. My mom started to realize something was wrong and pulled my brother into the kitchen to interrogate him. A few minutes later I was stumbling around the house, and everything looked like a strobe light. I was in full blown panic mode, and my heart was racing and hammering on my chest. I was convinced my heart was going to explode, and was trying to get my mom to call 911. Luckily shes a nurse and knew I didn't need an ambulance, but if you've ever been too high you've experienced sheer paranoia and I was convinced my mom and brother were conspiring against me. I ran out the back door and started retching as hard as I could, desperately trying to purge the chocolate from my body like an exorcist. Mind you, it was a sunny day in Texas and my neighbors were enjoying time outdoors. They watched in horror as I puked multiple times, each time screeching like a bat out of hell trying to get everything out. By the 5th or so time, I felt I could do no more and retreated to the couch, and that's when I thankfully fell asleep clutching a stuffed penguin like a small child. 

I woke up 5-6 hours later, and when my mom noticed I was awake, she just looked at me and said ""such a drama queen"". Turns out while I was sleeping she had tried some of the chocolate and had a wonderful, relaxing experience and was now cooking dinner. The real kicker was when my dad, an extremely conservative guy full of blissful ignorance, came over to feel my head because he thought I had a fever. ""Buddy, you must have the flu! I didn't know it could hit you so quickly."" To this day, 3.5 years later, he still thinks I had the flu which magically lasted only a few hours. That's the miracle of Christmas, I guess. It also took 6 months before I could confidently eat chocolate again without any panic.

**TL;DR** my older brother thought Christmas day was the best time for me to try edibles. I got higher than the International Space Station and had a massive panic attack. Dad thought I had the flu."

Hey everyone, I am going to start an internship next week and they just emailed us about some of the tasks we will be doing, and the first one I am assigned is ""Perl to .net migration"" and I have spent some time learning Perl, and understanding the basics of .net framework but whenever I try to learn about how to go about migrating perl to .net all I find are results about people looking for automated tools and nobody really talks about how to go about doing it. So I was wondering if anyone knew of any resources that I could learn from, or even had any idea why we would be doing this task at a higher level so I can understand why it is important to be doing this migration in the first place. I know I can just ask my manager and they will teach us all this when we start, but knowing a bit before I start will make me feel more confident.

I have heard how Data Structures &amp; Algorithms is one of the most important classes I will take as a Software Engineering major. I would like to take this class as soon as I can if it is as helpful as people say it is, so I can get a few steps closer to getting an internship somewhere next summer. However in order to take this class by Spring Semester, I would need to take Integral Calculus at Richland for a month this summer. I currently have a spot in the Math class, I just need to pay for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would consider programming to be my strong suit, and I have a pretty good understanding of C++ through Jason Smiths 1337 CS Class. I have used Java and Python in the past, but I would need to brush up on the languages given I haven't used them in a long time.  

&amp;#x200B;

Before I commit myself to fast-tracking my way to Data Structures, I would like to know just how influential the knowledge from the class would be in helping me get an internship somewhere. I am not keen on taking a 4-week calculus class and a 4-week discrete math retake class at the same time. However, if the Data Structures Class could be the ticket to getting a job, I will do what I need to do to get there."

I'm a film production student that got an internship with someone last week through my school. It seemed like a super relaxed internship where me and another student from my university would be helping her film and edit episodes of a show she wanted to create about some health issues she's had in the past. Some things you should probably know: I'm a girl. I'm in my late 20's but I look VERY young (definitely look like I'm under 18. I often get comments about how I look 16). I have been sexually assaulted in the past so I'm also very uncomfortable with people touching me and make it very clear that I do NOT like being touched.

&amp;#x200B;

I met with her (alone) last week and she seemed...Strange but nothing I couldn't handle. She kept telling me how pretty I was and I just thought of it as her being nice so no big deal. But then she started drinking a beer (after she had told me she used to be an alcoholic) and then she asked me to go to her garage where she closed the garage door and started smoking weed. Now I don't care if you do that, whatever. But I was an hour away from home in a very small enclosed space with someone I had JUST met and I was about to drive back. Not exactly what I wanted to have happen. I panicked a little bit but played it as cool as possible and, trying to be optimistic, I thought ""maybe she won't be as weird once the other student is there with me"" so I waited until yesterday's meeting to see how things were.

When I got there she immediately came up and hugged me and made a comment about my chest and told me how soft it was and how she liked feeling it pressed up against her. I was immediately uncomfortable. The other student could tell I was uncomfortable. So we go inside and she's talking to us about what she wanted us to do and all of a sudden she starts rubbing my back, my shoulders, my hair. I know I should have said something then but I was, honest to god, absolutely terrified at that moment and just stiffened up and tried my best to not lose my mind. She had us transcribe the lyrics for her theme song (which she openly admitted was a rip-off of a Gorillaz song. Same beat, everything) and then had the other student (a guy) start moving some of her stuff around. She kept yelling at him that he was picking stuff up in the wrong order and every time he'd turn around she'd look at me and make a face. Then she asked me if, since I'm Mexican, if I have a lot of junk cars in my yard ""like most Mexicans do.""

The entire time this was going on she was keeping her hand on my arm. After that she started talking about how the TSA stole her pills and how one of them she takes is like cocaine ""but not like the good stuff from the 60's."" All of this was followed by her going through a cycle of laughing, sobbing, yelling, and then just getting up and wandering around mumbling to herself while pulling up the legs of her shorts so high that we both saw far more of this woman than we ever wanted to.

So, finally, the other guy said he had to go pick up his kid and she started begging me to stay by myself for a little while. There was no way I was doing that, not at all. Before she let him leave, though, she made him go get her beer and kept offering me some despite telling her I don't drink for personal reasons. When we finally get up to leave she keeps her hand on my arm and follows me to my car. I sort of pull away and get in my car and leave and ended up going to Target and was sobbing in the toy aisle in front of Toy Story toys so it wasn't a good time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to quit. I know what I'm going to say to her when I quit but there are a few things I'm unsure of.

1. Genuinely terrified she is going to do something to me. She's admitted that she's done it to people before. Within the first 5 minutes of me knowing her she tells me she steals stuff all the time and has hurt people before.
2. What should I do in regards to letting the school know? I don't want someone else going through with this but I also don't want anything coming back on me because of me. I'm torn between keeping myself safe but I want to keep other people safe too and I don't even know who I would contact at the school. Probably someone at the film department?

tl;dr: Got an internship, lady was touching me inappropriately, drank alcohol during internship, smoked weed, and was highly unprofessional. Scared of her and not sure what to do."

But fuck it.

I graduated a bootcamp a while ago, I wasn't the best coder but wasn't horrible either. I had trouble getting interviews and finding a job. Eventually I found a gig that wasn't programming but was in the industry and figured why not? It's still somewhat tech related and I'll get some income. I stuck it out there for a while, and after sometime I managed to land a programming internship through a referral.

That first internship was a pretty bad experience, horrible culture, not much training and I was one of 3 developers. It seemed like they were looking for cheap labor. Anyway, I didn't perform well enough to get hired. Imposter syndrome and the feeling of not being cut out for coding started to grow. 

I was able to get back to my old job and fast forward for about 9 months, I got another internship. This was a pretty great experience and I learned tons. I thought I did well but I did not get the offer, _again_.  It seems like almost all my friends from bootcamp landed software engineering jobs and I'm the last one left behind.

At this point, I'm really considering giving up and looking into other career paths. My gut just tells me I'm not cut out for coding, and although I do enjoy it a lot and just _really_ wish I was amazing at it. I don't know if I'll be good enough. I really don't know.

I feel like I learned the complete basics during my first month (for example, to write down everything I need to do – otherwise, I'll forget it), but it was already one month too late. As you can imagine, I make a lot of mistakes. A lot of them. The colleague I'm supposed to help told me recently I can't make any more mistakes, I've reached the limit. Because of all those problems, people at the office don't really like me (and I've never had people skills). I started to have bad anxiety concerning this job. It's Saturday, yet I'm afraid to go to this job on Monday. I feel like I'm too stupid for it and I have impostor syndrome. But on the other hand, I like what I'm doing there and it's really important for my career. There's no other similar place to work in my city. I know 7 weeks is not much time but the mistakes I make are all so dumb and the others expect me to make no mistakes at this point. So my question is, should I resign?

I live in Western USA. Around August 2017, my brother and I were planning to fly out of state to meet a friend in their hometown, to see the total solar eclipse there (we’d never seen one before).  On the night before the flight, I stayed up late doing a project that tbh wasn’t THAT important. However it made me groggy enough the next morning to decide not to go, so my brother flew alone.

After a few days, I watch the eclipse happening on livestream, and I hear how the event is so “life-changing”, “once in a lifetime”, “you-had-to-be-there-to-understand-it”, and so on. I start to feel so much regret for not pushing through the sleep deprivation and going. Especially after realizing the next eclipse in USA wouldn’t be for 7 more years. I promised to myself to go to the next one I could.

Fast forward to a few months ago, when I realized the eclipse on July 2, 2019 is coming up. But it’s only visible in Chile and Argentina. I tried to suggest to a few friends if they wanted go, but they said no because it was too far. I decided to forget it.

About yesterday, I said fuck it, I’ll just try to go alone. (Luckily I reached out to a different friend,  and they said they were already going.) However there’s two major issues:

1. The flights are long and expensive

and 

2. I have an internship starting July 1st, which overlaps with the eclipse. I’m sorta friends with the CEO so they *might* be okay with me skipping work, but missing the first days of a job for a vacation is definitely not a good look.

Do you guys think it’s worth it for me to take a risk and go to South America? I feel like it would lift the regret off my shoulders, but I’m also thinking that now might not be the best time.

There’s also another total solar eclipse in South America in December 2020, which is 18 months away. So if I don’t go to this one I’ll probably go to that one.

Um, no that’s not true. Nothing is a guarantee. Especially without solid experience. 

I can’t find even a simple help desk job and i live in a job abundant area. While there’s lots of competition, I should be able to get SOMETHING. 

I have customer service experience, an internship, and ~5 years as a help desk (more of an admin assistant but I do all the tech stuff) at a non profit where I mainly worked weekends. Plus the degree. 

Yet, I still can’t seem to secure anything. I can’t get a government clearance unfortunately so that eliminates a large portion of the jobs available in my area. I’m based out of the DMV area. 

It’s really frustrating dealing with the whole I need a job to get some experience but can’t get the job due to lack of experience. Where are these grads with 2-4 years of IT experience? Wtf. 

No I’m not a programmer or good coder, I don’t have any certs or the money to get one. I’ve looked at internships but can’t seem to find any. Student loans are coming, wtf do I do? I studied IT because I assumed I could easily get a decent paying job! 

Help, advice, suggestions?"

I understand that having back end experience really helps when it comes to these positions, but I wanted any advice from real engineers or sales team associates in the field that could provide insight as to what attributes and qualities employers look for at these positions, so I can become more well rounded and a stronger candidate.

c3u94f,3,2019-06-22,Should i give per schola a shot?,SHOELACEtheMENACE,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/c3u94f/should_i_give_per_schola_a_shot/,"So ive been reading around alot and been having trouble coming to the right decision so i finally decided to make a post for some advice.

As far as my personal situation:
Im from the philly area and i turn 21 in august. Past 2 years i mostly tried to figure out somethings and have come to the conclusion that IT is something i actually want to invest my time into. Its something im somewhat familiar with and am willing to learn. I wasnt exactly sure what the right moves shouldve been. Last year i failed 2 semesters of community college and got depressed all over again. I still want to prioritize college as i want it to help advance all my options for my careerpath (computer science degree). 

Despite everything i came down with a plan that this summer, i'd find any job to save money as well as paying for my cert exams and that i would get either just my a+ or my security cert. as well, along with my drivers license. And then the coming fall, id start school again with a new head on my shoulders. 

So heres the thing, i came across this offer for apparently IT training. Its all free, it starts july 22nd. Its 15 weeks (basically 4 months) from 9 am to 5 pm.
They would help me get my A+ and network cert. For free. It sounds like a great opportunity, but after reading around others have agreed that 15 weeks is waaay too long to just get those early certs. Idk if i'll get connections there or not, maybe i will but its a big commitment. 

This messes up any opportunity for work or college and ive honestly wasted too much time.

I guess im looking for any advice people can give me on training programs like these or if anyone has experience with per scholas, its their first time opening up in philly apparently. Or should i continue the self study route (utilizing the likes of prof. Messer) and eventually hopefully land an internship somewhere while taking college classes too.

Ive already fucked around wasting 2 years, im not trying to waste more if the results arent as promising."

The main problem is, I find I'm always confined and never allowed to stretch my brain muscles to their fullest extents. By saying this, I'm referring to being confined to specific duties/roles. Though being prior military, this seems quite humorous in retrospect. I always thought I enjoyed order, mundane tasks... but after years of experimentation, I found myself loving the aspect of being a go-to problem solver. Even if there isn't a problem to be solved, I can usually derive a better alternative to help streamline work activities. The worst of these activities was when my manager stole a majority of the credit for my innovations to the company owner, but I digress. I currently have an occupation that does not let me go to my fullest extent, but the pay allows me to afford to pay for an undergrad certificate/post-bacc -&gt; masters degree, thereby allowing me to re-specialize either within the company or laterally to another source.  I have worked as a team lead of a small company heading up their marketing team. I loved the aspect of working towards the larger goal with working parts(cogs to a system) but became frustrated when I realized I was the only one working towards the milestones. It seemed as if I had the drive and others were doing it(or not doing it rather) because the boss wanted to try it out. I do prefer the more structured curriculum as it will allow me to bridge gaps for lack of experience many employers are ""requiring.""

Please note, internships are not a viable option as I am currently living/working abroad in a different country.

Current MBTI: \*INTJ-A/Architect to INFJ-A/Diplomat\*(if you believe psychometrics will help)What I want out of a career prospect:-creativity-problem solving-lack of micro-managing/autonomy-can look at big picture scale, while working on fine tuned details-love to constantly learn and implement new ideas/concepts-explaining abstract or higher-tiered knowledge and breaking it down to understandable terms to others(despite being introverted)-

Areas I've researched thus far:-\*Marketing\*(not being an extrovert, so social interactions are a downside)-\*Science Researcher\*(the aspect of needing a Ph.D while attractive is a long venture)-\*Electronics/Mechatronics\*(I have a knack for computers and would love to create something, but have no formal knowledge in this area. Could just be an interest area rather a career path.)-\*I/O Psychology\*(Still an emerging field, and not well-known apart from EU/US areas)-\*Web-Design/Dev\*(More of a portfolio aspect apart from formal education alongside experience)-\*Education\*(Requires me to be extroverted and drains me after work greatly)-

I would go to a 4 year university, study Computer Science and maybe Economics or Business, work as a Software Engineer either indefinitely or for a few years (depending on if I came up with a startup idea I thought was worth pursuing). That plan was working out fine, and I really enjoyed my CS classes in college, until my internship this summer. 

This summer I'm working at a mid sized company with about 200 employees (but it still has a distinctly startup culture) as a Data Engineer/Strategist. Before this internship started I had thought I was really interested in Machine Learning and data analysis (and I still am on a high level) but I'm uncertain now. I know that Data Engineering is somewhat different from software in certain respects however, I am really not enjoying the work. My main complaints are centered around the feeling that most of what I'm doing doesn't seem like its actually building anything. 

I spend most of my days working on data pipe lining ie. getting data from the website to a warehouse to the machine learning model etc. This alone feels tedious to me and as though I'm not really getting to build something cool. To add to that, I am mainly using code that is written by others, whether it be libraries or frameworks, and not really making anything on my own. More explicitly it feels like most of my job is trying to read documentation and find already existing solutions and making those solutions work together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though working on the business side might be better for me given my want/need to see the bigger picture of projects. I should add here that I think I would like to do the job of my manager who does product management and doesn't actually write code. 

Questions I have: 

Is the experience of finding code on GitHub/Docker/TensorFlow etc and putting it together rather than writing more core code common to software engineering or is it just my role here?

Would working at a tech giant like Google/Facebook be different or a similar experience and would it be worth it to try to get an internship at one or will I be wasting time I could spend trying to get a business/consulting internship?

&amp;#x200B;

I would also just appreciate any general advice. Sorry this post is kind of long but thanks for taking the time to read it."

My goal for after graduation is to be able to get interviews at the top companies like Big N's and HFT firms. I might not want to work at these companies in 4 years time, but my logic is that if I meet the highest standards then anything easier to get into will be open to me as well.

I've researched what you must do to get an interview, and one of the most important things is having good internship experience, so I want to start working on this early. I hope this post will generate useful discussion for other freshman who are starting this process.

I know it's not essential for me to do an internship in freshman year as [this user here](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/axw08t/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_new_grads/ehwom0l/) got a job with £160k total comp at Jane Street with 3 internships, which is the highest-paying offer I've seen for a new grad outside of the US.

Degrees in Scotland span four years, so I could start looking for internships from my 2nd year on. However, I don't want to leave anything to chance so I'd like to try and get an internship freshman year, preferably at a good company (although I know it'll be very hard).

Using [this blog post](https://blog.nathanhleung.com/google-internship/) as a guide (the author was a freshman who got an internship at Google), it seems like getting an interview for an internship at a normal small company requires you to pretty much just be a not-terrible CS student and make some small side projects like calculators or simple games. As long as I can talk in detail about the project, explain why I did things the way I did and my code is clean and well-structured, it should be satisfactory. As a freshman however, a lot of companies will just automatically reject me but I'm hoping that if I apply to a ton then I should hopefully get accepted by at least somebody.

To get an interview at a big company seems to be impossible unless you get some kind of referral or recommendation. The author of that blog was rejected by every company he applied to except Google, and it's only because he completed this coding challenge thing that was being used as an online recruitment tool. Any other case I've seen has had the person getting referred by someone they know who already works at the company, or being given one at a career fair after making a good impression on a recruiter.

I'm just trying to get clarification that I'm on the right track with all this. My plan for this summer is to work on side projects so I can hopefully get an interview for a 2020 summer internship. I've learned basic programming skills from classes I've taken at my community college alongside an online course, and I already have a basic HTML/CSS eCommerce website which performs the basic functions of any eCommerce website and connects to a SQL database with PHP.

It currently works but looks like shit, so my plan was to add features and improve the design to get it up to more on the level of something like [this website,](http://shipbucket.com/) which was given as an example of a good side project in another reddit thread. I've also built a small tic-tac-toe game in python which I could improve and if I have the time, make other small games, like how that blog author made a checkers game. Making calculators like his also wouldn't take that long and could be a nice extra.

One other thing I was wondering is if it would be better to focus on contributing to an open-source project instead, because it shows the ability to dive into an existing codebase, and having my code vetted by the project maintainers is an indicator of quality.

Can't say that I am not nervous about my future in this department. All the reading that I have done, the fact that even the most experienced and best CS graduates take weeks, months, **YEARS** to find their first job, doesn't make me feel good about it. 

I have a GPA that's just below a 3.00 (like probably in the 2.90s) from a non target school, no internships bc our school don't have a lot of cs places looking here since there is one of the best engineering and cs schools down the street from our school, have a few school projects I can use but was told that using school projects on your resume is a waste of space. Try to come up with some cool project ideas but whenever I look into some examples (whether it's on here or on the internet), they are way over my head like people are building servers and APIs (like wtf how does one do that), bringing up that they used 5 or 6 different frameworks (gotta throw that .NET in there), and i try looking at the open source route but I don't even know where to start with that lol. Am I just too stupid for this field of work? 

Gotta Linkedin account, always hear people telling me to network yet I got no one to network with. Don't know how I am suppose to do that when I got nobody, and cold messaging is just weird. What am I suppose to say, ""I am graduating in a year please hire me, I promise I am smart...."" 

Practice Leetcode/HackerRank. Can't say that I am bad, I do good on the easy-medium questions (was told that hard is something I don't have to worry about), but it's pretty useless to practice these when I can't even get a response on my resume and get to utilize what I get out of those.

Sorry if this sounds like a rant more than a questions, but I am lost and clueless and worried that I messed up and kinda don't know what I am suppose to do from this point. Just afraid I'll be one of those that will be stuck 2, 3, 4 years finding my first job. What do I do? Any stories from you guys and what you did (if this experience is relatable), would be great! Guess I am just really overwhelmed at this point. I know I am a capable student, it's not that I don't know how to code or don't know anything. I believe I am capable of having an entry level job at this point (at least I hope I am), but I am just worried about getting there."

No internships before.Decent GPA. After graduating i traveled a bit and then started applying to SWE jobs. I made it to the final round for Amazon and Google and felt like i performed decently but did not ending getting any offers. After that i had a few more interviews here and there with smaller companies that did not result in any offers. I really struggled selling myself and was not very well prepared for behavioral questions / discussing projects (which i feel like i'm more comfortable with now). I suppose i was a little discouraged at that point (around January). I decided to start preparing for the GRE so i could submit apps to CS masters programs as there was still a lot of  higher level classes that i wanted to take but didn't get a chance to. I got into some grad schools but couldn't land any kind of T.A position to cover the costs of tuition. This is probably the biggest reason for me deciding not to go.

&amp;#x200B;

 I decided to start applying to SWE jobs again.  I ended up getting an offer at this consulting company close to where i live.  They weren't exactly clear in explaining what kind of work i would be doing but mentioned that i would be learning React and using MS suite technologies so sounds like some kind of full stack development. The pay is on the lower end of entry level SWE jobs and im not really interested in the work.Overall i'm not to excited about it. I'm trying to get a position more in the data engineering ecosystem. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is with my one year gap am i better off taking this offer, working for a half year and or so while self studying stuff thats more relevant to what i want to do and then moving on or just self studying and constantly sending out applications? Fortunately it's not very important that i'm making money at the moment so that's not a huge factor but i do want to move out of my parents house. The year gap is putting pressure on me to get a job but i just dont want to get stuck with a job that i dont want. Any outlooks on this?

From the beginning, she’s been strange. She’s a compulsive hoarder and, when I first arrived in May, I had to clean the fridge out of food that expired in 2016.  Moreover, she often gets incredibly plastered in the middle of the day or starts drinking at nine AM. Typically, she just sorta stumbles around giggling and then passes out on the couch. But today things came to a serious head.

I went to go see Toy Story 4 (nostalgia!) and she tagged along. At the theater, she purchased multiple drinks with high alcohol content. Like she was really throwing things back and wound up so drunk she could not safely make it down the steps in the theater.

About halfway through the movie, she reaches over and puts her hand between my thighs. I snap at her and ask what she’s doing. She starts giggling and says, “Listen it’s really not that bad.” 

I have a tendency to shut down in sexually aggressive situations due to past trauma. So I just death stare and tell her I’m trying to watch the movie. I didn’t feel comfortable full on confronting her right then.

But she kept doing it! She kept reaching over to grab my thigh. She even insisted, “You’re misunderstanding. I swear and promise I’m not trying anything.”

Ok IF YOU ARENT TRYING ANYTHING THEN WHY ARE YOU GRABBING ME??

Ultimately we left the theater and did not discuss it further because she was literally too inebriated to speak. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t have anywhere to go in this city and no one is going to rent to me for the single month I have left. I’m also massively in debt as a grad student and can’t afford a hotel or anything—I’m sleeping in the same fucking apartment with this creep because I can’t afford anything else.

And I feel worse because I feel BAD for her. I’m so used to rationalizing other people hurting me that my brain’s automatic response is, “Oh she didn’t mean it. It won’t happen again. She was just drunk. Just stay away when she’s drunk.”

Never mind that she’s always drunk and also the nastiest human being ever who leaves stew out on the counter for days and eats it. 

And why did I just sit there??? I could have left. Why did I keep just letting her grab me? I could have dug my nails so hard into her skin she bled and I didn’t. Just like the weird old man at my aunt’s wedding or the guy who flashed me at the fair or any of the people who’ve ever touched me. I never DO anything. I just freeze."
c43mt2,2,2019-06-23,Would Python be relatively easy to learn after studying Ruby first?,Leaker-,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/c43mt2/would_python_be_relatively_easy_to_learn_after/,"Hi all,

I have been wandering around for so long and finally decided to return to this industry.

I could definitely say that I forgot mostly everything that I've learnt at university and thus I am planning to apply for a coding bootcamp which teaches Ruby, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and so on for six months including chances of 3\~4 weeks internship.

At this stage, my very long term goal in next ten years is to be an A.I. expert but, the bootcamp offers Ruby over Python as I stated above.

According to the research that I've done, Pyhton has

* larger community
* more resources for A.I. &amp; machine learning
* better future demand
* more job offers as well as higher salary rate

That being said, I'll have to learn Python at some stage (at least for A.I. &amp; machine learning resources) and my question is would Python be relatively easy to learn after studying Ruby? Or should I search for another bootcamp that offers Python from the first place?

Thank you in advance!"

c43tve,14291,2019-06-23,My ex proposed. I said no. He is now talking about suing me. Advice?,Jenny86-75-309,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c43tve/my_ex_proposed_i_said_no_he_is_now_talking_about/,"Just want to say this is going to sound insane but I am not trolling/making it up.

Me and this guy were together for 3 years. We're 19 now. We never talked about the future until a year in. Before then I'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

In short, I wanted kids, he didn't. I wanted to stay in Ireland, he didn't. I wanted to get married, he didn't. When I realised it was a bad match I broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. This happened a few times over the next 18 months In this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

We knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something I would want further down the line, I wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. If I were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then I might have an issue, but when I'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

When I went to see him this time I was again, considering breaking up with him. Aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that I really don't like. So when I arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, I assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so I wouldn't cause a scene. I don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

In the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. First he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff I liked and what my taste was. I assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so I told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. I also said ""go cheap"".

The other thing he asked me was how I felt about public proposals. I told him immediately that I, personally, disliked them as I felt I wouldn't be able to say no, even if I wanted to. I feel like public proposals are OK when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not OK at all. I assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

I never thought in a million years that he would propose.

So you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

The ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. He got on one knee, and held it out to me. We were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. Everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

I said no.

Well, I didn't so much say ""no"". I ran out of the restaurant.

He drove me there, so I got a cab back, and drove home that night.

I realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but I didn't know what else to do. I could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all I knew was that I didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. I felt like I couldn't even speak, I was so upset about the whole thing. So I just got up and ran.

I just want to take the opportunity to say here that I really really don't care about the rings. Honestly, when I want to get married (which is absolutely not when I'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and I'd say yes. I wouldn't even need a ring. I know I'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what I'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

I didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. He said that he thought a proposal was something I'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. He said that he was out of pocket for the rings. He'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. He linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). When I asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped I would cover the cost of mine. He said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. He'd hoped that I would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but I said no. He also said I'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if I was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

We both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. Enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on Sunday.

He has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that I have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which I had no part in spreading. He says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. So €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

I think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but I am not a law student or a lawyer. He is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

What do I do about all of this? Do I need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

Thanks in advance :)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  He knew I wanted to get married but not to him. He not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. He openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and I told him that this was why I was breaking up with him the times before this that I have ended the relationship. During the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like I'm gonna propose"" (that one was last April)

I was of the opinion that getting a grad school is only possible for high achievers until recently I realized there are a variety of schools who accept a variety of students. Given the cost of applications, the task seems impossible and Reddit is my only source of information on what is going on outside.

I have a bachelors in CS from a Tier 1 college in India with 8.5 GPA. My GRE is 320 (155V/165Q/3.5AWA). I have an abstract accepted in a local conference and two submissions (peer-reviewed journals with moderate-high impact factor) on the way, all in the domain of computational neuroscience and cognitive science which is what I intend to major in. I will be able to get 2 decent LoRs from my profs and 1 from one of my internship mentors.

I am looking for schools in the US/UK/Europe.

I have tons of software engineering experience through internships and a job since I graduated but not much research experience. I had no intention of ever going for higher studies but one year in the industry showed me it's not for me (I blame my college for this because it focuses too much on research and I only wanted a job at that time).

If you think it helps, my goal for the immediate future is to get some foreign college exposure since I kind of screwed my undergrad by being eccentric most of the times and not in a positive way and that's the reason I couldn't realize the value of research at that time. Since I still have a year left, I am actively looking for a research assistant position to help me with my applications.

Some of the schools I have shortlisted (in order of preference) are JHU, UCSD, Uni. of Maryland, UT Austin, Uni. of Wisconsin-Madison, TU Munich, Stony Brook, SJSU (and likes).

I have no clue about the UK and Europe at the moment. I probably do not care that much about getting a US school as of now but mostly about studying abroad and getting a job there. Yes, settling outside is definitely a goal in the long run.

Am I going in the right direction?

But I'm thinking about applying to remote jobs and jobs in Singapore in the next 1-2 years when I get more exp (ofc if only this time I didn't get a job from any of them).

It's been a long half year and I've made much progress since I've first joined this subreddit and would like some feedback

&amp;#x200B;

note)

* I have edited out some parts for privacy reasons.
* I've highlighted the parts I thought are or could be important, just in case anyone was wondering.

&amp;#x200B;

During this period, I have 

1. Grown **confident in leetcode style questions**. A lot of my time was spent studying data structures and algorithms.
2. Completed **2 separate projects** with **Tensorflow**, which are simple, but fairly accurate AIs that **predict X and Y prices** in a (restricted) market. The first project is actively being used by the expat community in my country, and the second is for my dual-major. (The second will be finished within the next semester). The **data was manually scraped**, too.

&amp;#x200B;

These are my worries:

1. I am a **senior year student**, and must take an extra semester next fall because of my dual major (Computer Engineering). Thus, I will most likely **graduate in Spring, 2021.**
2. I'll have been at **University for nearly a decade when I graduate**. Apart from 2 years of military service, I really can't say most other gap years I have taken, which have (unregretfully) been spent ""enjoying my 20s.""
3. My **GPA is very low**, and I don't expect it to be very high when I graduate. I've messed around (again, enjoying my 20s) during my younger years.
4. I haven't had a single internship related to the CS field.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am hoping that the following unrelated experiences will possibly boost the chances of me getting a job in CS:

1. A holdings company I interned for was like office-life bootcamp for me, where I basically **worked on my soft-skills**. This was a very stressful experience for me and sure as heck would like it to count in any ways possible. I took the offer because I didn't want to take out a student loan.
2. I was recognized for this work and got scouted by another company that was lenient with my time schedule, allowing me to **go to school and have a semi-full-time job** at the same time. I hold a **management position** and my main job is HR and communications related. My most recent project was a **government-funded accelerating program for IT/Tech companies**, which was completed successfully.
3. I am a **prominent figure in a certain field of Arts**. I am recognized for being among those who have introduced it to my country, and am invited to **give lectures/lessons at Universities** regarding the form. Furthermore, a book and doctorates thesis will be published citing me as a credible source.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my questions:

1. Would my cs-unrelated experiences be of any value to CS-related companies?
2. Where should I take it from here, what is the most realistic career choice for me? (I apologize if it is a dumb question)

&amp;#x200B;

My **preferred career choice would be in embedded software specifically for aerospace and automobile industry**. However, considering my low GPA, I don't know if this would be a realistic career choice for me. Most automobile/aerospace companies demand a high GPA just to apply and they are generally regarded as large corporations. I feel that with my cs-related experience, I would be lucky to get into a startup.

&amp;#x200B;

Harsh or not, I would appreciate any form of feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm either going to make a UML sequence diagram or a directed graph with messages as edges.

* The edges (not nodes) must be clickable to display the full message content. (Or there must be some other way to view the full message content since messages are very long. Another option would be having a click redirect to another page that displays the full message content) 

Does anyone know what tools I could use for this? I've looked at D3.js and Cytoscape.js but it doesn't look like there's an easy way to do what I want to do. Specifically, clickable edges to display message content looks like it's not a common feature in visualization frameworks. Thanks!"

c49l3u,1,2019-06-23,I'm terrified of driving and it is killing my social life,anchr_dwn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c49l3u/im_terrified_of_driving_and_it_is_killing_my/,"Howdy, using a throwaway for general reasons. 

I'm currently 19 years old, and I'm about to turn 20 in the immediate future. As of now, I have never gotten my license, and the farthest steps I have taken driving-wise has been getting my permit and practicing with my mother, father, or sister on rare and sporadic occasions. In high school, I walked everywhere and I was the youngest in my friend group, so I either always had a ride or did not need one. My college has us living on campus for all four years, and parking passes are a bitch to get if you are not a senior, so I never needed a car and just Ubered around anyways. However, come this summer, I am on my own for the first time in a completely different state completing a summer internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I am on my own, and starting average non-college student adult life for the summer, I am finally having to deal with the repercussions of not having a license/car. I usually walk to work and other essential places such as the nearby Aldi, but other than that, I am completely stranded. I don't live in a hub or any sort of popular area, and the bustling parts of the city are in driving/expensive Uber range. Not having a car gives me an excuse to sit in my room all day watching Netflix, and when I do feel like something, I walk to the beach and read, but those two options get old after a bit. Additionally, dating is a pain because the girls I match with on Tinder are not keen on driving the guy around, which is sorta lame but I understand the social attitude behind it.  As a result, I have an incredibly sad social life compared to my college days. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never got my license because I am absolutely terrified of the road. I am scared to death by the thought of hurting myself, others, and my parent's insurance premiums. I have general anxiety issues, and my mom got into a couple of bad accidents due to dumb luck. She had to get her ankle rebuilt, and I have another memory of seeing the side of our van completely crumpled while in the body-shop lot. I guess I am trying to say perhaps a deep subconscious aversion to driving maybe be a result of these instances. I tried driving with my mom, but she would grab the handle and audibly gasp every time I took a turn, sped up, or made a minute mistake such as not being in the center of the lane. My dad, on the other hand, is a great teacher in comparison. I always felt comfortable driving with him in retrospect, but I am a child of divorce and he moved a couple of hours away, so needless to say I do not see him much as compared to my mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I am in a new state for the summer and renting a room out for two months, I can't get a license here as I do not have permanent residency, and I'm not technically a resident of the state I go to college at (dorms do not count legally or something). Additionally, I'm not home often since I spend the majority of my life at school, so I do not know if I can learn how to drive better and be comfortable behind the wheel with the time I would have during school breaks spent at home. I'm gonna be interning again next summer, although hopefully in a commuter friendly city such as NYC or Chicago, so all in all its hard to find a time that I can dedicate purely to getting over this hump. Further, I want to be a management consultant, and they are usually required to drive when on client sites in remote areas, so I am going to learn how to eventually, but like I said I cannot block out the time and I do not know how I will fit it in before I begin my career.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about the wall of text, but I am incredibly frustrated with my situation right now, and I wanted to see if any of y'all have been in the same place."

I do have quite a lot of free time over the summer before my 3rd year starts and was thinking it'd be valuable to learn some skills that could boost my CV in the future.

Essentially, my task is to take log data from a kibana database and create something that helps visualize the connections between different log messages.

Right now, I have a Python/Flask webapp that queries the database based on search terms, and I want a visualization to pop up based on the search term, but I'm not sure how to proceed with the visualization. Here's what I'm thinking:

* I'm either going to make a UML sequence diagram or a directed graph with messages as edges.

* The edges (not nodes) must be clickable to display the full message content. (Or there must be some other way to view the full message content since messages are very long. Another option would be having a click redirect to another page that displays the full message content) 

Does anyone know what tools I could use for this? I've looked at D3.js and Cytoscape.js but it doesn't look like there's an easy way to do what I want to do. Specifically, clickable edges to display message content looks like it's not a common feature in visualization frameworks. Thanks!"

I have been working at a university hospital for 2 years doing research making pretty low pay. I started an online masters in health administration (2 year) program last year through my university hospital. 

I’ve been in the process of trying to find jobs in health administration but haven’t had any luck. So I decided to start doing a volunteer internship this summer in addition to grad school and my full time job. As a part of the internship, the interns (20 students) have meetings with various healthcare leaders to learn more. 

Last Thursday we had a meeting with the associate COO and the chief of affiliations and network development. There they each had a presentation and a little q&amp;a for us. Anyway after the meeting wrapped up I decided to introduce myself to the COO because I had nothing to lose. I asked him several questions and it didn’t really go anywhere. I did also speak to the chief of affiliations for a good 5 minutes one on one. 

He asked what I was interested in and I explained to him that have worked here in research for 2 years and was interested in getting experience in administrative. He goes I’ll give you my card. He looks through his wallet and it took him a few moments to find it. Then he says to call or text me don’t email me cause it’s bad. I asked when’s a good time to text you? He says anytime. I said it was nice meeting you and said I’m (real name) so he’d hopefully remember my name. 

I was thinking about texting him tomorrow but how should I word it? I thought “hi (his name) this is (my name) we spoke after the meeting last Thursday and I wanted to get in touch with you about our conversation. If I can help you in anyway please let me know.” 

I would appreciate any help about this as this could be a great connection for him since he is at the top in my organization.

c4dpek,33,2019-06-23,How To Find a Safety You'll Love,newaccountz_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c4dpek/how_to_find_a_safety_youll_love/,"I've been seeing a lot of kids on this thread scoff and turn their noses up at the idea of ""falling in love"" with a safety. I've also seen a lot of kids think a safety has to be your local community college or University of Phoenix online, and just not knowing where to look for a solid safety. There's probably been lots of posts already written about this, but I've decided to make my own (Note: This is primarily aimed at domestic U.S. students, but could apply to int'l students as well)

&amp;#x200B;

The #1 thing I want to stress is that your safety school must be a financial safety as well as a safety in terms of acceptance. There's no point in applying to a ""safety"" if you won't be able to afford it. Unless your family is willing and able to pay in full to any college, you need to be sure you can afford to attend. If you qualify for a lot of need-based aid, run the school's Net Price Calculator to be sure they will cover enough of your demonstrated need. If you don't qualify for much need-based, but your parents can't afford full pay, look for schools that offer substantial merit scholarships that you will be competitive for (meaning, your stats should be much higher than the 75th percentile, among other holistic factors).

&amp;#x200B;

So how do you go about finding a safety school? Primarily, you'll want to look in-state, but don't discount private schools either. I understand that some states have stronger higher education systems than others, but many public universities also have tuition agreements with neighboring states or counties. For many students, I've noticed that ""state school"" is often mentioned with a very derisive tone on here. But I'm telling you: Public universities are not that bad! When you compare ""lower tier"" public universities to T20s, you're bound to be disappointed they don't have the exact same bells and whistles. But you need to get in a mindset that there is a strong chance you will end up at your safety (even if you think otherwise). When you go for a tour at potential safeties (and you should go for tours), don't compare it to other fancier schools you've visited/heard of. Just take it for what it's worth. And often, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Large state schools are often highly regarded and respected in the local community, with many opportunities for local internships and jobs. Most state schools also have honors programs, with honors students having their own housing, classes, scholarships, internship and study abroad opportunities, and getting to schedule classes before anyone else. And if you're a superstar student, you'll have a much better chance of rising to the top than at a more competitive school. So find a list of all the public universities in your state (or OOS public universities where you're eligible for in-state tuition), and take a look at things like location, average stats, clubs/orgs, study abroad, etc. Then narrow it down to 2-3 and schedule visits. Go beyond just a tour, and try to schedule personalized visits with the honors college, a department/major you're interested in, and any clubs you're interested in (athletics, music, debate, etc). State schools will often ""roll out the red carpet"" with 1-on-1 visits for high achieving students, as long as you ask ahead of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have an in-state public university nailed down (even if you aren't 100% in love with it), if you're looking out of state, consider some OOS/private safeties as well. For example, I had a high-achieving student who had her heart set on going to college in Southern California (she was from Ohio). She applied to UCLA, USC, UCSD, the Claremonts, and a few others, but ended up attending California Lutheran University (one of her safeties) with a full tuition scholarship- and she's absolutely loving it now! There are over 1,400 accredited four-year colleges/universities in the United States. Odds are, if you're looking at a prestigious school in a particular region/city, there will be other ""lower ranked"" schools in that same area. For example, if you love UT Austin, maybe consider St. Edwards University for a safety. Or if you love University of Miami, maybe look into Barry University. There's also tons of ""lower ranked"" LACs out there. A lot of them are religiously affiliated, but there's secular ones too. They may not have all the bells and whistles of more well-known LACs, but they will have similar environments, along with (hopefully) much more scholarship money. A good place to start looking would be a list of schools with large to full scholarships (I know there's a few floating around Reddit), and then find schools from those lists that pique your interest where your stats/accomplishments would be much higher than the average (preferably higher than the 75th percentile as well). A lot of the students I work with will have an in-state public safety, and one or two private out-of-state safeties they love (where they're basically guaranteed to be accepted and receive lots of aid).

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, remember that the school you happen to attend for four years of your life will not pre-determine your entire future (even if it seems that way). Pretty much every college or university will get you a degree, help you with internships and job opportunities, give you the chance to make amazing friendships and meet great professors, have study abroad opportunities, and give you a strong base for your future career and/or post-graduate education.

A big part of my problem is my family, they're religious people who wouldn't accept the fact that i'm non-religious, they talk about it constantly and they try to mention god always to provoke a reaction from me, they constantly talk about disowning me and throwing me out of the house. That's not the point though i've been trying to get them to get me better education in a private uni for an engineering course because that's what employers are looking for at least in the third world country i live in, they say that it's time for me to get a job no matter which (the money i'd make in a year from an average job wouldn't even be enough for enrollement fees let alone living off it) and start earning money by myself, they're right in a way but i feel like the 16 years or so i spent studying will just go in vein, i had a quite rebellious teenagehood in which i tried to drop out from school and they were so insisting that i keep on studying and they reassured me they'll take care of everything and here i am now almost done but faced with the fact that they betrayed me and now i'm just gonna do a job that anyone could do with a major or not. I feel really depressed and betrayed by everyone, by my country and by my family.

I'm not the perfect developer but i manage to get the job done no matter what. During my internship i worked from 8 to 5 and sometimes i wouldn't sleep at all just trying fixing a certain bug or problem and i would go to internship next day and get sent home for being too sleepy. I love working and i love solving problems i feel like it's a fire inside of me that my decaying country and my family are trying to extinguish, it makes me so depressed seeing my ambitions and my dreams fading in front of me while i can do nothing about it because i'm financially dependent on my family and i can't get further education because they can't afford it and even if they did for them i'm not worth it.

Today (6 hours from now, its 3am and I can't sleep) I start my first day and I had some questions about the company based on some of their benefits and outlined details in the offer letter.

First of all, here's some information:
It's a 3 month trial where I am paid as an intern and they will assess my ability and I'm sure some other things. At the end of the trial they will see if I'm a fit and will begin salary negotiations with a title upgrade to a junior developer along with the accommodations that come with that title change (I dont know what that means entirely)

They also provide me, and this is as an ""intern"", 16 days PTO and medical+dental coverage. I personally thought that this is quite strange for someone in as low of a position as me.

The Co-founder was also very hesitant during the interview to give me a position, given my lack of experience as a recent graduate. But he emailed me back with some heartwarming words and CC'd his head of HR to offer me a trial position.

I have always put passion and dedicated hours into learning to code because I enjoy and love it; and I have always dreamt of bringing that to a company that would treat me as good as I would be putting back in. I know that this isnt much to go off of, but would this be a company that is ""worth"" all that i am willing to put in based on just what I'm given so far?"

c4ot00,4,2019-06-24,My (M21) internship makes me depressive.,Larry97EU,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c4ot00/my_m21_internship_makes_me_depressive/,"I made some posts about this topic already. I'm doing an internship at a big company which is mandatory for my degree. But I don't have anything to do. Hate the environment and it's not the field I wanna work in one day. I hate it and I'm getting more and more depressive. On the weekends I have a awesome life. But at work.. I feel so devastated. Sometimes I need to take a toiletbreak and cry. I know you could say this is overreacting. Especially as I did 4 months already and got only 2 more to go. But I literally can't stand it anymore. My biggest task at work is not to cry. The alternative is to quit it and search for a new internship, which means 6 months of work AGAIN. At my internship at a radio station I once did was so much fun and I was great at it. That makes it worse as I know there are jobs that I'm good at and that make me happy. I don't actually wanna quit especially as my girlfriend and parents would think I'm a sissy for whining about a job that is ""too boring"". But I just can't stand it anymore. It's hate it so unbelievably much but I know if I quit now these 4 months before were kinda useless. But what should I do? Shouldn't my mental health be priority #1?"

I recently graduated and I'm being seriously considered for a Systems Operator position at a Transmission Operator company on the east coast of the US.  I'm curious what kind of advice you all can give me.  The company is offering health insurance, 401k, ect. The salary isn't exceptional (\~75k) for the role but it will help me pay off loans, which is a chief concern at the moment.  The schedule is a little wonky: rotating shift work basically 1/2 days shift, 1/2 night, sometimes weekdays, sometimes weekends.  For someone who had interest in going into the power industry a system operator position seems like an excellent place to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I graduated with a BS in EE. Not an amazing GPA but 1 year work experience (quality internships); plus good soft skills and a willingness to learn while dedicating myself to my work.  I had some rough times in college and got hit with some surprise bills right as I graduated which cut down the time I had to find a job from 3months to realistically just 1 month. I have other applications out there but this would be the surest thing so far and like I said time is a major factor right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very grateful to even have the potential to have this opportunity.  I just don't want to rush into a very important decision like my first job out of college. Any advice or relevant stories appreciated."

Things aren't actually getting better. Not in any meaningful way. And at this stage it doesn't feel like it will. BPD is a death sentence.

It feels like the end of the Good Place season 1. Well not the actual end. But what should have been the end. They were going to the Bad Place. There was no 

question about it. But they turned the music on and fucking partied bc whatever. The end is fucking coming no matter what I do.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to die. I really don't. But at this stage it feels like the only option. Bc what's the other fucking option? Pain and suffering till I eventually die anyways. Probably at an early age bc S T R E S S kills.

Pride thing? Fell so short of what I wanted it to be.

&amp;#x200B;

And why? Bc I'm lazy. I procrastinate. I have no impulse control. My sleeping schedule is fucked. I'm fucked. The list of things wrong about me is so long.

&amp;#x200B;

I've run into a dead end. Nothing brings hope or happiness. I see no future with me in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Hospital? I can't do that again. I just can't. I'm pretty sure I'd fucking kill myself if I went again. Hospitalizations have traumatized me so much. I was sexually harassed there and they blamed me since I was trans.

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy? IVE BEEN FUCKING DOING THERAPY!!! and I'm still writing this. 7 years later since my first hospitalization (Age 11) and I'm still writing this.

It hasn't gotten better. It won't. It can't. My brain is completely broken now.

It doesn't say anything bad I only describe what I did there and me talking well about the company. However, I notice when I take this experience off my resume I begin to get calls back and interviews and maybe it is just coincidental, the time of year, still in school,  etc. Hoping that is the case. I haven't gotten many calls back. I'm not sure what to think and I've asked quite a few times now but I still don't know in this situation.

Last year I was pretty lazy and did virtually no interview prep and as a result failed almost every single tech internship interview except for one which I am at now. The position description was a bit misleading in that it said I could be working with cloud and AI but it ended up being a primarily web dev position. I’ll be working with pretty much just C# web development and SQL, maybe help with a bit of cloud services later on. I’ve been taking interview prep more seriously this summer and was wondering if good companies see mundane past experience as a negative, or if past internship experience no matter what it consists of is always sort of a net positive thing."

I used to laugh at people who did this but this much real estate for coding is amazing. 

I'm planning on getting a similar setup in my dorm once the semester resumes. However I want to game as well, and don't want to spend more than $300-350. My laptop has a GTX 1070 so it's not gonna run 4k, and I'm completely fine with 1080p 60hz anyways. I'll only be gaming on one monitor, not two. Here's the options I'm considering.

1. Two 1080p 27 inch monitors. These cost ~$150 each, but I'm afraid 1080p on such a large screen will turn out bad. Also screen tearing.

2. Two 27 inch Samsung curved monitors. Same idea but curved and cost $190 each!. Has AMD freesync but not sure if that helps when using nvidia cards?

3. One $1440p ultrawide. These cost anywhere from $350-500. But there won't be as much real estate haha. Would you rather have these than dual monitors?

Also thinking maybe meeting in the middle and getting 1440p and 1080p screens maybe? 

I have time to think about this, just wanted to know your thoughts and other recommendations on monitors to buy/places to buy from other than Amazon. Thanks!"
c4umsk,866,2019-06-24,Why I Feel More Depressed After Getting Into An Ivy,PsychOuths,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c4umsk/why_i_feel_more_depressed_after_getting_into_an/,"To give you guys a little bit of background, during my college application season I shot gunned to all the east coast schools and other T20 schools. I worked extremely hard in high school, really only thinking about college my junior year. At the same time I wanted to excel, and put myself in the best situation to gain the necessary skills and connections to help others. 

After getting rejected and waitlisted to all my top choices, I had to choose between UCLA and UC Berkeley. Ultimately I chose UCLA for a number of reasons including that I realized that in order to accomplish my goals of helping others, I first needed to take care of myself. Before choosing UCLA I was in a slump, thinking that I had failed by getting rejected into 10+colleges. I felt like I failed everyone around me, wasted the opportunity given to me by so many people that pushed me to who I am today. I felt like I failed the future people that I know couldn’t reach. But UCLA is an AMAZING school, and I started learning more of how just lucky I was.

So fast forward to the the month of May, where I had already started looking at internship, research, and entrepreneurship resources at UCLA, I started feeling  way more at home especially considering how much I liked the overall people and school spirit. Also a bunch of my friends were going and we started planning out meetups and everything!

Then it dropped, I got off the waitlist to UPenn, which I  had previously already gave up on. (Last year 9/2500 people got off). It was an unbelievable miraculous moment. I felt elated, absolutely stunned at everything. 

My family and I instantly booked a plane ride to philly to visit the campus and as the days trickled by, I realized that this wasn’t an easy choice. I didn’t really connect with the campus much, and I had long arguments with my parents about which to choose. (They obviously wanted me to go to Penn despite the financial cost). To give you guys more context, my parents are both from China, where they value education over everything else. So as middle class individuals we didn’t receive any financial aid, but they were willing to take the financial hit of around 160k (Yeah it’s that expensive). I know that sounds great! But from my perspective I’m going to have to pay all of that back no matter what. So even if I’m not in debt to some bank, that’s still my debt that I’ll have to pay off to my parents. So although it’s not crippling, I still have “debt”. 

In the end (as you can tell by the tittle) I chose Penn. I really had to dig deep, and some part of me knew that I couldn’t pass up this opportunity. This was what I had wanted all along. But along the way something in me had changed. I KNEW I was going to be happier at UCLA with an amazing location, weather, food, and just overall an amazing place to study. I love the people there, the vibe and the culture. But I wanted more, I was ambitious and decided that it’s now or never, if I were go out in life always prioritize my own happiness, I’d never be able to accomplish my goals. So I chose my ambition over my happiness and now I’m not sure I made the right choice.

Over the past month I realized that getting into Penn didn’t make me happy, in fact I’m not even close to happy. There’s always another goal to reach, another obstacle to overcome, and someone else that’s always better than you. Since I was interested in entrepreneurship, my next goal is to transfer into Wharton and get a double degree from both the engineering and business school. But again, just like getting into Penn, this is incredibly difficult and unlikely, and this time I may not be so likely.

In the end, I’m not even sure if what I said about Penn being a once in a life time opportunity is correct. I mentioned how my parents put a lot of pressure on me to choose Penn, but usually I can ignore that stuff, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say it affected me. My mom and dad were playing good cop bad cop. My dad was constantly yelling, being incredibly emotional and basically throwing up every time I mentioned going to UCLA. On the other hand, my mom was being extremely manipulative telling me about how my dad was so pent on penn that he was in risk of heart attacks and depression. Like how can you not let this stuff go to your head?! How in the world could I have chose UCLA?

So in the end, I don’t regret my choice of going to Penn, but I just feel like I was FORCED to go to Penn over what I wanted for my personal well being. I definitely wonder to myself what if I chose UCLA, would I be feeling happier?  Would it solve all my problems? If you guys have any tips or things to say to me, go right ahead in the comments.

So for all of you rising seniors, I just want to impart some wisdom. Chose the school that you fit into and love if you can, not the one based on rankings or prestige. Also for those that are already in college or thinking about what college really means, just know that goals don’t make you happy, you make yourself happy. We’ve been taught over and over again that success is equivalent to happiness, but that’s not always the case. There will always be another goal whether it’s success or failure, but what we take away is not the end but the journey. And if you’re not happy along the way, the goal is meaningless. So take your time, and figure out not what your goals are, but if you’d be happy accomplishing those goals."
c4uz1i,1,2019-06-24,"Get a job to pay for school, or compromise on major program? Advice appreciated!",Meerywednesday,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/c4uz1i/get_a_job_to_pay_for_school_or_compromise_on/,"Hey,

I was hoping for some advice on this issue as I can’t make up my mind and have to make a decision by the 28th.

Long story short, I am a junior transfer student coming out of community college. Within this last year, I discovered I really liked filmmaking along with its various aspects (editing, effects etc.) and want to go into a field like television, or if that didn’t work out, maybe something more realistic like advertising or PR.

I applied to a bunch of schools these last two semesters, and after filtering out some that I didn’t feel worked for me, it’s come down to three. One is U of Michigan, one is Ithaca and the last is UT Austin.

The issue is that Michigan’s film/tv program isn’t  too well known, not as production based, and doesn’t have as many resources as the other two. (When I applied last year, I was likely less concerned about my major until I received my decision, then I deferred until this year). But they’re giving me a lot of aid, and I’d be out in two years with only ~26k in debt. However, Austin, which has what I want, and where I really wanted to go to, is pretty unaffordable (54k a year for OOS) and I would have to work about 20 hours a week for a year in order to gain residency so it would be affordable. Ithaca is third in line to the other two as it’s a bit expensive (43k after two years) and I’m not sure it’s definitely for me, though their program is more TV oriented and has a lot of internships.

My question is:
Would it be better to compromise and enroll in a school (Mich) where my major isn’t prioritized (no advertising/PR courses either), or should I bite the bullet and work 20 hrs a week for a year to afford where I really want to go (Austin)?

I guess what I’m most worried about with the working side is not having much of a social life or even time to do my HW. 

I’d appreciate any advice. I feel like I’m obsessing about this constantly, but this feels like such a big, daunting decision. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks!"

I'm basically clueless about what am I going to do right now, do you think it is better for me to go back to university to get an US degree or maybe going straight for Master school? I'm interested in computer science since it seems like demands for computer science graduates are pretty high in US. Personally I prefer to go to Master school since honestly I don't want to waste more 4 years in school but many threads in reddit said that master school isn't really worth it.

By the way I have no professional experience at all, I had an internship back in my home country but It was a local company and probably won't mean anything here.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm just taking ESL summer classes in my local community college (my spoken English is horrible, so is my writing) since they're free, but I don't know what will I do after summer ends."

c4x0o6,1,2019-06-24,Interview Tips: How to prepare an original equity trade idea? Part 1,Tradingwithswag,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/c4x0o6/interview_tips_how_to_prepare_an_original_equity/,"  Pitching a strong trade idea is the most nerve-racking and challenging part of the sales and trading interview process. It involves both technical and storytelling skills. But with great challenges comes great reward. A well-constructed and logical trade idea can leave a lasting impression on your interviewers and help you land your dream jobs at Wall Street’s major banks.

That’s why the Wall Strategies Experts have compiled this Ultimate Trade Idea Guide to help you aced it! In this guide, we will cover how to come up with an original trade idea and prepare your pitch in details. Let’s get started!

&amp;#x200B;

*What is a trade idea?*

A trade idea is an investment thesis to either buy or sell a particular security such as stocks, bonds, or derivatives. The thesis of the trade idea is supported by various arguments that can be quantitative and qualitative. 

**Qualitative** arguments include management experience, product rollout, customer perception, and industry theme. 

**Quantitative** analysis can be based on fundamental analysis and technical analysis. 

In any case, the essence of a trade idea is to build a winning investment narrative that is consistent and logical. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Why is trade idea important?*

Not only are trade ideas time-consuming, they’re also incredibly difficult to get right. Even professional traders and investment advisors can miscalculate and lose money on their trades. Good traders are profitable over time because their predictions are more likely to be right. The secret to their success is their methodical way to analyze the market that is both consistent and logical.

No one can predict the future. Your job as an intern or analyst is not to pitch a trade idea that is 100% profitable. You are, however, expected to present a thoughtful investment thesis and support it with evidence. *They are not looking for the right idea; they are looking for a strong and logical thought process!* Many interviewers view trade idea pitching as a litmus test for a candidate’s technical skills and personality fit. Here is why: 

First, the ability to grasp complex ideas is crucial for both salespeople and traders. Sales and trading professionals work with very abstract concepts. Being able to understand the market impact of interest rate, unemployment rate, and even monetary policies demonstrates your ability to learn and master challenging concepts and apply them to the real market.

Second, supporting an investment thesis with logical arguments and analysis is the essence of Sales and Trading. Each pricing and hedge on Wall Street is supported by an investment thesis. For a trader to successfully manage the risks on their book, critical and independent market analysis is needed. Blindly following the market can lead to disaster while original thinking promise a stellar career. For a salesperson, their job is to make the trade happen and support their client. A salesperson has to be able to come up with original ideas and express it logically and passionately to their clients. 

Lastly, they are looking for passion. Many candidates think that pitching trade ideas is strictly a technical challenge, and they fail to recognize it as an important opportunity to demonstrate that you are a good fit for the S&amp;T industry. No matter if you end up as a salesperson or a trader, your job will focus on selling securities to the bank’s clients. Though you can talk about your interest in the cover letter, a passionate and strong trade idea pitch will further convince you interviewers that you will have longevity and success in the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Can I reuse a trade idea I found online?*

Simply copying and pasting some random ideas from Seeking Alpha is not going to help you win that golden ticket. It lacks originality and doesn’t play into your interest and strength. Even worse, if you try to impress your interviewers with technical terms that you don’t fully understand, you will surely be challenged by them. Remember: salespeople and traders call people’s bluff for a living; they will drill you down until they get their answers. 

&amp;#x200B;

*What makes a good trade idea:* 

1. Originality      – originality is crucial. In many ways, salespeople and traders are      content creators. They generate trade ideas daily for their clients and      help them understand how market movements impact their portfolios.      Original ideas do not necessarily have to be unique. Two people can pitch the      same idea to long Apple, but you can support your idea in a different way      and make it stand out. 
2. Logic      – there are various ways one can validate an investment thesis. Some      investors focus on fundamentals and some focus on technical indicators.      There are no wrong answers, only illogical ones. Your goal is to build a      logical narrative of your idea and support it with evidence. 
3. Specificity      – trade ideas are only valuable when they are specific and actionable. A      broad recommendation is not sufficient. Details such as price target, risk      factors, and investment horizon can help your pitch stand out among      competition.
4. You! - Trade idea pitching is also a      fit evaluation. Your interviewers want to see that you are passionate      about your ideas and are confident explaining it in front of an expert.      They want to make sure that you will not freeze up in front of important      clients. Even better, a strong and powerful delivery can help interviewers      overlook minor flaws in your trade idea and increase your odds of getting      the job.

We recommend you to prepare at least three trade ideas for your interview: one long strategy, one short strategy, and one portfolio strategy. Although preparing trade ideas is time-consuming, your efforts will not go unnoticed and you can often recycle these ideas for other interviews in the same season. 

At Wall Strategies, we have helped many candidates create impactful and original trades ideas with our [S&amp;T Interview Guides](https://www.wallstrategies.com/interview-guides) and [Expert Coaching](https://www.wallstrategies.com/expert-coaching). In the following pages, we will teach you how to build an impactful and logical long equity trade idea from scratch. We will show you how to generate a trade idea and support your argument.

&amp;#x200B;

First post, thank you for your time lets get this story started. TLDR at the bottom.

I didn’t initially study for the Security+. I started with the A+, then moved to the Network+, and committed to the Security+. I studied the A+ when I was in university studying computer science and working part time as an IT technician for the engineering department. My studies started off serious and dwindled when school work got heavier. After a couple of semesters at uni, trying to get an internship, I was unsuccessful and left for other opportunities. I found a work force development program with a focus in Cyber Security. I jumped on this as soon as possible because it also guaranteed an internship, which I have been looking for. 

During the first six months of the work force development program we studied what I would say is the equivalent to the Network+ with a heavy emphasis in security. We also got a little bit of hands on PC hardware training. After that, the next six months was internship. I was hoping for a security internship; however, it was more network related. I got a chance to reinforce my learning from school and books with the internship experience.

After a year of hard work, I graduated the work force development program and landed a job in security without any certifications. Notice I said, “landed a job in security”, I worked as a social media expert and crafted reports on threats. This job was easy, and I took this as an opportunity to study for the Security+. 

First, I started by watching all the professor Messer videos on Security+ and took notes. That took about four to five months of studying, on and off. Then I saw a video on Darril Gibson’s book, “Security+ Get certified Get Ahead”, and bought the book after I finished watching all of professor Messer’s videos. I took the pre-assessment test in the book and failed miserably. At this point I am pretty burnt out and discouraged that I will pass this exam. So, said ""fuck it lets buy the exam voucher"". I got the bundle that include the CompTIA e-book, CompTIA practice exam questions and two exam vouchers, one is a retake if I were to fail the first time. Therefore, I spend another three months studying the everything, on and off. I was planning to take the exam March 31st of this year, but some complication prevented me from scheduling my exam on that date. So, I spend another three months “studying”. I finally scheduled my exam in two weeks ago. This is when it really hit me, so I started to cram. But again, I now work full time and taking online courses, not really setting up self-up for success. One week before the exam I crammed hard. I blew through all of CompTIA practice questions and reviewed all the chapters in Darril Gibson’s book. 

Finally test day is here, I crammed and not feeling confident. I did some lite review before going into the exam. Overall, the exam was hard. I was not confident in most of my answers. Some of them I understood and others I couldn’t figure out what they were specifically asking for. The first part for me was the simulations, they were straight forward. It was a lot of dragging and dropping. Then I had 72 multiple choice questions. These questions were super vague in my opinion. Compared to CompTIA’s practice exams and Darril Gibson’s practice questions, the exam questions were 10 times harder. It was like I must read the exam question, which were scenarios based, understand what is going on and then match it with multiple choice that were so very closely related. After struggle the entire 90 minutes plus the end survey, I was greeted with the “Congratulations you have passed” screen. I popped off, fist bumped the air. 

Overall, I would say to study as much as you can. Even if you have felt like you have studied enough, enough is not enough. There is no book or material that can prepare you for the exam questions. You really must understand the Security+ definitions and how it is applicable in any situation. My pro-tip would be to study every Security + related vocabulary/ lingo, understand how it is applied and take as many practice exam questions as possible. This will help with the scenario/ situation-based questions. 

I hope this post doesn’t violate the rules. If it does welp. I tried to keep it clean. If you have any feedback please let me know. Again, thank you for taking your time reading my story. I hope your quest for the Security+ will be better than mine.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Crammed hard, struggled 90 minutes through the exam and passed. The exam was very difficult. Study your ass off…"

Fast forward two years, I’ve been working in IT. For the first year and a half, it was good. Now I’ve come to a standstill since my financial responsibilities have increased and I’m living almost paycheck to paycheck. I’ve been looking into web development as my next immediate move since I had an internship for that in college, so I thought I’d start building a portfolio. My ultimate goal is in data science (or R&amp;D), so I also started studying this online.

The main is issue is not being hired or even interviewed since I don’t have a few years of solid experience (and no degree), and it seems like they want to see professional projects instead. So I thought I’d get a couple of pro projects under my belt, but I haven’t been able to get clients for a project; they expect free or cheap work for someone who hasn’t been in the professional field for long. There’s no way I can sacrifice my day job to work for free on serious projects.

I stopped building my website/blog right now since I’m so overwhelmed.

I’ve hit a wall, and I don’t know what to do. I have these ideas for projects that will require significant time, and that would be free work that’ll spam over several months and more. But I’m trying to land a development position in the next few months.

What am I doing wrong? What should I do to continue moving forward and ensure I land a development position soon?"

I'm currently working for a IT startup in the Baltimore and Washington D.C./ Northern Virginia area.  I do Tier 1/2 Help Desk for a Financial Firm with 200 end users. My company does a little under $4 million in revenue. I happen to be in the first intern in this company and I have since brought on two new employees. One is running the Cyber Security side of the company and the other is doing Assistant Operations. I began working for this company full-time in February  of 2018. Over the phone my boss and agreed on a 45k salary. Unfortunately, I have since been making 42.5k... I've completed the most tickets in the company's history and have been a backbone for the company by helping expand our team. I decided that I wanted to move away from the Help Desk and get my foot in the Cloud. So, I passed my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification in February 2019. I still have received no raise yet. I feel like I'm getting low balled and taken advantage of. We will me migrating a new client to AWS in the coming weeks and I will be the one working on this project.

If I get my AWS Solutions Architect- Associate certification in the coming months, what should be the salary that I negotiate with my boss?

&amp;#x200B;

**Please keep in mind the following:**

**Location:** Baltimore/ Washington D.C.

**Accomplishments:** First intern, got two people full-time positions, AWS Cloud Practitioner certified, most tickets in the company's history

**Experience:** 18 months help desk, 1 month AWS experience on job, 7 months of AWS self taught

I had to take a year off just to try and control my panic attacks and go on medication. Here i am, in my final few semesters and I'm not even sure I'm enthusiastic about my major and i'm lacking any motivation to do things for it. I feel like I should have done more with my life by now, have more friends, make connections and more but my experience in college hasn't been that fun or memorable in good ways. Coming back to college, i met some friends that were all younger than me but i felt like I had fun whenever i could hang out with them, which wasnt a lot. 

I got alright grades, but i am currently retaking one just to try and get into my major (compsci). I'm just thinking so much about the future where I have a few semesters left, have to search for an internship and then graduate and get thrusted into the real world. I don't have any plans for myself for the future because I don't see myself living in it. 

I've thought about suicide more than I want to admit and can't talk about it to my family or anyone really. I know how bad suicide is for everyone around me that cares about me, but sometimes it feels like the only option to escape everything. I'm not smart, not the best in anything especially my major, and I really don't see myself living the next 5 years of my life. 

I've always hated the way I am when it comes to actually trying to do anything productive because I either procrastinate or underperform on everything. With everything moving so fast and things getting more difficult, i'm probably gonna be the same old lazy ass who isn't ready for anything challenging unless I change myself.

I don't know where to start changing. I am capable of doing daily tasks and doing my job fine, but I hate everything changing so fast and anxiety flaring up and depressing thoughts whenever school and the future pop up. The only reason I feel i'm still here is because I do have a loving family, but I don't want to talk to them about my mental health at all because they don't understand it. All this money going into my college where it seems like it's moving like a fast conveyor belt with me trying hard to halt it or get off of it. 

It's getting to the point where I feel there's is no path where I am happy with my life again."

They told me no about getting out of the dorms and are sending me back to the financial advisor to figure out the real issue with my supervisor (the real issue is student debt, but they don't seem to be understanding this).

c50hgf,0,2019-06-24,Traffic Court Tomorrow,AleNeedsHelp,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c50hgf/traffic_court_tomorrow/,"ILLINOIS 

Hi, if anyone reads this before 9am tomorrow,I’d appreciate it. I’ll list the events in a timeline so that I don’t have to story-tell; I’m terrible at it. 

(November 4, 2018) 2 days before my 20th Bday- Was driving home from work in a suburb and I had a dinner date with my bf. Got stopped by cop who said I ran a stop sign. I saw him behind me for about 4 minutes so I know I would never break the law in front of him or in general. He says I’m guilty and can pay online but won’t have to show up for court even after I ask for a warning and tell him my birthday is coming up. So I take the ticket and can’t find it online once I do check it 2 days later. It takes 7-28 days for it to process according to the website. I wait the 28 days and still no online ticket. I know I should’ve called the Secretary of State Office but for some reason I didn’t. Might have been busy. So, I ignore the ticket for months thinking maybe it went away. 

(February 2019) I get mail saying I’ve been convicted for disobeying a stop sign. I NEVER got mail saying I had to go to court and I NEVER received a ticket by mail either. So now I have this on my driving record and I’m confused because I never even got a chance to defend myself in court. The letter also states I cannot have a similar offense for the next 24 months or else my license gets suspended or revoked. I was having a bad month and again didn’t do anything about this. I kept leaving it for later and honestly I thought getting convicted meant it went on my record but since I had no bill I didn’t have to pay the amount anymore. Till this day, I don’t know how much it has accumulated given it’s been some months. 

(April 2019) Morning of Easter Sunday- I’m driving home from someone’s house at 7am and I’m not even a block and a half away when I get stopped by a cop. Again, at a suburb. SAME OFFENSE. “Disobeying stop sign.” Now I’m infuriated! I drive past that street so many times and I know there’s a stop at that corner. It’s literally next to a park! No one can miss it! Anyways, I try to get out of it by telling him the truth. I need my car to get to my university classes and I already have 1 warning for the same offense from 2018. I explain my situation and the fact that I can’t have my license suspended. I ask if there’s a way to get this off my record and he says online courses, 4 hours, $169!!! So now I’m like yeeeaa... no, I’m contesting this. I don’t tell him this of course but now I’m really mad. No warning again, and another fine. So that’s $100 for the first ticket &amp; $100 for this second offense. 

Anyways, I contested the second ticket and my court hearing is tomorrow. First court hearing in my life. I know I’m not guilty of these 2 offenses but I plan on pleading guilty and asking the judge for a way to clean my record. Maybe through some community service? I still have that other ticket that may be accumulated and it could be close to $1000 or more. I hope the judge doesn’t have a record of that or else I’ll be in huge trouble. Some final details are: I have a red truck, I’m a 20 year-old female Hispanic, I live in Chicago, I passed Driver’s Ed with a B+ when I was 15 and had a clean record until these guys (5 years later) show up, my parents own the car and my name is not under the insurance although State Farm told my parents not to list me under it because it would be waaaay to expensive. Instead, they charge my parents $50 to cover me in case of an accident. I have no way of proving this to the judge however. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I bring up I have that first ticket and have the judge review what could be a humongous fine ? Or not bring it up and hope they don’t catch it... although me begging not to get my license suspended would indicate I have another similar ticket already. In that case, I would have to bring it up. Can the judge fine me for not having insurance technically? How do I fight not to get my license suspended ? I just got an internship and really need my car... thanks for reading this long! Ask if anything is unclear or simply comment. Much appreciated, thanks! 

WENT TO COURT: Waited 1 hour and 45 minutes only to be told my case was dismissed ! Judge was super understanding !"

i interned last summer and felt like i was in no way ready for it, i didnt learn any troubleshooting, basic stuff you should know as a tech, i did learn during the internship but still so much more to learn for hands on work

i scored another internship that is more of i got hired as a tech which is sick but it was a one man show so hes all about teaching me stuff which is awesome.

im continuing my education at a university to study cyber security, i would like  to get some certs as well as having my IT degree would hope it helps getting a job

I'll make sure we have a set agreement prior to doing any work in the future. Also, he works for his dads real estate company that will be implementing the software once it's done, so it's not just some kid with just an idea.

Okay so I just graduated college with a solid GPA and my bachelors in computer science. I never had any internships although I had a job doing basic HTML/JS work. I have lots of experience from classes alone.

I'm interviewing for full-time jobs but in the meantime I decided to do some freelance work at [Upwork.com](https://Upwork.com) to pay the bills. I found a project pretty quick building a web application from scratch in HTML/JS and it took me approx. 20 hours to do (\~17 hours of work, 3 hours learning) as it was a bit complicated. It's basically just a web application with a form that takes in the clients details for a real estate transaction and is used to create a Word .doc which can be downloaded from the browser. I've attached screen shots of the site so far (just need to improve the UI and add one more feature then i'm done).

The issue is that the client is a 19 year old who said he has a low budget but will give equity in the software as he plans to sell it to companies to use. So I will continue to work on it - add in backend dev like registration/login and eventually payment.

But for now, he's going to pay me for what I have currently. I see rates on here anywhere from $30-150+/hr for freelance work. Can anyone give me an estimate for how much I should ask for what I have currently?

Here's a pic of the site and then a pic of the created word doc that was downloaded:

[https://imgur.com/a/uFvvpfm](https://imgur.com/a/uFvvpfm)

Would appreciate any ideas as I have no clue what to charge lol. We decided that we would agree on a price once I was close to finishing as I was unsure how long it would take

Thanks!"

For a while I thought I would be happy just using programming to make processes easier, which is what I do right now, but I am only really enjoying the parts of my job that involve programming. And honestly,  I'm not in love with the actual engineering work I'm doing, I just like the act of programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also always enjoyed computers. I have built my own computers for a while now and have always loved the parts and software that computers use. This is why I am contemplating doing a career switch into computer science. The difficulty is Microsoft doesn't really want to hire an aerospace engineer who kind of uses python. So the current plan would be to stay an extra semester to finish a computer science minor (I'm supposed to graduate in December, but I would push it back to Spring 2020), and then get a computer science masters. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here's where any and all advice is welcome. Is this a good idea? How hard do you think it will be to get into a decent masters program (not like a top school just enough to land microsoft/nvidia/intel/etc. jobs)? Should I do a thesis or non-thesis track? How hard would it be for me to get a job afterwards compared someone who went down a normal path? IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE??? I'm nervous and kind of excited too. I'm just worried about taking a leap of faith like this and I think I could use some advice from people in the C.S. Field. Thank you for taking the time to read this!"

I had a post last year about finding internship and the community gave me tons of useful and amazing information! Firstly, I really want to those who can’t find internship even in the very last second  to know: don’t lose hope and keep finding! I got my dream company’s offer on Feb this year and it was pretty late for summer interns. 
Now I’m seeking for more advises as an intern. My company is a big company with at least 10 years legacy. It’s so hard and even impossible to understand all the architectures and it took me almost three week to get to know the part of my project. This is my first internship and I don’t really have any experience with big project so it always takes me long time to even understand the code and the tests. But it’s always easy and fast to ask the team but I just really don’t wanna bother them too much plus there is one teammate always told me would help me later and basically never came back so I asked one of them too many times :(
What do you guys think of asking questions and what the expectations of interns as the team and manager? I don’t wanna people think I’m dump or know nothing about my work but it really takes too long to figure it out by myself sometimes and I don’t think worthy it. 
Could you guys give me some suggestions? Thank you all soooo much!"

My first business website was designed a couple years later, and in that time I occasionally helped friends/acquaintances build personal sites or just did it for them. Added some CSS and probably other types of code I don't now recall over the years. 

From then until 2015 when I attended a coding bootcamp (and then went on to a CS program at community college), I played with code off and on as interest/time/life allowed. Other than being the go-to informal tech support person for family/friends and working on websites for family member's businesses on occasion, I didn't use any of the knowledge professionally. Spent over a decade mostly out of the workforce. 

Now I've graduated with an AS in CS/EE engineering (pre-engineering really, it's the first 2 years of a local university CS degree program) and am looking for work while continuing the BS. 

Problem is, figuring out how many years experience I should list on my resume.

It's my first desk job/full-time job, I'm a month in and for the rest of the summer it looks like I'm writing unit tests. Which is boring. As hell. And not very conductive to my learning. It has gotten to a point I have done nothing really the past few days of work, because I have the ability to slack of. That being said, my computer is facing an office walkway, so people are always passing by- I can't actually slack of. I am starting to loathe anything programming related. My dad is learning programming, and whenever he talks to me about it I just want to leave the room.

The worst part if that another intern, who somehow does less than me, is actually paid over 10% more (only a couple $$ per hour, but it adds up over the summer). No, the worst part might be the other interns- they do not socialize much at all. The ones I do talk to are very stereotypically CS- real life Reddit meme-lords.

The reasons why I am staying are as follows:

1) Pay. Getting money is sweet. On the other hand, it would be nice to have some free time this summer. I'd love a part time job, for this reason.

2) Parents. They want me there and I live under their roof, so. I've talked to them about it.

3) Resume. If I stick with CS, I do not believe I will go down the traditional CS software-dev path, but if I do stick to CS, this internship will look good.

I have considered non-traditional paths (see: military), and in those cases, this internship doesn't mean diddly-squat.

I'd appreciate some advice about making the internship bearable or how to proceed. It's mentally taxing. I don't see myself finishing this.

TL:DR; got tossed into an internship last minute, not having a good time, thinking about quitting and using my summer differently."

A bit of background:

* I graduated with a BA in Liberal Arts with a focus in Health Sciences (3.8 cGPA) with about 4 years of experience in 2 different labs focused on HPLC and data analytics for candidates for an antibiotic.
* I'm a ""pre-med"" in my gap year at the moment and during that time I've learned how to write code in my spare time but by no means is it anything more than novice level.
* I have some work experience creating scripts for medical documentation and implementing them across several physician groups but I'm unsure if it would be considered by a Masters program.

**My questions are:**

* I'm aware of programs such as OMSCS, MCIT but I was hoping to find similar programs which are in person and provide the same kind of ""prep"" coursework before starting the Masters level coursework.

* In the case of OMSCS, do employers view the in-person vs online Masters differently?

* If I decide to go on this path, when would it be most appropriate for me to start seeking internships prior to graduation from a Masters program (assuming I feel confident in my abilities)?

* Is it possible for me to avoid using a Windows machine? In the medical field, its the only option and I would rather slit my wrists if this is something that employers for the most part prefer.

* My hope is to become a Software Engineer with a goal of starting out in the ballpark of 80k to 100k outside of California and New York. Is this a fever dream or somewhat possible?"

Now to the topic:

2 weeks before I joined in a company with my friends referral. If you wonder how I landed that job, my friend got a project that he wanted to outsource. In the same time I was in job search. so he contacted me and asked whether I can do it or not. It's an e-commerce project. I told yes(because I was searching a job for almost 6 months). I done the demo for them, the boss liked it,  also told me if you're completing this we've another project(another e-commerce) too and he offered me a full time job, I agreed. 

There is no IT guy in our office, have an IT Supervisor and he's in our head office(I'm in branch office having more than 50 employees) so he only comes if we have any major problems in our office. So with these backgrounds they also assigned me as their IT Guy who need to fix the Desktops, printers, bio-metric, CCTV, Software issues, Network issues even manage and troubleshoot the AD server and Exchange.

I don't know how long I'll be here. I need to move to security side after completing the project (yeah they need to find another guy to manage the website) if this job didn't sucks or after 1 or 2 years.

So far I don't have a title (job position). The manager didn't given me anything. Please help me to find a title which won't be weird while applying a new job in future because I like to add it in my resume as experience.

Tldr at the bottom.

I've been saving money for a few years now, I had an internship before for a year and a small job before that where, all in all, I managed to save up a decent sum of money. Most of my friends and family knew I had a good bit saved up especially for a student and they also knew that I'd hoped to use it to either get myself a car or help keep myself alive during my PhD year's (that's even if I  manage to get funding to even be able to do a phD)

This money has just been sitting around not being used for a year now (my dad suggested investing but just never had the time to actually do it) but recently I managed to score a job for 4 months abroad and used some of that money from my savings to move and settle. I have enough left over to pay off my last few months of rent and be able to survive till I go home plus I get paid decently enough from this job to survive so I'll still have some money to live off of for final year of college and some.

Anyways, my laptop (which has barely reached 4 years) has stopped functioning, I got it for 700 back when I first started college and it's done well but I've always had major issues with it. I decided today impulsively to finally by the laptop of my dreams and I ended up paying 2000 including tax and a 4 year warranty plan. When I told everyone they acted like I had no right to spend my money, how stupid could I be to waste so much money on something not worth it!

My sister was the only one who told me that money is for spending and that Im still young and will have time to make up for it. I kinda felt better after our talk but the whole point of this long ass post is to say that I was happy, but then after listening to everyone, and a lot of them had pretty logical explanation for why I shouldn't have done what I did, I feel like an idiot for spending my money even tho I don't regret buying what I bought and on top of all that I feel angry for letting everyone influence my decisions and emotions soo easily.

Was it stupid of me to spend my money on something I've always wanted because it's expensive and I don't have the luxury to spend money like that? How do I stop letting people have influence on me like that, especially when it comes to financial matters? It seems like I always seek reassurance and when I don't get it, I become sad/angry.

Tldr: bought an expensive laptop. Was happy. Friends and family found out and told me off for spending money like it falls from trees. Now sad and angry and kinda regretful even though I don't want to be sad angry and kinda regretful."

c5ex6t,20,2019-06-25,Internship regret,cab084,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/c5ex6t/internship_regret/,"Hi everyone,

I just finished my second year of school and started a summer internship with a construction company. A bit of backstory: I started out as a civil engineering major, and as such, most of my work involves being out on the field. My initial contact was the president of the company, a family friend who I connected with last summer.

Last semester, I decided that civil wasn't really for me, so I switched to industrial. Following the advice of my dad (an engineer himself) and career counselors, and with the mindset that any job is better than no job, I decided to keep the internship I already had lined up. I told the president (who hired me) about my switch, and he didn't seem to think there would be any issue.

Now that I've started, however, I feel extremely out of place. I'm being given lots of drawings and geotechnical data, and I honestly understand very little. My IE coursework deals with data analytics and operations research; I switched out of civil before I had the opportunity to take any of the upper division classes.

Another thing I'm concerned about is how my resume will look with this internship on it. Last summer, I worked at my uncle's architecture firm. I don't even want to work in the built environment at all after I graduate, but being that I only have experience in that particular field, I'm worried I won't be as desirable to companies in other sectors.

Part of me wants to voice my concern to HR and see if I could instead work at the corporate office where an industrial engineer might be more useful since that's where the administrative work happens, instead of a satellite office that focuses more on projects. Would it be worth doing this?"

Looking for advice on experience / education.,OforOatmeal,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/c5f3nz/at_a_crossroads_in_the_very_beginning_of_my/,"Hey everybody. I'm a new, 23 year old graduate from community college with my degree in Computer Networking, and it's been a very busy couple months since graduating. I don't have any real work experience besides a small help desk internship I had right out of high school for a few months, and was planning on going for my Bachelor's this upcoming semester at a state university.

A bit of a wrench got thrown into this plan though when I got in touch with a recruiter that helped me find a position. It's with TEKsystems, a name that I've heard not get the best response on this subreddit, but the company and position they've placed me with is a help desk position for 6 months as a minimum for my contract, and I've been told that other people here through TEKsystems have stayed for many years. I've been told from the get-go that this will most likely not have room for advancement, but I'm willing to take it for the foot in the door. Overall, this job seems like a great entry point to get practical work experience, but the scheduling is going to make it almost impossible to take classes at Uni during it.

My current plan I had was to work with this company for at least the first 6 months of my contract, to get some practical experience in the industry (hopefully staying for longer if the position is good), and I was going to study for the A+ certification with my girlfriend during this time as well. I'm just a little bit worried that not working towards the Bachelor's will bite me in the ass, and I'll just be stuck playing catch up once this is done. I'm trying very hard to not put all my eggs in one basket.

Does anyone have advice on what I should do in this situation, or feedback on if this plan I have for the future seems like a good call? Much appreciated."

**My background:**

Mostly working in the service industry over the last few years, was hoping to move into IT/Security after taking programming, Linux SysAdmin, and cybersecurity classes at my local community college for the last year and a half or so. Last fall I took a course in computer networks (geared towards the Net+), the semester before that I took a course in Linux network admin (was over my head but I managed to pass), and over the last few semesters I've taken a lot of security courses. Together these gave me a relatively solid background but I was not very confident about taking the exam a month and a half ago. I also started an internship doing general IT helpdesk work at a local research hospital a couple months ago. Otherwise I have no professional IT background. I got a free voucher through my school and planned on giving myself about a month and a half to study.

**How I studied:**

I watched most of the Professor Messer videos and Mike Meyers videos on Udemy while taking down notes by hand. I have an insane-looking notebook filled to the brim with notes, scrap paper, and post it tabs now. If someone picked it up off the street they'd probably think I was trying to find the Zodiac killer.

Periodically took a LOT of practice exams to test my knowledge: Mike Meyers's and Jason Dion's on Udemy as well as ExamCompass, KaplanIT (got these through my school), and some Pearson PBQ simulations I got through a textbook bundle from my community college class. After taking each test I'd take notes on scratch paper on the questions I missed or the ones where I guessed. In retrospect it may have been better to keep these more organized.

This last weekend/yesterday I went over topics I was still struggling on. Was feeling pretty shaky since I couldn't get past the low 80's on the Dion practice exams. Yesterday I went through the exam objectives to make sure I had at least some understanding of everything. I also reviewed all my written notes and highlighted what I felt like I wanted to review in the last minute. Also, last night before going to bed I also put tabs on the notes I'd want to review right before going in.

**The test:**

Not going to say too much (you know, NDA and all), but I felt like a lot of it caught me off guard. The PBQs were a lot more involved than I thought they would be, and I imagined that I'd found plenty of places to get things wrong there. I was also surprised at how many questions there were on 802.11 wireless (especially wireless security), VLANs, VPNs, but in retrospect I think it was pretty well-balanced through the subject matter. Lots of phrasing that felt ambiguous throughout. I passed through all the questions within 55 minutes, then reviewed my flagged questions, then tried to review everything else before turning it in with 45 seconds to spare.

**My takeaways:**

Somewhere (I forget where exactly) I read to take the day before the exam off before studying. Maybe I was distracted the day before last because my gf's roommate had some salacious HBO dramas on in the background while I was studying, but in any case I don't think that would work for me. Going over my problem areas before taking the exam was key.

Jason Dion's practice tests were really hard (for me at least), but helped me figure out what I had to learn.

**What now?**

I told myself I'd buy Breath of the Wild if I passed, so I did that right after leaving the testing center. That might keep me busy for a while.

I think I may have a full-time job working help desk coming through at a local MSP (lots of tech companies in my city), so I'm looking forward to plying my trade and learning more there. If I get that job they may help me pay to take other cert exams, and other certs I'm interested in getting this summer include the Sec+, RHCSA/RHCE.

I definitely need to learn more about Windows so I may look into a Windows sysadmin certification track too—does anyone have any recommendations on learning Windows (especially AD) if I'm interested in moving from IT help desk toSysAdmin and Security?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Take practice tests, review the exam objectives, find your weak points and review those until you feel like you can't not get them right.

Thanks reddit! This sub was super helpful in figuring out how to study and prepare for the exam"
c5fnrs,1,2019-06-25,"Trying to make a switch into CS, feel like my current job is my biggest barrier to making that happen. Plan outlined, looking for feedback/thoughts.",mbguitarman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c5fnrs/trying_to_make_a_switch_into_cs_feel_like_my/,"TLDR: I have saved roughly $20k from my current sales position, and would like to quit my job to pursue applying for developer positions and filling gaps in development knowledge full time until I'm hired on.

Hey guys, I'm at a bit of a turning point in life and looking for some honest feedback on taking a leap of faith to starting a career as a software developer.

I'm a 26 year old that graduated with a BS in Business Information Systems. For CS majors that aren't aware of my program, graduates from this program get a healthy dose of business classes (marketing, finance, accounting) in addition to learning technical skills such as analytics, software development, network design, and database design. The caveat with this program is that you don't really get into the ""how things work"" of software development, you just learn enough to be dangerous and a lot of gaps are filled yourself if you are looking into being a developer. For a person who's fascinated with the business world along with the SE world, this made a lot of sense at the time.

Now my situation. I am a mostly self-taught (minus my major) software developer, with a number of personal projects, undergrad projects, and 1 software engineering internship under my belt trying to break into the industry. I didn't break into the industry right out of college as I wasn't doing a good job of conveying my skills in my resume, but that has been fixed and now I have been getting appropriate feedback. I feel like I've trial/error'd just about everything to get where I'm at currently and am getting close to actually landing a position. I've started to have more conversations, interviews, and 2nd round technical interviews with companies, but of the conversations I've had, I've been told that I need to get better at my technical understanding. Basically, I code the way a businessman would code. Google shit, hack something together, debug, rewrite, IF works (yay!), ELSE repeat. I've been told I can code, but that I lack an understanding of what it is I'm actually doing.

So why don't I just fill in the gaps do you ask? Well I believe my current role is the hindrance. I found myself in sales accidentally 5 years ago when my contact at my SE internship quit and I found myself without a position lined up for the summer. My friend introduced me to a hiring manager for a door-to-door sales role and I was given an offer immediately. I was good at it, and proceeded to go more and more down the sales path until I wound up where I'm at today. My dilemma, the work is soul crushing, my ethics are being pushed every day, and I'm just over the people you find in a sales path. People bragging about cheating on their SO's, doing drugs, being alcoholics, all traits I don't want to have as I continue to grow. I try to spend as much time at home coding after work and on the weekends to hone my skills so I can get out, but I can't help but be so worn down by anxiety and self-doubt all the time (all which is fair to say directly related to this role, my friends and GF have told me they can see it) that all I want to do is play video games and rest until I eventually have to go to bed and do it all over again. While I'm sure there are good sales jobs out there, I've spend a little over a year doing self reflection to realize this career track isn't for me.

The good news from sales is that I've saved a bit. I have about $17,500 right now, and come our Q2 payout I should have about $20,000 in savings. I would like to quit my job and use my 40 hours a week to apply for positions, and also use this time to fill my gaps in knowledge. I currently have hard fixed expenses of $1,600/mo but realistically I'd be spending about $1,800-$2,000/mo if I gave myself some dollars to have a life. Assuming I'm at a $2k/mo spend, I'd have about 10 months I could go before I'm broke, but knowing myself I would probably start looking for any job to get back to work after month 3 or 4 if I haven't found something by then (I'm not looking to blow through all my savings). Something to note as well is that my GF and I live together and I am NOT going to put the burden of me not working on her.

Being a salesperson does have it's advantages with this. I have excellent communication and soft skills, and have gotten over the fear of talking to any level personnel. Spending my days hunting for business has amassed me quite a list of connections here in Portland, OR. Right off the bat, my first week or two would probably be spent hitting up people on LinkedIn I've worked with to see if I could get introduction to their SE teams, and also spend evenings going to networking events/hackathons (I've heard from local tech meetups that this is a great way to break into the industry). There is a local coding bootcamp I've spoken to a few times about my situation and I based my estimated hiring timelines off my conversations with them. They've told me based off my resume, CV website I built, and conversations that I should be able to break into the industry in ~3 months if I put my nose down and grind for a position. They've said I'm on-par with the knowledge a student graduating from their program should have.

Another side note I should touch on. Our company does have a SE division that is actively hiring entry-level developer. I am trying to speak with one of the companies Ops Directors about presenting the idea of me switching roles to this department. This would be great, but honestly there's a part of me that has a bad taste in my mouth after seeing how the sales department operates. I'd almost feel better if I was away from this company in general.

Let me know your thoughts/opinions on this, I appreciate all feedback. If you have questions or something doesn't make sense, I'd be happy to clarify."

I’ve been good at my assigned tasks, I show up early to work, etc. I think my best course of action is to approach my manager before I consent to the background check (right?)


To be clear I never lied about my record, employers in my state are forbidden to ask (ban the box law) before putting forth an offer. After I accepted (around 3 months ago) they just told me to show up on a certain day for orientation then on boarded me (gave me a company laptop, etc). 


Do I have any chance of staying on? I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do if I lose the job cause I’ll probably end up homeless.

I recently joined a small IT startup as an intern with another student from my uni. The company was clearly understaffed, and the first few days passed without anyone giving us clear work to do.

The manager did task us with getting familiar with the system, and somehow we ended up describing the faults and limitations in one of the Python scripts the other employees are using. Mr. Manager was delighted, and asked us if we could rewrite it it--and we said yes, not knowing whether we were up to the task. Then he left us to do everything by ourselves--setting up a repo, planning milestones, designing the new API, etc.


It's been ~10 days (weekends included) since we began, and now I am unsure if we are up to the task. The first milestone--demonstrating a prototype of the new API in action--is in sight with a possible delay of 2-3 days. But I don't think we have the expertise or experience to push beyond that. I'm a rather zealous coder, and I feel I'm spending too much time double-checking PEP 8, PEP 484, and Google Style Guide, and not writing code fast enough.

I am especially worried because I recently overheard one employee skeptically claim that anyone with experience using the script for a long time is better suited for the task. I know this is true, and that us interns are prolly underequipped. Anyone can see our repo in the company intranet, so I assume the others will figure it out soon enough.

The Manager has left us alone for a while, and while the company structure is mostly horizontal, I'm afraid of what he would say if he learns about the situation. Should I tell him right away, or push forward to the first milestone (due this Friday)?"

So my story is: I worked with a mid-size Real Estate Investment and Development opportunistic firm for 6 years and moved up quickly to a VP position in 6 years. The fact the firm was family owned had a glass ceiling and therefore I decided to look for other opportunities. MBA was one of the options and when I got a call from one of the top B-schools (think top consulting target school - Majored in finance). I took it on hoping to take the time to figure out what and where next. But i was really clear I wanted to join PE, HF or AM/ER. Fortunately I was able to land a boutique hedge fund internship focusing on Equity Research in Singapore, which I really enjoyed but they weren't looking to hire anybody full-time so that ended without an offer, but made some good contacts (still in touch with my manager).

Post MBA I continued to look for work and started to get a little desperate and started applying for jobs I wasn't sure I even wanted. 5 months after graduation, I landed a couple of offers in Corporate and decided to join one of the major Auto companies in a regional office working in a Strategy &amp; Operations role. I enjoyed the role for a few months till I was learning about the industry and understanding what the role is about. Having worked in smaller one-office firm/fund it was exciting/enlightening to learn about how larger corporate works, challenges that are faced in terms of strategy development and execution when working with multiple regions.

Its been almost a year since I joined here and now each day I feel I made a massive mistake settling for something I dont give a toot about and looking to exit soon than later.

Any advice is appreciated."

I will be getting a BS in Information Systems in the fall. I was so focused on finishing school that I spent every summer taking classes and not looking for an internship. I have a connection with someone who works for IBM but my GPA(2.7) won’t get me far. I have no work experience and haven’t worked on any projects outside of school. Is it even worth it to apply to full time jobs after graduation or try to keep applying for internships? I’m also very fearful that if someone does decide to hire me I won’t know what I’m doing. I also find that I don’t always meet the skill requirements for most of the jobs. I will be making an appointment with my school’s career center, but I’m afraid they won’t be able to help me. I’m very interested in becoming a data analyst or working in cyber security."

c5l5su,34,2019-06-26,Help with Underperforming Intern,AltruisticJoke,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/c5l5su/help_with_underperforming_intern/,"I have several years experience dealing with summer interns and thought I was pretty good at it. I pride myself at running an internship program that is both paid and adheres to the ""no coffee/no copies"" policy (e.g., provides useful job training and acquisition of skills that can be used going forward).  I've hired a few interns at the company and helped many more find the right job for them in the field.

&amp;#x200B;

Until this summer.  Of the four interns, three are amazing.  The last one, however, is struggling.  He cannot work at all independently, is sloppy, and doesn't follow basic workplace rules. I started off managing him the way that I managed others, but he produced work riddled with mistakes and never asked questions, even when given multiple opportunities to clarify.  He has twice called out last minute (and two additional times not shown up at all), frequently comes in 90+ minutes late, and almost always leaves 30 minutes early and takes lunches longer than an hour.  I have changed my management style with him as much as possible (twice/day meetings, double checking all his work at multiple stages of the process, and refusing to approve his time card until he amends it to reflect the actual hours he worked, not the 9-5 he claims).  I have also spoken with him about proper attendance, proper use of a shared office (he decorated every available wall and table space and doesn't really understand he is sharing an office with other people who might want to use it), and about proper email communication.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, after adding up my time dealing with him (and the direct consequences of him flaking, angering others or producing sub--par work), I realized that I spent \~20 hours of my time. The work product he produced is probably less than two hours of what I could do with these tasks, so I was out 18 hours (and had to work the weekend to get my job done). Last week, after he arrived two hours late (he missed our scheduled 9:15 meeting and I was currently in another meeting), the office manager put him to work scanning old files for digital record keeping. With some supervision from her, he was able to do a pretty decent job.  We decided that he would try this for a week, and it turned out that he was able to scan with only 1 or 2 errors.

&amp;#x200B;

I planned to use this for the rest of the summer, but as soon as he walked in the door Monday (around 10:45), he was in my office complaining how the other interns get better projects.  He said he didn't like the first projects he was assigned and accused me of unfair treatment.  I indicated that I had to revise the tasks because of all the problems that happened in the first few weeks. He then threatened to get his university internship office involved as I wasn't providing job skill development. He didn't show up today and both members of our HR department are on vacation. My boss suggested firing him, but I am unsure whether that is even possible with this internship. As things stand, it has made trouble for other employees, other interns, and is keeping me from getting my work done.

&amp;#x200B;

I have paperwork. I have written documentation for things when I have noticed them (Call-outs, ghosting, coming in really late, and written records of some of the unusable products he submitted). I know one of our interns complained to HR about shared spaces, and I think one employee also complained because he was constantly bothering her instead of doing any work. However, I don't readily know how to get access to these before July 8th.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?  Thanks so much for any help!

**Background:**

26, Asian Male

&amp;#x200B;

**Academics:**

Undergraduate: UCLA

GPA: 3.86 (Magna Cum Laude)

Major: Chemical Engineering

&amp;#x200B;

GMAT: 720 (Q: 48, V: 40, IR: 3, AWA: 4)\*

\*I plan to write an essay addressing my low IR/AWA scores. Key points for that essay are as follows:

* When I officially decided to go for an MBA (March 2019), my work was going through a work intensive maintenance window.
* I was working \~80 hours a week, 6 days a week, including days/night shifts for 12 weeks
* I tried studying while working 80 hrs a week, but the physical and mental fatigue made it tough (my work entails physical activity - climbing through equipment for inspections &amp; technical analysis during this maintenance window).
* I realized I had to pick and choose what to study to maximize my score, so I choose to study verbal which was my weakest section and only briefly reviewed IR/AWA to familiarize myself with the sections.
* When the maintenance window ended, I had to transition from night shifts and had effectively 3 weeks to study.
* With a relatively strong work experience and GPA, I felt that would help bolster my IR/AWA scores (and even my quant score).
* Instead of retaking the GMAT, I felt my time was better suited researching MBA programs, determining post-MBA career, &amp; determining what I would do with my time at different MBA programs to achieve the post MBA career. 

I have received mixed comments on whether to address my low IR/AWA scores. Some have indicated that it may come off as an excuse, but I feel that I am simply describing the scenario and stating that I chose not to address it because I felt my GPA/WE were enough to show that I can keep up in B-school. Please let me know your thoughts!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Work Exp:**

Process Engineer at a Fortune 50 petroleum refining company

A sample of major projects/achievements include the following:

* Leading interdisciplinary teams to remove equipment deficiencies &amp; increase unit reliability
* Optimizing process unit to increase throughput &amp; generate millions of dollar/year in profit

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra curricular:**

I am very big on mentorship so a lot of my extra cirriculars reflect this:

\- Mentorship roles in a few engineering clubs as an undergrad. Help set up various events including: UCLA's Engineering Welcome Day, resume workshops, interview/internship prep, etc.

\- Recruiting lead at UCLA for my company. This extends to being involved in our internship program as a supervisor &amp; buddy. Also I have been involved with my local high school students (through my company) with discussions about college, STEM fields, career fairs, resumes, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goal:** 

Ideally, I hope to make a joint degree program that has exposure to tech to help switch in Tech as a product manager. 

My current role has me communicating with a wide audience from engineers, operators (essentially our customers), and management, so I feel like this aspect translates smoothly. The reason I am pursuing and MBA to learn the business side of this role (different analytical tools/metrics, case studies, hands on experience, etc.) and also learn more about the tech space (joining clubs, learning how to code, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

**Target Schools:**

MIT Sloan, Kellogg, Chicago, Wharton, HBS, GSB, Haas, Anderson, McCombs

I am planning to apply this fall for 2020 admit. I choose these schools based on the programs &amp; the location. I still need to do more research into the culture/fit and other resources that would help my career goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Please do let me know how realistic/unrealistic my goals and target schools are or if there are areas of my profile I need to address to make myself more competitive. Also, if there are other schools with a strong Tech MBA that I should be considering, please let me know. Thanks!"

During the internship, I was considered a Systems Engineer intern but did full-stack software development using Java, Angular, etc. I was pretty much a Software Engineer with the title of a Systems Engineer. They offered me a full time position after school and I took it thinking that I would be doing the same type of work. Fast forward to today and apparently, the entire department I was working with had a massive overhaul and I am now working with a different team. However this team is doing things I’ve never worked with. I now work under a Lead Systems Architect and am part of a solution design team. The work that was described was to help other teams figure out their needs in regards to their apps such as servers, DBs, VMs, load balancers, DNS, and a bunch of other things that I have no experience in. It’s pretty much networking, OS, and other things that I have no exposure to. I’ve never taken OS nor networking. I feel useless and disposable. I asked the lead if there is any programming and he said he hasn’t written a line of code since he got here. I’ve always thought of myself as typical Software Engineer... you know, actually programming and doing front end and back end work. I studied computer science in school with a focus in software engineering, even cramming leetcode for FAANG and the likes. This is a total career change that I didn’t expect and I’m not sure what to do. Does this thing happen a lot? Any words of advice is much appreciated. Idk just looking for guidance on how to maneuver this."

I am going to be a junior at a state university located on the east coast in the fall of this year. I live very very close to NY. So far I have had one internship as a freshmen into sophomore year of summer as a wealth management intern. Overall my GPA is quite abysmal due to my freshmen year fuckup and only now I’m making a slow rise (3.7 last semester and overall 3.1). Unfortunately I wasn’t able to land an internship this summer which I believe was due to a not so well put together resume which I’ve updated to be better now coupled with my ability to get write cover letters (which I have also improved on now). I’ve had interviews for two corporate finance intern positions (FP&amp;A and revenue recognition) along with an intern position at a hedge fund but unfortunately wasn’t given any offers. 

Coming from a very very poor high-school, I had know knowledge of finance whatsoever until I came to college and learned at my summer 2018 internship. Based on what I have learned so far I believe that my current goal is to hopefully become a financial analyst (i know it is broad but i would like to hopefully focus this into a more specific position). I understand this is still broad but I would like help on how I can have more focus on my career goals as someone who’s pursuing a degree in finance.  I always witness a lot of people who seem to have their shit together in this sub so early me feel as if I’m really behind as someone who’s about to become a junior. I wanted to make sure this summer I become stacked with knowledge when it comes to financial concepts so I can stand out more during fall recruiting. Will be looking 95% in NYC. 

1.) What specific skills should I have that can make me stand out more during fall recruiting for any finance internship. I am currently about to get certifications in Bloomberg market concepts along with SQL.  

2.) What wording should I use in my resume that makes it stand out more from other applicants’ resumes?

3.) when it comes to valuation modeling, DCF, and other forms of financial analysis and financial modeling, what free online resources can i utilize to make sure I have at least some knowledge of all of these things. 

4.) When it comes to finding a potential intern, what are the most important qualities that recruiters look for? 

I apologize if there’s any rambling in this. Even with my abysmal gpa, is there a chance for me to land a finance internship hopefully in the fall?"

I was given a task by a PhD student to investigate the origin of the gauche effect in certain cycloalkanes. At the end of this project, I came to the conclusion that electrostatics, rather than hyperconjugation (more commonly used explanation), provides a more accurate explanation. No mention of publication was made.

Recently, I discovered a paper (published in early 2018) authored by the student I worked with that claimed the same thing, which challenges the explanation that hyperconjugation as the cause of gauche stability, instead presenting electrostatics as the cause.

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware that there are various reasons that may explain my not being acknowledged, such as the work not being novel (i.e. the PhD student had already made the discovery and was just giving me a redundant project), or that they just honestly had forgotten my input.

My name is Jim Shang, and I live in Tokyo. I’m working in a large company, with a mediocre salary. I have a small group of good friends and I pursue some personal goals whenever I can spare the time. Basically, I’m your average Joe. Just another expat here in the land of the rising sun. I don’t see myself as anything out of the ordinary and I never expected anything out of the ordinary to happen in my life, certainly nothing quite like what I’m going to tell you. I want to write it all out in depth, therefore hopefully allowing me to clarify everything for myself, to convince myself I’m not losing my mind. I’m posting it here in the stupid hope that you all will read it, let others know this happened, so that this whole incident won’t just end up as a figment of my imagination.

I have been warned by both powerful and dangerous entities not to disclose any information, but I can’t hold it in anymore. There was nothing in the news, nothing online, absolutely NOTHING! And it’s been almost a whole year. It was as if by some dark conspiracy, everything surrounding the incident has disappeared. Erased! The Wikipedia pages, the articles, the damn websites! It’s all gone. It was as if the whole thing was a hallucination I cannot forget. I have seen things I don’t understand and people have died! Yet, everyone around me acts like nothing happened! As if I never even went to that island. Even my friend Hannah, with who this whole nightmare started with, had gone missing a couple of weeks after the incident, and no one is aware! Everybody at the office thinks she’s just up and left! Some people even told me she’s gone back to the UK. It’s all absurd! Nobody seems to think anything is wrong...

I’ve tried digging, but every time I came close to some possible related information, someone had sent me threats by email or by text. They’re watching my every move and I don’t know what to do. Yet, I’ve kept quiet for so long and I’ve finally convinced myself that that was the wrong thing to have done. Because a few days ago, I received a text from an unknown number. The text contained only an image. It showed a dirty wall with the following scrawled on it in what I now believe is blood:

&amp;#x200B;

*I’ll remmbr u, pls 4giv me*

&amp;#x200B;

I’m sure it was Hannah. I’m positive. And now I know deep down...she’s dead. I can’t imagine where she was or what she went through to leave such a message, but I know what it meant. That was her last goodbye. To me.

If I end up disappearing, or dying in an accident, or god knows what, at least I will have a clear conscience. I owe this much to Hannah. Or maybe I should have died along with the others back on that damn island. I’m no longer innocent after all that. Maybe I’m just going crazy. I really don’t know what to think anymore.

So my name is Jim Shang. I live in Tokyo. Please remember this because I don’t know how much longer I’ll be alive. It all started last year, in July, 2018.

My work is at the Mori Tower in Roppongi, home to multiple international companies in Japan, such as Facebook and Goldman Sachs. My job is not grossly important nor particularly challenging, as I’m simply tech support. However, one perk is I do end up assisting many different kinds of people, both in high and low positions.

It was a Friday evening in that July and I was packing up to head on home. I remember it as a hot day, the setting sun shining bright orange through the panorama windows and the office floor calm as most employees were already out. I went through the security doors and hall, and waited for the down elevator. When the doors opened, a girl was the only occupant. Her name was Hannah Litner, a market analysis lead from the floor above me, and we had kind of started a friendship a few months before. I helped her out with major computer issues, she bought me Starbucks, we swapped some stories and compliments. I made a friend.

We greeted each other and asked the usual questions on our ride down. How are you? How was your day? TGIF! That kind of thing. To be honest, I could already tell her energy wasn’t really on par with what I expected Friday Hannah to be. I was going to ask her if something was bothering her, but when we reached the Lower Landing, I didn’t have to.

“Are you doing anything now Jim?” She asked as we scanned our badges and went through the security gates to the tower lobby.

“Not at all,” I said, “yourself?”

“Care to join me for a quick coffee?” She motioned towards the Starbucks in the lobby and I quickly agreed. She seemed slightly on edge, not her usual smiling cheerfulness, but like how people often are when they’ve received an unexpected problem. We walked over, waited in line, chatted about the crap we had that day. I remember she ordered a Frappuccino, grande. I went for a tall Mocha. We took opposite sides of a small table in a corner, but since this Starbucks is open to the whole public lobby area, it wasn’t quiet. Too many people chatting and moving about loudly, and some woman in sunglasses a few tables down kept taking pictures of her coffee cup. Snap, snap, snap! Once we sat down and got settled, Hannah began talking in a lowered voice, as if telling me a secret.

“So, have a look at this,” she reached into her handbag and drew out an envelope. A standard sized, off-white envelope, and as she handed it to me, I noticed it had beautiful hand-written maroon ink that said ‘Miss Hannah V. Litner’ and then under that, ‘CONFIDENTIAL’.

“What’s this?” I asked her as I took it and scanned it all over, noticing that the paper felt solid. This was superior to your regular post office 10yen recycled material.

She looked at me with a small shake of her head, shrugging her shoulders. “No clue. I went to lunch today, and when I got back, it was on my desk. Apparently nobody saw who delivered it. I thought it was a joke at first,” she pointed at the envelope and took a chug of frap, “but then I read it and it was real...weird. Take a look.”

I thought since it said ‘confidential’, I probably shouldn’t have. Looking back, if only I just refused and left her business alone. If only I kept my nose out of things far above my pay grade, I could have avoided it all. Yet I didn’t. I took out the twice folded A4 sheet of paper, opened it up, and my eyebrows rose as I read the contents:

&amp;#x200B;

*Dear Miss Hannah V. Litner,*

*You (and one additional companion) are cordially invited to attend the Evening Celebration of the Grand Opening of the Minami-Iwo Jima Estate.*

*Your Host: Prof. Sagara Hirotoshi*

*Should you choose to attend, please review the details and register with the link below, no later than July 31st.*

*\[A QR Code\]*

*With sincere regards,*

*The Minami-Iwo Island Project Team*

*Hisae Holdings*

*\[A red hanko stamp from who I believed to be Sagara Hirotoshi\]*

&amp;#x200B;

What surprised me first wasn’t the invite, but the words themselves. They were handwritten beautifully in dark red fountain pen. The flourishes were expertly done with a feminine flair, the QR code printed perfectly center and clear, the hanko fresh looking, ever so slightly smudged. I thought if the letter was a practical joke, someone with professional calligraphy skills should be questioning their life goals.

I folded the paper back up and slid it back in the envelope. Hannah was already typing something into her phone and when I made an ‘err’ sound, she stuck the screen in my face and drank more frap.

There was a Wikipedia page about that Sagara Hirotoshi guy, the host. From my quick scan, I picked up that he was a very successful and renowned individual, and very old. A professor in chemical engineering with two PhDs, head of Hisae Holdings (a notable Japanese investment company), board member of both ANA and Mitsui (one of the largest conglomerates of Japan), entrepreneur and philanthropist, and more! Honestly, I didn’t know what to think. Seemed to me like I really should have made more sophisticated friends.

“Well, congratulations! You’ve certainly got friends in high places!” I said, half jokingly. Hannah didn’t really react. She looked at her phone again with a frown and pulled up a saved website, the QR code link. She placed her phone on the table so I could scroll freely.

“That investment company,” She said as I scrolled through the webpage, “Hisae Holdings. It’s pretty big. I had a scholarship from and then internship with them when I was living in London!”

I nodded my understanding. The website though was even more strange. It had a backdrop of the ocean and sky, with a triangular, forested island rising up in the middle of the horizon. The overlying text of Japanese and English was in stylish blood red italic font very similar to the letter, and looked surreal, like one of those sleazy nightclub websites, except more tasteful. It explained about an opening ceremony of a new state-of-the-art exclusive resort estate on Minami-Iwo Island, close to the infamous Iwo Jima (‘jima’ means island btw), the one from that WW2 movie. A private residence to Prof. Sagara himself and his guests. The upcoming event would start on Thursday, August 9th at 5pm and guests would need clothing from then through to Sunday, Black Tie for the first day. It also had a place to enter your name and confirm.

“Well, this certainly isn’t a joke.” I chuckled and slid her phone and the envelope back across the table. “Seems far too professional. You gonna go?”

Hannah gave another shrug. “It can’t be right. I was just an intern Jim, in a HUGE international company. Why would said company’s ojisan (an old man in Japanese) even know my name? Isn’t it crazy?”

“Well it could be a system error? Perhaps there’s another Hannah Litner.” I smiled, but Hannah shook her head some more. She stared at her phone and tapped at the envelope on the table.

“The letter was hand-written wonderfully, wasn’t it. And they wrote ‘V’ specifically for my middle name, Victoria! I really doubt there’s another Hannah Victoria Litner who worked for Hisae.” She sighed with a frown and downed her drink. She was behaving weird and it was obvious there was more to this than she let on. She talked as if she was thinking out loud, and I wanted to ask what connection she really had to this Hisae Holdings company, but her offbeat demeanour made me hesitate. “I don’t doubt it’s real,” She continued, “but I wonder why they’re inviting ME to something so, well, exclusive. I’ve never even met this Sagara Hirotoshi guy. Can you even imagine going?”

I admit I would have loved to, and I imagined an island paradise with a Tony Stark-esque villa, where a bunch of royal-looking businessmen and women were drinking champagne and talking about stocks and poor people.

“Why don’t you sign up?”

I should never have said that. I should have told her to forget it.

“I was considering it, just to test it out. If it was a mistake, it wouldn’t work right?” She gave me a lopsided smile and tapped the text field on the website, “You’re my plus one in this. You’re supporting me on this. If anything crazy happens, I’m blaming you.”

I agreed and joked about all the free champagne I was going to drink. Hannah seemed a little more relaxed but you could see the worry in her. I really didn’t consider it an issue as it must have been some clerical error on the administrator’s side, but she seemed to be torn. I remember thinking I didn’t even have a tuxedo, so how would it look if I rocked up at this old dude’s private island party in jeans and a llama t-shirt. And what if it was all real! Wouldn’t that be a hell of a networking opportunity?

And so she typed in her full name, checked the +1 box, hit enter, and the page refreshed to a black background with more flourished red words that said:

&amp;#x200B;

*We look forward to welcoming you, Miss Hannah V. Litner, and your companion.*

*Please meet your chauffeur at the Grand Hyatt Hotel Entrance, Roppongi, on Thursday, 8th August, 2018 - 8pm.*

*Your* ***utmost discretion*** *regarding this Event would be dearly appreciated.*

&amp;#x200B;

That last part was certainly strange and practically confirmed the invite’s legitimacy, and we spent another hour or so talking in a more lighthearted tone, swapping ideas on what this was all about. How she came to receive this invite, and why it was so mysterious, and how this ‘chauffeur’ will turn out to be Frankenstein’s monster. Yet we agreed to meet up at the stated time just to see what would happen. Worst case scenario, we’d go see a movie instead if it was all a big farce. But I should have known better.

I should have noticed small details that meant something was wrong, like the fact that the same guy in a suit had walked by our table far too many times while we were talking, just to get sugar, or how Hannah’s name was written on her coffee cup, even though she never mentioned it to the baristas, or that the coffee-loving, indoor-shades woman a few tables away (who’s called Sun-Hwa Yu as I’d later find out) was never so interested in her latte, because she had been secretly taking photos of me and Hannah the whole time. And finally that island, Minami-Iwo Jima, you can go check it online now, Google maps if you will. Part of the Ogasawara island chain. It’s just a rock. There wasn’t anything there. There has NEVER been anything there.

I’ll continue next time as it’s late here. My team lead has been acting weird recently and I fear it’s to do with me, so I need sleep to keep my head clear. Thank you.

c5qeg9,2,2019-06-26,Are my parents being too over bearing?,muchosad,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c5qeg9/are_my_parents_being_too_over_bearing/,"This is a repost from r/relationship_advice. I'm just trying to get as much insight as I can from as many people as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I feel like my parents are too overbearing when it comes to my romantic relationships. They try and influence who I date, what I do with them, and what I'm allowed to do with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Situation:

I am going into my 4th year of university. It's summer break and I am currently working as an intern. I've been living with my parents while I work. During the school year, I live alone because of how far school is from home.

I am currently in a very happy relationship with my girlfriend (20F). We've been dating for about a year now. However the issue arises with my parents. They disapprove of her because of her socioeconomic status and difference of upbringing. My family would be classified as upper-middle while her's would be classified as lower. She also comes from a family with an abusive father. They feel like this difference will affect my relationship with her in the long term. I agree it could happen. So far no big issues. Regardless, I think it's up to my discretion to continue dating or break up.

Also I should mention, My girlfriend is moving back to her home country in about a week. She will be there temporarily but the duration is unknown yet. The earliest I would see here is after my graduation. We've talked and decided we would like to continue dating and make long distance work.

&amp;#x200B;

Main Issue:

Often times I feel like my parents cross the line between being good/caring parents and overbearing/no boundaries parents, especially when it comes to my romantic relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Example Scenarios:

\- My parents get upset I come home late from dates with my girlfriend. Dates happen about 3-4 times a week. I usuallysee her right after work (so about 6) and I get home any time between 11:00pm - 1:00 am. Is this something myparents should be upset about?

\- My girlfriend and I would like to spend a weekend before she goes away. My parents are saying no. Do I even needtheir permission?

\- My parents have tried to talk me into breaking up with her by saying things like: ""Oh she's too different, life will behard with her"", ""There are so many more fish in the sea"", ""You could do better"". Things like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice/Question:

I get my parents are concerned. I mean what parent isn't worried about their child? But my question is: are they going too far? Am I really not responsible enough to be deciding things on my own? Am I just being an angsty teen or are my parents being to intrusive?

Any advice would be helpful. I'm really just trying to gain more perspective on my situation. Thanks reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Also let me know if I'm missing anything, I'm pretty new to reddit!"
c5qmhl,1,2019-06-26,Discussion: doing a bachelor degree after Junior College and some years in the market,iagoxmm,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/c5qmhl/discussion_doing_a_bachelor_degree_after_junior/,"Hello people! I would like to hear some advices and other perspectives about my situation that is bugging me a lot lately.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my career relatively early: together with high school I had a 3-year Junior College in Data Processing/Computing. Right after finishing it, I got an internship for one year, that got me hired afterwards. During the internship and first year as full time employee, I was doing a part-time bachelor in Information Systems, that would probably take me more two years to finish.

&amp;#x200B;

After my second year as full time employee, I got an excellent offer to work in a different continent, and I end up dropping university and moving out for it.

&amp;#x200B;

My current situation is: I'm a Data Engineer with 4 years of experience, a Junior College degree and an unfinished bachelor degree. My career is evolving pretty well I would say, this job wasn't really interested in my education level and several ones that contact me from time to time are not too, but I cannot say it's a rule around here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some friends of mine that are working here, also as Data Engineers or related areas, really recommended me to finish the degree.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion I wouldn't never stop working for some years and finish my degree or maybe start over everything again, so the only option that I see is to do a distance course during my night time. It wouldn't be so hard too, since most of the things I already learned or used at work at some point. My doubts here is that if this invested time and a bit of money would bring me some return.

&amp;#x200B;

So, would you think it would be necessary the degree?

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks for the answers!"

I’ve recently become interested in applying for a baseball R&amp;D internship, which uses the insights from data analysis to make an impact on the advanced scouting process. Under the qualifications section it states an “experience manipulating and analyzing data sets is required” and “predictive modeling experience preferred.”  For reference, i’m going into my junior year in college as a comp sci major and up to this point i have taken primarily java courses and a data analytics course where we learned mostly just the basics of coding with R and did a little bit of modeling as well. I was wondering how much knowledge these employers expect as well as whether what i’ve learned would be enough for the internship"

Did I ruin my whole career?,Juklimar5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c5r46r/became_web_dev_because_no_other_options_did_i/,"Quick backstory - I'm 26, recently graduated university, I didn't have the best grades and because of that I did not have a lot of options when it came to jobs and internships. In my second year, I applied to a ton of internships and only one accepted me, I assumed it would be better than nothing and took it - the internship was a web dev internship and it was super boring. I hated every minute of it and genuinely almost felt like Computer Science wasn't for me anymore after this internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my third year started, I was doing audiovisual stuff, graphics, machine learning and algorithmic stuff which was interesting and fun. But then I had the same problem - I applied to a lot of companies, but only heard back from a couple of them.

&amp;#x200B;

One of them was a graduate scheme for a large finance/insurance company and I thought it would be fun. The job description just said ""Software Engineering"" and talked about C# and ""Solving new problems every day"". Well I got the job and it's fucking web development.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing PHP, Javascript, Ruby and a bunch of frontend stuff. I hate my job now and I don't know what to do because my contract is a 2 year contract. I don't even know what I want to do with my career, I don't really know what you CAN do besides web development at this point, but I hate it. I hate CSS, I hate Php, HTML literally gives me cancer every single time I look at it and javascript might be the worst programming language ever made. I am at such a crossroads at my life right now, because I feel like because of this job - I can only get web development jobs in the future and nobody else will even look at my CV. But also, I don't want to do web development and I don't even really know what else is there to do besides super low-level stuff that I am in no way smart enough for.

&amp;#x200B;

Have I basically fucked myself completely?

My resume got selected for an internship at Google for fall but I couldn't move forward after the coding sample.

I can do anything to get an internship, I just want some guidance.

I am proficient in building Mobile apps with Flutter and Front-end apps with React and bit of Node.js too and I thought these things give me a chance to interview at Google too.  I like doing coding problems in C++ and I have done with the concepts of important DS like trees, graphs, heaps, hash table etc.. also good with DP and I am solving leetcode consistently to keep up my level.

Can I assume that if my resume passed a screening at Google, I will have chances for other big companies too in the upcoming recruiting season?

c5ttac,6,2019-06-26,Advice from the other side,King_Cheetah19,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c5ttac/advice_from_the_other_side/,"I will be starting college at the college (not my dream school but the school I think is ultimately right for me) this fall so I wanted to leave all the advice I could for everyone on this sub. 

Firstly: Start your applications as early as you possibly can. I got accepted to a University overseas that I really shouldn't have been accepted to but I got my application in extremely early and they got back to me quick. Early deadlines help so much in getting you consideration before the majority of other students apply to the same colleges. 

Secondly: At least at the colleges I was looking at, weighted GPA did nothing for me. I was .027 GPA points away from a $10,000 scholarship to a college because they were looking at my unweighted GPA. If they looked at my weighted score I would have gotten the scholarship and I might have gone somewhere else for college. Don't rely on your weighted GPA! Make sure you can back it up with your unweighted GPA and SAT scores.

Thirdly: Continue to work hard throughout the end of your junior year and continuing into your senior year but don't overburden yourself. Senioritis will hit, and it will hit hard. Don't let that happen in the semester(s) that you a lot of classes you cannot handle. That will kill your GPA and might hurt your SAT score. 

Fourthly: Take advantage of any help you can get on your essays. My school had an essay workshop that I didn't take advantage of and my essays were horrible. If a teacher offers to help you with your essays, take them up on that offer. Essays are where the colleges will look for you to stand out. They are the most important part! Ask for advice on your essays, it will make your applications so much stronger.

Fifthly: Regarding your essays, make them different and personal for each college. Look up things that are specific for those colleges. Email professors and ask if you can get summer internships with them. Ask them any questions you have about the college. Then refer to them in your essay! This will help tremendously in your application and you will stand out. You need to stand out, work on ways to do that. Do not write an essay on events that many other students could relate to. Be unique, colleges want diversity so you have to be different from other students.

Sixthly (pretty sure that's not proper English): Don't put yourself in a situation in which you incur a lot of student debt. Take care of your future first and student debts will stay around for a long time. College is important but the education you get at some universities are not that different from others (especially if you aren't comparing an Ivy League to a regular college) Have back ups and have back ups to your back ups. Going to your back up isn't the worst thing to happen to you. You will be ok.

Seventhly and most importantly: Believe in yourself! Back up plans aren't bad. You don't need to go to an Ivy League university in order to be successful. Don't get dissuaded if you get rejected from your top choice. There are so many other colleges out there and they would be lucky to have you. Your GPA and SAT score do not determine who you are as a person. Personally I think standardized tests are horrible ways to measure potential and intellect but it's how colleges do it for right now, we have to play their game. You don't need a perfect GPA or SAT score to get into college, even the Ivy league schools. But like I said earlier you can still be extremely successful if you dont go to an Ivy school. And do not ever let your family, significant other, your friend, or anyone else influence your decision. It's your future not theirs. They can offer you advice and it may help you decide where to go but you have to decide this for yourself. Put yourself in the best place to succeed not where someone else wants you to go.

You all are going to make it in the world, no matter what happens when you start applying to universities. You got this! Goodluck to all of you!"

c5v6fq,0,2019-06-26,"I'd rather attempt suicide than look for another job, and neither receiving disability or living with parents is an option. What are good jobs for people with depression AND anxiety AND undiagnosed chronic joint pain?",jaggedjottings,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c5v6fq/id_rather_attempt_suicide_than_look_for_another/,"Long post, TL;DR in the conclusion paragraph.

Before y'all ask, I'm taking meds and therapy.  I fell into a major depressive episode in January, and in February I started seeing a therapist who diagnosed me with MDD with anxious distress specifier, and I saw a doctor who put me on SSRIs.  Unfortunately, my doc is rarely available for appointments, so I'm still on my first SSRI trial, which isn't working very well.  I'm hopeful I'll eventually find some meds or somatic therapies that work for me, but I don't know how long it will take, or if I can hold out mentally and financially in the meantime.

I've had depressive episodes in the past, but only one as bad as this, and I didn't recognize the symptoms until now (hence the late diagnosis).  I've only been in my current negative mindset since January, but I've been feeling perpetually drained and exhausted since the summer of 2016.  I've had a blood panel test which ruled out a thyroid disorder and other physical illnesses, so I figure it must be due to the depression.

Things aren't going well with my therapist either.  She keeps saying that she doesn't think she is helping me very much, and expresses a plaintive hope that my meds kick in soon.  Maybe she thinks I'm too far gone.  I'd like to switch to another therapist, but she is the only one who takes my insurance within a 45-minute drive.  My roommate recommended her therapist, who is only 8 blocks from my house and is supposedly excellent, but she charges much more than I can afford.

I recently quit my last part-time, minimum-wage job because I was getting near-daily panic attacks.  Though I have anxiety, I never used to get panic attacks until I started SSRIs.  Hmmm...

I'm 30 years old, and I've now worked 10 jobs in my life.  Every single one of them made me actively suicidal until I quit (or was let go), at which point I felt much better.  My job history in brief:

* I've worked as a laboratory technician on 3 occasions (I quit because of chronic joint pain, abusive supervisors, or both)
* I've worked data entry at an insurance company (quit over joint pain and low pay)
* I've been a data science intern at a software company (contract wasn't renewed because of poor performance)
* I was the customer success manager at a different software company (supervisors asked me to resign because of poor performance)
* I worked as an asbestos abatement contractor (quit after 1 week due to joint pain and acrophobia from climbing on rooftops)
* I've had 3 different customer-facing retail jobs (quit over anxiety, depression, and low pay)

The funny thing is, when I'm not forced to work for a living, I'm the happiest person I know.  I've had 2 different 8-month spells of ""funemployment,"" and emotionally I could literally keep doing that forever.  Just hike in the mountains, play with the cat, and surf the internet.  For a long time I considered myself an extremely content person, except for the whole ""forced to earn a living"" fly in the ointment.  But I don't have a trust fund, I can't live with my parents because they retired to another country, and I'm not eligible for disability.

You might ask: ""But what about your chronic joint pain?  Shouldn't that qualify you for disability?""  Funny thing about that.  My last lab job carried insurance that allowed me to get MRIs on my left elbow, right wrist, and right shoulder - the joints where the pain is the worst.  The MRIs came up with absolutely nothing.  When my supervisor asked with concern in her voice what the test picked up, I truthfully told her that they found nothing.  She responded by writing me up for faking an injury to get out of work.  I quit not long after.

So here I am.  Short on savings, completely directionless, and seemingly having a choice between suicide, homelessness, or pain/exhaustion/daily panic attacks at whatever new job I manage to get.  In my history, any job that my brain could handle, my body couldn't, and vice versa.  It appears that neither manual labor or repetition-heavy desk jobs are an option, and until the meds start working, I'd rather be perpetually unconscious than forced to think on my toes all day.  So, do you nice folks have any job recommendations for someone with depression AND anxiety AND undiagnosed chronic joint pain AND who's nearly broke?

EDIT: I'm not trying to say that my needs/wants are reasonable.  They are absolutely not reasonable, which is why I'm doing meds and therapy, so I can change direction.  I'm merely looking for something that can tide me over financially until my course correction starts to actually work."

c5yndg,0,2019-06-26,Physics graduate with nearly no programming experience. Should I even apply?,FirstBabyChancellor,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/c5yndg/physics_graduate_with_nearly_no_programming/,"Hey guys!

So, I just finished my bachelor's degree in Physics. Alongside a rather low GPA (2.81) because I was having financial issues throughout and had to work alongside my degree, I also have very little programming experience.

The physics program at my university is basically shoehorned into an electronics and electrical engineering degree, with a bunch of core physics subjects to make it a 'physics' degree. As a result, I have a lot of the mathematical and especially statistical training I imagine would be good in a CS program and I also have a good background with electrical engineering because I also took most of my electives in that field - they were the only one on offer anyways - such as Digital Electronics, Electronic Circuits, Electromagnetism I and II, Microelectric Circuit Analysis, Process Integration and IC Manufacturing, Solar Cell Technology, Semiconductor Physics and Devices. I'm basically half an electrical engineer at this point.

So, I think maybe I do have some of the tools that they would require for the program, especially since they consider electrical engineering majors to be a 'relevant degree'. However, what I severely lack is programming experience. We only had one semester on MATLAB as part of my course on Computational Physics. That's kinda programming, but not really. I'm also working on filling in my gaps in this regard (MIT's Intro to CS using Python) and I'm enjoying the subject matter a lot, but I won't be finishing that MOOC before August, either.

With all the above in mind, should I even apply to this program? I do have a lot of the hardware and math background, but not much of the programming requirements. A physics degree is no joke so it does at least speak to my ability to learn. I also did a final year project on quantum physics (something almost all the students, even with perfect GPAs avoided) and did a research internship in an experimental photonics lab without much experience in the field so I can use that to pad my essays and claim I am a fast learner, but without a solid programming background, I'm assuming I just have no chance?

I want to transition to computer science for the rest of my career and this program does seem like a good fit for me (my grades won't suffer nearly half as much because I also work online so just the ability to switch between work and studies with a click will save hours in commute time and so on), but I'm unsure if I have any chance of getting in, especially after I've looked over some of the background essays from people on this Reddit.

What do you guys suggest? Would the OMS Analytics program be a better fit, since they'd have more lax requirements when it comes to programming?"

Repost from another sub because it was deleted. I was told it was better suited for this one.

Depending on the specific topic, I am pretty progressive in someways, and also pretty conservative in others. For example, I’m fairly conservative when it comes to things like freedom of speech and gun rights, and peoples rights to defend themselves. However, when it comes to things like gay rights, women’s rights, and just basically allowing people to live their life how they want to as long as they’re not hurting anyone else, I’m very progressive. In short, I pretty much have a live and let live mentality, and I don’t believe anyone should have the right to force their own morality or religion on anyone else. 

Because of my, for the most part, laid-back view of things I generally get along with people regardless of what their political, social, or religious leanings are. However, lately I’ve found it more and more difficult to deal with certain people in my own family and social group. I’ve actually had more of a problem with the conservative minded people lately. 

For some reason, they seem to think there’s absolutely nothing wrong with making blatantly racist, sexist, and homophobic comments in person and on social media. They don’t seem to have any problem whatsoever putting their ignorance on public display, and anytime I call them out on it I get called a libtard. What’s even worse, I just finished my first year of law school and am currently in my summer internship. This seems to be something they love to throw in my face for some reason. 

I regularly get told in person and on social media things like;

“Those liberal professors have brainwashed you!” 

“You don’t seem very smart for a lawyer!” 

“You’re okay with murdering babies, so I hope some n——er rapes your wife and you can jerk off at the thought of killing it!”

These are only SOME of the things that have been said to me. Lately I’ve tried to avoid getting into arguments like that especially on Facebook, because nothing good ever comes of it. They just end up ganging up on me and anyone else who thinks like me, and just hitting me with a barrage of ignorant nonsense. They rarely ever want to have an actual discussion or debate, and facts are quickly brushed off as “fake news“. I wouldn’t care if they were strangers, but they aren’t. Some of these people I loved and respected. That is slowly changing. Has anyone else dealt with this level of crap from people close to them, or is this type of extreme ignorance and bigotry something you see more in strangers? Honestly, the thing that hurts the most is when these people who are supposed to genuinely care about me are taking something I view as a huge honor (finally getting to go to law school) and are weaponizing it and using it to make me feel like shit.

TLDR; Close friends and family are using their ultra conservative views to spew hatred, and when I call them out on it they turn on me, and use my own personal achievements as a way to beat me down and try to demoralize me.

c5zvwc,3,2019-06-26,Advice on How to Solidify an MBA Narrative,somethingtropical,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/c5zvwc/advice_on_how_to_solidify_an_mba_narrative/," 

Instead of using a pricy admissions counselor, I figured I would try to crowdsource my thoughts on developing an MBA story.

Short points:

**(Pre-Work Experience)**

Working class rural caucasian American, scholarship to local private school (3.9 GPA), transferred into Top 20 University where ***GPA fell to finish at 2.9*** \- (progression of 2.5 to 3.0 to 3.3 my last three years, respectively with double major/minor) - took time to adjust and had to work as a server through college to cover costs. Focused on International Development,voluntourism globally a few places and emphasis on foreign affairs in clubs and coursework - graduated in 2013.

**First Job:**

Consultant on two contracts at one of the following (the World Bank/United Nations/Asian Development Bank etc.) over the course of a year. Difficult place to start out straight from undergrad, clear I needed experience to move into a proper role. First interested in sustainability here as I worked with green bonds and financing.

Briefly took an internship at a fund of funds from there, but only purpose was to pivot to buy-side finance; **one of my references will also come from this institution as evidence that I am interested in returning post MBA.**

**Second Job:**

Pitched to join a reputable long-only fund USD 4-6Bn AUM as an Analyst in Asia where I moved early 2015. Focused on the consumer sector in emerging markets with a very strong ESG overlay; due to the nature of investments I became involved in engaging with management of these businesses and have a few projects to highlight. After about a year started to lead my team for the region I covered (two analysts) and continue supporting global ESG engagements with other teams at the firm. Also gained CFA Level 1 Pass. **One of my references will be the head of ESG here/senior member of the firm.**

**Current Job:**

After a bit more than two years, was pitched to join a family office that was launching (also in Asia). I provided research for a year before allotted a tiny bit of capital to run my own portfolio as part of the equity mandate. I still focus on emerging markets and mostly consumer - less ESG here, but the real drive is portfolio management ability. Gained the background in investment research at my last fund and progressed to overall positioning/trading here. Coming up on two years and will be three at matriculation for a total of 7 years out of school at the start of the program.

***For GRE, my score should be in the 720-750 range. (when equated to an MBA - got 165Q 164V on a practice exam, taking end July)***

The other aspect from a non-corporate perspective is my **interest in the LGBT diversity** in business movement. I am gaymyself and have taken a more active interest as of late - I'd like to explore this aspect further in organizations through an MBA program - may comment on a project I am working on at the moment.

**Reason for MBA and what I bring to the Program:**

I want to take my background in research and buy side finance to work on engaging businesses at a high level once more at an institution such as the UN/World Bank etc... basically I started there briefly, went out and got work experience, international experience, and hopefully an MBA, and will return as a more mature staff member with a greater focus on sustainability and sector expertise.

A secondary field would be strategy work for a consumer or tech corporate engaging in emerging markets for social impact and ROI on ESG investing. This would be more of a pivot as I never worked on sell-side finance/management consulting, but it would be more tangible leveraging my experience through looking at many businesses.

My main sell would be career progression quickly from an Analyst to Portfolio Manager as well as international experience, living abroad 4-5 years and frequent travel in emerging markets/ active discussions with C-suite management in my region on ESG. Brining two perspectives to the cohort - rural LGBT American (Trump country) making an international career and the other with plenty of anecdotes on how emerging market businesses are addressing sustainability themes.

**Rebuttals to Plan:**

Why do an MBA? Why not just try to network into a larger institution or back on your own? Some programs I am targeting are for post-MBAs, so I'd like a shot through that channel. I would also like a school that can introduce me to more resources and contacts in that field.

**Schools of Interest (roughly in order):** Oxford Said, Yale SOM, Cambridge Judge, Imperial Business School

So, given this information (and thank you if you've actually read this far!), what schools should I realistically target for my goals. How do I make it VERY clear that an MBA is necessary for my goal, and does this narrative make sense - any unknowns worth addressing or aspects to overlook when working on my apps?

Thanks!"

c62lpl,3,2019-06-27,[Advice Needed] Switch from EE student to electrician's apprentice?,Pen_Pimp,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/c62lpl/advice_needed_switch_from_ee_student_to/,"TLDR AT BOTTOM

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm currently a university student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. I've just finished up my second year and am absolutely hating school and possibly the major. I started out okay but have progressively gotten worse as I've taken more advanced classes. This past semester I failed 3 out of 4 classes that I enrolled in, namely physics 3, calculus 4, and circuit analysis 2. I also started out as an electrical engineering intern about a month and a half ago at an electrical contracting company.

&amp;#x200B;

I absolutely hate it. I've been struggling with EE for a long time and this internship, where I am preparing material take-offs from electrical construction plans, has been almost the nail in the coffin for me. Thing is, I've always been interested in the electric field as a whole. I've also made a lot of progress in this field and would like to use it, as I still find interest in electrical work and think it's cool. Money is a side effect and does not influence my decisions, as plenty of people around me have suggested. I never expected to make big bucks and I never will expect to.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend recently mentioned going to trade school instead to be an electrician and that got me researching the electrician trade. From the sounds of it, this might be what I need instead of a university degree in EE. I can work on my feet instead of wasting away sitting in an office, and I can do actual hands-on work with electrical components; both of these are things I wanted out of EE but never got. A previous campus job and my current internship have me sitting in an office all day working with electrical plans, but little to no hands-on work. As far as I know, EE's are more on the construction supervision side while electricians do the actual hands-on electrical work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've eagerly been looking for electrician apprenticeships in the union, and found a position that I believe is part of the NJATC (which is a union?). The apprenticeship program is for a Telecom/CatV Installer Technician. The terms of apprenticeship is 6,000 hours (\~3 years) and 480 hours of related classroom instruction. I have only started my application to the recruiters of this program but am interested in it. I'm looking to leave university and not finish my bachelor's to pursue this electrician gig and maybe get an Associate's in something related with the credits I've earned thus far.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your guys' thoughts and opinions? Is this a risky transition from a field and a job that I hate to something that'll be much better? Is this a stupid or a smart choice to make for someone in my position? Is there anything I should know before making the final decision?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; current second year struggling college student majoring in electrical engineering. Hate uni, hate electrical engineering internship, and hate the thought of sitting in an office for the rest of my life. Looking to switch to an electrician, namely an installer electrician, which seems to fit my desires to work on my feet and to do hands-on stuff better. Also looking to leave university with unfinished Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering to pursue this electrician gig. Any advice from the other side? Is this a stupid or a smart choice to make for someone in my position? Is there anything I should know before making the final decision?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any advice on the subject!"
c63j11,1,2019-06-27,When should you just quit?,randomasstosseracct,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c63j11/when_should_you_just_quit/,"So I turned 30 last year and experiencing a mid-life burnout.

&amp;#x200B;

So my family owns our own fairly successful business, like comfortably mid-upper middle class. I've been working for the family business since I was a kid, except when I went to college for a film degree.  My mom, who was the heart and soul of the business, passed right before I graduated. I didn't have a job in the industry lined up and with my mom gone, I went back to work at home to help keep us going. I tried to line up some internships and interviews during that time, but the job always got in the way and it just never worked out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Five years ago, with my dad's encouragement, I made the move to LA to do what I loved. I was really lucky in that I found work fairly quickly and over my first two years here, fell in with a group of friends (who became mine as well) that all worked together quite often. It was often low pay, but I was making enough to get by, and as a group we were starting to get tastes of bigger, better paying gigs.

&amp;#x200B;

But disaster struck.

&amp;#x200B;

Working on a charity gig that paid practically nothing, with my stress levels through the roof because of the impossible demands, I walked off a show. That night, my two friends who were on it with me, came by the make sure I was ok and ask me to come back. I declined, telling them I felt better than had in months because of how long and stressful that show had been.  To the point where, I'd always had a full thick head of hair and I now have much thinner hair. Maybe it's just aging, but I trace it starting directly to this event.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought we left it in a good place, with them understanding why I did what I did. I made sure they had all the information they needed from me to keep going and made myself available whenever they had a question about something I set up. But in the end, they cut ties with me. The whole situation was complicated further because one of those friends had kind of been...idk, not dating, not FWB, just occasional messy hookups. All that to say, my entire network of friends and work was basically entirely gone.

&amp;#x200B;

I was lucky enough to get hooked up with some other producers through an old classmate shortly after and I've spent the last two years trying to build new contacts. It just hasn't been coming though. This group is great and they're definitely headed places, but I get one maybe two jobs a year from them. Big ones but not enough to live the year off of. I get recommended to people, and do a job for them, then never hear from them again. It's not like I'm bad at my job either, I almost always come in on time and under budget, and everyone makes a point to say they like my sets. I'm just so beat down and disillusioned at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

This year I can count on one hand the amount of jobs I've been on so far. My savings and emergency funds are pretty much totally tapped out and I've been borrowing money from my dad to pay bills. Luckily I don't have much, I own my car outright, my student loans are almost gone, not much debt in general. I have basically no friends, I don't go anywhere because I can't afford gas, 2nd gear in my car is broken, and I can feel myself getting stupider and more socially awkward by the day. Yesterday we had a location scout, and the amount of times I stumbled over words and had to add umm's and ahhh's was just embarrassing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say, when should I just call it quits? I'm seemingly not making any progress in LA. My career isn't really progressing, I have no money, and nothing to show for 5 years here except some shitty movies nobody will ever see. All my friends are buying houses or nice cars, I can barely afford my rent. My dad is getting older and I know he'll be ready to retire in the next few years. He wants me to take over but I just...ugh. I love our business, I really do. But I don't want to go back to the same town I've lived in all my life, where there's nothing to do I haven't already done. I love living here, there's so many cool things to do, it's always great weather, the scenery is amazing, it just costs a fortune, and I can't find work.  I don't want to go back and live at my dad's house because I don't like his new girlfriend, and I REALLY don't want to live in a shitty apartment in my town haha. Not to even mention having to go back and tell people why I'm here now and not in LA.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides all that, I don't know how well I can even run it. I know myself well enough to know I'm not that Type A entrepreneur/socialite you need to be to really succeed. I've seen my mom and Dad so easily charm people and bring in new business and I know that's just not something I can do. I don't know anything about how to expand from where we are, let alone the financial side of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess . I just needed to vent a bit. I still don't know what I'm going to do. I have one more job booked until August, so maybe after that I'll just decide to pack it up."

I'm in the middle of an internship in a lab, and the device I'm working on is almost done, but that means more data to analyze, my tutor told me abt the possibility to create a program in Excel that do the repetitive tasks for me. These are basically import 16 data sheet with two important columns, open them, create a new Excel sheet , copy the important two columns of each of the 16 sheets, do the functions, draw the graphs.

Isthis something I can do over a weekend?
Where do u advice me to start( tutorials,courses..)?

I'll be more than thankful for any kind advice you could give me.
Thank you and have a great day."
c6510b,35,2019-06-27,New Zen2 build plan,Mahde232,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/c6510b/new_zen2_build_plan/,"Hey guys, I'm planning on getting a whole new rig to replace the one I already have because it is indeed getting old (i5-2500k).

A little background on my current and future work, I am a 22 Y.O. software engineer doing an internship at Facebook and planning on going deep into the AI and Machine-Learning field.

I have gotten a respectable sum of money and would like a build that would last me atleast 3-4 years without doing any hiccups in neither work field nor casual-serious gaming, and I have came to a conclusion that the new Ryzen lineup is just too good to pass on.

CPU: 3900X (12C,24TH)

RAM: 32GB 3200Mhz+ (planning on getting a 2x16 config for possible future upgrade to 64). Would like recommendations on specific ram kits and modules if anybody knows great kits.

MOBO: any mid tier X570 (X470 might be an option if X570 prices are WAY high up there), recommendations would also be great, I obviously will be planning on overclocking the CPU (not to an extreme state, just to squeeze more performance)

COOLING: Current plans are to grab a Hydro h100i  Pro RGB , recommendations on a better AIO that is 360mm and doesn't break the bank are more than welcome.

GPU: I currently have a Sapphire RX580 8GB Nitro+ LE card, It's doing me quite superbly for 1080P gaming and I wont be switching to 1440P gaming any time soon since I recently got a 240Hz 1080p monitor and most of the games I do play are FPS/Open-World.

Future plans would be to grab an RTX 2060 Super if those get released pretty soon, granted reviews are good and the RX580 feels lacking.

\----------------------

PSU: I currently have a SeaSonic 620W 80+ Bronze one, I dont know if it's enough for the whole rig (+ overclocking) and with the future RTX 2060 Super upgrade, If it's neccesary I will also purchase another PSU and keep the current one for the i5-2500k extra rig.

STORAGE: I will be moving all my current storage solutions to the new system (which consist of 2x2TB HDDs, 1x Sata III 2.5"" Sandisk SSD. Plans are to get an NVMe drive, Corsair MP510 is one of the few I looked at, a Samsung 970 Evo+ is also in consideration.

CASE: I already have a full tower Corsair, no plans on getting a new one.

I hope I explained the whole situation and reasons for upgrading each component as good and as brief as possible, any recommendations or tips are more than welcome."

so furious for the lack of sleep I’ve been getting this past week. I’m 22, my roommates are 21. Every single night, they do drugs and get intoxicated and they start blasting music and putting the tv on high volume every time they partake in these activities. 

They told me to tell them whenever they get loud, i do tell them by texting them or just going out of my room and asking them to turn it down. They will turn it down after i ask them, but then they start talking loud and they just do this every single night. 

I have to tell them every night to turn it out, after waking up from this it’s difficult to fall back asleep because of all this anger too because they continue to be inconsiderate and still be loud everyday. 

Tonight, i fell asleep at 11pm, woke up at 12:40am because they were being loud. They finally went to sleep at around 2:30-3am and now it’s 5am and i still can’t sleep because I’m so pissed off and i don’t know how to deal with these people! 

They literally have no life and they are so unproductive. I have explained to them i actually have shit to do in the morning, i can’t be up all night and sleep all day like them. i have class, my workout class, and an internship all day tomorrow and it’s gonna be a long day because of this.

I think I’ve been more than nice and reasonable, all i ask of these people is to let me sleep. I don’t care about anything else. I just want some damn sleep!

I’m stuck in this lease until December too :("
c66hdo,1,2019-06-27,TIFU by almost getting banned from work,lxing18,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c66hdo/tifu_by_almost_getting_banned_from_work/,"To provide some context: I started as an intern at an IT company that provides services for a big pharma company (let's call it BPC), about a month ago. Since most of our work is done with the clients in BPC, we have offices within their building. I am at BPC everyday, so I have an employee badge. We also have our own office a few miles away, so some of my coworkers only come about once a week for meetings. They need visitors badges every time they come, and because I'm the intern, I have been signing them in and out.

&amp;#x200B;

So the FU actually happened on Tuesday. After I signed in one of my coworkers, we both got to work separately on our own things. A few hours later, she asked me for my employee badge because she needed to make a personal phone call and the service wasn't that great in the office. So, being the naive intern, I handed it to her without a second thought. About 20 minutes later, I received an email from her telling me that I needed to come to the main gate. When I got there she's on the other side of the entrance and a security guard has my badge. Apparently, one of the security guards caught her trying to re-enter the building with my badge and flipped out. Along with this, my coworker didn't even bring her visitor badge, so I had to go back to her desk and bring back her green purse, which had it. I got a bunch of weird looks from people while carrying her flashy purse back to the entrance, and when I got back I had to get chewed out by the security guard for handing my badge away.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I showed up to work, and my first indication that something was wrong was that my badge didn't swipe at the underground parking lot. But, I thought that it wasn't a big deal because it could have been something wrong with the card reader. So, I parked and walked the distance to BPC. As I got to the building and went to swipe at the employee side, what do you know? It also didn't work. Turns out, my badge had been deactivated because the Head of Security was looking for me on Wednesday. And since he couldn't find me anywhere (I worked from home), I was deemed a security threat. Long story short, I had to wait in the lobby for him to show up. And when he arrived, he ripped into my ""questionable behavior"" for a full 10 minutes. He told me that I was circumventing the security process and usually people who did that we banned from the building. In the end, I think he took pity on me because I told him that I had only started a month ago, and I didn't know it was that big of a deal.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I almost lost my internship about a month in because I gave a coworker my employee badge. Needless to say, I will be making sure the badge never leaves my person for the rest of the summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Lent my employee badge to a coworker and almost got banned from work."

I'm pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science and a minor software engineering. But in lieu of my son being born in a couple of months I have taken time off from school, and have been learning on my own(code academy, etc.) 

My best friend works as an RPA  and has (possibly) helped me acquire an internship.  

The caveat is that I'm a python programmer, with small amounts of C++ and SQL experience and this will be a VBA ""programming"" job. It's technically an engineer position. Will that experience have a positive effect on my resume if I were to apply (later down the road) for some type of ""software engineer"" or ""programmer"" job?

I'm just nervous that in a progamming interview someone's gonna say: ""What qualifies you to work here? You only programmed in VBA and that's a dying language."" 

Any insight would be super helpful!"

I'm 30 and have been a waiter for the past 12 years. I decided a couple years ago to go back to school for electrical engineering.  My GPA is good (3.68), but I havent taken any engineering classes yet. Just all the calculus,  diff eq, and physics 1 and 2.  I worry that I'm good at school and bad at applying anything that I learn in the small chunks that school delivers.  Right now I'm at an internship with Northrop Grumman.  They pretty much immediately put me on tasks related to programming, which I'm just NOT equipped for.  They gave me time to watch a bunch of tutorials on python. After 2 weeks of tutorials I am still terrified to sit at a computer with a blank IDE expected to actually do something.  I worry that I'm just not smart enough to do real world stuff. All the other interns somehow already know their way around coding and I'm just pretty much useless.  Another guy came from my school and he seemed to be able to pick up coding in python already.  I feel like everyone can tell I'm a bit of a dunce.  I don't get it... isn't school supposed to prepare me for this even a little bit? Any advice or wisdom on this would he much appreciated.

Edit:  next day. 
After the overwhelming amount of resources and encouragement from the users in this sub, I have been sitting at my desk scribbling out pseudopseudocode and maybe a little pseudocode and even less actual code for the past 6 hours straight. You guys are right.  It isnt pretty, but some of it works.  I don't feel stupid or helpless now for going back and looking at clips of every tutorial that I've watched for the past 2 weeks, or googling help.  In fact now that I Know it's what I SHOULD be doing, things are happening.  My brain and I have synergy once more.  I get the pace now.  Slow, painstakingly slow with ITTY bitty chunks at a time. But progress.  A vision for the project is starting to materialize.  

Can't thank you all enough.  Brothers and sisters of r/AskEngineers, you're all badasses. Thanks for getting me out of the gutter.  Expect many more questions (more technical, less existential in nature) moving forward.  One day I'll be giving back like all of you golden ponies."

c69s89,110,2019-06-27,Hosting your websites and web apps for (esentially) nothing,apple532,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/c69s89/hosting_your_websites_and_web_apps_for_esentially/,"**TLDR:** Don't let financial constraints be the reason you haven't deployed your web applications or websites to a top level domain.

&amp;nbsp;

Except for those of us that have been lucky enough to get a Big 4 Internship, I'm going to assume most of us are either broke college students or even-more broke high school students. It's pounded into our heads here and at r/cscq that we should be creating personal projects. Got it. Websites and web applications are particularly appealing because they are accessible from anywhere and require no environment setup.

&amp;nbsp;

I was under the impression that my only option to deploy my Web App for cheap was to use Heroku with some annoying URL like mypersonalproject1234.herokuapp.com. This isn't to mention that Heroku free tier spins down the server after 30 minutes of inactivity and that SSL certificates aren't an option unless you pay for Hobby Dynos, which becomes frustrating when you're trying to work with an API that requires SSL. I get that it's only a minor inconvenience that you have to wait 30 seconds to spin up the server when you're trying to show someone the site, but it's all about first impressions right?

&amp;nbsp;

As far as hosting costs, most basic plans cost ~$10 a month, and I can't really justify paying over $100 a year for a website that has no purpose other than display. DigitalOcean offers a VPS hosting option for $5 a month, but I'm lazy and I'd rather have a managed solution like Heroku where I can just deploy without worrying about provisioning an entire backend (?), making sure my virtual database server is properly connected to my virtual application server(??), making sure my servers are secure (???), and load balancing (????).

&amp;nbsp;

So let's discuss cheap hosting options. 

**Google,** **Amazon,** and **Microsoft** all offer hosting solutions with free tiers, free credits, credits for students, whatever. These are probably the best options overall, especially if you're trying to build something with an actual backend or persistent database. A lot of their free tier offerings are only free for one year however. While these three options offer the most in terms of flexibility and capabilities, I currently don't use them to host my projects because there's definitely a learning curve in familiarizing oneself with each ecosystem. I definitely want to learn AWS at some point, but I'd rather not be trying to familiarize myself with the ins and outs of AWS when I'm also trying to crank out this project. Also the pricings and offerings are super specific, which is great for enterprise users, but annoying for me when I'm just trying to print Hello World on the screen. Another option from Google is **Firebase.** I'm not really knowledgeable enough about Firebase to speak on it, but it's an extremely comprehensive BaaS with a nice free tier.

&amp;nbsp;

If your backend isn't extremely complicated, *serverless/static hosting* may be an option. GitHub offers **GitHub Pages**, which is free static hosting as long as your repository is public. **Netlify** and **Zeit Now** are other options for serverless hosting with more functionality than GitHub Pages, similar to AWS Lambda. Both come with their own CLI and deploying websites to these services is as simple as possible. Netlify offers 125k requests per month, and Zeit offers unlimited requests per month, but the truth is that it doesn't matter. We all know nobody is ever actually going to visit these websites and projects, which is why our goal is to get our page on the internet for as cheap as possible. If you want to incorporate a database with serverless hosting, things get slightly more hairy, as you'll have to host the database externally. **mLab** and **mongoDB Atlas** offer 500mb of free NoSQL database storage, and Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all have their own options of course. For most small projects, these options should offer plenty of storage.

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, I've spent exactly $0 to host my create-react-app. Now it's time to buy your domain name. Namecheap.com is a good choice as they offer free WHOIS protection. Just please get the WHOIS protection, and PLEASE don't use GoDaddy. I managed to snag my firstnamelastname.dev for $15, and most of .dev domains are similarly priced. Congratulations, your website is now hosted for ~ $1 a month."

Body language and social skills tips?,MamoswineRider,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/c6bkta/destroying_my_social_anxiety_once_and_for_all/,"Hello, 20M here. Would like to make a quicker post, so here goes.

I have traces of social anxiety, which means I got rid of the more extreme form of it somewhere last year. I was afraid to look people in the eye, was barely talking to people, wasn't even interested in them... I thought I will never, ever get a girlfriend or a decent social group, and with a troubled childhood and past which I don't feel like sharing now, my life seemed fucked. The fact that I have many Asperger traits doesn't help at all.

I'm much better now, though. But I still have issues - I feel I'm halfway there. No, maybe 60-70% there. 

I can now maintain a conversation with almost anyone for about 5 to 10 minutes and have no issues with helping (most) strangers. But I still don't feel like I have complete control over what I'm saying and how I'm delivering it to other people. For some reason I never picked this up. I only partially know body language skills, have some trouble picking up jokes and messages, and am still not interested in movies, which most people would talk about for hours.

This is what I call traces of social anxiety. 

I feel this is the main reason why I don't have a girlfriend and am still a kissless virgin. It made sense once I stopped blaming society and everything else besides myself. I thank my depression for hitting me two years ago, honestly. Really good wake-up call!

And I stopped using the excuse that only 18% of people with Asperger's get romantic relationships... once I realized less than 15% of such people get jobs. I'll quit my job now to focus on my internship, but once I'm done I'll go back in the market, ready to go probably by October.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So Reddit - I would like to know how to polish my bad social skills that were once absolutely abysmal, to the point where I can call them at least decent. I would just need some tips, some advice. Otherwise... I'm confident I can work with what I have."

As in the title my current major is in Computational Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. The only reason I’m not a CS Major is because my grades suck so I was rejected and forced to do math but ended up really enjoying all of my classes in the end. I’m coming into my senior year and for the past 2 years have been trying to apply to everything I saw from all spectrum's of programming related jobs and have heard next to nothing from nearly every company. I have a 2.6 GPA which I believe is a terrible misrepresentation of my skills. I tend to get C’s in my classes but I am a slow learner so it tends to take me longer to understand the material compared to others. I also didn’t care about school all that much to be honest prior to a year and a half ago but I finally found my love and passion for math and programming so now I’m normally in the library for about 7-9 hours a day studying just because I love learning. I’m looking to someday become either a Cyber Security person a Software Engineer or Programmer of something. Now school does take up a lot of my time and I haven’t nearly got the skill set of a CS Major because I’ve only taken intro classes that were way too easy. I pretty much only know basic java and that’s it when it comes to programming but math on the other hand I feel as though is my strong suit and I am pretty darn good at math. I’m looking to get internships or jobs in one of the above fields but have gotten rejected from everything. I would really love to go to grad school but I feel my chances are slim because of my grades. As I go into my senior year I just feel as though my chances of getting a job in this field might not be a smart decision to pursue anymore, unless a miracle occurs and I get into grad school. I guess I'm looking for any advice or tips for someone with little experience in programming compared to all these other kids who are far more skilled than I am. I'm currently in CA so tech jobs over here are tough to get but I was thinking they might be looking for more people else where such as the Midwest or something. At this point I'm excited and eager to get a job and to learn more so I'm hoping someone has had a similar experience and how they went about overcoming this obstacle
Thanks
Also sorry for my crappy grammar obviously English isn't my major."

My top options/choices right now are Applied AI, Electrical Engineering, and (Space) Systems Engineering but I’m also open to other suggestions.

I am going to be a senior Computer Engineering student this coming fall and I think I am going to need to start applying soon. I would also be doing my masters at night/online most likely at my undergrad school while I work. 

Generally I like to work with software however during an internship where there was no physical component, I realized I missed doing more “hands-on” and engineering work. Ultimately I want to be able to work on something impactful down the line(Ik it’s rare to work on really important projects as an intern/entry level), not just something that makes the company more money.  I have family that had worked in the aerospace/defense industries which has created a interest and love for space so naturally that’s an industry that is interesting to me. My only worry is about the number of jobs and it seems like the jobs are concentrated in a few areas. Other than that, I’d be interested in potentially working in other tech, power engineering, or something fighting climate change. 

Any advice on which masters degree might benefit me the most for what I want to do would be greatly appreciated"

Just a little background to start off, I am an incoming senior in computer science at my university, and during the school year I work a part time internship at a local small/medium tech startup (I think ~60 engineers). I was offered a summer internship but turned it down for a larger company (5,000-10,000 employees). The larger company is a pretty old company, but I thought this would look better on my resume. Since I’ve gotten to the larger company I’ve really disliked it, and I didn’t realize how antiquated this company is in their practices. I find the company to be very poorly run, and the internship program to be unstructured and lack a solid learning environment.  I have a spot at the small company if I’d like to quit and join again with them for summer.  At the smaller company I get a ton more done, and also learn a lot more. The smaller company also really has their shit together, and best practices are followed and taught. I can’t say the same about the larger company. The smaller company has also expressed interest in hiring me out of college. 

My questions I’d like your opinions on are:

- Would leaving my internship early have a negative impact on future opportunities? (With other employers I don’t plan on working for my current company ever again)

- How much more prestigious does a large antiquated company look on a resume, than a smaller growing startup? (If any)

- If I was to join the smaller company out of college, would a second job after that be interested in seeing the larger company internship on my resume? Or would the most recent job take on a lot more weight than a previous summer internship. 

Thank you so much for any opinions on the matter."
c6cz7n,3,2019-06-27,Is coding just not for me?,Synikx,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/c6cz7n/is_coding_just_not_for_me/,"As I’m nearing the final semester of my 4-year degree in CIS, I’m having to seriously think about what kind of jobs to start applying for in the next few months. I know that CIS is diverse, and I can get into many fields, but 1 field in particular has me annoyed: coding. I’m currently at my 2nd internship and running into problems like I always have. Over ~2 years or so, I’ve done coding courses and projects with C#, Java, Javascript/CSS, Python, Swift, R and SQL. Of all those the only one I kind of enjoy is SQL, probably cause its not even a real language. 

I’m currently doing Android development in Java, following a video series on Udemy. As expected after we learn a few things, the teachers always say “Okay, go make this!”, and I’m completely lost. I figure after over 2 years of exposure to various languages this would get easier, but I’m still just as stuck when I have to come up with a project. 

At what point does this get easier? Should I stop coding? Honestly, I don’t even enjoy it and consider it daunting and frustrating. At this point in my possible career path, Id be looking at doing something in Databases since I hate SQL the least. 

Appreciate any advice, thank you."

**Background:** 

White male, 28 years old

&amp;#x200B;

Work:  
\- 3.5 years work experience in Private Wealth Management with a top 3 RIA

\- 1 promotion after 2.5 years - currently at the AVP level  
\- 1 year of AmeriCorps experience as a community organizer for an environmental nonprofit

\- 1 year of various shitty sales jobs

  


Extra curriculars post college:

\- 2.5 years of managing a network of volunteers from my firm to work on environmental projects like beach cleanups, trail building, and habitat restoration

\- Co captain of an amateur men's soccer team (competitive enough where we have tryouts, a coach, and small sponsors, but it's definitely not semipro) 

\- Recreationally play the violin (fiddle) 

\- Avid hiker/camper

&amp;#x200B;

Undergrad: relatively prestigious private university, BA in Environmental Studies 

\- member of environmental club, club soccer, intramural soccer/ultimate frisbee, Renewable Energy Scholar Intern, GIS Student Intern, Junior Fellow of Environmental Residential College (plannings events like speakers and hiking/kayaking trips for freshmen)

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats:**

2.8 GPA (I know - oof)

I sit for my GMAT this Saturday, but I got a 750 (44V, 49Q) and a 760 (45V, 49Q) on my two most recent practice exams from this last week. The only other practice exam was a 690 (40V, 44Q) from over a month ago, and I definitely feel like I know more than I did then. How accurate are those practice exams you get for free (and have to buy past 2) when you sign up for the GMAT? 

&amp;#x200B;

**MBA info:** 

The goal is to pivot back into a sustainability-focused career. There are 3 main career paths I'm interested in:

1. Sustainability consulting for a consulting firm, or in-house sustainability/CSR strategy at a fortune 500 company
2. Renewable energy project development
3. Investment banking with a focus on green business

My target schools in order of my interest are: 

1. Michigan
2. Duke
3. Yale
4. Cornell

From my understanding, Michigan has the top Green MBA; and Michigan, Duke, and Yale all have great dual degree programs (MBA and Masters of Environmental Management; or, in Michigan's Case, an MS from the School for the Environment And Sustainability). I'm considering Cornell because they have a strong MBA focus in sustainability, I have a very good friend who just graduated from Johnson, and I connected well with the admissions person at one of the events I went to. I have been in contact with current students, alumni, people in admissions, and professors at all four schools to express my interest and pick their brains. So far, I've connected the most with people from Michigan and Duke.  


My biggest concern is whether my low undergrad GPA will undermine my chances at these programs. The general consensus is that a high GMAT, a compelling narrative in my application, and continued contact with students and faculty at my goal programs should still make me a competitive candidate, but I will still need to include a supplemental essay in my applications to address my GPA. I plan to say something like: I was young and dumb and didn't have my priorities straight. I just didn't apply myself at all - I was more worried about my extracurricular activities and building friendships (read: partying). I always had a general idea that I wanted to help steer the world to a more sustainable future, but never knew how to do it, and so I was unmotivated. But now I have a clearer picture of what and how to do it, and plan to apply myself at these programs.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm reaching out to this community to see if I really do have a shot at these programs, and to get some help polishing my supplemental essay to explain my GPA. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am a college senior at a good school in the Los Angeles area. My major is film, which is totally unrelated to IT and kind of a waste of money in hindsight. I'm one semester away from graduating, but my interest in that area is dwindling, and job prospects seem pretty bad with little to no upward mobility. Which is why I am exploring other options such as IT. I started about a month ago truly focusing on the Linux operating system (Ubuntu and Raspian), basic python, and some AWS services. I lack an A+. 

One thing that seems to be a silver lining is that I was part of the IT department at the film school for about 3 semesters. However, it didn't have much to do with networking, system administration, or cloud since it was more AV heavy, and most of the time I was free to just do homework. 

That's why I'm looking for an actual internship to gain experience near the area. I do feel very under-qualified for everything though. Any tips on what do learn next, what to build, or how to get an internship?

c6faqc,1,2019-06-27,Should I quit my internship for medical reasons? (undergrad CS student),Danereno,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c6faqc/should_i_quit_my_internship_for_medical_reasons/,"So here's some background: I recently landed a software development internship at a relatively unknown non-tech company. Being so late into the summer, they were desperate to fill the position, so they finally hired me. I'm starting to feel that when they did, they settled for someone under qualified, because the responsibilities and technologies they expect me to be familiar with are overwhelming. I do fairly well in my studies but it feels like they expect me to be on par with their experienced developers after only a week or two of self-guided training, and I have no idea where to even start. I don't want to turn this into an r/cscareerquestions post, but I'll just say that the work they expect of me is a far cry from any class work I've done.


But all this is besides the point. The main reason that I am seriously considering quitting is because I have really bad tendonitis, and working a full-time desk job is only making it worse. The pain hasn't become debilitating but it's definitely distracting and has kept me from enjoying many of the things I used to love doing. I've had it on and off for over a year now, but recently it's started to flare up again, and it doesn't help that most of my free time is also spent at a computer. My doctor and therapist have made it clear that the only way for it to truly heal is rest. I've tried everything: pain meds, ice packs, ergonomic mice, even ultrasound, but I'm starting to realize that only a seriously lifestyle change will help me at this point. As a result of not taking the condition seriously up until this point, I'm now stuck between prematurely leaving a lackluster yet valuable internship, or sticking it out and possibly living with this condition indefinitely.


I'm only a week into it, but the internship would last 8 weeks, and it pays great, though money is not really an issue for me right now. However, the remainder of this summer break may be the last time in a while where I can seriously give my wrists some rest, completely isolating myself from any computer for at least a month. If the condition persists after I graduate, then I'm going to have a real problem on my hands. 


There's something else worth mentioning: if I were to quit, I would not give any notice. Not because I particularly dislike the company. My coworkers are friendly enough and the work environment is decent albeit a little gossipy. It's because I don't want to face the humiliation during those two weeks of having to quit for some silly wrist condition. It sounds stupid, I know, but I was just hired and these people have high hopes for me and have no idea that I'm thinking of leaving any day. Maybe it's selfish of me to mildly screw over a business just to avoid this shame, but I don't really care about any future job offers from them.


And so, I find myself in a situation with no good options. If anyone has any experience with tendonitis/wrist pain being an issue at work, or if anyone can speak to the value an internship like this would provide me in the future, I'd really appreciate some advice, thanks.


tl;dr - just got hired but the job makes my tendonitis worse, not sure if I should tough it out or quit to get some rest"

The companies I initially interviewed with were large enterprises, but I have since then scaled down my search to small to mid-sized tech companies. They were also mostly located in metropolitans in the US (Boston, Austin, etc.). The types of roles I've been initially interviewing for were Leadership Development or Rotational Programs since they seemed more likely to give interviews to college students. However, they usually had really difficult final rounds (flying in and doing case studies with/against other candidates). Since I had difficulty with getting into those programs and the calendar period expired for them, recently, I have been interviewing for entry-level roles in Operations, Recruiting, and HR at start-ups/tech companies. I wanted to get started in HR in the tech space because I felt a strong passion for it, and did an internship in it previously, but I seem to have trouble getting in, so I opened up my search to different jobs I wouldn't mind doing. 

I am fortunate to have received two offers during my search, however one did not align with what I wanted to do (it was Retail Management), paid a low hourly rate, didn't provide me any relocation, so I declined it. The other offer had many red flags and seemed like a scam. Both of them only had two rounds of interviews, which was also not as common. For the remaining companies, I have received rejections.

I've had many companies ghost me after the first few stages after I reach back out to them, and have had a couple of companies cancel the position entirely when I reached the final stage. I have been rejected for a lot of different reasons from ""not having enough experience"" to even ""being too senior for a role"". I usually requested feedback and since then have incorporated them moving forward. However at this point, whenever I request feedback, now they tell me that they really enjoyed speaking with me, I connected well with the team, I seemed like I could have done the job, but I lacked  enough experience and/or they decided to go with someone else who had more experience who could help them scale faster, etc. The three most recent final interviews I conducted have actually told me and I quote ""that I have a good head on my shoulders, and they feel that I will find a lot of other opportunities, just not their company at that time"". At this point, a lot of it seems out of my control, and I'm not sure what to do anymore. It's really frustrating to reach the final stage so many times, only for them to tell me no. I have gone to my career center regarding this and they have told me that I am doing everything right, but unfortunately, it's just how the process works, and that I'll land one eventually.

It's has been incredibly mentally taxing having to go through the process: apply to companies, prepare for the interview, talk to a lot of different people, do case studies, only to get rejected and restart the process with other companies over and over again. I have to say that it's difficult to bounce back after getting constantly rejected, but have been engaging in activities to bolster my mental health. 

I wanted to note that I am incredibly fortunate to receive this many interviews, and I greatly appreciate it that. However, having a lot of interviews doesn't translate to having offers. Currently, I am still in the interview process with some companies. If anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it!"

I currently am a mechanical engineer. The problem is I absolutely despise the classes I'm taking. Math isn't the worst because it becomes more or less repetitive with just more equations, but it's the classes like statics and physics (and soon a full semester of mechanics and dynamics) that make me hate what I'm doing. I don't enjoy the classes or the material. Having bad professors is probably part of the cause, but them aside I just don't find any of this interesting. Now what further complicates my decision is that I have an internship at a turbine engineering company that I can keep every year of college until I graduate in which I will then get a job. This among other connections guarantees me a career in engineering. Now, I kinda like it and it's definitely better than school considering how much stuff you learn that's really just useless in the industry, but I don't know if I 1) can make it through the education or 2) will be happy in life doing sorta boring work that doesn't directly help people or excite me. I'm not sure what to do because I don't want to have wasted all this time and money starting an engineering degree, as well as waste this career opportunity, but at the same time this is my life I'm deciding on.

I've had a really bumpy ride over the past 10years due to personal mental health, so I have literally nothing to my name and this is the only option for me to move forwards into a better life, better work options, a career that I am passionate about, and an increased salary in a country I want to live in (for a while at least.)

**I have the following to my name...**

* 19,000 USD of Credit Card Debt with Chase Bank
* £0 of Savings / no Roth, No IRA / ETC

**I need to cover the following (total 140k EURO)....**

* Consolidate 19,000 USD of Credit Card Debt
* Cover 80,000 EURO for Program Costs (1 half due in October 2019 / the other in October 2020)
* Cover 45,000 EURO for Living Expenses (includes 19 months of expenses calculated out)

I will have an internship in the summer for 3-4 months which would give me at least 20-40,000 EURO

My parents will pay for the initial deposit of 10k which reduces the total amount a bit.

**The School says they have the following funding options but are there any others available??**

* Banco Sabadell for up to 80% of the program cost
* Prodigy Finance Loans for 100% of program cost
* Sallie Mae Loans for up to 100% of program cost
* US FEDERAL LOANS (These are available but I DONT WANT to use these - because the US GOVT has a very unfair rule of prohibiting me from doing a 3month exchange into ANY US MBA if I use their loans)
   *  Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan and Federal Direct PLUS Loan would be offered if I give up my right to exchange for 3 months.

**I have the following questions**

* Anyone have experience with Banco Sabadell, Prodigy, Sallie Mae? 
   * Fixed or Variable Rate?
   * Should I get my retired parents to co-sign?
* Anyone know how I can get a loan to cover living expenses? 
   * I have a  GOOD credit score - above 700 (730 TU / 715 EQ)

TLDR - I need to finance my full cost of the MBA which is 140k including living expenses and consolidation of my credit card debt. How can I do this?"

My resume got selected for an internship at Google for fall but I couldn't move forward after the coding sample.

I can do anything to get an internship, I just want some guidance.

I am proficient in building Mobile apps with Flutter and Front-end apps with React and bit of Node.js too and I thought these things give me a chance to interview at Google too.  I like doing coding problems in C++ and I have done with the concepts of important DS like trees, graphs, heaps, hash table etc.. also good with DP and I am solving leetcode consistently to keep up my level.

Can I assume that if my resume passed a screening at Google, I will have chances for other big companies too in the upcoming recruiting season?

Its a bit of a desperation vent and cry for advice?

So, i am a 25 year old dude with bachelors degree in Tourism and Hospitality management and after graduating i started working as an administrator in small 60 room hotel. Started this job in August 2018. Had a really great FO manager, great dude. Everything was okay, job had its ups and downs, shifts were mostly 8 hours and sometimes 12 hours, nights shifts didnt like but in total it was okay. Important note, our shifts consisted of 1 administrator as the hotel was small.

As for myself as an employee, i would like to think of myself as hard working, never said no to a task or a challenge and did everything i was asked to do even if it wasnt in my job description specifically.  Went on my days off to help with different tasks which were in general good for the Hotel, i was just happy to help and motivated to be a good employee.

At April most of middle management quit ( couple internal issues etc), a lot of employees quit for different reasons, including my FO manager.

He moved on to different, larger hotel to the same position and, as he like my way of working, he offered me to go with him keeping my same position although larger hourly pay and only 12 hour shifts ( which means only 12 hour shifts) . So after working at my first small hotel for 10 months i left and joined this larger hotel with 258 rooms which i thought would be okay.

I was excited, knew i would learn Opera system, while we previously worked with Fidelio, so i knew it was at least something new and something i could learn. Also was thrilled to work day to day with someone else besides reception table, we work here in pairs.

After first shift i realized i just didnt like it there. The colleges were a bit off, people who were a bit off were working there for a couple of years, so i understand they can be a bit opinionated and not all of them were that bad. The workload was not what i expected - people just pile on and on and on , basically you just stand there 12 hours and get hammered. The work/life balance is terrible as you work for like 4 days in row, from 8 AM to 8 PM ( OR 8 PM to 8 AM ) which leaves no room for anything besides work and sleep, knowing that just depresses me and i hate when i have to start hauling my long days knowing i wont see anyone outside of work for most of the week. The Opera system there is soooo SLOWWW and you basically stand there waiting for it to catch up to you, and you can imagine what it feels like when there are 10 people in line during check-in and you just stand and stare at loading screen and cant do crap to speed it up.

So now i have been there for a month, i have learned most of my daily routine and everything just feels so stiff and not organic, cant place my finger on what exactly it is but i just cant find a fit for me there.

But here is my problem. I have decided that i dont want to work in this field anymore, i just hate to do all the mindless check-ins, check-outs and say all the same repetitive phrases every minute for 12 hours a day. I just cannot do it anymore.

I have decided to try my hand in HR and i have an eye on some intern openings and id love to try to assign to them BUT, i just dont know how to quit and i dont even know if i can quit without burning bridge with my FO manager and making him look bad. He specifically asked me to join him, he stuck his neck out, pretty much vouched for me and now after a month i want to quit. It just  doesnt make me look bad but also him and i just dont know how and if i can do this without making a huge drama show for everyone.

I havent spoken about this with anyone besides my gf and she suggest for me to work there for at least 6 months, but at the moment, it seems like a nightmare and i hate to loose my chance for this spot in HR. I AM LOST

Sorry for this ramble.

Any thoughts?"

But, I'm only part time. I've been working here 4 months now and my boss has asked me if I want more hours (to which I said yes) but I haven't told him yet that I want to be full time. My 90 day review hasn't happened yet, but the annual reviews are being done right now so I think it's just going to get combined.

Also the hiring manager told my brother she was really impressed with my resume. My brother doesn't think I'm going to enjoy the work though. 

If I were full time at my current job I wouldn't even be considering this new job, although ultimately I'd love to be doing HR at this fortune 100 company.

&amp;#x200B;

So I graduated undergrad as a physics major. Long story short I realized I like engineering a LOT more than physics, but it  was way too late to change majors and my plan now is to go to grad school for mechanical engineering in Spring 2020. Is it too late to find an internship for this fall? I'm applying online to every job I can find and trying to find any connections I have with engineering to help, but I'm not having any luck. Any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also working on things to supplement my resume or portfolio, such as working on my skills in coding, computer science, design, etc. and of course also studying for GRE. Any pointers on other projects would be amazing as well. Thank you!"

The code for the currently existing website was given to me, but there is no documentation. This has made it extraordinarily difficult, especially since I've never done web dev before. I've spent weeks already just trying to figure out what part of the code does what. Also, the person who originally made the application has left the company, so nobody is too familiar with the code. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I brought up the issue of understanding the code without documentation in a meeting, the full-time employees kind of laughed and said that's just how the job is. Is this normal? I find it shocking how much time is potentially wasted by software engineers trying to break down and understand other's code instead of developing their own if there isn't any sort of guide for the existing code. But this is a very large company so I'd imagine the way they do it must be normal. Should this be a red flag for working there or can I expect this anywhere?"

I'm looking for a school with a lot of people; I'm fine with small schools if they're by a city or mid-to-large sized college towns. I want to stay close to home, so I'm looking mainly in the US. I want a semi-competitive atmosphere but nothing too cutthroat and I just want to feel safe on campus. :) However, if you think any school is bomb enough comment it anyways because I still want to widen my scope of options either way.

Stats:

Race: I'm white lol

GPA: 4.75 W/ 3.95 UW

Class rank: 1/200, relatively small public school, semi-competitive

SAT: 1480 (I retook it, my predicted score is low 1500's)

Courseload: My school doesn't offer AP's until junior year. My combined total will be 9, and I've went beyond my school's math curriculum by studying calc BC. I am the first student to take multivariable over the summer at a CC and I think I'm going to do an online course for Linear Alg/Diff Eq (can that be put on my app or...)

Job: I will be tutoring at a local Mathnasium starting this year.

ECs: Will be 4 - year member of:

* Mathletes (no leadership positions available)
* FBLA (can't run for leadership position)
* Swimming (1 year JV, 3 years varsity)
* Chess (board 1, co-captain JR/SR)

Will be 3-year member of

* Science Olympiad (1 year JV, 1 year varsity, maybe captain this year)
* Scholastic Bowl (don't think I can even go for captain next year, I'm really only there for math questions lol)

I might found a mathematical modeling or computer science club starting next year, but in general my peers aren't interested because we don't have education for either of those things so I don't know if it will work out.

Awards

* Both individual and team state awards (nothing like first place, but top 10).
* Math student of the year (FR, SO, JR)
* English student of the year (SO)
* I'm HOPING to bag an award for a good mathematical modeling competition.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm anxious about this process and my chances at decent schools because of how little my school ever stressed the importance of EC's beyond school. I'm under the impression that T20's are out of my reach because I lack anything like an internship or research experience but I don't know if my stats are ok enough. I'm definitely going to go ham on my essays, but it's pointless to try to rate it on here. Thanks y'all!"

After a period of analysing their mistakes, I realised that they were having a really hard time with syntax than they were with logic! They were having a tough time with big huge English words, as that wasn’t their native Lang. That was great. I decided to come up with a Java layer, with special syntax which allowed these students to write code in Hindi and then my program would convert that to java and run the code.

It’s a very small firm. Besides the interns, there is only the owner and two people below her. I have been working really hard whenever I’m there (1 day a week) and always go above and beyond. 

The person who stayed on after her internship by all accounts is not a very good worker. She’s temperamental, lazy, awkward and hard to get along with. The other two workers clearly don’t like her. 

I would LOVE to work there but I just don’t think the owner has Space at this point for another full-time worker. Maybe in the future if she grew her business a little more. In the meantime, I would love to do what the other intern did and turn my internship into a part-time job. It seems very possible that they are going to end the relationship with her based on the vibe in the office when she’s there.

The problem is I get along really well with the other two workers and they seem to really like me but I barely know the boss as she’s not there very often and she’s a little standoffish. I don’t know how to go about asking her for the opportunity number one because I don’t know the right words to say and number two she’s not in the office very often and when she’s there she’s always so busy that I don’t think she would like to be disturbed.

So this is a weird post, or maybe it isn't. I want to know what you would do if you were in this situation because I want to feel comforted in the decision  I will make regarding the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently graduated with a Master's of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering in the USA and had been looking for a job desperately for the past two months. I am an international student on an F-1 Visa; long story short for those who don't know, **I can only legally stay in the country till October** without a job before my Visa becomes invalid.

I'm a web developer guy, with skills in front-end and back-end. I'm fairly proficient in Javascript and Python and frameworks such as React, Express, Django and obviously HTML and CSS. 

I don't have a lot of work experience save for a 3-month internship as a full stack developer with a small firm. 

Yesterday, I got a job offer from a small firm of 50 employees as a Full Stack Developer with a salary of 70,000 per year which I'm not too happy about, but okay with. Hey, at least I can stay in the country for longer.  I haven't accepted the offer yet, and I asked them for **a week's time** to think about it. I also already discussed that **my joining date would be August** if I do accept the role. 

Also yesterday, I got an interview request from Facebook for a Front-end engineering role which is pretty fucking great for me since I didn't expect to hear from them. Note: **it's a recruiter call, the first ever call. She emailed me yesterday and set the phone interview for Tuesday.** 

If you weren't already a super skilled guy in Front-end dev(you only have 2 okay-ish projects in web dev and you're only started learning Javascript a couple of months back) and you haven't really been performing well in the interviews you've had so far with other decently sized firms and you haven't practiced your data structures and algorithms all that well for a long time, 

* Would you actually consider Facebook to be a company that would be likely to hire you? Is the interview process insanely hard that requires some intense preparation? 
* Considering you only have a week to accept the offer from the other company, would you accept that offer anyway and then decline if you do get an offer from Facebook?
* How long is the Facebook interview process for Front end engineering? Because if it's going to be longer than a month, then I'd have already started working for the company that did offer me a job. Declining then(provided FB does give me an offer) would be harder and maybe safe to say, impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize these are some strange and silly questions but I guess I'm not truly happy with my pay and am the kind of guy who's always thinking 'what if'. 

What would *you* do?

&amp;#x200B;

***tldr; Would you bank on the possibility of Facebook hiring you if you're about to start the interview process on 2nd July, but you had to accept another job offer by 5th July and join by 1st August?***"

I also have numerous extracurriculars in related areas, including olympiads. I am looking for advice in conducting research DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR to submit to competitions such as ISEF. I should note that I do not desire for this to be a research internship or be assisting in a professor’s research; rather, I am inquiring with regards to the possibility of a professor being able to mentor me in a research project to submit to science fairs. 

1. Is it possible to start research in August to submit to science fairs around March and April?
2. When should I begin contacting professors regarding whether or not they would be able to mentor me?
3. Where should I determine which professors to email?
4. How many professors should I email?
5. What should I include in my emails to them?
6. How long does it usually take them to respond?

I'm a white male from Kentucky going to an in-state school. I'm not a minority of any kind so that marks me off the list for a lot of scholarships.

I am however extremely broke, and my sister is going to college at the same time.

I found out today I'm going to have to take out an absurd amount of loans from the university. If I have to take out this much for four years I see no other option but to switch to a cheaper school. Which I really do not want to do because I love my university and its CS/Engineering program. And I also have the amazing opportunity to work as a student developer despite the fact I haven't even started my freshman year yet.

Some things that I think would make me stand out, however: I'm 18, haven't even started my freshman year of college yet, and I've already started paid work as a Student Developer at my school. I've also previously worked as an unpaid research assistant in bioinformatics and before that an unpaid intern as a web developer for a non-profit.

I spend as much time as I can manage to work on personal projects. I've built chatbots, websites, web scrapers, web apps, tinkered with electronics.

I'm going to be a part of the Association of Computing Machinery, and a club at my school that builds a solar car for racing. I as well intend on participating in hackathons semi-occasionally.

I love this field, I can show I love this field. I'm in no way here for the money. I've worked in this field unpaid before. I'm here for the love of programming and computers.

I seriously appreciate any resources. I'm doing everything I can to plan and be prepared to pay for college. I'm saving what I can and hope to be working some internships in the summer that I can save a lot of money from to put towards those loans."

My current phone: Samsung Galaxy S7

It's still working very good! It's just that the 32GB of intern space keep filling quickly through cache etc. and I always have to delete stuff in order to even be able to use the galery properly (It has some issues if less than 500MB is free).

I just noticed, while going through the apps and looking at their space usage, that the Samsung internet browser (standard one that is pre-installed) uses over 5GB of space. I was baffled...
I have a lot of bookmarks, but 5GB?

I have many more bookmarks on Firefox on my PC, and the file containing all this information is not even 100MB large.

Wow...
Just... what can I do about this?

Is there a file somewhere that contains all these bookmarks? Can I transfer that file once I get another phone, to keep using the bookmarks? How? Where is that file? I've been saving these for years and there are a lot of important links among them. If I could save the file on my PC or so, then I could delete many of them to free some space.

Is there a way?

IT Consultant or Software Engineer?,throwaway_4__obv_rea,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c734av/which_job_has_better_prospects_it_consultant_or/,"I'll start by giving some background about myself and my situation. I recently graduated from Rutgers University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering double majoring in Mathematics. I've been working at the IT helpdesk at Rutgers for years, and once held an engineering internship with a computer manufacturer. I'm a solid programmer, and am comfortable in a variety of languages. Before graduating, I was applying to a lot of positions, and I got an offer pretty early on from an IT Consultancy that sells, installs, and manages enterprise B2B EDI software like IBM B2Bi. They also have their own flagship data visualization tool that is pretty unique. I'll provide more specifics later. I had submitted my resume all over, so I wasn't surprised when I got another interview. It was for one of the big government defense contractors. I got a conditional offer of employment for a software engineering position (primarily C++) pending my ability to obtain Secret clearance. Because this was a conditional offer, I felt there was no moral dilemma in continuing with the clearance process to see if I'd be cleared and get an official offer. The clearance has been taking a long time, and I've begun work at the first company mentioned. It is clear that there are some really talented people there, but I don't know how I'd feel working with clients as a consultant. Let me give a list of the pros and cons for each company.

&amp;#x200B;

**IT Consultancy**

* Located in NYC, but its a quick commute
* Top level reputation among many fortune 500 companies
* Frequent travel, potentially allowing me to rack up airline points and go on nice vacations
* Unlimited PTO
* Comprehensive $0 medical, dental, life, and vision insurance
* I've already gained a good reputation, and made friends with the directors of the company
* My technical ability allows me to succeed easily, and I already have good soft skills
* Excellent support as a new employee - literally anyone is willing to help you
* Pay is only $60K :( but there are a lot of opportunities to move up

&amp;#x200B;

**Government Defense Contractor**

* Has a poor reputation among long-time employees (few raises, benefit cuts, prefer to hire recent graduates)
* Bureaucratic red tape is a frequent problem
* Cut-throat environment suppresses teamwork
* Getting clearance opens the door for many other jobs in the future
* Pay is $84K starting with a $4.5K signing bonus
* I'll be a programmer rather than an IT person
* This job is more suited to my personality and interests, and holds a high level of prestige
* OK benefits package, but apparently getting vacation time approved is difficult

&amp;#x200B;

Its obvious that the IT position might be easier and more comfortable, but I feel like starting out for a big company opens the door for so much more opportunity. I've always wanted to be a really good programmer. I'm really comfortable in linux/unix, so I already have half of what it takes to be a really good consultant. I'm just looking for some advice on which path I should take!"

I will be a senior once this summer is over and currently have a potential IT internship coming up (Technical Support). The problem is, although IT and computer science share many similarities, I cannot get this position unless I can convince my adviser that this experience will 'enhance my academic experience in the Computer Science major' to quote his words directly.

&amp;#x200B;

Being an international student, I am legally not allowed to be employed in fields that aren't directly related to my major, regardless of my minor. I really do regret that I chose Computer Science over IST; Computer Science is interesting and all, and I can certainly get past the coursework and have done some personal projects, but I am not certain I am at a level where I will be able to find jobs easily after graduation, nor do I have any professional experience. I actually have been working part time at the university regarding IT work, so if anything, I feel that I will have a better chance seeking out a career in this field instead. Most of all, I can say pretty confidently that I enjoy this work. But changing my major is not an option at this point.

c75jm1,3,2019-06-29,Struggling at Machine Learning Internship... Advice Please?,ml_intern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c75jm1/struggling_at_machine_learning_internship_advice/,"I'm currently interning abroad at a large company as a data science intern. I've been here for the past couple of weeks, and my internship lasts until the end of August. I'm also a computer science undergrad from a relatively well-known university in the US, and I've taken introductory programming and machine learning classes.

Last week, I was introduced to my main project for the summer, and I'm already feeling confused and incompetent. My project is to create a machine learning model that would solve a specific and challenging problem in the machine learning community (won't disclose for privacy). My mentor has divided the project into three parts: researching state-of-the-art ML techniques, writing a paper of my proposal of possible models, and actually implementing my proposal.

This past week, I've been reading academic papers to get an idea of what has already been done to approach the problem. However, my mentor would like me to come up with my proposal draft of 3-4 possible models for this coming Monday (in less than 2 days). I have been trying really hard to get a better understanding of how to come up with my own models and using Google to look up information that I don't know.

However, this is my first internship in data science, and my only experience with ML to date is the one class that I took this past semester. My main problem is that I'm not sure what my mentor expects from me. He has been very welcoming and helpful so far, but he has not been straightforward with his expectations whenever I try to ask for clarification.

I'm not sure whether he expects me to come up with \[1\] a completely novel ML model (such as what most of the research papers that I have been reading have presented) OR \[2\] an evaluation of existing ML models on the specific problem. In other words, \[1\] would be a completely original idea of a ML model that has not been tried before or \[2\] use existing ML techniques and evaluate them but without doing something completely new. To be honest, I don't think that I am capable of doing \[1\] within the time frame of my internship with my lack of experience, but I also don't want to disappoint my mentor if that was what he was looking for.

I understand that this is an internship, and it's not expected that I know everything off the bat because I'm here to learn (which I'm really thankful for). However, I'm worried that my mentor believes that I am much more capable due to the fact that I have taken a ML class and go to a university that's also well-known outside of the US.

I would appreciate any advice for how I should deal with this problem. If you were in my situation, would you choose to \[1\] attempt a novel ML model like those in academic research papers or \[2\] do something that might not be what my mentor was expecting but much more reasonable given my circumstances? I know \[2\] would be the safer route (and what I'm leaning towards), but I don't know if it would be looked down upon by my mentor and my boss. Thanks!"

&amp;#x200B;

On the surface, I'm doing great. I just turned 21. I have a kickass career as an electrical engineer on my horizon and have traveled 2-3x a year since graduating high school. But deep down, I'm just bored. I feel like everything I do is a distraction from that boredom. I don't think I'm depressed in the traditional sense; the boredom is my motivator to \*do more\*. But no matter how much I do, it's never enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a year left in my electrical engineering degree. I have a near 4.0 GPA; the two B-'s I've gotten were because I failed to follow simple instructions from a professor.  These two instances:

&amp;#x200B;

\* I didn't email an assignment we completed/presented in class because I wasn't listening to the prof's instructions

\* I didn't copy my exam answers from my answer book to the question sheet because I wasn't listening to the prof's instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

I study \*maybe\* a collective 6 hours a week. School is easy but it's not fulfilling. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

My freshman year I traveled to a foreign country twice - once for pleasure and once for an internship. Sophomore year I traveled to a state 1000 miles away for an internship working on missile defense systems. After a few weeks, work became boring. I didn't like the way the company's standard work procedures - they were inefficient, wasteful, and mindless. So, I spent a few weeks writing a program to automate 75% of my job. After my job was automated I became bored. Again. 

&amp;#x200B;

During that summer I was bored a lot too. I traveled to a city 1500 miles away with a friend; we did a ton of cool things. I saw some natural wonders, drank a lot of beer, had great food, it was a blast. But then the evening before work rolled around and my trip was over and I was bored. So a few weeks later my friend and I went to a rollercoaster park in a city a few hours away. The rollercoasters were tons of fun. I even paid $50 for a 'skip the line' pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the city, my friend's dad\* treated us to the nicest dinner I've ever had. Wagyu beef, amazing lobster, the works. In the moment it was amazing. But then that trip ended and again, I was bored. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*I tutored their kid with math. It was his way of saying thank you - there's no way I could ever afford that meal.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

After the summer, I got back to school and once again was kind of bored. I say ""kind of"" because I was taking 3 classes that I found amazingly interesting - I loved the material and was motivated to do the work. But at the core, I was still bored. So I got my scholarship to fund a 3-week study abroad class in Europe. The course was loads of fun. I had a 2-week fling with a hot girl from Spain, I drove on the Autobahn, I drank a lot of beer. It was fun. But I was still bored. When things are actually happening, I'm excited and happy. But in the interim periods - even the few days in between activities, I just become bored. I can only describe it as a boredom-induced depression of sorts.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward to now, I'm interning at another company doing military radar and GPS hardware. Also, the company is located in a really cool city on the beach, 3000 miles away from home. As an intern, work comes and goes. I spent a few days convincing a manager I work under to let me try a project which he was reluctant to assign me since ""it'd take an experienced engineer more than a month to complete it."" I finished it in 2 weeks and now I'm bored again. My company doesn't have more work for me right now (I finished that task early this week) and so now I'm spending my days doing whatever work I can find. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends, but I can't hang out with them all the time - they do other things too. And whenever I do go out of my way to hang out with them, I feel like I'm just making a giant effort to not be bored. I can't vent about my struggles to friends because 95% of the time they take it as me bragging. Only the really close friends get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm bored. I don't have a real reason or purpose for this post. Hell, I don't even know if it's coherent. I just wish life moved at the pace I wanted it to.

I've asked a lot of people where I should go personally, and I've gotten some pretty conflicting advice, with some telling me go into the public sector for the benefits, and others telling me to pursue the private sector for the work ethic, pay, and to avoid red tape.

I know that generally, you'd want to go into the private sector when you're young for the growth opportunities and higher pay. However, I do feel that my proximity to DC does make public sector a bit more enticing than usual to think about, given the quantity of jobs available.

Any and all recommendations/questions welcome."
c79abs,1,2019-06-30,School or Full Time?,trapper6868,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/c79abs/school_or_full_time/,"I just finished my freshman year at a large, fairly prestigious university with an intended major in Cyber Security. I am currently working at an unpaid internship at a tech startup, and I was offered a full time job at the startup. I have found that the education I am receiving at my university is most likely not worth the price premium that I am paying for it, as I have learned more about the field in 1 month of internship time than I did in 2 semesters of schooling. I am heavily considering taking the job offer, and finishing my degree online through a different school that offers an online bachelors with cert prep classes. I guess my question is, is that a smart move? Would an online degree carry the same weight as a university with an enormous alumni network and general prestige, or would the experience of a full time tech gig at 19 outweigh the difference (if there is one)? Also, is it worth the risk of taking a full time job at a startup, not a firmly established company. (side note, although it is a startup, there are plenty of clients that work is being done for, the income/customer base is fairly steady, and I personally see huge opportunity for growth in the product sector the company is targeting)

My main point is that now that I'm graduated and no longer have to drain my soul everyday doing mundane tasks and long shitty exams, my mental health is loads better. Those of you barely holding on, just get through it the best you can.

Now I've got a set schedule that really let's me plan out my days and weekends way ahead of time. I work a 8-4 shift and getting paid an okay $40/hr for it.

The feeling of having to study or forgetting to turn something in still lingers but it's gradually going away.  I still get nightmares about Calc 2 and Physics 2, though.

c7fx00,2,2019-06-30,[UK] University choice and how it'll affect future prospects?,NoContact_,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/c7fx00/uk_university_choice_and_how_itll_affect_future/,"This is a FAQ but bare with me.

I finished my A Levels last year and got grades CEU in unrelated subjects (English Lang &amp; Lit, IT and History); these results were awful and way below my academic ability. The reason for that is a mix of lack of direction as to what I wanted to do after sixth form (I wasn't thinking about uni at the time) and problems at home that created additional, unnecessary stress.

Common sense says that these results won't put me within a million miles being considered by any uni (save for the likes of London Metropolitan, but I've already ruled out that one and several others), so I've decided to study an Access to HE course next year at a local college and start uni at age 21 as a mature student and make up for the poor A Level grades.

At this point, I have no chance of being considered by what are typically thought of as the ""best"" unis for Computer Science (see: Warwick, Manchester, Durham etc.) because of not taking A Level Maths. I still have a shot at getting into a good uni if I do well on the course though; I researched entry requirements and which unis do/don't accept access and found some good ones, including: Nottingham, Lancaster, Leicester, Sheffield (foundation year), and a few others.

So to get to the real question - how much will uni choice matter long term? Assuming that nothing goes to plan and I end up having to go to a low ranking uni with course content that doesn't match up, is that going to limit my potential in the CS field? Or will placement years and internships hold more weight? Is it worth filling in any gaps in knowledge or will I be rejected from internships for not covering the appropriate course content?

Final note: It's no use for me to do an A Level in Maths because all of the local colleges that I've looked at don't have any level 3 units in maths for their access courses, and this is a requirement for those that ask for maths A Level in conjunction.

I'm a 3rd year CS student about to go into my 4th and final year and I'm thinking about which graduates jobs I should apply for when my internship is finished. Ideally I would want a job that will provide progression to a means to acquire lots of wealth (i.e. I don't mind earning small amounts in the beginning as long as there is a possibility for me to earn lots later on when I have more experience)

I've been looking at salary estimates for 'devops' contracts in London on Indeed and the differences are staggering in comparison to standard SWE contracts. As of 30/06/19 Indeed claims that there are 634 devops contracts open and 421 of the 634 pay 90k or more. There are 504 SWE contracts and only a mere 174 pay 90k or more. Why is the there such a difference? This pattern also emerges when looking at full-time/permanent jobs but it's not as great. 

How competitive are these contracts relative to perm jobs? Are they more or less competitive? 

This makes me think I should try and get into a devops grad scheme instead of an SWE grad scheme because it will put me on the right path to acquiring wealth.

What are your thoughts?"

I've been passionate about tech and entrepreneurship for a long time, and learnt to code in high school. Going into college, I had built several side projects and done well in my high school CS course, but always knew I wouldn't want to work as a software engineer/developer for more than a couple years. 

In this past year at college I struggled quite a bit and questioned whether CS was the right path for me a lot of times. I definitely want to be able to build products and understand them at a deeper level, which is why I'm very determined to finish my CS degree. That said, I don't see myself being happy preparing for software engineering roles and becoming a developer, I'm much more of a product/team/entrepreneurial type of person who's excited about making impact and building cool things. I'm also very interested in fields like marketing and product design. 

Knowing that I want to become a product manager/entrepreneur, should I prepare to apply as a SWE intern for summer 2020? I keep reading about how experiences developers get much more respect from other devs and management, and are able to form more realistic timelines. I'm very confused about whether it's a better option to work towards becoming a PM right after college (which means trying to get PM internships) or go the software engineer ---&gt; PM route after several years of experience. I'm heavily inclined to the tech industry if that matters. I'd love to hear your opinions on this! 

Also, what do PM internships typically look for in candidates? Is GPA not very relevant like for SWE roles? And what about the importance of side projects? If anyone has experience with these I'd love to hear your insight. Thanks!

Also when looking at entry level positions, knowing your way around alot of languages isnt enough, you also need to know a 10 point list of libaries and frameworks... And the best thing is the ENTRY LEVEL positions that require 2-3 years of experience... How is that entry level?

I am an incoming junior in college who is trying to become the person I aspire to be. This year, I have been experimenting with many different sleep schedules and time management techniques, and I believe that I have finally reached what is ideal for me. 

I do my best to sleep at 11 PM and wake up at 6:30 AM. I have a summer internship which keeps me busy until 5 PM, but afterwards, I dedicate two hours of my evening to furthering my knowledge in Computer Science (my major), building projects, and preparing for software engineering internship interviews. I write my daily and weekly goals down in my notebook, then organize my online Calendar to schedule tasks that will help me accomplish my goals. The pommodore technique has been instrumental in reducing my procrastination. I allocate some of my weekend evenings for social life, but otherwise, I continue my projects and interview preparation. I am finally satisfied with my productivity and how I am operating and controlling my life. I really think this is steering me away from seeking help through antidepressants and other medical aides which I previously thought could solve my problems. I am also reducing my frequency of alcohol consumption to one night of drinking a month.

However, I am nervous about going back to college. Looking back, many of my best memories have been made past midnight, and it seems that the highlight of social activity occurs past 11 PM on weekend nights. However, when I don't stick to my weekday schedule on weekends, it REALLY throws me off. I get headaches, I feel uncontrollably depressed and lazy, and it ruins my day. I would really like to wake up between 6AM - 7AM every day, but that might limit my social life. 

I don't want to have friends drift away from me because I am no longer present in their best social moments. I feel really anxious about this. This school year, when I was trying to improve my life, I got lots of comments saying that I was taking things too seriously, wasn't fun anymore, etc. On one hand, I thought ""fuck them, it's my life"", but on the other, I really started to think there was some validity to their message. I don't want to be that guy who you never see, who is just always working and never makes time for anyone. But I really don't want to ruin all the development I've put into making myself a happier person. I am trying to think of ways to balance the two, but am having trouble.

I'm a rising junior and going to apply for the Stanford and Harvard deferred admission programs in 2021. Would appreciate feedback from people here and what I should do to substantially increase my chances.

**Academic Background:**

Undergrad &amp; major: Computer Science @ top 5 CS school

GPA: 3.3. I realize this is low, and this is my major area of concern. One of my only priorities is to get my GPA between 3.6 and 3.7 from now till when I apply (which is 3 semesters). Took time to adjust to the U.S. system, and had severe mental health issues my third semester. Freshman year was 3.1, third semester I got rekt with a C+ and a D. Repeated the D course last semester and got an A. The D is still on my transcript, but won't count in my GPA.

GMAT: Haven't taken yet

Race/nationality: Indian (International Student)

Sex: M

**Work experience:**

Internship at a startup after freshman year, interning currently at a large enterprise software company. Studying to get a FAANG internship next summer.

Also did research in the intersection of biology and computer science during my third semester. Professor is aware of my difficulties during that semester and has offered to write me a recommendation. Not doing that anymore though.

**Extra curriculars:**

* Founding member and director of STEM for a pre-incubator startup program at my university. Last semester was its first run, and it was very successful. I personally advertised the program in my department through various clubs and organizations that resulted in a 20% increase in applications in a 5 day period.
* Former member of the International Student Body. Only stayed for a semester, but organized a speaker panel that brought in professionals from various fields who were international students themselves. Covered various topics that affect internationals like acclimatizing to the U.S. college system, different visa structures, getting jobs etc.
* Member of the IEEE chapter, and founding member of a new committee within the chapter that is responsible for outreach.
* Been on course staff for two CS courses.

**Relevant future plans:**

* Joining the student government under an executive, and will run for a position myself next semester.
* Working on some side projects. Want to monetize at least one and start a company.

**Other info:** Lived and studied in multiple continents (Asia, Europe, Africa) before college.

**Question:** This might be a stupid question, but what do such programs value more - research experience or founding a startup/leadership in a club/student body? The logic behind deferred programs is to get people who traditionally wouldn't get an MBA. Someone who's doing academic research fits the bill. On the other hand, I've often seen it mentioned here that business schools are looking for leaders. I don't have the bandwidth for both, which is why I want to do one of the two. (Or maybe I'm wrong on all fronts and someone can correct me)

I'm also unsure of joining a consulting club in university. Would my chances decrease if I join a consulting club, since it's sort of a business-y activity, something that deferred programs don't like?

**Goal of MBA:**  I want a complete education from both the technical and business standpoints. I want to use this combination and apply it to my already global viewpoint to uplift people around the world, since technology is region and culture agnostic.

**Target schools:** HBS 2+2 and Stanford GSB"

I have been the sole programmer at a company for almost 4 years now and we are getting to the point where we might add another programmer full time. Also the local college asked us if we would take 2 interns this School year. But right now all of my code is maintained on my local computer and in one drive not a big deal when it was just me working and maintaining all the code. However I have been looking into migrating it all to a GitHub Professional or Team Account.

1. Should every project have its own repository? 
   1. I have about 60+ Projects I maintain for commercial and residential clients 
2. Or can I have a single Master Repository with folders / sub directories for each project so that I can reference a common subdirectory within the Master Repository with all my Reusable Code and Documentation?
3. I was going to originally set up GIT on our Server but I like how GIT Hub makes it easy for technicians to easily go in and add notes to a project on what needs to be fixed or bugs in the code. We use to do this in readme file attached to each project but this looks and feels a lot nicer. 
4. Is there any other recommendations on good practices to implement on moving from One Drive to GIT?  

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for your advice."

I've tried android development for over two years and ended up hating my life because it required me to sacrifice all my time including weekends to keep myself updated. I quit after an internship. I want a less complex, less abstract, more stable job, especially a one that doesn't require an intense continuous learning. I'm a slow learner and want to enjoy life outside work with my family. I don't care about having a high salary.

Small Edit :
- I'm 28 and I have a CS bachelor degree.
- I'm a foreigner living in France so getting a gov job is very hard! Anyway I get the idea of joining a large company.
- I have put in efforts to learn, I just can't learn on the fly. I had a very hard time understanding basic software design patterns and doing advanced maths (Algebra, Analysis, Calculus). 
- I'm an ISTJ on MBTI if this helps.
- I really need your help, I had some suicidal thoughts not so long ago and I had to see a psy."
c7lfkx,0,2019-06-30,I have an inferiority complex,aitgvet,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/c7lfkx/i_have_an_inferiority_complex/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I will be entering my junior year in the fall. I have only completed three computer science courses at the undergrad level. With that being said, I have been successful. This is not due to natural talent. I spend hours banging my head against the wall to finally come up with solutions. I understand the importance of perseverance so I'm fine with that, despite seeing friends do things in a fraction of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

But despite my success in the classroom, I still have zero confidence. I want to get an internship next summer (because I failed to this summer). When I go on leetcode, I can't do any of the interview prep questions. I can't think of any practice projects I want to do. I'm unsure of which books to read and what resources to listen to in order to improve. I'm worried that I am just doing well in classes, but don't actually have any skills.

&amp;#x200B;

What books have you guys read and what informative podcasts are out there for beginners? What practice projects have you done in Java? What strategy do you use to complete these cursed interview questions? And above all, how did you become confident? I have two months left in the summer (having just completed a summer course), and I want to be on track for being an attractive candidate for an internship when interview season comes around.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks guys!"
