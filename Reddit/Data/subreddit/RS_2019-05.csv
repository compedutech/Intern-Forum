bjaore,2,2019-04-30,Consequences of breaking internship contract?,throwaway8bdz1217a,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bjaore/consequences_of_breaking_internship_contract/,"I was recently offered a one month summer internship at a large accounting firm (not one of the big 4 though) and I signed the contract.  Let's call this company A.  A few days later one of the big 4 contacted me for an interview, let's call this company B. The internship of company B is almost three months long, compared to only one month for company A. 

&amp;#x200B;

After attending the interview for company B I received another call for a second round of interviews. At this stage I have already signed the contract for company A, and am now awaiting my follow up interview for company B.  The issue I'm facing is that the two internships would overlap and I would have to choose one or the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

If company B offers me an internship position I believe it would be much better for my career, since it's with one of the big 4 accounting firms, versus the smaller company A, and the length of the internship would be longer as well (3 months as opposed to 1 month).  I need to figure out an answer before my follow up interview with company B, and this is my current dilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had any experience in this situation? I'm sure many others must have been faced with this same scenario, so I'm trying to understand the best way to handle this. My main concern is that if I take the position with company B and break the contract with company A, will there be major consequences to this, such as getting blacklisted for any future position with company A, or within the general accounting community?  Or is this something that company A won't even care about 2 years down the road for example?   Are there any other downsides to breaking an internship contract?  Thanks"
bjatzq,17,2019-04-30,Parents want to cut ties with me,asskechum1,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/bjatzq/parents_want_to_cut_ties_with_me/,"TLDR: Super dysfunctional family.

Hey guys, I’ve been having major problems with my parents for a long time now, but our relationship has never been this bad until very recently. They’re driving me crazy and I need support/advice on what to do going forward. I’ll try to present the situation as objectively as possible. Sorry if this is long, but I want to paint a clear picture of my family’s complex dynamics.

Background:
My parents are your typical Asian parents who subscribe to traditional Chinese values such as: respect your elders, work hard and make money, don’t question authority, yada yada. Money is all that matters to attracting a girl. Fun is for the weak-minded and poor. You know the drill. They are wealthy and have always been able to provide for all of my financial needs. 

I am a 24 yo male who has been living with my parents for the past couple of years. I have poor self esteem issues due to years of verbal/psychological abuse from my parents. I attended a top 5 college for undergrad, but didn’t perform well academically due to depression and laziness. As such, I couldn’t find a decent job when I graduated due to my lowish GPA. I wasted my parents’ hard-earned money because they financed my entire tuition, living expenses, etc. during those 4 years. However, since graduation, my depression has declined dramatically, and I have worked my ass off these past 2 years in order to get into a top 5 law school, which I’ll be attending this August. I have been fueled in part by guilt of having wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars spent by my parents, but mostly I just want to make my parents proud of me for once in my life. I have been working as a paralegal for approximately half of the time since I’ve graduated college. Although it sounds good on paper, my life has been hell these past 2 years due to daily/weekly harassment from my parents (which is fair to some extent but not to this extent).

My dad is a workaholic - he works from morning until late at night (he usually doesn’t get home until 9 P.M.) on weekdays, weekends, and even works while on vacation for majority of the time. He is very condescending and never has anything good to say about anyone who he doesn’t perceive as high status (i.e. make a certain amount of money). He does this because (1) he is very greedy (2) he has nothing else to be personally proud of because he has devoted his entire life to making money (3) wants to feel good about his lifestyle choices. Apart from financial support, he has never been involved in any aspect of my life apart from helping me get an internship one summer during college and attending graduations. He has no idea about what’s happening in my life other than the bad things. We don’t really talk and he doesn’t even greet me when we see each other, even though we live under the same roof. He has always put me down by calling me stupid, not hard working, essentially not good enough to become successful in the future. His conversations to me are very fixed in vocabulary - meaning he repeats pretty much the same shit over and over again.

My mom, on the other hand, is very caring and always makes sure my needs are met - food, shelter, basic necessities. She makes sure I study above and beyond for my academics and that I am healthy. Sounds like an awesome mother right? Unfortunately, she has many bad qualities as well. She is bipolar and is overworked from handling my father’s business and taking care of the house. Some days she can be nasty and other days pleasant. She can be quite manipulative and twists arguments and facts because she thinks she is always right no matter what. She always compares me to more successful kids of parents she socializes with. No matter how much I improve, there is always someone else who makes my achievements irrelevant. We have explosive arguments every month/few weeks that always stem from her unnecessarily criticizing me and then me cursing her out. We have a love/hate relationship.

Manipulation:
Most of my frustration is derived from feeling like I’m never good enough as a son, no matter how hard I try to improve. I understand I was a piece of shit for not putting enough effort in undergrad. I understand that they want me to be financially independent. I’ve been trying to improve myself in these respects. It’s why I studied 8-10 hours a day for months on end in front of my mom in order to score as high as I could on the LSAT. Its why I let them confiscate my computer for an entire year. It’s why I told them that I would pay my law school tuition and living expenses on my own. It’s why I helped my mom whenever she asked me to clean the pool, cut the hanging branches off all the trees in the backyard, rake all the leaves, carry 60 bags of leaves from the backyard all the way to the front of the house, move groceries/books/furniture into and around the house, remove weeds from the grass, shovel the snow, clean the house of any mold, wash the dishes, and more. She recently got into some legal trouble for assaulting someone, and I pretty much worked as her personal lawyer, scrutinizing all the video evidence, reviewing correspondence with her actual lawyer, and attending every single Court hearing with her. I’ve been trying my hardest to be a good son. My mom used to be upset I rarely went to the gym even though I was paying $10/month for a member’s pass. So I’ve been going 5 times a week now for the past 4 months. My parents were upset that I was taking a break from work after I got into law school. So I’ve been working in a stressful environment at a law firm the past half year.  I never ask my mom to cook or do anything for me in order to reduce her stress.

And you know what their responses have been to all of my efforts? My mom told me I was lying about studying 8-10 hours and that it was actually only 4-5 hours. She told me that I never helped her around the house, and when I listed all the various chores I help her do in order to show her how wrong she was, she told me that I was bragging about myself and that she’d never ask for help ever again. When I wanted to retake the LSAT for a second time, she started an argument that resulted in me almost being kicked out of the house because she only wanted me to take it once (it’s very common to take the LSAT multiple times ever since new rules were implemented a few years ago). She has made verbal contracts with me saying she never wanted to speak to me ever again. I literally didn’t speak a single word to her for an entire month this past February.  Two months ago my dad stormed into my room yelling like a madman because I hadn’t responded within an hour to his text to come downstairs regarding finding housing for law school, even though I was literally in the process of finding roommates. I kept my mouth shut, but he kept screaming at me until I stood up from my chair to confront him, and he made a motion to strike me. We got into a physical altercation, and my mom sided with my dad, saying I tried to hit him first even though she wasn’t present and that I should have responded to his text sooner. The most recent contention was yesterday when my father refused to be give me guarantor verification for my apartment lease for the next year (even though he had agreed 2 weeks prior and I had already paid the deposit and application fees) because apparently I am not working 60 hours like this other kid and he didn’t think I was cut out for law school. He thinks I’m trying to depend on him to pay my rent, even though I’ve made well enough money to cover it and have made it clear I’m paying for law school all by myself. Having a guarantor is mandatory for the lease and he was trying to fuck me over for no reason because he knew I’d be able to pay it by myself. Luckily my mom sided with me and forced him to just be my guarantor. Today, my mom and I got into another argument over cleaning my room (even though I had already cleaned it 2 days ago). I called her abnormal and unable to understand English because she was manipulating something I said again, which resulted in her saying she wanted me out of her life because she can’t handle the disrespect from me. But this time is different and I know she really means it. She thinks she is the victim in all of this because I curse at her and refuse to keep my head down and tolerate all of the abuse they hurl at me.

I apologize for the rambling on...there’s just too much to unravel, and so much I have not even mentioned. Please give me some guidance."

bjbvbr,2,2019-04-30,I really can't make up my mind about a job offer to an up-and-coming start up(as SDET) vs a bigger one(job is more towards SDE),throaway_cant_decide,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bjbvbr/i_really_cant_make_up_my_mind_about_a_job_offer/,"So a bit of a background about me, I'm graduating with a Software Engineering degree in Canada. I've been working full-time ( while in school) as a mobile developer at a small company in my city and been a pretty integral part of the process ( I helped refactor a good chunk of our mobile app). I also did a year and a half at another big company as an intern for QA (for 4-5 months), the rest was as a regular engineering inter.Currently, I'm moving city towards a bigger tech center and been offered multiple roles.

&amp;#x200B;

The company that interest me the MOST is a start-up-ish company as a SDET. I voiced my concern to the recruiter about SDET and was told I wasn't the only one who was a new-grad and went into SDET and transferred into SDE. I know recruiters though... you can tell a potential hire 1001 promises just to get them in. However, this company also deals with very technical intensive stuff ( without going into too much details or I'd give away the company).  So, I COULD see why hiring a new grad into the technical intensive aspect of things could be unwanted. I also come from a background that isn't very relatable to what they do (I.e: they deal with a lot of distributed system and I've never had to deal with a code base that dealt with distributed system). I love the concept, the culture, and everything around the job. The testing does seem to be quite difficult since they have to mock plenty of things that are almost hardware level.  But even then, SDET isn't my end goal.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been offered mobile engineer opportunity at a bigger company (can't go more into details) with competitive salary but the culture seems more corporate and a lot different from first one. The technical stack looks interesting, but I'd stay in the mobile world where as the other I'd branch off from mobile ( which I've gotten a bit bored of, maybe its because of what I'm dealing with currently though).

&amp;#x200B;

So, in the end, I'm kind-of worried of being stuck in a rut taking the SDET position even though the product looks very promising and interesting  ( as well as the culture of the company). Would I be making a terrible mistake believing the recruiters word?

&amp;#x200B;

I just need outside opinions because I can't really speak about this to anyone I know currently since the two jobs requires moving out of town and I don't want to tell anyone yet. So here I am trying to get some outside perspective on my conundrum.

&amp;#x200B;

Small edit: I want to say I do have side projects (one that is already up and running and was my end of degree project and another with a businessmen that has a ton of funding)."

I haven't gotten a chance to visit it yet but it's relatively close since I live in the San Jose area. I've gotten in for CS at OSU and Computer Eng at SFSU. 

I got into OSU a month ago and have already visited it, I really liked the big campus and it seemed like I would always be able to find something to keep me busy with both athletics and clubs. The tuition however is much greater than SFSU at around 45k while SFSU is supposedly 12k as an in-state resident.

SFSU's main advantage in my book is being in the Bay Area so much opportunities with internships, much closer to home and the ability to transfer to a UC would be much easier. Cons are it's much smaller campus, less activities, not the college experience I was looking for in a busy city.

OSUs pros are slightly better academics, amazing safe small town with no traffic, better facilities and teacher(so I've heard), incredible campus and location, as well as great school-spirit. Cons are basically the pros of sfsu: distance from home, less tech job opportunities nearby, and no chance to go back to a UC. 

My parents claim they can afford both but I have a younger sibling and need to look out for his education as well. I've paid both deposits but will withdraw from 1 tomorrow. Any advice is welcome."

I'm extremely excited that I just got my first face to face internship interview after going through an application online then a second screening survey for this small dev company. I'm now in the final stage of the process for the face to face. While I've had previous part time jobs before in customer service, I've never officially interviewed for anything Tech related. The online application part had all fields about education and previous work experience. The secondary portion of the application process contained questions about technological knowledge and also a coding portion, which I had passed as well.

Now it got me thinking the final in person stage, what should I expect in the 30 minutes that I am scheduled to be there? Should I expect them to ask me mostly behavioral questions since the previous two applications lacked anything of the sort and also get ready for more technical questions?

Also how does an internship interview differ from an official job interview? Or would the company not make the distinction and just treat the intern like an employee, albeit a green grasshopper that is fresh out of school?"

&gt;""It is very easy to quietly work in your cubicle all day, do a fantastic job and enjoy your work, but at the end of the day no one at your company knows who you are or what you are doing, and because of that you miss out on lots of career opportunities. It is vital to be proactive and make sure others know what you are doing and who you are.""

My questions for you:

* Have you found this to be pretty true universally, or do you think these guys may have overstated the importance of it due to shared experiences at a particular company?

* What are some practical ways to actually do this?

I really needed this springbreak from school, school is going super well but it costs me a lot of energy and i really need my rest  First i make the stupid decision of even accepting to continue my internship for one of the two days to compensate for a day i had been sick earlier, then i cant say no when they ask me if i could assist today aswell bc lack of people, so here i am working my second internship shift on this springbreak that i really fucking needed  

Today was intense, and i mean intense, i had to work really fuckign hard because there was a huge lack of workers, so i had to take care of both breakfast and lunch for atleast 15 elder people on my own, im super fucking gratefull to be able to do this function and be able to be there for those people and the bad situation theyre in, but its super fucking exhaustign, this one woman keeps on complaining about everything, and i dont blame her for it at all cuz its mostly bc of her dementia, but i hope yall understand how mentally wrecking it is when ur working super hard to please everyone to grant them the good life they deserve at their old age, and all you get back is complaining about what im doing wrong and what she would want different

Im finally done, go home, intensely tired, decide to make a gehaktbal (typical dutch meat dish) for lunch to cheer me up a bit, while taking it out of the microwave i burn my hands, smash my toe to the wall so fucking hard half the nail breaks off and its bleeding like fuck, i havent stopped crying since,  The exact same thing as last school break has happened, i really need my rest for the sake of my mental state, but i end up exhausting myself so much more then school would have done, and i dont even notice it till its way too late  

At this point i just wanna go back to school, seeing my friends 3 days a week is the single thing that keeps me super motivated and mentally in the right place, i feel super guilty over complaining about such bs when i should be feeling blessed with how my life has totally flipped in the positive sense, but still here i am, sitting at my desk on a wednesday, 1 o clock, and already ready to collapse and been crying for the past 15 mins,"

I tried applying for internships to gain some hands on experience but the recruiters said I dont have much in my resume. Im sorry for the long question but Im really confused. In 6 months I'll be sitting for college placements and I havent worked on any real projects. All my professors have the same reply that publish a research paper.

Let me know if this is more appropriate for r/cscareerquestions.

I started working as a software engineering intern six months ago developing small projects from scratch to help employees be more efficient at the their jobs (data collection for maps). It was fun and challenging, but it was also good experience for someone like me breaking into the industry because I got to own the design phase AND development phase.

However, I have since moved to another internship within the company, this one under actual java engineers working on a large spring mvc web app. Besides not having any experience in java or the spring framework, I am also struggling to get up to speed on the project itself. It's just so overwhelming and its scope is huge. I understand what the program's purpose is, but doing something as simple as refactoring a class or compiling a library seems so daunting.

Where do I start with all this? I'm a fast learner, but I can't help but feel like a fish out of water at the moment ...

bjinnb,8,2019-05-01,Advice: Switching Majors Senior Year,CaptainGaston,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bjinnb/advice_switching_majors_senior_year/,"I’m currently finishing my 7th semester of college, and I’m really scared. 

I’ve been thinking of switching to a Computer Science degree in order to find a job. It would take me at minimum 44 hours to complete the program. The reason I’m thinking of switching is: I love video games, I want financial stability (even if I can’t break into the game industry), and I liked a class in the past that used Alice to introduce programming. 

I didn’t originally pursue computer science because I was afraid I couldn’t make it with my math ability. Whenever, I joined a math class or computer science class I felt completely lost, and quickly switch it to something else early-on.  I’ve also never done an internship. I never felt I was experienced enough to do one. Which, I know may sound dumb. 

My other three options are: 

1. Graduate with a film degree with a history minor and computer animation minor in 5 semesters.

2. Graduate with a history degree and film studies minor in 2-3 semesters.

3. Graduate with a history degree and film studies minor in 3 semesters.

In terms of financial aid:

I haven’t taken any loans.

I have 5 semesters worth of the pell grant left.

I have at least 1 semester of state funding left.

Any and all advice would be appreciated! I know I’ve messed up badly, and may sound naive. I just feel like if I can’t get a job I love I’ve failed life. I like history, but the history classes have always been something I’ve taken because I was scared of computer science and art programs (computer animation is a last ditch effort). I started taking film classes because I eventually said screw it I’m going to take stuff that’s cool whether it’s viable or not. 

I’m currently looking into Khan Academy to get better for math and computer science coursework. Sorry if the post is a downer, or it’s hard to read."

I find that books suit my learning style better than other forms of study and I would like to progress to another book with a larger practical focus with some code examples etc. but one which still contains a good amount of theory. I have spent some time researching some possibilities but I am not sure which book would be most appropriate. Some possibilities I came across were:   
'[Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33986067-deep-learning-with-python)'

'[Fundamentals of Deep Learning by Nikhil Buduma and Nicholas Locascio](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35235663-fundamentals-of-deep-learning)'

Add to this story the fact that one happened this last Sunday and lasted for 18+ hours. I have been dealing with the results of this brownout for the past few days in our office. As some quick background, this is an office of about 45 people, most of whom are software developers and a couple of business managers. I am the sole IT guy (hired on full-time 7 months ago after the last guy left for another company, who was in charge of me during an internship that lasted 1.5 years) supporting the office. This is perfectly manageable on any regular day. But when we get these brownouts, shit goes down. Servers turn off, autostarting services don't come back, iptables reset to defaults.

&amp;#x200B;

I came in Monday and quickly put out a few small fires: getting the TortoiseSVN server back up and running, restarting a few PCs, logging outage info into a complaints book we have against our leaser for the office space... But worst of all, our 10-year-old PC running an old, outdated Timesheet program crashed. Took out the hard drive and put it on my bench for testing. 2689 days 13 hours, 50% health, 556 total start/stop count, 1300 weak sectors reported via Hard Disk Sentinel. Dear God, can I even navigate the drive? Backups? Are there ANY backups??? Checking on our NASes that have backups of all our servers on them, the last backup was from 2014... The backup schedule hadn't been running on this PC in over 4 years because the drive was too damaged, it was failing backups and no one knew.

&amp;#x200B;

I lucked out big time, I was able to navigate to the drive on my PC. Copied over as much as possible, but backup programs or cloning software would fail halfway through and get a disk error. Everything I tried to restore the disk at least enough to clone it over to a new one or get an image was failing. This was super important to clone since the software is no longer supported or can be found anywhere, it was running on Windows 7, and it runs on IIS + SQL which I have zero idea how to use. This needs to be back up ASAP since our billing manager needs to run reports for paychecks.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the past three days trying different programs to get the drive clone-able or image-able while building up a new device using the old database and software, copied over from the old drive.

&amp;#x200B;

Well finally, today, Hard Disk Sentinel saved my fucking life. The Pro version (which I paid for out of my own pocket months ago for personal use) has this nifty feature called ""Disk Repair"". If you have it, this can be found at Surface Test &gt; Test Type &gt; Disk Repair. It took over 24 hours to complete, but it fixed the drive completely. Reported it at 100% health, even after another Read Surface Test. Still, not taking any chances and following common sense, I cloned it over to an SSD, backed all info up, and got the PC running as-it-was again! Plus since it's now on an SSD, it's slightly faster (the PC is a massive bottleneck since it's slow as shit). Immediately got the backups running again to two different locations and will immediately work on getting our timesheets into an updated cloud service.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I swear I'm not an HD Sentinel shill"

I graduated last year with a degree that I'm not using (Health) at a small company that I work at, and my position is on the business side. I like the job but would like a career change into something more technical. I've been doing programming and enjoy the problem-solving aspect of it, and I've been accepted into the Oregon state online post-bacc program. I've also contacted admission at the school I graduated from last year, and they said that I could come back and do their Computer Science program, which is in the top 30 in the country. It would take a full 4 years to complete the program (vs 2.5 online), and would cost about 50% more than the online degree.

The pros of the online degree are: Flexibility, lower cost, faster (by about a year), and I could work full time.

The cons of the online degree are: Lack of networking, non-ideal learning environment

The pros of the physical campus are: Networking, ideal learning environment, fantastic career placement services through the engineering department, on-campus workshops, more prestigious degree (Idk if this matters), opportunities for multiple internships while earning a degree

The cons of the physical campus : Slower, would probably work on campus part-time to cover expenses, more expensive, much less flexible, would be a broke college student until I'm 27

What would you guys do given this decision? Any input is appreciated. Thanks."

I wanted to cry that day but was as polite as possible: smiling and thanking him for the opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost all my friends are currently working at Google. I don't understand what I am lacking. I just don't ever get the opportunity to even get the interview.

Yesterday, I applied to new grad position at Microsoft and today morning, I got a rejection letter (most likely an automated e-mail because there's no way rejections come so fast especially outside the conventional 9-5 hours &lt;rejection came while I was sleeping&gt;). \[the reply stated I did not have enough experience. I don't understand. I have been in the industry for almost a year now and I was applying for a new grad position. It's just so depressing. I want to have a chance too.\]

&amp;#x200B;

I recall in senior year I applied to hundreds (literally hundreds) many of which I had no idea of. Got total of only 3 interviews. Of the 3, I got in all 3: 1 not software related, 1 questionable start up, and current firm \[multi-billion dollar firm\].

I want to have the chance to at least land an interview with these tech firms. I want to be given a chance to prove myself. It's frustrating and demoralising to not even get a phone interview. I don't know what I am lacking. I took courses like Modern Algebra as a Computer Science major. I basically double majored in college in both math and computer science. I took some of the most rigorous courses available in college \[including humanities\] and did not slack off in terms of workload.

Hence, I now humbly request for guidance. It must be because of my resume. I want an honest (and helpful) review of my resume. Please don't sugar coat it. I feel my college resume helpers sugar coated too much. I know the results. Almost 400 online submissions. Barely 3 results of which all 3 only decided to interview me because I went to a Columbia Univ. It was either no reply or company @noreply.com.

Thank you in advance.

I secured an internship with Valero at a refinery in Texas this summer. The have misfiled multiple different submissions of my paperwork (honestly, this part just annoys me) and just informed me this afternoon that the apartment that we signed on (through Valero) would not be ready until 30 days into my internship. They suggested we “Find a hotel or sign a 30 day lease at another apartment complex.”

Here’s the kicker: I don’t have any money. The rent for our apartment was to be taken from our paychecks. There are no other apartments in town and the idea of living in a hotel for $50+ a night is absolutely preposterous. I swear to you I am not even the type of guy to complain. The amount of time and effort I have put forth retrieving documents multiple times and finding somewhere to live for the third time has exhausted me. 

This is just a curveball. I have dealt with worse and will come out fine at the end of the day. However, I do not wish to start a career with a company that continues to make mistakes on my end. They have shown no remorse for making us find three places to live in two months and have not offered any financial help even though it has been their fault every time. 

Have any of you worked for Valero before? Have I just experienced an unfortunate chain of events? Are these a normal amount of problems to deal with and I just need to grow up? I would love some opinions."

Throughout the 12 years of grade school, i continuously got bad grades because of social anxiety. I thought that my teachers thought that i was stupid. I had no real friends. I was bullied at a young age so i learned how to keep quiet so people could not make fun of me anymore. However, I'm an extrovert with social anxiety. So, i felt trapped in my own body everyday. This affected my self worth and consequently my grades suffered. Even at 6 years old, I didn't think i was worth the education, as weird as that sounds. I used to throw my homework assignments in the trash without doing them because i thought it was not worth it for me. But i knew i was not stupid. I always knew that. But no one believed in me. Not my teachers or even some family members. I wish i had one teacher tell me that i was smart and noticed the social anxiety. Then, I went to college and exceeded all expectations. I took honors classes and did an internship. I presented research. College was my way of starting over. It was easy because i didn't have to interact with anyone lol. I could be an extrovert in class when answering questions the professor asked, and i was so happy with that. Then i just went home and studied. My confidence grew when i attained knowledge.

All my hard work paid off but the cost was pushing aside my family to study. 

My father would call me everyday and I would cut our conversations short . He would ask me to call him but I didn't have the chance to. I miss him. I miss him terribly. I hate myself for pushing him aside when he was alive. 

Recently I've been thinking of just killing myself to hopefully see him again ( I am muslim and we believe in meeting souls of our loved ones after death) . But I know I have an entire life to live for and my father would not want that . 

Recently Ive been just getting more and more of these thoughts. Today I kept promising myself that I will make it alive today. I promised myself that I will eat something my husband had cooked for me when my shift was over. I just wanted today to be over . Now that I am home and ate food in his arms, I congratulated myself .

This is probably the hardest decision of my life, and even after a good amount of time thinking I accepted BOTH of CPP and CSULB's admission offers as a Comp. Science major. Yes, I am an indecisive little bugger. 

I'll decide by the end of today (May 2nd) which school I will email and cancel their offer, so my admission won't be revoked hopefully lol. Anyway, Cal Poly Pomona is the cheapest option since I will be able to commute and not have to dorm. My family will also be able to get a puppy (yeah so much for saving money) since I'll be able to stay home and help take care of it. CPP is also more renowned for its engineering program, and of course I'll be able to keep in close contact with most friends I already know since many of them go there or near there.

But CSULB is overall a better campus in my opinion. CPP seems like it will be a repeat of my high school, just slightly nicer in campus but the same vibe. Long Beach seems more interesting and has a better feel to it. Dorming there would provide me with an actual college experience. I will also be able to be roommates with 2 of my other friends so that will help out a lot too, both with money and save my social awkward self a bit of stress. Even with CPP's renown for its technology/engineering focus, CSULB is apparently ranked the same or around the same in most other threads I have seen on Google.

The only thing I am a little unaware of is which one has better job or internship opportunities either during or right out of college.

Hopefully that covers most things, and I look forward to your opinions!"

Since, he came back in Europe twice for the holidays (Christmas) and we've seen each other every time.

I suffered from depression myself for years so I kinda know how he feels, but I had my family (his is... not great) and managed to make friends that helped me through it.

He thinks he's useless and nothing but a burden for others. He didn't tell me everything sooner because he didn't want to annoy me. I told him I'm here for him anytime and he's never bothering me, but I think he doesn't believe me because he has a very low self-esteem right now.

bjvcwa,404,2019-05-02,I got a 4.0 while taking 20 credits and didn’t hate my life. Here’s how.,extraspicyavocado,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bjvcwa/i_got_a_40_while_taking_20_credits_and_didnt_hate/," 

This is a story about how this spring semester, I got straight A’s in 20 credits worth of classes while also working part time, volunteering, securing a summer internship, trying not to neglect my relationships, exercising daily, and getting 8 hours of sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not trying to “flex” \*hello fellow kids\*, but I see a lot of people asking for advice, especially new students, wondering if their credit load will overwhelm them.  I hope this helps someone.  \*\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A Brief History:**

I am a 25 yo female who just finished my “Junior” year of undergrad. “Junior” because it was my fourth year of college and I have a ton of credits, but I still have a full academic year before I graduate. After high school, I dragged ass and essentially failed out after two years of an unrelated degree (art), took three years off, then went back two years ago for my current degree.

When I left school, I was absolutely convinced that I was dropping out of college, not taking a break. I had anxiety attacks before attending class, felt extremely lost, could barely pay attention in lecture, and struggled with substance abuse. I finished my last semester with a semester GPA of 1.9 and a total GPA of 2.5. Yikes. 

In high school, I was one of those “gifted” but burnt out kids. My teachers always said I was smart, but it was such a shame that I refused *apply* myself. After taking a break from school and doing some soul searching, I decided: I’m a fucking adult, I’m going back to college, for real this time. I’m going to apply my goddamn self. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**About my degree:**

I’m studying public health. To me, my degree is the perfect mix of “hard science” classes and humanities classes. I take classes in the realm of microbiology, A&amp;P, epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. The mix of memorization-style studying and critical thinking, writing essays and discussion style work makes it so that I’m never bored. (I go to a large state school in the northwest U.S. if that matters to you). 

This is the part where someone butts in and says you could never do this with a STEM degree. Sure. Probably not. I’m not saying that every person regardless of major should take my advice, just trying to share what I have learned. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Decision:**

I do a little mental checklist before I assemble a semester’s worth of classes (because advisors are useless- you already *know*). This particular semester, it just somehow worked out that I wasn’t going to be taking any classes that required large amounts of difficult studying. I don’t mean work, but *studying.* That is not to say that I didn’t do any work. I still had shit to do. Readings to skim, essays to write, research to do, the works. But I didn’t really *study*, which takes up a lot more abstract time than *doing.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My Classes:** 

I took 4 three credit courses and 2 four credit courses. All but two of my courses were 400 level classes with a significant amount of work. (If you’re curious: 3 credit 200 level medical anthropology and a 3 credit 100 level earth science class- my last core requirement)

I like to breakdown my classes at the beginning of the semester based on how difficult I deem them to be. You can usually figure this out by the first couple weeks of class, or after the first graded assignment. How much work will this require time-wise and brain-power-wise, and how big of a hardass grader is the prof? THIS is a big deal. Once I figured this out, college seemed so much more like a game. I would highly recommend doing this, you can reassess throughout the semester and as you learn more about your own grade in the class. I typically write my courses on a sticky note in order of priority and slap it in my planner. Speaking of which:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Planner set up:**

I need a paper planner. It’s absolutely non-negotiable. I could not survive college without one, and you shouldn’t try to. I bring it everywhere. I’ve tried bullet journaling, keeping a to-do list in a notebook, google calendar- none of them compare to the ease of use and accuracy of a paper planner. A typical week in mine looks like [this!](https://imgur.com/a/r5qhd0i)

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the semester, I write the time every class takes place in my weekly spread A4 Target planner. Then, I go through the syllabus and enter every single thing next to when it is due. For each week of the semester, I have two sticky notes on the page. I do this because inevitably things get moved around. In my photo, you can see that the smaller yellow note is for readings, and the large pink one is my ongoing to-do list. The readings being separate is important because otherwise everything gets clogged up, and I can see at a glance what I need to read (or skim, or pretend to have read). I organize my to-do list by class, and have a section for “life”. The first thing I do every morning is look at my planner, and it’s one of the last things I look at before I go to bed. As soon as I sit down in class, I open it up. When making plans with a friend, I open it up. I can’t overstate this enough. Get a planner and use the shit out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Work:** 

I had the unique situation of not having to work that much this semester. I received a federal grant that paid for most of my tuition, scholarships paid for the rest, and my family helps me out with part of my living expenses. This is obviously not everyone’s reality.

The last three semesters, I have worked up to 30 hours each week, and it really is fucking hard. Working takes up a lot of your time and energy, and I wouldn’t recommend working while taking this heavy of a course load. 

That being said, I did still work. I like working. I like having money, I like the structure and I like having something productive besides school to do. In the past, I was an assistant teacher at a private preschool. This semester, I was lucky enough to be able to substitute teach at least one 6 hour shift each week because of my school schedule (Fridays off, Thursdays half off). I also babysat a couple of nights each week pretty consistently. This ended up being about 10-15 hours a week of work- an easy couple hundred bucks in my pocket for rent and nights out. The best part about this situation is that if I was really swamped, I could just completely opt out of work or not schedule anything. When I wasn’t busy with school, I could put in a 20 hour workweek. It put me in control.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Volunteering:**

I taught adaptive skiing on Sundays. I ski with an 8-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and it is exhausting, but rewarding. Our days consisted of me chasing after her, singing songs, managing tantrums, and hoisting her up off the snow. I laughed a lot. Despite thinking that I might over-stretch myself at the beginning, this experience was additive to my life. I felt refreshed, motivated, and happy because I had this kind of volunteering in my schedule. I include this not to brag, but to recommend some type of meaningful volunteering or work if you can. If you think you’re too busy to do good things in the world, you’re not. Promise. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationships:**

You know the triangle. Choose one: sleep, get A’s, or have a social life.

Here’s the thing. I’m 25. Sort-of non-traditional, but I’m still in my twenties. I still have friends who like to go out, still go to shows, stay up too late, etc. But, my friends are also adults. None of my friends who are nurses, teachers, or baristas want to go out until midnight on a Thursday anymore. None of my non-student friends are free in the middle of the day to go fuck around or distract me. When I tell my friends I can’t come out because I’m studying, they’re not giving me shit for it. 

I still made a point to set aside time on Saturday’s to spend time with my friends. Typically we would ski, go out for coffee, or make each other breakfast.  

Another factor in this realm is my boyfriend. Boyfriend works 9-5, so my motivation to not do any schoolwork after dinner was intensified in order to hang out with my person. Boyfriend makes me dinner on nights that I have class until 8pm. Boyfriend gets toilet paper at the store because I’m stuck in the library.  Boyfriend wakes me up with coffee telling me he is proud of me. Can you tell that my love language is acts of service?

I’m not telling you to ignore your friends if they’re distracting and get a partner who does stuff for you, but to consider which relationships in your life are additive and which are less so. It’s fine to have fun and make memories; you’re in college. But if you say yes to every single opportunity, you will find yourself out of balance.

My point here with relationships is this: make sure the people who love you know what is going on with you. Let them know that you want to hang out, but you’re reaching for your goals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Work Ethic:**

For me, relying on motivation alone has never helped me. I need to “hack” my environment in order to do what I need to do. 

I woke up at 6:30 every single day, including weekends. On weekdays, I would arrive on campus around 7:45 and either go to class or go to the library. The quiet floor or the law library are clutch. No coffee shops, no cafeteria, no house. If there is any ambient noise or people having conversations around me, I cannot function. I am there to do work and focus. If you’re only half-working, you’re spending twice the amount of time on work. I straight up didn’t have the time to only half-work.

In a typical day, I will sit down at a desk, open up my planner and my laptop, decide which item on my to-do list is the perfect combination of “finishability” and time-urgency.  My phone is on grey-scale and I deleted my social media apps this January and haven't looked back. I listen to 432 Hz white noise music in noise-cancelling earbuds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m very bad at time. My brain does not conceptualize it passing. I wear a watch religiously, and set timers for everything- Otherwise I get sucked into the hyper-focus wormhole. I set a ten minute timer to get set up and decide what to do, otherwise I will agonize about what the “perfect” thing to do is. Then, I set a timer for 30 minutes, and lean into whatever I have decided to do. After this, I take a break, walk around, take my earbuds out, get some water or coffee, but do not turn my phone back on. And repeat. Before I know it, my work is done or it is time to go to class.

&amp;#x200B;

If I don’t have anything to do, but it is still “work” time, I will research grad programs, apply for internships, go to professors office hours, or read about work that people I admire do. This paid off in the end of the semester, as a professor casually mentioned that I would get along well with another professor in a different department. I meet up with Prof #2, she was impressed that I had already read about her work and offered me a paid summer internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Exercise:** 

Exercise is another non-negotiable in my life. I have border-collie level energy. I need to exercise. If I’m feeling overwhelmed, tired, or stuck, a run almost always helps. I lift weights 4 days a week, my routine usually takes about an hour. I either Nordic or downhill ski with my friends on Saturdays, volunteer on Sundays, and have two hours of yoga a week built into my schedule. No exercise = poor sleep = too tired to workout = eat like crap = I can’t focus= I get overwhelmed= whole system falls apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What I did that actually helped me succeed.** 

* Campus library is my “office” from 8-5 every single weekday. 
* Paper planner is your BIBLE.
* Delete social media. Turn off your phone. Really.
* Work in chunks. For my brain, 30 minutes with a timer and then a small break is ideal. 
* Prioritize, prioritize prioritize. You’re going to have to bullshit some assignments and toil over others. Make your efforts count.
* If you don’t think you have any school work to do at any given time, you’re wrong. You can always work ahead. 
* Habits trump motivation every time. Motivation wanes, but if you’re in the groove, you’re way less likely to fall behind. 
* Never. Ever. Ever. Skip. Class. 
* This seems obvious, but do every single assignment and every single extra credit opportunity, no matter how minuscule or annoying. 
* Support system. Tell your friends &amp; family what you’re trying to achieve and let them know how they can *help* you.
* Don’t forget to feed yourself and exercise.
* Set aside intentional time for non-school. Ideally a full day on the weekend. 
* Say no. Say NO. Explain yourself, be kind, but say fucking no. 
* Nobody is productive every single hour of every day. It’s ok. Perfect is truly the enemy of the good. 
* Have an end goal. Visualize walking at graduation. See your GPA climb.
* If you’re a non-traditional age considering going back to school- do it. School is infinitely easier with an adult brain, adult friends, and adult priorities. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, if you fucked up this semester, its ok. It really is. I’ve been there. My sophomore year, I ended the spring semester with one D, two Cs, an F and a W. It doesn’t feel good. Just remember that it doesn’t say anything about your worth as a person. Beating yourself up about it isn't going to help in the long run. You are not forever the person who fucked up, and you can use what you did wrong to learn and grow and change. 

Also, remember that succeeding and trying your best doesn’t have to be miserable. You can still enjoy the things that bring meaning to your life while trying to do something difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I got a 4.0 while being busy. It didn’t suck because I had a perfect storm of mindset, abilities, organization, and circumstance."

My friend and I are both in our second year at college doing a CS degree, both of us had no prior experience with coding, so we had to to learn a lot. I personally did not feel like I was ready for an internship this summer so I did not apply to any and my plan was to focus on a project, study, and work on leetcode/hackerrank. I just found out my friend got accepted to an internship, and I am very happy for him but it's an unpaid internship. So that's what I wanted to get opinions on, are unpaid internships worth it? They're experience and something to put in your resume. My plan was to focus on a good project and aim for a paid internship next summer. Would an internship have looked better on my resume? You won't say if it was paid or unpaid in your resume, so that won't matter, but to you personally, it'd matter if you spent your summer working without pay.

I'd appreciate any and all comments/opinions/advice, thank you."

Graduated a year ago with my BS in IT. Throughout college I decided I didn't want to go the classic IT route so I landed several internships in data analysis and business analysis. From there I worked as a Business Analyst with a company for 2 years. Throughout those 2 years I did very well and made the jump to my dream job at a new company as a Product Manager.



Been here for 4 months and I've come to realize.... 1) I suck at this and 2) I don't like this work. I struggle with leading these projects and on top of that I find the day to day to be extremely boring. I don't really know where to go from here. My projects at my old job where little baby projects but here I'm leading the charge on these much larger scope projects with a lot more heads involved. I'm struggling to be a good leader on them.

bjwm7f,1,2019-05-02,Second Bachelor's/Relocation,kindlekindle55778,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bjwm7f/second_bachelorsrelocation/,"Greetings! 

I've seen this question asked before, but I would love to get any input/advice as it pertains to my own situation. I'm 24, I graduated 3 years ago with a BS in ChemE, and I'm now considering going back to school to school to get a second bachelor's in computer science. 

A classic 18 year old punk, I had zero idea of what I wanted to do when I started college.  I went with chemical engineering for the hopes of a high salary/wide range of job opportunities. I pushed down the thought of actually finding a job while I was in school, and chose to be more invested in my social life/daily activities than actually finding an internship. After graduation, it was a bit of a rude awakening where I ended up having to take a 10$/hour internship for the summer, and then it took me quite a while to find a full time position. All of the chemical engineering jobs listings that I saw didn't really interest me-- a lot of manufacturing/production jobs in the region of the country where I live. I ended up falling into a role as a data analyst with a DoD organization. 

Through my job, I've learned some basics of programming/data wrangling (proficient in python and java). Writing code is the only time when I'm actually fully absorbed in my work-- I absolutely love it and time seems to pass much quicker. Unfortunately, working for the government, I would say \~75% of my time is filled with bureaucratic red tape- going to excessive meetings, documenting things, going to trainings, etc.  I am thankful for my position for exposing me to the tech industry first hand, but I want to go back to school to legitimize myself as a computer scientist and pursue more fast paced work. Additionally, I live in the southeast, but I would like to (hopefully) use this opportunity to turn a new leaf and try living in a different area of the country. 

Can anyone offer advice of what particular programs may be good for a second BS in Comp Sci, with regards to out of state? I graduated the first time with a 3.3 from a state school... A find GPA but not exactly stand out, but I am hoping to get into a good school and really make the most out of my second degree."

I also have a 1510 in my SAT 1 (800 Reading, 710 Mathematics) and perfect scores in the SAT 2 Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics level 2. While I am not really much of an athlete, I have medals in multiple national olympiads (Chemistry 7th, Biology 2nd runner up, Physics 11th) and participated at the national stage in the CS and Mathematics ones too. Now should I take the gap and apply to Oxford or go for McGill? What else do I need to do to have a good shot at getting in? How difficult will getting in be?

Starting pay is lower and firms prefer smu / nus compared to ntu. On the other hand, smu provides students w internships and they prep the students for the workforce. 

One Uni provides me the course that I want, and most prob a job that leads me to finance sector, (but lower chances of being employed and low starting pay). The other Uni provides me w great chances and a job that I’m not interested in.

bjxv68,3,2019-05-02,I could use some advice. Finishing degree from 2011. No Comp Sci experience since then.,NMEofYourEnemy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bjxv68/i_could_use_some_advice_finishing_degree_from/,"I studied comp sci from 2007-2011 at Penn State University, but I failed two general elective courses in my final semester and didn't get my bachelor's degree. I really can't give a satisfactory reason for why I failed the courses or why I have not since finished the degree. Oh well. Mistakes were made. So now my question: how do I pick up after my failure and begin a career?

I've spent my years since college living with and caring for a terminally ill parent who has since passed on. During that time I've picked up quite a few hobbies, but living at home meant I didn't need to get an actual job. I did odd jobs and art commissions for spending cash, but that would not have been enough to live on if I had to pay for rent and food. I've since moved to live with my brother, and I'm struggling to make ends meet. I've only had one proper job in the past 8 or so years, and it was bussing tables. 

I would love to just pick up where I left off with the potential of a real career in computer science, but I've done very little with coding in my years since college. I've done some Unity tutorials and played around with it some, but even that was a couple of years ago. Is it feasible for me to find an entry level job or paid internship in computer science or should I go back to something unrelated like restaurant work while I shake the rust off in my spare time? Are there specific types of jobs that I should search for that would help me to shake off the rust and also develop my resume? I'm particularly interested in terraforming if that would narrow it down at all.

I've contacted the university, and they are allowing me to finish the degree with the 2011 requirements. I am not yet sure if I'll be able to take the courses online over the summer or what, but I intend to complete them and finally get that degree. Should I hold off on applying to comp sci related jobs until I have finished the courses or have at least enrolled in the courses? 

I appreciate your time and any advice you offer."

Hi everyone, I have been having a major issue with my PC for almost a year now. I noticed this happening when I moved my PC across the country for an internship in my car. Anyways, whenever I am playing a game, there is a good chance that the game will freeze/crash. I am then unable to reopen the game as it says it’s running (happens in both steam and epic games launcher). I’ve tried ending the task on task manager but that only makes my task manager “not responsive”. The only solution I have found is a full restart. I’ve attached pictures of what my performances look like while gaming and when it crashes:

[https://imgur.com/gallery/jEy5I4Z](https://imgur.com/gallery/jEy5I4Z) 

I’ve already cleaned my PC multiple times before and this issue has still been happening, so I believe it’s a hardware issue and not a software issue. My temperatures also do not look out of the ordinary while playing/before crashing. I’ve also tested this on different GPUs (1060 and 1080, both EVGA), and nothing changed. I even bluescreened the other day with only Twitch and Amazon open on my monitors. 

As of right now, I think it has something to do with my HDD (no SSD installed yet) as my disk seems to spike along with my GPU. I’m planning on rebuilding my whole rig in a week or so after finals, so any insight on what this is could save me time then/money in the future. Thank you!"

I graduated Cum Laude (3.3 GPA) in May of 2018 with majors in mathematical/computational finance and business analytics from a small business school in Boston.

I never really knew what I wanted to do with my career throughout college, but I knew that I loved highly analytical work with numbers (hence my coursework/major). 

I interned with a renewable energy company (F200) in FL my Junior year where I worked doing Business Intelligence and Analytics for the risk analysts on the trade floor of the company. I didn't directly work in the trade group but I worked in the IT department for the traders. Figured it was a good balance between analytics and finance, which it was. 

After the internship I got sold a leadership dev program in IT at the same company, which I accepted. I was pretty complacent my entire senior year, and never really thought about what I wanted to do with my career, so I stuck with the offer, and didn't really look elsewhere. 

Fast forward 12 months since graduation, and I am finally starting to realize that I really want to get back into finance and that is where my heart/mind lie. I also don't see myself at this company long term, as I do not love the location of the company. Obviously with my degree I shouldn't have an issue transitioning back into an entry level finance role (obv depends on the role/company), but I was wondering how you guys would recommend I start looking for a new job/defining what type of company or role I would like. 

I remember some of the most exciting experiences I had in college (class-wise) were working on portfolio optimization projects, or working on valuation projects, or even grinding to study for an exam on options and futures. All of that work really got me going, and I am curious to knowing what types of roles I could laterally move into with where I am at today (Recent finance grad with 1 year IT experience). 

I absolutely love commercial real estate and think that industry and work is extremely interesting. Curious in if I could get a job at a CRE shop as an analyst, but not sure I am qualified? What do you guys think?

tl;dr:

Recent finance grad with 1 year of IT experience looking to get back into finance. Wondering what options are available to me and what kinds of jobs/roles I am qualified for."

When they called me about this, they said that the entire panel really liked me and could see me working for their company, but that my skills would better fit a different internship they were offering. (I’m an engineering student, and the new position is more technical.) So I’m being “re-considered” for this new position and am going to be talking with HR soon. My new contact person said the panel and other HR personnel had strong recommendations of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Small biz is taught by the head of social sciences (he's real sweet, love him). It's an easy A, but also really useful and genuinely helpful. I intend to get my CPA and eventually start my own firm, so I think it'll be practical for my future. I've talked to the professor before, and he's great - plus, I've heard that he writes amazing recommendation letters for people who do well in his class. This class is offered once every 2-3 years - it's a special topics course. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, Leadership Studies is the first class in the Leadership Minor program, which has an inbuilt internship and college work-study into it, as well as a scholarship for the best students. However, I've been told horror stories about how the professor is neurotic, has a lot of favoritism, and holds the worst grudges for the smallest things. I'm gonna be honest - I'm an abrasive person, I like to control my destiny, and that sometimes lands me in trouble. I could lose all the opportunities offered.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I can't decide whether it's better to join a class where I swallow my pride, network and step up to internships, or to join a class to learn, make a better relationship with my professor, and enjoy myself.

## I'm depressed since at least 1 year, last month I broke up with my gf after 3 and half years my life is going in shambles.

📷

This is a big wall of text but I'd be grateful if you could read it and give me some answers on how to improve my life from now on.

To start off, I'm still studying trying to get my Bachelor degree in statistics, I should have already finished but I still need at least 1 year to finish it, I've been stressed for a long time about this because I don't like this situation I put myself in, my family is paying for my studies and this is a huge part of my struggles. This week I travelled to see B(I Will call B my gf for the whole story) because She wanted to see me and talk about our problems. B Is finishing her master degree and Is doing an internship abroad right now, she's ahead of me in Life and really want to get Independent soon. She said She wanted to work out the issues we had and fix them we were even planning a small vacation for the upcoming easter holidays, but when we spent time together things didn't go well, I discovered she met her ex bf, because the football team She was working with played against the team of his ex but She didn't tell me about it and I felt betrayed because for the First year of our relationship She couldn't get rid of him because he's a sort of Psycho Who stalked her sometimes. Now we already had lots of problems mostly because I want to pursue my dream of becoming a data analyst for professional league of Legends teams and She thinks this is really stupid and it's only a dream that won't come true, but I'm pretty good and already got offers that weren't good enough to drop out of my Bachelor, but still I study statistics and this Is really valuable for teams that look even for people with no knowledge at all of the game, and I've been top 1%(diamond+ for those Who know LoL) of the european server for almost 3 years now doing analysis by myself of gameplay and coaching of single players. B doesn't like this and also doesn't care about me pursuing this she'd rather see me pursue job Security getting to work in a bank or something like that, but I feel like i'm still young and even if it's hard this Is the time to try to follow my Dreams. B basically have a low consideration of me like I'm still a teen that Just wants to play videogames and find a way to keep doing it. I'm kinda Lost we got through a lot of things, 2 years ago She Lost his mother out of nowhere After She had a stroke during night, and I was there for her during her struggles, now that I need her support to pursue my objectives she's downplaying them as stupid ideas basically and I'm kinda depressed for this because this has been going for a long time, sometimes when She raged She told me I was a failure who wasted years of my life playing videogames, but to her part I had my fair share of range telling her She was an egocentric bitch who was never able to give up something for me when I needed (examples: delay holidays because it wasnt a good moment for me to go on holidays and so on). This was my first breakout of my issues and stuff, but now one month has passed since my breakup. We broke up after some months were not going well and we discussed it and eventually decided it was time to move on for both of us, most of the problems came from the fact that for a long period I took care of her in a lot of ways, her mother died when I was seeing her for 1 year and she just wanted to spend time with me talk with me and I realised only recently that I became his family during this years. She was alone being a single child and his dad never being a person that she talked to. This lead to all of my problems being left in the dust for a lot of time and when I eventually got overwhelmed buy my problems she was never there to help me like I wanted to or in a way that really helped me improve my situation. She also ruined my friendship with the girl that was my best friend for 7 years, because she was jealous of her, they lived together and they still live together and she always had this complex against her that she couldn't be for me what my bf was for me, she was manipulative many times and in the end my friend eventually gave up and decided she didn't want to deal with our relationship problems. All in all I gave up a lot of stuff for her and since I am a nice person in general who always try to help others out I slowly renounced to a lot of stuff, I started gaming less, I almost stopped watching football on weekends(because weekend are to hang out you know? Why do you always want to watch your team games), and despite me not watching my team games I always kept hearing every time I really wanted to watch something stuff like ""we are always watching football why should we do it again"". Basically I was in the most toxic relationship possible and the worst part of this is that I wanted to break up with her before her mother died but eventually we didn't because that happened and as warm hearted as I am I couldn't leave her alone, she had an affair with her ex months before her mom had a stroke but I was taking my time to think about it, but now after we were having a break I discovered that she was texting him again so basically for our whole relationship she probably hid this from me and despite me finding clear proofs(ie finding messages with her friends talking about messaging his ex again).

I even talked with his ex after discovering everything, and he told me he tried to explain me how she was 3 years ago but I didn't wanna listen to him because I thought he was crazy, that's because she always painted him as a problematic stalker but the truth is that she's the problematic one, who in the end likes having him around and never wanted to get rid of him, she basically lied to me, to her friends and even to his family, just this last 4 months she went around telling his friends we broke up at the beginning of January, told his dad that I could have travelled with him because he never took a flight to go visit her in Sweden, she asked me to come back home with me for 4 days when I had like personal family stuff to do at the end of february despite she shouldn't be involved in that and I infact refused to, and in the end in March she gifted me the tickets to visit her in Sweden to fix our issues because I was mad at her for how she was handling our relationship the last months, and all of this happened while she was for sure seeing her ex and texting him every day since she was even telling her best friend about it, little did I know that we break up without me knowing.

In the end I just feel like a complete retard who wasted years of his life with a complete asshole who made me insecure made me drop some important people, ruined my relationship with my friends in general because she created an ecosystem where most of the time I was giving up all my free time to stay with her. I just feel so empty, angry and depressed and I just think world sucks, I lost serenity and I feel anxious about a lot of stuff I feel like I'm a really big fucking idiot who will be treated like shit no matter what I do. I have no idea how to get out of this sadness hole I'm stuck into I don't even wanna hang out with my friends tonight because I just wanna cry in my room. I should be already graduated but other than my fault, the fact that I took care of her issues for so long and continuous fighting about her jealousy or me not doing enough for years drained me like nothing else ever did. The only good thing in my life is that my sister is pregnant so I will be an uncle soon but other than that I can't see myself sorting things out in the short term some days I just go to sleep thinking I don't even wanna wake up, but then I think that if I die that would just be another failure in my life making everyone sad one more time. In the end I'm just stuck being 24 having not finished my bachelor when almost 5 years have passed since I started it, and someday I just feel worthless and I just hope everything will end soon for me, sometimes you just read about people getting hit by a train or people getting in random accidents, well some days I just wake up hoping that will happen to me too just so I can get rid of all this shitty problem.

TL;DR Basically got manipulated by my cheating gf for more than 3 years, just discovered everything after the breakup, I'm also almost 5 years into my bachelor and feeling shit cause I can't reach my goals in a reasonable time."

bjzyik,1,2019-05-02,From Physics to CS: Should I drop prestigious physics research position for summer and prep for tech?,phystocs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bjzyik/from_physics_to_cs_should_i_drop_prestigious/,"Hey everyone! So I am a freshman physics major at a top 5 school, and I've decided that I no longer want to go into physics. I made the switch to CS about two weeks ago. In my spare time, I have been taking an intro course and a course on data structures and algorithms on coursera. 

I got an offer to do particle physics research at one of the Department of Energy national labs this summer, and while I was previously ecstatic to do it, I am not sure if it makes sense to continue with the internship. I really want to focus my time on building a good foundation in CS, developing 2-3 quality projects for my portfolio, and practicing for the coding interview this summer to prepare for tech recruiting this fall. That will be quite difficult when the majority of my time is spent doing research. I am quite concerned that spending that much time on research will just leave me uncompetitive for tech this upcoming recruiting cycle for summer 2020. I also just don't care for doing physics anymore.

The research will involve data analysis with Python, which is good experience, but it definitely won't give me close to the amount of experience I can do with myself. Last summer, I also had a research position which involved data analysis in python, so I already have a data analysis background and am not sure another summer of doing that will do me any good.

I could put some time into trying to find a tech internship this summer, either in software or data science, through alum connections at smaller places in my hometown. There are still a bunch of positions open on my school's career site and google jobs, glassdoor, etc. But it is quite late for summer 2019 internships, so not sure if this would be a waste of time. 

(1) If I could manage to swing a tech internship this summer, should I drop my summer gig?

(2) If I don't manage to find a tech internship this summer (more likely), would I be better off doing the physics research internship or just developing my portfolio and deepening my portfolio on my own? The research position sounds ""impressive"", so maybe just having it to make me look smart is a good idea. 

Thanks everyone!"

By hole I mean there are a lot of personal reasons related to mental health, finances, family, and other things that are dependent on me landing a job hopefully soon after graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

About me; I'm a senior undergrad who is anticipating to graduate in December with a degree in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. My GPA is around 3.45, no internships; did one STEM research thing for 2 weeks dealing with MATLAB and patient data. I don't have relative work experience in the field; but I have been managers at retail stores and restaurants. I have no major projects on my belt; but I do have some interesting ones I did in school that I'd like to add on and clean up. A full blackjack card game with betting options and saves to databases in C#, 3 C++ projects related to machine learning and large computation with data sets, a multi threaded small project in C, some standard SQL tables and queries, and a working small working PC from scratch on Logisim.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan for the summer is to first refactor and clean up my projects. I have grown a quite a bit since I did a few of them, and know I made stupid design decisions on some of them. Then I will learn GitHub and push (or commit; not sure) them to be displayed for anyone interested. Next, I will submit my resume online to get feedback 2-3 times after changes are made so it can be the best it can be. Once I have those two completed; I can then begin my networking and learning phase.

&amp;#x200B;

I had bought the cracking the coding interview book; and I'll be studying practice problems so problem solving any puzzle can become quick and easy to me. My goal is over the summer; I will attempt to get 50-75 problems in. In addition to practicing for interviews; I'm going to created a LinkedIn profile and network a bit. Also I have a meet up app that lets me meet up with groups of people for anything (hiking, dance, wine, food, and coding). I know there are several meet ups every 2-3 weeks for .NET, Java, and others with developers. I'll also be hitting up my professors and counselor to see if maybe they can hook me up with something. As July goes by; I'll begin my insane job hunt online through my semester until I get an offer. I appreciate you taking the time to read my post and posing any suggestions, advice, or comments you have!"

But today while I was playing quizlet live I got an email from the program head that said “Due to a problem in the importation of contacts in to the email address email book you mistakenly got an email that wasn’t intended for you” and then later today I got an email that rejected me from the cdc disease camp... and at that moment my funk returned. 

Through April all I ever did was send a bunch of emails to doctors offices and departments at colleges in hopes of landing an internship having to due with infections diseases and public health, but all that’s ever happened to me is failure after failure after failure. I see my friends have secured all the internships they applied for and then there’s me... the loser. Compared to my peers I’m just so different. I don’t have a car, I’m ugly, and I don’t have many resources in general (I’m low income). The only thing I really have a pull on is my academics and I feel so inferior when it comes to that. 

I remember thinking this was going to be my year bc the school district offered to cover all the expenses for AP exams for low income kids and I was so so so grateful because I wouldn’t be able to take my exams without it, but unfortunately in my life the highs always have to be followed by a disastrous low often back to back and i can’t help to feel like a loser. 

I’ve gotten no accolades like my friends and I’m basically invisible in my classrooms. I would try to answer questions, but I always get ignored because the kid with a 97 is answering at the same time and he gets priority. 

I remember applying for the volunteen programs last year and getting rejected but I didn’t give up and applied again this year！ But, I was rejected in the worse way possible... it feels like I’m not destined for great things tbh. I feel like I’ve been selling myself false hope and motivation. I feel like I probably won’t get into GT or UGA and that I need to lower my standards because every time I try to not give up and keep pushing I meet a brick wall. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

bk1eaz,2,2019-05-02,[HELP] University of Houston or Muhlenberg College,SultanOilMoney,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bk1eaz/help_university_of_houston_or_muhlenberg_college/,"So today I got off the waitlist for Muhlenberg College. Now I am torn between the two colleges. 

I am wanting to major in Mechanical Engineering.

The thing is, Muhlenberg College does NOT have a mechanical engineering major. Instead, they have a physical science major and a 3 + 2 program with Columbia University. A 3 + 2 program allows me to gain a degree from Muhlenberg (in Physical science) and Columbia University (Mechanical Engineering). The thing is, there is NO longer guaranteed admissions. So if I go, there is no guarantee I can get into Columbia and major in Mechanical engineering. 

The University of Houston on the other hand - I am guaranteed admission into Mechanical Engineering. While it is a commuter school, I feel like I will be more STEM oriented in my studies, and I will have MUCH more opportunities in terms of research and internships. However, I’ll be missing out on the “college experience” and the opportunity to attend Columbia University. Also, University of Houston is looked down upon (though I heard they are respectable in engineering and job opportunities are decent?)

So I am town between these two colleges. Should I take the gamble and go with Muhlenberg and possible enter Columbia university, or do I go to the University of Houston? 

I should also note that my time at Muhlenberg will be 4-5 years whereas at the University of Houston, it’ll be 3 years (go to a dual credit HS). 

Other things, Houston is a big city and Allentown (Muhlenberg’s location) isn’t. I have dietary restrictions, etc. Though I figure I can make do if I attend Muhlenberg.

I can program, but I'm not confident enough to put it on my resume as a skill. I don't know what makes you a ""programmer"". I write Powershell and python scripts to make my job easier and sometimes help my coworkers.

For example, one department uses this stupid machine that is never detected by Windows unless you enable and disable the device. So I wrote a powershell script that automates this, and wrapped it into a exe. So now they just double click the exe and the machine works, and they don't have to keep putting in tickets.

I'm too busy to track what I'm doing, so I wrote a python program that detects when I've been away from my desk for more than 5 minutes, starts a timer, and when I move the mouse again, it asks what I was doing for the x amount of time I was gone. Whatever I typed and the counter time are automatically exported to my weekly report so I don't track my time spent at work"

thanks for taking the time to look at this. I'm hoping for some career and resume advice and you guys are amazing with that. I'll keep this concise. My anonymized resume is at the bottom. Me:

* 31yo, born and raised in Germany
* 18 - 21: German Army
* 22 - 25: Undergrad in Germany (Political Science and Law - focus on data analysis and corporate law)
* 26 - 27: Move to Canada, MBA at Canada non-target (University of Windsor)
* 28 - Present: Working B2B sales, mostly for a digital marketing agency (current job).

In my current job I talk to business owners or marketing directors of medium to large businesses (e.g. healthcare, financial services, law), explain with lots of data how they can benefit from digital marketing with my agency, negotiate the contract and close the deal. Basic B2B sales.

**Why do I want to get into finance?**

* I feel underchallenged and stuck at my current job. I'd like having a rewarding, long term white collar career path. An analytical job where I use my intellect and am challenged to problem solve.
* I enjoy data analysis and have done lots with STATA and R in my undergrad and during an internship back then. I know some SQL.  
I also enjoy legal, regulation, compliance type stuff since I studied law and like it.  
Also negotiation, anything involving soft skils.
* I already have the MBA, and loved everything about finance when I did it. I just ended up in digital marketing through random circumstances and stayed because I enjoyed it at first.
* I have an interest in money as a social / political / philosophical concept. I enjoy the science about it. I love data, financial modeling, excel, IT, coding, economics, etc.

**What I'm looking for**

* I'd like max 50 hours / week regularly (sometimes is fine). I'd enjoy something like 8am-6pm most days.  
When I was in my early 20s and in the army I worked 100 hour weeks in the mud. That was fun! But these days I want 3-4 hours a day for the gym, yoga and meditation. I want to take 30 minutes at least for breakfast and dinner. I also want 8 hours of sleep every night. And to have a social life. Obviously I won't end up in M&amp;A, IB, ER and the like. I'd rather not anyway. Probably corporate finance? FP&amp;A sounds nice.
* A career path that allows me to work from home a couple days a week or more would be great, in 5-10 years
* I don't need much money. If I hit $60k - 80k / year in 5 years that's cool with me. When/if I ever hit six figures I'll be one happy camper.

**My questions**

1. What are go-to job opportunities for me to make the switch? I'm aware of  
\- Financial Analyst  
\- Business Analyst  
\- Sales  
\- Investment Advisor assistant  
\- Any others?
2. What are career paths long term?  
\- Going into Corporate finance? What are my options here? FP&amp;A?  
\- What are my options at the intersection of financial / legal? E.g. financial regulation, compliance?  
\- Any others?
3. Where am I going to be most sought after with my MBA / B2B negotiation experience?
4. How useful do you find this map

I'm a senior in high school and will be attending undergrad at Eastern Michigan University next year. I am trying to decide whether to major in computer science or a degree they have called Information Assurance &amp; Cyber Defense. 

I enjoy programming and have thought about software development, but I also think that network security is an extremely interesting field with great prospects.

If I understand correctly, the consensus is to get a computer science degree first and move into NetSec. With that being said, I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the Information Assurance program or graduates of the program?

Here is the program curriculum.

Also, what should I do to maximize my chances at internships? Should I work on the Network and Security + exams on my own, or should I focus on personal programming projects and get a fleshed out GitHub portfolio?

As a preface, let's call them job A and B.  I'm in computer engineering.

Job A is with a company I interned for in 2017.  Relatively nice place, close to my school, and pays very very well (~24 USD/hr).  The work challenges me a bit like any job would, but it's not something beyond my skill level.  However, it's a relatively boring workplace.  Everyone is a boomer and I get a strong feeling that chances for upward growth there are very small.  That being said I don't mind working there again as an intern.  They asked me to come back last year, but I declined since I had found a new job in a foreign country.  

The problem has to do with this country since I've fallen in love with it.  The people are great, the work culture there is something I like, made tons of friends there last year (was there for 7 months).  In my time there I worked for a great company, very nice to me, covered food and travel, brought me all around the country for business trips and just generally fun work environment.  With this company I met tons of people professionally as well, so my network there is surprisingly bigger than mine in the U.S.  Through this company I met the president of a small company offering Job B, and he's a very nice guy and we got along well.  2018 company is not offering work again this year though.

The problem being that co-operative work in that country isn't much of a concept like in the U.S., so pay is less than half of Job A if even that.  Moreover, I hadn't heard from Job B on whether or not they could take me after almost a month, so I asked Job A if they'd take me in again this year.  Of course, as luck would have it, they both emailed me on the same day saying they'd take me.

I'm really having difficulty deciding which one to go with, and I've been agonizing over it for days (time is running out too).

**Job A**

+Pays well

+Close to school, so I can find cheaper one year lease housing for myself from now to May 2020 and get out of temporary crappy school housing with nasty roommates who I can't pick

+Know what the work is like there, and it's not a problem at all

-Future seems dim for post-grad opportunities with this company

-Very very boring town, would likely not do much after work/on weekends

-saying no after just asking for a job makes me look really bad

**Job B**

+Nice boss, likely many paid for business trips/company dinners

+Extremely fun country, tons to do, last year was time of my life

=Unknown work environment (different company from what I worked at last year, but affiliated closely with last year's company, 
would meet often)

-Expensive country, low pay for interns, will need to take out loan (plane cost, low pay, likely spending more on fun stuff)

-Finding place to live back in U.S. from September-May not as easy/cheap if not randomly assigned by my school

Any advice as to even how to look at this would be appreciated"
bk33bj,1,2019-05-02,I was sent to collections without being sent a bill or receiving a phone call.,aquahorse_,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bk33bj/i_was_sent_to_collections_without_being_sent_a/,"This is a little confusing so bare with me. I have a great credit score and am on the verge of tears trying to fight this. We are trying to build a home right now and are afraid this is going to nip our butts. We have always paid our bills on time. 

At the beginning of 2018 my husband and I were living in Denver on a tax internship. We rented the apartment from a family friend while she was traveling. It was time for me to get an ultrasound on my thyroid while I was there so I researched a place that my insurance was contracted with and went in. We moved back to Utah afterwards. 

I knew I would have to pay something eventually but I was waiting for the bill to be forwarded to my address. I figured it was just taking insurance a while to process everything. A year and three months later that family friend we rented from texted me and asked what my address was because I received a bill. I told her but never received the bill. I decided to go ahead and call them to get an update on how much I owed after a few days of not getting it. 

Well, turns out they had already sent me to collections even though that was the only bill I had ever received! No phone calls, no mail, no nothing.  Apparently they messed up my insurance and swapped secondary and primary so that's why it took a while. They then said insurance didn't pay anything because it was out of network. I call my insurance company and they tell me that's not true and that my portion was $124 compared to them trying to make me pay $311. 

The imaging center won't work with me because they 1. They already sent me to collections and 2. They can't resend claims after a year. (I work with insurance on a daily basis at the dental office I work at so I know how it is. There are ways to submit it after a year and have the insurance pay). 

I'm waiting on the EOB from my insurance company. In the mean time I am panicking because I was sent to this collections agency. It's been a few days and I haven't received anything from insurance. Collections won't do anything until them. I'm stressing out. They shouldn't have sent me to collections without trying to get in contact with me. I know I could have made this situation a lot better but is there anything else I can do? Am I just screwed?

Let me know if you need anything clarified."

I graduate in a month and then I’m off to CSU Humboldt. I plan on majoring in international studies with a Chinese concentration and possibly minoring in biology. I’m thinking of getting into the medical field, a forensic pathologist. My problem is that lately I have been feeling a lot of pressure to become really successful for my mom and dad. I know success does not automatically equal to being rich but money is definitely something I worry about. My oldest sister is a travel nurse and makes a decent amount of money. Maybe 2 months ago she received money from a car crash she was in a while ago and promised to give my mom some money to help us out, especially since my mom and dad take care of my niece and nephew along with my brother, another sister, and I. My sister who I will call A texted our oldest sister, B, talking about how she doesn’t act like a big sister and how she never helps out or checks in on her younger siblings or her parents but is always ready to ask our parents for money when she spends it all on things that aren’t necessities such as bills and stuff. B texted my mom about it and told her that she hopes I go to a college very far away and get away from the family because they only want money. This is not true at all. My mother only asks when she really needs help. Only my father works and my mom stays home to take care of us. It takes a lot for her to ask for help, let alone money. So now I just feel the need to get a really good job and make a lot of money so my parents won’t ever have to worry about not being about to pay bills or get something for my little brother and niece and nephew. I know people say don’t get into medical field for money but I think I am pretty interested in it. I plan on trying to find internships and shadow different doctors to see what I like and whether I only like the idea of it from like tv and such. I just want to make my parents happy and live a comfortable life. My mom and dad really miss the house they had in Texas but we had to move because of my second oldest sister but that’s a different story. She also plays a part in why I want to continue my education and find a good job. I just don’t want to let my parents down but I feel like I am putting too much stress on myself. I worry it will burn me out before I even get to college :/"

I have no idea why, but when I was applying for colleges earlier I only applied to UMBC, UVA, and VT. I got into all 3 but UVA and VT are soooo expensive and I don't really want to go to UMBC. So I pretty much plan on going to AACC and then transferring. The thing is, I want to major in Computer Science which is an LEP. Additionally, there's two gateway courses that have no equivalencies with AACC and the advisor recommended me to take both CMSC 131 and 132 in the summer after my college freshman year. I wanted to transfer after one year but I guess that only means I would have to transfer into Letters and Sciences and spend sophomore year doing those gateway courses. Has anyone ever transferred into an LEP after 2 years of CC? How has it been? I'm just worried that I'll miss out on internships, experiences, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* Intern at a new company
   * **PROS**
   * I will get paid ($11-16/hour)
   * I will be working in the STEM field
   * I will be able to fine tune my programming/design skills
   * I will be able to work with kids, which I enjoy
   * **CONS**
   * The internship is at a camp and I'll be teaching kids.
      * As much as I enjoy working with kids, I won't really be getting any real industry experience
* Intern at a company which I interned at in high school
   * **PROS**
   * Get real-world industry experience
   * Loved the company culture when I last interned there
   * Close to home (train station is a five minute drive away and train stops by the office)
   * I *might* get paid (will discuss this more in the cons section and below)
   * I will for sure get some money for transportation (like $100/week)
   * I could ask to be given bigger and more daunting tasks since I've taken a year of classes at college now
   * **CONS**
   * I already interned there before
   * Not sure if having the same company on my resume twice would add any value, even if I do bigger and better stuff this time
   * I am 19 so I can technically get paid legally now, but not sure if they'd be willing to do it

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of other notes -

* Getting paid vs pursuing an unpaid internship isn't a huge deal for me right now. I am currently financially dependent on my parents. They both have jobs with comfortable salaries (especially my dad), so I really have no need for extra cash right now. Once I graduate college, I will definitely look for a good job with a reasonable salary.
* There are two companies whom I have interviewed with and they said they would get back to me with my final result soon. A third company has invited me for an interview, but hasn't responded to the Google form they had me fill out. My summer break starts next week and I don't want to waste half my summer waiting for a response from these companies which is why I am evaluating those two options. If I hear back from any of these three companies during the first week of summer break, I will take their offer. Otherwise, I'm going to go with the two options I mentioned above

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks"
bk49g0,13,2019-05-03,ME - Worthless Intern?,super_mech,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/bk49g0/me_worthless_intern/,"I am in a bit of a dilemma, and would like to reach out to the community of experience and see what you guys think. I will try to keep it brief. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started an internship on Apr 1 through a co-op program at my school. I am currently an ME Junior.  I received the initial call from my mentor at the Aerospace Metals Manufacturing Facility in mid-March. Although I would be relocating about 1.5 hours from my home at my expense(mortgage + rent), I was excited at the opportunity. I have about 11 years experience as an aviation mechanic, so I felt this was right in my lane. 

&amp;#x200B;

After no further communication from the company, I called my mentor about 10 days before I was set to begin. He informed me that his job had changed, and I was being reassigned to a different ME.  Day 2 (after orientation) I hang out in the Engineering department for a few hours, then new mentor tells me he has another intern, and two new employees and will be too busy for me. Passes me to 'Jerry' the manager of west operations. He becomes my immediate supervisor. He has never had an intern, unfamiliar with the co-op program, or what an Engineer really does (although I am also somewhat unfamiliar, as this is my first venture into the real world)

&amp;#x200B;

Jerry is busy, so he passes me off to the floor supervisor.  Floor supervisor manages the workers, and so he has me work the floor with the guys to learn the process. I do not mind this at all (maintenance background). About a week passes by, and then I get passed to the Recovery Analyst (as now I am familiar with the process, although in reality I have a faint grasp).  The Recovery Analyst job is to fix paperwork on parts that have been messed up along the process, and continue them on their way (over 60 steps per part). He is a wizard on the process, and tells me that it takes about 6-12 months to train a guy to do anything on their own. So I help with whatever I can, but me trying to help (or learn something) involves impeding his work (1:5). I have been doing inventory on these lost parts and teaching myself (youtube) how to set up databases and logs for the last few weeks in order to produce something worthwhile. I can do some Matlab, but SQL is totally unfamiliar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Week 2 Friday co-op rep of company notices what I have been up to. Brings me to his office, informs me that he is disappointed on the outcome, and that I have somehow been lost in their system. He will try to get me reassigned to an actual ME by talking to Jerry's boss the Chief of Operations. I find out after a few days that COO will not release me, he thinks I can be of tremendous value to their problems. Eventually I was given a paper with some project goals COO had in mind. Heavy emphasis on Industrial Eng. type of stuff. Very vague items like ""improve efficiency, reduce lost parts, reduce man hours in this department..."" I ask my supervisor Jerry what any of it actually means and how I might implement it, and he says he didn't write it and is unfamiliar with the exact details. Jerry remains uninvolved and busy afterwards. I continue with inventory and making up work for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sit tight until the 4th week Friday, and I reach out to my original mentor. I explain all of my situation in greater detail. I thought things might change and get better over time, however I feel like if I say nothing, this will just continue for the six months I am here. Nothing learned, no engineering experience, twiddling my thumbs and making up odd jobs for myself. My impression is that the COO thinks I will somehow come up with something fantastic and save them a lot of money... and if I don't, well I was just an intern after all, no losses there. COO might benefit something, I will get nothing.

 

My original mentor understands the situation, and advises that I escalate the situation outside of the company (co-op headquarters). He believes that nothing will move if I don't squeak. I am apprehensive of escalating the situation beyond my control, and alienating people. Another idea that crosses my mind is that COO has no idea what I am actually up to, believes I am flourishing (Jerry reports to him, and reports must look good), and if I were to escalate things, this might blindside COO. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am at a loss of what to do. Original Mentor has not gotten back to me yet (about a week), I have nobody to reach out to, I am unfamiliar with the engineering world, and I do not know how to maneuver in this situation. Do I complain, shake the tree, and see what falls out? Do I accept my fate and make the best of it? Do I escalate manners beyond my control and alienate people, and possibly ruin the companies relationship with the Co-op program? I feel trapped but the idea of doing nothing at all also worries me, I do not want any regrets later. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the long post, and I truly appreciate any advice."

My mom and I’s already sinking relationship would get worse and I feel like I should at least try it out before dropping. I don’t think I’m ready to grow up and do this. But this is a field that I’m very passionate about after a very long internship in undergrad. Any advice?

Forgive me, this is long. 

I (almost 23, F) start my 2 yr masters program in less than a month and I don’t even know if I really want to go. If I am gonna go to grad school for anything, THIS would be the field I’d choose. But now I’m not sure if I want to go.

I was originally put on an alternate list for one of the schools I applied to and was doubtful a seat would actually become available. So, I cried for a few days and then started making other plans for the next year or so. I was excited to start these plans and thought about reapplying for school again in the fall. Last month I got an email about a seat becoming available.

I read the email as I was leaving work and I honestly was just shocked. I had no idea what to think or how to process it and I wasn’t excited at all. I literally drove in silence on my way home when normally I have the windows down and music blaring.

I live at home and I didn’t tell anyone for almost a day. When I did tell my brother, he told me that if I were going to go to back to school, now is the time to do it. The school is fairly close to home, I’m accepted now, and I’m still pretty fresh out of my BS program. He is a big believer in not giving your money to colleges and you can make a career out of networking and blah blah blah. Except you can’t really make a career in the medical field without a degree.

I’m also currently going through a rough patch with my mom. When I told my parents the news another day later and explained my hesitation with it, she said “You are going to school!!” about 5 times to me. Because we are on bad terms, I can’t really talk to her about any of this nor do I feel any support from her when I tell her the LIST of things I’ve accomplished EACH DAY in preparing for school.

I already signed a lease with 2 roommates, bought my books, paid for my background check/drug test, and am almost to the stage of actually signing up for my classes.

I was really excited to start working on my new plans that included traveling, but that won’t help me move away from home (which I desperately need to because of my mom and I’s sinking relationship). With school, I’ll at least be out of the house and away from this shitty town.

I feel like I’m not ready to grow up and tackle this program when the only thing on my mind is, “How much can I work to pay my bills and save money for traveling/festivals to do in between semesters AND keep my grades up??” Literally everyone I know in the program (a couple of professors included) advise against working at all during this time.

I feel like I should at least give it a shot and if I really hate it, then I can drop out. “It’s only 2 years” I keep reminding myself. But I’m really worried I am about to spend a lot of money and put myself in more debt just to end up hating it. I also know that dropping out before even starting will make mine and my mom’s relationship even worse. I know I should do things for me, but like.... who doesn’t want to make their mom happy...? I’m torn.

Can anyone offer support in either direction? Thank you"

Maybe with some context so I don’t sound like a spoilt brat: I used to be the top 30% of my school through 16. Then, things got weird and I went into a bad school and was in a bad class. I had hopes of applying to an American University (I’m from Asia), but only got into a very safe safety school that I didn’t want. So I stuck local, did it for a year, applied for a transfer and got into an Ivy League University.

I thought life would look up from there. On the surface, it was - I was a straight A student, a president for my club and I even did my internship at a prestigious consulting firm. BUT, the truth was that I was struggling the whole time.

While my Friends seemed to be getting investment banking offers and consulting firm offers, I only got two interviews - one that finished recruiting before I was done interviewing and the other that didn’t pass me to the second. I kept persevering, applying, interviewing, and kept broadening my search. I had decided to move to Los Angeles after graduation because my Boyfriend and Brother would be there. Even though I worked hard to network, send out emails, write cover letters, I graduated with no offers on the table.

I spent my summer doing the same thing. Waking up in the morning, applying to jobs, interviewing when I could. I had a handful of firms interested to interview me, but as I was in Asia, they decided not to proceed until I returned. (I did reach out upon returning, but slots were either gone, or they weren’t interested anymore)

I move to LA in August and did the recruitment dance all over again. When I failed to get interviews, I decided to start working at a juice store at the mall across my home. I spent my time there networking with customers, getting emails, reaching out for referrals and getting interviews. My top two leads were an interview with a major investment bank and an interview with a media agency. I chose the latter because I didn’t want to do 90 hour work weeks, and felt like media would be more exciting.

I kept following up, but only had an interview in February this year. I did the interview, didn’t like anything about the job, but accepted the offer because it was the only one I had. I had negotiated for a month before starting, and almost managed to get two jobs before starting but I didn’t. The first just started ghosting me (Private Equity firm) and the second interviewed me three times. On the final day for the company, I did well in all the interviews, only to be rejected because I didn’t have a “polished presence.” 

The day of my final round, I left with an email inviting me to interview with a TOP MBB firm. So, I started my job with the media agency a few days later, with the decision to get an income while applying for other things. Unfortunately, I was staffed on the busiest and most disorganised team, because everyone had just joined the company and were new to the team and company. In the three weeks before my MBB interview, I prepped for cases during my lunch break and came home to more casing. I did my interview, only to be told I had a strong foundation but lacked practice. This was fair because I was working till late every day and had little time to prep (I did 35 cases in 3 weeks, on TOP of learning consulting concepts and other related things.)

With nothing in the pipelines, I tried to do my job. But I hated it. I had come in with an open mind, but with the realisation that my job not only wasn’t what I wanted, but would also disadvantage me from getting the jobs I wanted, I was disillusioned. Just to substantiate this, the HR of MBB said that I could reapply in a year but didnt think media planning would be a strong background to come from, and the skills I learned on this job was so specific to the role that I didn’t believe it to be transferable. I was even told by people in the company that people stay in the industry and move from agency to agency, which made me panic because those who left became insurance agents. If I had wanted to be an Insurance Agent, I would have started a Long time ago.

All of a sudden, I had an interview with a TOP 10 consulting firm. I wanted it so badly, but my boss wouldn’t let me take leave for the following week. So during a company dinner, I hinted to her quietly (and drunk) that I was unsure if this industry was for me. More specifically, I told her I didn’t understand the work but believed there would be a 3 month learning curve that I could get over. The next day, she fired me. I felt happy because I didn’t have the job anymore, had 2 weeks paid, and could do my interview.

I did my interview, solved both cases but didn’t click as well as I would’ve liked with my interviewers. But I definitely thought I did well enough to get to the final round. Wrong. I got rejected a couple hours ago. So I’m lost once again, and I need your advice.

I can’t even begin to share how exhausting this journey has been for me. I’ve been consistently recruiting, looking for jobs, writing cover letters, doing interviews and getting rejections since I was a Sophomore in college (4 years!!!) and to no avail.  I’m exhausted. Exhausted. Really just tired of this whole thing all together, so I value all advice.

To make matters worse, nobody understands. I talk to my classmates with their dank ass jobs and they just tell me to be patient because something good will come. I talk to my friends and family back home and they just insist that with my Pedigree degree and 3.9 GPA, id definitely get something. So I can’t even get proper advice.

In addition, I may sound like a hermit with no social skills, but that’s never been the case. I’m always the center of attention, have always been into public speaking, and usually nail the interview. I’m starting to think that I suck and that everyone hates me, and that this is all there will be. 


1. What am I doing wrong?
2. What jobs should I be looking at (Poli Sci graduate) 
3. Should I just give up and move home?
4. Any advice at all


TLDR: My life sucks, help me make it suck less.

Feel free to ask clarifying questions."

bk5s4f,3,2019-05-03,Which is more important early in your career - growth or salary?,No0bDev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bk5s4f/which_is_more_important_early_in_your_career/,"Hi all,

Just wanted to see what everyone's opinions are on this topic. 

**TLDR:** What is more important early in your career - growth or salary?

&amp;#x200B;

To give you some background, I am a 23 year old living in the Bay Area and have a little over 1 year of experience. My first job out of college was definitely nowhere near my dream job, but it was a stepping stone. I went through all 4 years of  college without ever landing an internship (not that I didn't try at all, but I probably could have tried even harder).  Half a year after graduation, I landed my first job. It was a contractor position at a large bank. I was told it was a Java Developer position, but after starting the job, it ended up being a SDET position. I was pretty disappointed after finding that out, but I figured I should stick it out since I have zero experience at all and at least I would still being doing some kind of development, even though the code I wrote didn't reach a large amount of users since the only people that were utilizing my software were the QA teams and occasionally the Product team. I was getting paid about $75k without any benefits. 

Fast forward 15 months later, I have accepted an offer as a Software Engineer II at a private mid-size tech company in the Bay Area. My last day at the bank was yesterday, and I start the new job in a little over a week. This time around, I made sure to ask more questions during the interview process, and made sure that this role matched my career goals. Because I am still very early on in my career and value growth/learning very much at this point in my life, I asked: ""What is this company's culture around career growth?"" This lead to a very fruitful conversation and his answer blew me away. We talked about this for almost 10 straight minutes and he said something along the lines of ""I would love to keep all our employees around and see them grow within the company, but if not, my goal is to be able to have them leverage the work they do here so they can get to where they want to be, even if that's at another company... We aren't fixed on assigning you on a specific project, instead we would like you to work on projects you care about and are passionate about, even if that requires proposing a new initiative."" It really sealed the deal in terms of finding a workplace that I wanted to be in, especially since my previous position did not care about my growth at all (although they did ask if I was interested in converting to full-time instead of contract, probably only because the technical lead left). It got me really excited about the position. A few days later, the company called and said they would like to make an offer. They asked me what I was looking to make, so I said ""I'm hoping to make at least the market rate for similar positions in the area."" The recruiter then asked me if I could give a specific number. I wanted to make at least $120k, so I asked for $125k. He said he would talk to the hiring manager and get back to me the next day. Next day comes around, recruiter calls, and said they would like to offer $120k base, $5k signing bonus, and 10k units of stock options. I accepted the offer right there on the call, maybe because I was already excited for the position, but I understand that in terms of negotiating, I did horribly, mostly because I did not negotiate at all. Although I am very happy and excited about starting this new job, here is my dilemma.

Obviously, if anyone has spent any amount of time on Reddit or Blind, he/she would know that my offer probably was not the best, although not the worst. The average I saw on Glassdoor for Software Engineers at this company was about $116k. However, I've been told that the averages on Glassdoor aren't completely accurate and you should estimate that the real average is about 20% more. Don't know how true that is, but I kind of believe it since Glassdoor may contain data from years ago. That would mean my base salary is below average. In addition to that, I already know the signing bonus is pretty low compared to other places. I guess another factor that played a role in me accepting the offer so quickly was that I wasn't even expecting a signing bonus, so I was happy to hear that when the recruiter told me. I never realized until researching afterwards that signing bonuses are pretty much standard nowadays and the signing bonuses are usually a lot higher. 

Despite all of this, surprisingly, I feel content and most importantly, happy. After learning more about the company during the interview process and especially after the conversation on growth with the engineering manager, I have a really great feeling about working here. Yes, I probably could have negotiated better or gotten a better offer elsewhere if I kept looking, but I think I'm just really excited to be working on some of the things they told me about and most importantly, growing as a software engineer. Also very happy that this is a Dev role instead of a SDET role which I was kind of tricked into previously at last job (I guess it was partially my fault too for not asking enough questions). Lastly, very happy with the modern office environment as you would expect in any Bay Area tech company. Definitely a step up from the grey depressing cubicle-filled office at my previous job. 

My apologies for the essay, didn't expect it to be that long... but to wrap up, should I be more concerned about the compensation? Or is my mentality exactly where it should be? Clearly it would be better to have to best of both worlds - great pay and growth-focused company - but if you were early in your career like me, which would you choose?"

How possible is it?",tozangezan,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/bk5tt4/applying_for_cs_phd_algorithm_data_structure_aco/,"I am currently thinking about applying for PhD in CS, but I don't know how feasible it is especially as I am not a CS student.

* Seeking for funded PhD positions in US and Canada which focuses on algorithms and data structure
* Preferred schools: GA Tech ACO, CMU ACO, Indiana CS, UBC CS.
* Programming contest awards such as: IOI silver medal, ACM-ICPC World Finals silver medal, Distributed Code Jam finalist (twice), Facebook Hacker Cup finalist, (and red coder in all the major contest websites)
* Worked as an International and Host Scientific Committee member in IOI a few times
* Worked as an intern at Indeed Tokyo and Google Tokyo
* Submitted a paper about graph algorithms to arXiv and a journal, now waiting for the feedback

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, some schools describe that applicants need to have a degree in computer science or related field, which I don't have. However, I strongly believe that my experience in algorithms and data structures are far more than average CS students have. I also would like to apply for lower-ranked schools which are focusing well on the algorithm researches.

How is it possible for me to get in such PhD programs? What do I have to work on seriously? (Writing more about my competition activities in SoP? Recommendation letter from CS professors?) Is the feasibility different in Europe?

I can't afford to pursue MS in the States but can in cheaper universities in Canada. Maybe I will apply for them as well. Honestly, I don't believe those MS courses give me a lot about the subject, but that can at least make me easier to get a job and to immigrate."

First of all, I guess, comes the story time. In 2 month I’ll be finishing my bachelors at one of the best universities in Moscow and even Russia probably. I’ve studied trade, which is realistically all sorts of subjects: from microeconomics, accounting and management to asset valuation, building financial models and logistics. For the past year I’ve been thinking about my future and what does it hold for me and I’ve come to the conclusion that I want to work in a financial field. As I had part time positions as a marketer, I realized that’s not a rout of mine. 

Last semester we were given a chance to enter any internship we were able to find. I landed on an intern position at a financial department of a big German IT firm. I realized that it was absolutely the right decision as I loved every second of it. After the internship had ended, I asked to stay in the company, so nowadays I do 40 hours at work/40 hours studying. 

So the big question is: what do I do next? I read this subreddit a lot and plan on doing so for many years, I realized how many people, who were open for a talk, are here.  The big plan of mine was: go for masters to Germany (as it is free there and I don’t want to take money from my parents anymore), apply for any degree just to get the student visa, and finally find a position in VC, as I’ve heard it is mostly Berlin in Europe who plays a role of a VC hub (not talking about London, as I potentially can’t go there). I’ve always wanted to be a VC analyst because from my point of view, you get to face so many random businesses, which prepares you for your future life (maybe you want to build a firm later in life). 

Therefore, there are a couple of questions:
- does anyone have kind of a map with career options (kind of like a skill tree with different job positions, don’t know how to name it better), as I don’t want to limit myself to VC only, and plan on doing the most money I possibly can, as well as realize what I really want to do. 
- Do I apply for an MBA or a master of finance? I’ve seen a similar question here, people were mentioning that MSc is worthless and you should choose an MBA, but I feel that it’s not my option, as there are no top tier universities with MBAs, and people were suggesting top 10 US universities for that. 
- Last but not least - what is the best option for this kind of situation to get to the states? Because I feel that no way there is even a half of what you can make in Europe comparing to the US

Quick desc:
Languages: Russian as a native, English with an Ielts band 8, German B1-B2. 
Relevant work experience: 6 months as an intern in a financial department in a big German IT company. 
Moderate ms office skills.

This is a message for everyone that is struggling and thinking maybe you can't cut it as an engineer.

In 9 days, I'm graduating with my BSMET, and in 17 days, I'm starting my new job as a manufacturing and quality engineer for a company that makes MRI machine components and radiation shielding. 

According to some people's logic,  I shouldn't have been able to do this. 

I've got a 2.89 GPA, not completely terrible but below that magic 3.0 you hear everyone talk about. I'm also graduating with my BSMET, an engineering technology degree. I've been told I would never get an engineering job because of that extra word at the end of my major.

However, here I am. So, how'd I do it?

The beginning of my third year of school I switched from BSME to BSMET. I hated all the theory, it seemed useless for what I wanted to do. I was on the verge of academic probation. I had a 2.5 GPA and the previous semester I failed dynamics and had a 2.007 GPA that semester. Anything less than a 2.0 and you get put on academic probation for one semester, and if it happens again, you get kicked out. I knew I needed to make a change, and so I switched major's to MET. The debate about BSME vs. BSMET can get long and heated and it really isn't what I want to talk about. So I'll just say that MET works very well for some people, and for others it may not get them what they want. 

Anyway, so now it's spring semester junior year. I have a 2.65 GPA, and the career fair is coming up and I know I needed a summer internship. How was I going to get one? My GPA sucked, I had no prior experience, and I was in what some people consider to be an inferior program. Well, a few weeks before the fair a friend of mine asked me to model him a case for his raspberry pi computer. So I looked up a drawing online, designed a simple case around it, and printed it on the schools 3D printer. It was a neat little thing, but it was something any freshman engineering student should have been able to do. 

So, with about 50 copies of my resume and my little 3D printed case in hand, I went out to the career fair and I talked to every single person that would talk to me. I gave out so many copies of my resume I had to go to the library and print more. 

And after all that, I got three interviews. And from those three interviews, I got one internship offer. 

Problem was, it was for a company that tested concrete for construction. Completely unrelated to my major. The hours were irregular, and the pay was low.  I didn't care. It was something, finally, a starting point. 

Long story short I hated that job but it gave me what I needed. Experience doing anything remotely engineering related. With that, and my newly acquired AASMET, I went out and found myself a new job, a full time draftsman job. I restructured my classes so I could take them at night and finish my BSMET while working full time. And my God let me tell you what a living hell that was. A full two semesters, four classes each semester. But I did it.

So how'd I get the fancy new engineering job?

Well, this was actually the easiest part. I got a cold call from the company I'm going to work for. Said he found my resume online. Asked me if I was interested. After a few interviews and a tour of the facility, I got the job. Didn't even have to apply for it until after they made the offer. (Paperwork and what not)

I hope this post finds someone who needs it. Feel free to PM me any questions."

The title is straight forward.

The context is, i am finishing high school diploma in a professional course, Europe, Portugal.

I am currently an intern on a big company and the team wants me to work here asap.

The issue is that ill have my course completed only in around 8 months, ill be back on school after this internship. Also, one of the other issues is that i legally cannot work while being on a state funded course (complete bullshit, i have to give up my education to work a parttime, or i can live with 150€ while my family doesnt sustain me, currently i am being sustained by that number and my girlfriend)

Now, the real question... I was thinking off a 450-650 wage range for parttime (full time minimum wage monthly in portugal is around 550).

Is it too low? Too high? I have no experience on it, however, the company needs exactly my profile and it os quite on demand.

I dont have any education, but i have currently all the required hard and soft skills (team feedback). I learned programming and overall software development by myself for almost 7 years.

Being on demand didnt look like i should receive too close to the minimum parttime wage (20-25 H/week, around 300€) .

I currently work as a Resident Assistant (RA)  at my university, this job has helped me tremendously with paying for school. I only pay 1k a year for housing and get a 7.8k stipend. I'm a computer science major (junior) and had been looking for an internship all year, but failed to find one that was really related to CS (I found some for IT). Anyways, I found out that in order to graduate in 4 years I have to take a few summer classes so I'm not loaded with coursework over the fall and spring. I'm taking 3 classes all that go on at the same time but one ends earlier. I was worried because I didn't have a place to stay to take these classes until I was blessed with the summer RA position (which is a different application within the regular RA application/renewal). I met up and basically got hired by a web developer who's hired through the school and hires students to work with him. The thing is even though the RA job is extremely flexible I am unable to work more than 5 hours on campus with the RA job. Meaning I would have to leave the offer and stay an RA (which includes duty nights, desk shifts once a week) OR leave the summer RA job and work for the ITS department and gain real experience for my field. The dude said that they find employees on campus housing (for free or discounted cant remember). I rarely take risks, and i'm afraid I might end up homeless if I quit my RA job. Can I do 3 classes and 20 hours a week at this new job, that also will pay more? Or should I just say no and stick to the original play, have no work experience, and no job when I graduate (employers love experience)?!!?!!?! Thank you!"

So I am a mechanic engineering major and an aerospace minor. My goal for my junior year was to obviously get an internship. It has been absolute he'll trying to get an internship. My gpa is not great at only a 3.15, I had a really rough first semester in college where I got 3 Cs. I've only had one since. I haven't failed any classes and am on track to graduate in the 4 years next year in May. I've got a lot of personal experience with engineering hobbies, 3d printers, some rspberry pi stuff and I've been a car guy for years. I'm currently building the engine in my project car, forging the internals and stroking it out. 

I started early, I was offered a co-op a few states away but I had to decline because I didn't think I could afford to take it and also wanted to graduate in 4 years. This was last October so I thought I had plenty of time.

I met a high level engineer in a large defense company who offered to help me get an internship. I was stoked. I love the company and everything that they do. We continued to talk for a couple months where in the first of January I got my resume in a list to be considered for a position. I was told I'd hear back by the end of January. The engineer I had met told me he thought I had a very high chance of being interviewed and offered a position. At the end of January I sent a follow up email with the HR person we had been going through and got no response. Come mid February he decided we should just talk directly with the hiring manager. He had me send him my resume directly and he forwarded it to the hiring manager. He told me the manager was impressed with how much of a tinkerer I was and I'd be getting a call by the end of the week to talk about the position further. The week passed, the next week passed and I got nothing. I spoke with the engineer again and he mentioned how busy the aerospace industry was right now and that I might be getting something later. 

By this point the spring career fair had passed and I spent the whole time with my eggs in one basket. I know, my fault there. I proceeded to apply for anything in pretty much a 1000 mile radius of me. My school sends out emails with offers and I proceeded to apply to all of them. I made it through a couple interviews but eventually was denied. Most of the time I didn't even hear anything back. I have one place that said they were waiting to hear back on a bid on a project but if they got it they would hire me but I haven't heard back. I have emailed them once a week for the last 3 weeks. There's an undergraduate research position I am applying to that's due on Monday so we'll see what happens there. One professor told me he might need help with his research this summer and that he would keep me in mind. I don't know what will happen with that if anything. 

At this point however I took my last final yesterday and my semester is officially over. I can't help but just feel really bummed. I made a couple dumb decisions but I feel that I have put a lot of work into this just to come up empty handed. I can't help but feel almost cheated by being strung along for so many months by the defense company but I know that I should have still been applying to stuff in the mean time.

I guess I am just looking for advice, especially if anyone has been in the same spot. Often the importance of a 3rd year internship is expressed to be so vital and now its looking like I'm not going to have that. I don't want to have to spend a year trying to find a job when I graduate and I want a job in something that atleast slightly interests me or that doesn't feel like an immediate hindrance to my career. I want to find one quickly so I can get out of debt. 

I plan to at this point to continue with my car and try to find other potential projects to work on to strengthen my resume but I feel like most companies just look at the gpa and look for an internship and then move on gracing over anything else. I've thought of going back and retaking a couple first semester classes as I know I would ace them at this point but not sure how much that would help. What should I do at this point? Any help is greatly appreciated by anyone. Thanks"

I am a recent graduate (BS in computer engineering). I currently work as a software engineer and do not enjoy the work. I took the first job offer I got and ran with it (because it was a long and stressful search). I have been working here for a few months and am looking to leave because I dread doing software development work (my internships in school were in this area) and am not learning any new technologies that would help in a career in software engineering. I also enjoy low level programming and circuit design so I am interested in having a career in hardware engineering, firmware, or embedded programming because it’s something I find interesting and can see myself doing as a career (IC design also seems interesting but I need more education for that and plan on getting a masters in the near future). The faster I get out of software engineering the better so I am looking for a job in the two fields I mentioned while I have a job now.

The problem is most of the jobs I see online are mid level/senior positions. It is as if entry level positions do not exist except for at defense contractors, or those positions are not posted online and are tied to a university big companies recruit at. I find this incredibly unfair (but such is life). I am a dual citizen and do not want to renouce citizenship or give up my other country’s passport for a defense contractor position.

How can I find companies hiring entry level positions and how can I contact people who are looking to hire junior engineers? I give up using online job sites because for me they have been a black hole. I do side projects and have my code posted on github but I feel as if recruiters do not consider this as anything and trash my resume or too many people apply to the few entry level positions online and my resume is not seen. What is the best way to find hiring managers or engineers who are hiring for junior roles (outside using online job sites)? Thanks."

I went through their grad interview process but due to my previous work experience (I was a chef for a while and I actually had some software internships unlike the other candidates) they thought I would be a better fit for a junior dev role (not sure if its seen as lower in this company most of their devs have come up through being grads but they're a financial company so dunno). 

Anyway, they use c# and .net. things I've never touched and never had in my cv, I might have made an off hand remark that I had touched it once in a minor class in my first year of uni but this would have been a very passing remark.

The role I got given was a role they were about to recruit for and I've seen the proposed job advertisement and it lists c# and .net has being essential skills to have. I've mentioned to my tech lead that I'm going to be going on pluralsight before I start to get some experience but he replied back saying I could if I wanted to or wait till I start because I get it for free. 

My main worry is that there has been a miss communication and someone thinks I'm maybe more experience than i am? My internships were only for a few months so I can hardly claim any experience. Am I fucked or am I just over thiking it?"

I didn't take an algorithms course either, which I may try to compensate for in an online course after I finish school.

At the end of august, I finished my summer internship in a foreign country and had to take a couple of planes and a train to come home. The whole trip should already have taken a good 23 hours but thanks to me being a hormone-driven moron, it actually lasted a bit more.
Bear with me because the full story is quite long.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

The story really begins at the end of my first 11 hours long flight. Pretty boring flight altogether except for the part that we were almost 40 minutes late… When I had originally 1 hour to catch the connection. The staff of the airport was waiting for me when I landed, and I flashed through this gigantic airport, barely making it to the second plane seconds before they closed the gates. I’m usually a quiet person however I tend to overthink everything at the airports, so the whole thing kind of put a good amount of stress on me. Fortunately, I still had a good 6 hours flight to my next connection, so I was gonna rest and arrive relaxed at the next airport, ready to catch my train, right? Wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

In the second plane, as I was sitting, I realized that I was placed next to this cute Asian girl, approximately my age. I first wondered if I should try to start the conversation but decided not to, as I was already tired, I would probably never see her again and I wanted to stay focused on arriving to my destination without trouble (should’ve keep doing that). So, we just exchanged some looks, smiled to each other and I put headphones to listen to music and try to get some rest.
&amp;nbsp;

I, of course, struggled to get some sleep in this tiny-ass seat even though I was tired. I had barely managed to get an hour and half of sleep when I was awakened by the flight attendant bringing me breakfast (it was very early in the morning, maybe 4 am). As I was eating, miss Asian cutie started talking to me. I was pleasantly surprised that she would take the first step when I had decided not to, so as the hormones-driven moron that I am, I wholeheartedly threw myself into the conversation and flirted a little. 

&amp;nbsp;

When we landed, I had almost 2 hours before my train and she had a bit more before her friend arrives to pick her up. So, I offered to take a cup of coffee in the airport together. She seemed pleased and agreed. But first we had to retrieve our luggage. First problem: as there was a lot of people in this plane, we had to wait almost 50 minutes for our luggage to arrive. 
&amp;nbsp;

At this point, we went to look for a coffee shop to take our cup of coffee. This was my first real fuck up in the long list that would follow: I should have told her that I had to go and catch my train while I still had enough time to do it calmly (the airport was pretty big and with my heavy-ass, half broken-open luggage, I needed almost 40 minutes to cross it).
&amp;nbsp;

We eventually found a decent, quiet spot and proceeded to do the whole improvised date thing. The date went great, we talked a lot, I made a few jokes that made her laugh, and I learned that me and her would go to study not more than 3 hours from each other next year. Great, isn’t it?
&amp;nbsp;
That’s where the second fuck up enters: I didn’t keep an eye on my watch and when I quickly checked it, I found out we had been talking for half an hour. My stress level exploded accordingly, and I left in hurry (third FU, I didn’t even go for the kiss, how lame) realizing I had not more than 40 minutes to cross the airport and catch my train. 

&amp;nbsp;

From an external point of view, the next 20 minutes must have looked like a cartoon character slaloming between people and poles with my half-opened luggage (that was only kept shut thanks to a strap) that was half my weight and bumping into as much people as it could. I swear you could have heard sabre dance in the background. 
&amp;nbsp;

I finally arrived at the train station 15ish minutes before the train departure, but I still had to retrieve my train ticket (that I wasn't able to print online before) … And there was at least 4 or 5 people already at each automatic dispenser. I waited a little, looking at each second passing by anxiously shaking. I managed to pass a couple of persons by pleading my cause and I arrived at the machine… Which couldn’t find my file with the file number I had been provided. As I would realize later, I had just done a new FU: in the haste of the moment I had given the machine the wrong file number.
At this point, I messaged my parents for help and we agreed that the best solution would be to just enter the train and try to explain the situation to the ticket inspector later on.

&amp;nbsp;

Once in the train, as I didn’t have any tickets, I didn’t have a dedicated place either, so I took a random empty seat, of which there was many, and finally sat down. I thought that, now that I was in the correct train (even though “illegally”) I could finally try to relax a little bit while waiting for the inspector. So, I put on my headphones and some music again. Yeah, no: new FU.
&amp;nbsp;

At approximately the middle of the trip, the inspector entered my car and I explained to him what had happened with all the evidences I had. He seemed to believe me but couldn’t find my file on his machine. So, he offered me to buy a new ticket. I accepted, and he handed me his payment terminal.
Well great, except my credit card had been stolen 2 months prior in the foreign country I was, and I hadn’t been able to replace it. So now, as I was unable to pay on the moment, I had to pay a fine which was more than twice the original price. I messaged my parents who (understandably) weren’t happy but told me to just go with it and see at the arrival train station if I could be refunded.
&amp;nbsp;

I, once again, thought that it was the end of my problems and I was just to relax for the last hour and half of my trip home. Of course, *it wasn’t*. 
&amp;nbsp;

Indeed, just minutes after, I heard the announcement of the train’s last stop… which wasn’t what it should’ve been (my hometown). In panic and at the verge of actually crying I went to the nearest train staff to learn that, if I had taken the correct train, I was into the half of the train that was deviating from its main route (to my hometown). In my stressful state earlier at the train station, and as I had no dedicated seat, I had entered the first car of the platform without considering the possibility that the train could split in the middle of the trip to go to two different directions. And with my headphones on, I didn’t hear any information of this separation which would have allowed me to change car before it was too late. 

&amp;nbsp;

I ended up 1h30 away from my hometown and my parents had to drive to come and pick me up.
Needless to say, I spent the rest of Sunday in my bed to catch up with my sleep. And no, the fine wasn’t refundable.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: found a cute chick in my plane, had a date with her at the airport after landing which lasted longer than it should have resulting in me having to run to catch my train and in the haste making mistakes resulting in a 200$ fine and forcing my parents to drive 3 hours to pick me up."

They always say I seem like a really good candidate and then rush the rest of the process, often giving me multiple phone screenings the same day and onsite interviews the next day. The problem I'm having though is I don't know a lot of CS yet. I can code projects and all that by looking up documentations and make some complex things, but I am still a Freshman so I don't know most of the formal terminology.

&amp;#x200B;

When I go to the on site they always ask me questions and I tell them the answer to the best of my abilities and they know that I am not good with the formal concepts that are normally known as I tell them that in the phone interviews. Yet they still say that I am a great candidate only to have me come to an onsite and waste an hour of my time since they only ask those questions. Is there any place where I can learn these concepts? Like stuff about interfaces, abstract classes, multi threading? I don't go over those things at my college until closer to senior year which is frustrating as I feel like its not knowing those concepts that is not letting me land the internships."
bkdhqu,1,2019-05-03,Advice for College Grad,CBNSimba,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bkdhqu/advice_for_college_grad/,"Hey all,

Was wondering if I could get some advice on this. I’m currently 23 and graduated with a B.S. in Information Technology from a respectable university. When I was 16 I was working at Geek Squad, generally doing malware removal, software/hardware installs, etc. ~18 I was lucky enough to score an internship at a small company doing Digital Marketing. Did work with content management, a little HTML, and some app development using a SaaS company. Luckily, since it was a small company the CIO knew me and wanted to keep me on part time, but in a End User Support role. So I was managing tickets using ServiceNOW, doing computer set ups, imaging laptops, and trouble shooting day to day issues on the client side etc. Fast forward to after graduation and I am now working at a medium sized company doing a little bit of everything. Application support, handling OS migration for the enterprise, a little switch management, deploying software through SCCM. What I’m basically asking for is where to go from here? I know I don’t want to be in the helpdesk/desktop side forever. 

I thought I was interested in networking. But after digging into the materials for CCNA/CCENT I’m not sure I want to make a career out of that. (I understand I may need these anyway for a fundamental knowledge of networking)

If it helps, I (think) I’m interested in virtualization technologies, setting up servers, etc. but I’m not really sure where to start? I took programming courses in college and I already knew that wasn’t my thing. 

Sadly I’m in a situation where I’m in six figure debt because of college. I’m looking to go down a route that pays well because of this. Currently in the PA area making 62k out of college. Because of my debt I can’t really afford a pay cut. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated."
bkdn32,59,2019-05-03,"The Life of a Student at a Large, Competitive High School...and it's getting worse",[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bkdn32/the_life_of_a_student_at_a_large_competitive_high/,"Note: With cheating and nepotism being universal, I wanted to shed some light on the intensity of such practices at particularly *large, competitive* high schools, as mentioned in ""The Dark Truth of Going to a School Like Bronx Science"" post.

First, imagine going to a school where your friends are at the top 5% of the state—**and with other 500+ students like this too.** You're surrounded by the most brilliant minds in your geographic area and constantly reminded by this fact. You wonder how in the world you'll stand out and be a fraction as good as the numerous 3+ times AIME qualifiers and other prodigies, kids who, unlike you, started grinding in middle school.

(Well-known examples: magnet schools (Bronx Science, Stuy, etc.) or schools in very competitive areas (Silicon Valley schools like Palo Alto, Monta Vista, Harker))

&amp;#x200B;

But...it shouldn't be that hard to grind extracurriculars while maintaining grades on the side, right?

&amp;#x200B;

If you go to a wonderful school in NY, your grade for each class is relayed to colleges to **two decimal places**. Instead of places where you can clutch that phat A with a 90.0%, here every point matters. What good is your 96.31% when the top 10% all have 98+%? Let all those petty points you lost continue to haunt your nightmares, when you do sleep that is.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at schools like these in Texas. With only the top 6% guaranteed a spot at UTs, **if you're not in this top 6% or merely average you might not even be able to go to the flagship state school.** Ditto for schools in other large states with great universities (ahem, California).

&amp;#x200B;

No matter the grading scale, getting the best grades does not come with much sweat and tears. Or perhaps, cheating (and adderall). Some classes are notoriously difficult, with attaining As to be a mark of a warrior, requiring intense studying and understanding of *every single problem in the textbook*. Other classes are universal to every high school. When every student is gunning for a T20 and dedicated to doing well academically, teachers simply make standardized classes such as AP Bio harder through unmanageable loads of homework and weekly 10 page papers/lab reports. To top it all, your classmates are toxic and backstabbing.

Shopping for teachers can mean the difference between hell and heaven. When such students are faced with counselors stringently against to frivolously switching teachers, students may mooch off a friend's counselor, seek higher into admin, or even use their influential daddy to get their preferential schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this post isn't to teach you how to cheat or teacher shop, but I hope this makes it more clear the lengths students go to get what they want and what will help them.

&amp;#x200B;

A specific difference of magnet schools is that the students are bused from all around the area, creating much socioeconomic diversity. For rich students, parents can easily hand over thousands for their child to start a *non-profit* (or masquerade one of their own small businesses/accomplishments as their child's) or send them to a volunteering trip in rural China. These same parents can also easily secure prestigious internships that **students from all over the country vie for.**

&amp;#x200B;

Nepotism is also pervasive in school clubs. Students suck up to upperclassmen to give them leadership positions after they leave for college. Significant others piggyback off of each other by granting each other positions. *If you're not well-liked or known, it will be hard to get leadership.*

*After four years of constant grinding, you'll start wondering whether it was ever worth it and whether you are worthless.* My school may not be as competitive as many others out there, but students at my school have constantly joked that everyone here is secretly depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

I fear for the future students of my school. Many current friends of mine got into T20s, but preparing for college was not a conversational topic until well into junior year. On the other hand, the incoming freshmen have asked how to get an internship this summer, pick the best college counselor, or start a club.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me end with some related points on TJHSST. We all know this school and how well they do with college placement. But with a large class size of almost 500, **the truth is most students still end up at UVA and only the tippity-top students who have gone to Olympiad camp (MOP, USACO, USABO, etc.) or are ISEF finalist may have a chance at HYPSM.** I'll [end](https://nikhilsardana.github.io/guide.pdf) with a publicly available guide written last year aimed at helping incoming TJHSST freshmen plan for getting into college, which gives a deeper insight into the mindset of students at large, competitive schools."

I was wondering - **are there some things (like Udacity nanodegrees) which are paid, which could make me stand out to potential employers?** I really want to be as qualified as possible for the role of machine learning engineer.

Here is what I am focusing on (in random order):

* college
* having code on my GitHub
* doing summer internships

Is there anything else you'd like to add which are paid, but could really make me stand out, or am I better off reading books, doing exercises and publishing the solutions on my GitHub in my free time.

Thank you in advance!"

Went to community college (2013-2015), then transferred to  a 4 year university (2015-Present). I have no previous work experience and for the most part my parents (willingly) are supporting me (rent, food, gas, parent plus loans, etc.). I feel extremely guilty that I'm still in school at this age and my parents are still supporting me. I know that people go through life at different speeds, but seeing my friends graduating and being independent just makes me feel shameful.

&amp;#x200B;

With summer right around the corner, finding an internship in my field is probably out of the question. Instead, I was planning on looking for part-time work just to have some form of work experience under my belt. After graduating (summer 2021), I plan on finding an internship that will hopefully turn into a full-time opportunity. I plan on paying for most, if not all, of my loans that were used for my schooling. I really do not want my parents to be paying back those parent plus loans especially with the amount of interest that accrued while I am in school. ***Note: Loans have only been taken out for the years: 2015-2016, 2018-2019 school years.***

&amp;#x200B;

I am not certain what I should be doing since I'm a first generation college student. Any advice is appreciated."

And finally got the available time to go back to school. I was told about My computer career by a fellow student. She sung their praises. I checked them out. Have no idea why my red flags didn’t go off immediately. They rush you to sign up, they take your pell grant money, apply for Federal loans, and a personal loan. So yea about 22k off tops. 
The classes are dumb to be honest. The instructors as they say have been in the IT field for 20+ years. And the mentors who are former students that graduated are usually not very knowledgeable. The classes are taught super fast. One class can have like 70 slides. And the teacher moves so fast. It frustrated me because I have no IT background? So how am I expected to learn the info for 9 certifications and can barely grasp the info. 
I truly feel the teachers are lying about their experience. I think they have phony students in class that put on that they passed this cert and that cert. 
they offer no type of internships as a local community college does. So how could I get a job with no experience and workplace experience in the field. 
Yikes! I probably can’t get my money back, but after like 5 months of attending I finally see what logical folks are saying.  
Anyone know if I can at least get my pell grant money from them?"

I got my current job just two months ago and tbh, I'm not getting any decent work(just doing secretarial work) and I'm looking to switch.

I’m currently in maybe my 6th year of study for Computer Science, although I haven’t always been in school for those 6 years (to take time off for internships etc.) 

I haven’t been the best student and I haven’t had the best marks (lots of As and Bs but also a lot of Fs).

But I haven’t been able to focus being a student either due to living with my parents - I know a lot of people in their twenties complain about living with their parents and I feel like a lot of people scoff when I say I don’t have a good home life, but I missed plenty of exams and assignments due to the police coming to our house to stop the arguments and I end up either failing or dropping courses cause I always end up being behind. 

I decided it was time for me to move out if I ever wanted to finish school but I couldn’t find a full time dev job so I managed to find a full time sales job to cover the bills and help pay for school (I’ve been paying all my tuition).

Fast forward 1 year - the position itself has made me very depressed (I was working with only cancelled accounts) so I started to look for dev work again.

I’m actually very happy cause I had two interviews, one being a contract and another for a full time position!

First I got an offer from the contract position which pays very decent, however I don’t really get vacation days or holidays.

Secondly I got a conditional offer from the full time offering which I was really hoping for - however they just backed out of their offer last minute after speaking with some of my references (although I don’t 100% know if it was the references that made them withdraw their offer) and that just really hit me hard. I had a friend who works on the team that I was supposed to join and the hiring team told him that they really liked me and was excited. So I don’t know what went wrong.

Both offers know I’m trying to pay off my tuition debt to my school so that I can return and finish school while working but now I’m scared with the contract position that: 

 1. I won’t be able to keep up with the workload and get terminated

2. That I won’t have time to finish school - which all of this was for that goal

But I also feel like no one else will hire me without a degree and I can’t afford one unless I work full time. It just feels like an endless loop and I’m just very anxious and could use some direction. 

I guess my questions are

1. Am I right to have those fears? Am I overthinking?

2. If I get terminated what should I do??

3. Anyone else have similar experience? How did you handle it?

Any advice would be a good one! Thanks!"
bketob,7,2019-05-03,How to convince HR Assistant to stay?,CoolThrowaway93663,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/bketob/how_to_convince_hr_assistant_to_stay/,"TLDR: I am 80% sure my HR Assistant will leave, I want to know suggestions if there are any that could make her want to stay. Most likely she will get a raise in July, but it would also most likely raise her salary to be about 1k higher than other entry level HR assistant in our area. Is there anything that we could do out of something monetary? If it needed to be monetary how much would be something that sub reasonable, but also make someone stay that I could suggest to upper management?

&amp;#x200B;

Background: 

I am a HR director of a small company in the city (NYC), we have a few offices, in different states but they are all each under 30 employees and each are different departments. I do not want to be too obvious for security reasons, but it is in finance. I hired my HR assistant as support for me, she works in the main office with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew I would be going out on maternity leave but knew that she would be able to fill for me, as well as for the additional work we would receive, such as new hires. She would be the sole person in our HR department for the full term of my leave.

&amp;#x200B;

She studied HR and had about a year of HR experience but it was through an internship. Our initial offer was about 5k less than the average in our city. She accepted however. I really like her a lot, she is personable but doesn’t prod. She comes across as very competent, and works very hard. Personality wise, she is very mature, and sometimes I forget her age, she comes across very well. I knew she could fill in for my role as well as do her own work, and had no worries personally, upon my last day.

&amp;#x200B;

The Problem:

While the role was posted at a more reasonable timeframe, six months prior to my departure, we only hired her three months before my departure. She again is very competent and demonstrated her skills very well within those three months, I knew she wouldn’t need any additional assistance. She really did just need confidence in her skills. She did suggest having a temp in he period I was out, as she was nervous about handling Open Enrollment in December by herself, as her experience was just in recruitment primarily, but I felt that it was the best way to learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone tells me how great she did as well. So I don’t think Open Enrollment was much of an issue for her, and this is what she expressed the most anxiety over to me before I left.

&amp;#x200B;

But, there was a change in upper management, and a lot of restructuring because of it. To be honest based on what I have heard, I am a little nervous to go back, as I too would be dealing with a new upper management executive that would be on my level. There is many initiatives made by the new management, and primarily it all is now falling on my assistant. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also additionally upon my return found out later random jobs are being given to her as there are resignations. I admit this isn’t great, and I was surprised she didn’t complain to me about it when I did speak to her on the phone. But she, even before always seemed a little closed off, and would only share with me when prodded. Usually it’s, an “I can handle it” or “it’s not really a big deal”.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought as well there would be more communication while I was out, but she only contacts me when something happens that she had never seen before and needs feedback. 

&amp;#x200B;

We had what I thought was a pretty good relationship prior to my leave. Although we did only talk when working together. I thought things would be fine when I came back, more like a homecoming. Now that I’ve returned she seems very distant and checked out. She does her own work and goes home. She’s made friends, and has become very well liked by the staff since I have left, which is good, although I am a little nervous about that as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone has told me that she has done a great job, and stepped up to the plate. Every month she takes one or two days off a month, from looking at the records, which isn’t obvious, but she didn’t take time off when she started and I had to prod her to use the time she had earned so she wouldn’t lose it at the end of the year. She seems sort of stressed out all the time, and I just feel like she will leave us soon. I really don’t want that to happen, as she’s really the perfect HR assistant. I would, if there was another position title at our company, suggest her for a promotion but that is not possible here.

&amp;#x200B;

When she started, she had mentioned if she didn’t get this job she was considering grad school. I am thinking that is most likely what she will do, or leave us for another company. We are in a area with a lot of corporate offices, and as I had said earlier she is getting paid a lot less than those with the same title who have done less than she has, although she’s still early in her career for years of experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Possible solutions:

We have our evaluations and raise considerations in June, and end of the year bonuses. I think that’s the only place that we could show “appreciation” monetarily to her. I do not think that she would be considered for a raise that would  be anything more than 1k over the market value for an assistant in our area. 

She has not indicated anything directly to me, except for at the start of her job when she said she was considering grad school. She has started to deflect when I suggest she move into the City, which again makes me a bit nervous, prior she said she would consider it after a year, which is only a month away. She lives relatively far from the City. 

There is no position for her to get a promotion, if she did get a promotion it would only be in name. 

&amp;#x200B;

If there is anything that you can think of that would convince her to stay? I would appreciate it!"

As my time with you comes to an end, there comes time to reflect on my journey with you.  When I came to your campus in middle school while my older sister was here, I instantly fell in love and knew I wanted to come here for college.  Fast-forward four years later, you welcomed me with open arms into your family.  Little did I know, however, how much I would treasure my time with you.  My journey here may not have been the smoothest with group projects, tough midterms, and late nights aplenty, but I am all the better for it.  You have helped turn a naive 18-year-old kid into a battle-tested problem solver ready for whatever the world throws at him.  You've also given me more than just an invaluable education.

You gave me resources to further my career and professional education through co-ops and internships

You gave me outlets to explore my interests in cybersecurity through elective classwork and extracurricular activity.

But most of all, you gave me an outlet to keep my passion for music and sports alive: the Georgia Tech School of Music.

When I first got to campus and auditioned for my first college concert ensemble, I assumed it would be just like high school: learn some new pieces, perform with some really talented musicians, and have a time to keep my mind clear of the worries of academics.  What I did not realize, however, was the strength of the School of Music community.  What started out as a simple membership in the Symphonic Band quickly became a gateway to something greater.  Through Symphonic Band, I met so many talented musicians and some of the coolest people on campus.  They successfully convinced me to join the Yellow Jacket Marching Band, which let me meet even more amazing people and forge new memories that I will cherish for a lifetime.  As a result, these experiences strengthened my love for you to the point where I am not ready to leave.    

Unfortunately, that time fast approaches.  So as I prepare to enter my final semester with you, I cherish every moment I have spent here.  From grinding out the last few lines of code for a programming project or the last few paragraphs of a written assignment, to cheering on the Yellow Jackets to some of their greatest victories, and everything in between, it has truly been an experience to behold.  Here's to more memories in one last push for glory before graduation as I prepare to close one chapter of my life and open another.

O Scion of the Southland, in my heart you shall forever fly.

Sincerely:
An ever-grateful son of Tech."

And I agreed with him on it all. Also my dad just got cancer, so it really had my mind not on working.

When we talked in a private meeting about letting me go he told me he would consider helping me out getting another job when I got to that point in my life. Well that point is now. I need 3 professional references and I only have 2 right now. I know I wasn’t the greatest employee, but I was never a bad person or did anything illegal to get let go. I contacted him today and asked if he was still willing to be a professional reference and he said congratulations and yes. 

My resume only has 2 internships and I already got the job. Should I list this person as a reference to show that I have references from both jobs? He was never a spiteful person, was a good man. I couldn’t see him tarnishing my name, but it still is worrisome... what do you guys think?"

I've applied to 70-80+ internships since January (maybe it's not enough, but I looked for a lot related to my major and ones that were local because I have to stay in the state) and have gotten 40 or so rejections (the others had in their rules that if they didn't accept you, you wouldn't get an email about it anyway). I received a few callbacks that led to nothing (they would say ""I'll call you back"" and then wouldn't, even when I reached out later). I went to both career/internship fairs at my college and never heard anything back from the people I talked and passed resumes to there.

We have discussed partnering up and opening a second store on many occasions but the timing hasn’t been right. I’m currently on my 2nd year of school to get my degree in business marketing and management. I was planning to finish my associates and take a break from school until I save enough money. 

I have been relying on being in a business with him for so long that I don’t have a plan B if that doesn’t work out. Honestly there has been some slight disagreement between us; he has been in the industry for so long that he keeps things old school whereas I am much more modern. 


I enjoy working for my uncle because I am able to pick my younger siblings up from school and take them to work with me and it is easy for me to take time off when I need (but I usually work 50+ hours a week plus school full time). Growing up, I realize that I don’t enjoy working for other people and I like to work for myself that is why I am pursuing a career in business. This is also the reason why I am still working for/with my uncle because it doesn’t feel like I am working for someone. I also have many responsibilities such as keeping track of money and going grocery shopping. 


 I am unsure what to do because a part of me feels like going into business with my uncle isn’t going to work out but at the same time I don’t know what to do because that’s my only plan in life. I really want to start my own business but I have limited amount of money and I don’t have a talent that I can “sell.” I’m also becoming miserable working with him because of our constant disagreements and i know he isn’t going to want to change his method and styles. 

I’m so afraid that nothing is gonna work out for me and I will soon be jobless and future-less and frankly i’m so scared. 

my question is should I continue to work there and hope things get better and my uncle would understand my modern work methods or should I quit and most likely stress about having no plans for the future. 

Also another question i have would be
should I continue and get my bachelors degree now or get my associates and then go back to school later. I am terrified of going to a university and the thought of internships freak me out. I really just want to own my own business or own houses."

So here is my situation:

I recently got a software engineering internship (yay!) and now I am getting a background check. Currently, I work at my school's IT department. I do tech support there and I also help with writing a python web application that our department uses to speed up the process of finding the stuff we need to give good tech support. 

**Now, this is what I am concerned about:** My official position, on payroll, is ""Student Help Desk Assistant"" where the description of the job is basically just giving tech support to students and staff on my campus, under the supervision of a senior worker. However, on my resume, I put ""IT Help Desk Consultant"" as my title. I did this solely because I thought this title looked more professional. Also, as I mentioned earlier, I work on a python web application as well during my shifts at work. So, I also put on my resume that I am a ""Student Backend Developer"", since I work on the backend portion of this web application. 

My concern is that my background check is asking for my official payroll title, which is ""Student Help Desk Assistant. This does not match what I put on my resume... I put the phone number of my boss on the background check, and I know that if my boss is called, he can explain my situation really well and everything will be fine. BUT the thing that is making me so worried is that what if I get straight up denied by the background check when they see my job title is different from what I put on my resume, and it does not even include the ""student backend developer"" position (since this position doesn't really exist, it's just a SIDE thing that I do at the help desk). Like, what if they don't even call my boss, and just deny me right there?

What do you guys think... I know my mistake now and I have learned my DAMN lesson: Never, EVER change the title of your job on your resume to make yourself sound cooler and never, EVER try to split a position into 2 to make yourself look more impressive.

Did i fuck myself over guys?"

I am a computer engineering 2nd year student and I recently got hired as a software intern and in my internship we mostly deal with web development and databases, and I have almost zero experience in web development. During the interview process I disclosed this to my employer and also have disclosed this basically in my resume, but I did mention I had some experience with java (which I did by building some webscraping applications). So basically my employer is getting really frustrated at me since I have no web development skills, I have been reading up a lot on SQL, jquery/javascripting and C# (which is pretty simply since I had C++ and python background). My boss today pulled me aside and reviewed my resume again in front of me and I she said ""You have webscraping so why can't u do this simple task"" the task at hand was basically adding features to a website, which frankly is very different from webscraping since its literally implementing library functionalities. So in essence I don't know what to do I expected some training and some mentorship since its an internship, but my boss basically told me they don't have time to train me at all and just expect me to do things. I honestly don't know and I feel like my boss keeps harassing me to get work done as quickly as possible. I just need some advice as to what to do, I want to learn and I am trying my best to learn as quickly as possible but the things she does is kinda discouraging me. She keeps comparing me with the other interns who are 4th year Comp sci interns who obviously have more experience/knowledge than me in web development. TLDR: I dont know anything about web development. I have a boss that doesn't want to train me and basically just wants me to get things done. What should I do?

Edit: Although the job requirements did say javascript,jquery,sql...etc. I went into the interview and was just honest with my skills ie: Told them I don't have any experience with web development and databases, but it is something I have always wanted to get into. They told me I would just be documenting code and then might add some functionalities. I don't know if I was lied to, because I accepted the offer expecting that they took this into account.

Two months ago I went for my first interview to a CS job at company T, made a pen and paper test, thought I went ok but never received an answer (although they said to me that I would receive a feedback even though I received a NO). After that I went to another interview on company C, was asked to make a CRUD and some simple interface and passed the test. In the same week this company C called to me to start at the end of the week. It was my first CS related job, so I was very happy. This was like 4 weeks ago.

This week the guy from company T called me and asked to talk to me again. I went there and they explained to me that my test was one of the best and even through I have no experience he find potencial and he asked for me to join the team. 

Problems: he asked for my wage prospect and the job will only start in three weeks. 

Wage: To be honest I don't really care much about wage. Until reading this sub today I didn't even thought to ask ""whatever is the average for a junior here"". I'm gonna ask a little more than my intern job, but I don't really care if I don't get it. I think they want me on the team and I want to work there, but I was afraid of looking too desperate and ""losing money"" if I talked too passionated about ther offer.

Three weeks gap: I don't know how to handle this phase of  ""I'm employed here but I'm gonna leave until the end of the month"". I really don't know what to do, should I talk to C after I the wage negotiation with T? Or should I wait to sign my contract? It a dick move to basically collect wage to learn on the job (it was pretty much what I did on my first month on C), I guess at least I teached a little about javascript to the other intern."

I’d been playing basketball for a while in middle school and in highschool I played for one of the top teams in my province and I went from benchwarmer to starter. However I’ve always been an intellectual and always focused on learning and doing good in school. Since I was pretty good in highschool especially my senior year people often asked me if I am trying to play somewhere or when I play casual pickup and I play really good a guy would ask me where do I play etc and that always sparks up my thoughts considering whether I should try and play or not. However my university is also one of the top teams in the country and so if I tried to play I would probably have to redshirt initially and I have no clue whether I would play the following  year as the nature of top teams is to continuously recruit good players . 

So I’m thinking will playing or trying to play  actually make me happier or will it just increase both my physical and mental stress while hurting my grades and most importantly my understanding of the concepts I’m being taught and thus possibly hurting my chances at a good internship and pretty much make learning the material less fun as I am not able to enjoy and fully understand everything I’m learning? When I was a benchwarmer in the beginning of highschool I hated it so much and wanted to quit and so I imagine having that same feeling along with more rigorous classes and even more hours dedicated to practices lifts etc will make me feel less happy than I currently am. I am a rational person so I always think about it with pros and cons but Yet I always keep on thinking about this thing and it is very frustrating. Can anyone relate to this or have any experience in such a situation or any advice? I really appreciate it thanks ."

&amp;#x200B;

NEW Question:(05/05/2019)

I now confused about ""the level of knowledge"" needed in order to get a job (as an international student if that makes a difference). It seems it is possible to get a job or internship after learned the basic such as Data Structure, OOP, OS, Database and some Java Project in coursework,  but on the other hand when I looking through the job ads, employers always expected you to know some Design Pattern, Agile Development, RESTful and frameworks even for graduate level developers. 

So which is true? My opinion is, seen from the job ads, a entry-level knowledge is far from enough to land you a job, because you need to know the architecture, am I right?

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ANSWER for original question: Most suggest NUIG\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

I am hesitating of whether to choose MSc in Computing (Advanced Software Development) at DIT or HDip and MSc in Computer Science at UCC, and hope you could give me some suggestions.

I am not from a closely-related computer science background and that is why I got MSc offer from DIT but only got HDip from UCC.

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is whether it is worth to spend one more year and the tuition fee in order to go to a higher-ranked university. I am aware that the rank won't necessarily be an advantage as long as I have the ability to do the job here in Ireland, and those attend DIT has said nothing bad about its courses, but since I am an international student and I may not stay in Ireland for the whole life, I am wondering if UCC is a better choice for long-term prospective.

For choosing UCC, apart from the extra tuition fee, some of the HDip modules are too easy for me. So the ""price"" of getting a ""better"" master degree is 1 more yr + more fees + some ""useless"" modules. What do you think I should choose?

I also got offer from NUI Galway of MSc in Software Design, though the modules seems harder than HDip at UCC, it is easier than DIT. Both MSc at DIT and UCC are offering for those with computer science background, whereas NUIG is a conversion course targeting non-CS background students, so that's why I haven't consider it at the beginning."

The second is the $, my family isn't wealthy enough to support me through college and I'm not sure how i'll pay for all of this besides using my credit card and slowly paying it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago I foolishly walked down a busy ""party"" street in my neighborhood with an open container. A cop came from behind me and grabbed me after saying ""sir come with me."" Being intoxicated and frightened from the random man pulling me away, I told him to get his hands off of me as i walked with him to what seemed to be the CSO tent 100 ft away across the street (campus security officer. They are city/student volunteers who give out water and make sure people get home safely. They don't detain people). I knew he was an authority figure of some kind (cso or cop) but i never saw him face to face, he came up and grabbed me from behind and then immediately started walking me away from my friends. I tried to shake him off my back. Yeah I probably would've tried to run but I couldn't get his arm off of my shoulder. He subsequently dropped my ass on the floor and handcuffed me with like 3 or 4 cops that magically appeared out of no where. They interviewed my friends and other witnesses, whom all seem to tell me that they said the use of force was unnecessary. I told him and the other cops I had no idea who he was while sitting in the back of the car and having them question me. I told them I would've appreciated him letting me know he was a police officer before slamming me to the ground, but i understand why it happened of course. I spent the night in the drunk tank and was written up for resisting arrest (the sheet just says 148 (a) (1) PC, i don't see an open container charge). My court date is in a bit over a week. I have been calling the DA's office to see my official charges and they are still pending?? Not sure how i'm to go to court not knowing what i'm defending..

&amp;#x200B;

Last night around midnight I went to get fast food with my friend. When we were driving back, there was a random dui checkpoint. My friend was smoking her juul and my car was a bit foggy, and they had me pull over instead of pass through. After informing them of my friend's juul, they asked if I had drugs or alcohol in the car, and now being terrified of cops, decided not to lie and told them there was a bit of weed in the center console. My eyes happened to be red, i was not stoned, but he wouldn't take no for an answer so i told him I had smoked before I watched a movie, at around 8 pm (4 hours ago). This was all true, I smoked at 8 and watched Bohemian Rhapsody. I am unsure of laws regarding driving after smoking, but I was not high after four hours. I smoke marijuana very frequently and have quite a tolerance built up. He tested me by making me get out of the car and follow his pen with my eyes. He said I seemed fine but still made my friend drive us home. I have naturally huge pupils, and my eyes were glossy I was told. I was written up for California Vehicle Code Section 23222 (b) VC. The sheet literally says ""1/2 gram of Marijuana"" in the notes section. There was about 3.5 grams there, but the lady writing it up felt bad I think. She kept saying when her partner walked to a different car being checked that i'm so sorry this is happening, but i have to write you up. This court date is about a half a month after my first.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a huge internship this summer- one that could jumpstart my career into what i've been wanting to do my entire life. I need this internship. I am so disappointed with myself because these have been all my fault, and two days before incident #1 i signed on that the company employing me could do a background check. This internship is really competitive and I don't see why they wouldn't drop me for this if they find it considering they have plenty of other smart candidates that didn't make the cut.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be great. I received free consultation letters in the mail from lawyer offices. I haven't contacted them because i don't know what to tell them considering the DA's office doesn't have my charges and i'm scared they'll run me up for all the $ i can dish out. I need advice. Do I wear a suit to court? Or a collared shirt? i know one of the elements a plaintiff has to prove is that ""when the defendant resisted, he knew the officer/EMT was performing a lawful duty."" I'm not sure if I can contest this. Any advice helps. I'm clueless."

bkryix,3,2019-05-04,How can I better position myself for a T-15 B-School in 2-3 years?,Jakob2293,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/bkryix/how_can_i_better_position_myself_for_a_t15/,"Hello all, hoping to get some advice on how to better position myself for an MBA in 2-3 years. 

For some context, I’m a 25M who graduated from a CSU in Southern California with a BS in Finance about 2 years ago. Going into my Senior year of college, I was fairly involved and had a decent GPA (3.3, held leadership positions in my fraternity/other on campus organizations, had several internships, restaurant full time to pay my way thru school. Life was good until Senior year absolutely rocked me. It was a culmination of taking on too much at once mixed with some bad luck and bad decisions. Senior year ...

-I was diagnosed with depression
-I was arrested for a dui, 
-my grandmother passed away 
-my dog passed away
-my gf broke up with me
-I was VP of my fraternity(which was going thru a membership review and internal audit)
-I was enrolled in 21 units a semester
-I worked full time to pay my way thru school

I’m not one to make excuses, but it was too much for me to handle. My grades suffered and I ended my undergrad career with a 2.98 GPA. Upon graduating, I took one of the few offers I had and accepted an associate role with a large insurance based financial services firm. After about 4 months, my mental illness was starting to get the best of me, so I ultimately quit and spent the next few months really focusing on getting my life together. I spent months researching the numerous career paths in finance and realized how I truly wasted my undergrad experience. I aspire to break into investment banking but realize that an MBA is the only feasible way for me to do so. 

With that said I was hoping to get a pre-mature profile review, as well as some advice on how to overcome my GPA and pivot into a role that will better position myself for a T15 MBA and particularly post MBA investment banking. Here are my stats so far. I know they aren’t impressive, but nevertheless:

Work Experience:
Client Service/Ops associate: &lt;1yr
-Large B/D and custodian (think Schwab, Fidelity, LPL) 
-Promoted after 4 months to our core team, servicing RIAs with over $500mm AUM
-Manage our relationship with a $1.4bn RIA that uses our platform
-Perform client servicing, reporting, and basic analytics upon our advisors request 

Private Equity Internship: 3 months
-Worked for a search fund seeking to acquire a a business that fit our model
-Performed proprietary and brokered deal sourcing and research
-Built several financial models for several potential targets

Financial Services Associate: 3 months
-Assisted Sales Manager with Portfolio construction and product recommendations
-Sourced potential clientele through marketing and social media 
-Performed client servicing, reporting, and basic analytics

Education:
-BS in Finance from CA State School
-GPA 2.98 (See initial summary)
-Held various leadership positions on campus (VP of fraternity, Chair on AS Community service commission, etc).

-CFA Level 2 Candidate (Hope to complete the charter before matriculation)

Extracurricular:
Non-Profit Associate: 3 yrs
-My family runs a non-profit focused on food recovery and fighting hunger. I’ve assisted in all aspects for the past 3 years including event management, social media management, grant research, and volunteering for various events
-I hope to acquire a board seat on the non-profits board of directors within the next 1-2 years

Fraternity Alumnus Advisor: 1 yr
-Service as the Alumnus Advisor for my fraternities local chapter 
-Assist executive board in recruiting, event planning, and improving on campus involvement 
-Directly oversee the chapters VP of finance and assist in budgeting, planning, etc.

Bartender: 3yrs
-I manage a bar, part time on the weekends for extra cash. I plan on using the funds for B-School tuition or funding various business ideas
-I’ve heard mix reviews on whether or not this is helpful. Considering I work full time, manage a bar part-time, while studying for the CFA; I feel it speaks to my work ethic and dedication 


GMAT: N/A
-Plan on studying and taking the GMAT after CFA Level 2. 
- I understand I need a 700+ to really be competitive



With all that said, I feel my current work experience is truly lacking. I have been actively looking for FP&amp;A or investment analyst roles, but don’t plan on making a move until after CFA L2. I understand the GMAT will be integral, but I want to know what else can I do to better position myself for T15 B-School eventual post MBA investment banking?

-What jobs or roles should I look into that would make me a more competitive applicant? 
-Are their any extracurriculars I should look into doing?
-What else would you recommend?

Any advice would be much appreciated

bksomh,21,2019-05-04,Internship Employer found my Glassdoor review....lol,XxaemaeThxX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bksomh/internship_employer_found_my_glassdoor_reviewlol/,"I had another offer from another internship, this past few months. I quickly interviewed and signed the offer because I didn't like what I was doing at my current internship, and the new one looks like a better experience (hypothetically at-least).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I made a huge dumb mistake on the Friday that I got the offer and signed it, I posted a glassdoor review of my current internship. It was anonymous and I thought there was no way they would find out. I planned to put my 2weeks notice in the next week Thursday, when I returned to office.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, my boss emailed me before that on Tuesday asking if I could have a meeting with him Thursday (really out of the blue and suspect) so I was already knew something was up. I come in Thursday and we start having the meeting, and I began telling him I plan to put my 2 weeks in, and he starts trying to get me to stay with the company etc...

&amp;#x200B;

.. and then he brings up ""I  don't know if this was you or not, but this review was posted and I'm very dissapointed"". I thought about denying it, but I'm the only intern at this department at this location so it was glaringly obvious. I just straight up honed up to up (thank god it wasn't a horrendously negative interview) . It was very awkward. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough, he still tried to get me to stay with the company, and I officially put my 2weeks in the next Friday. I finished my finals this past week and just emailed him yesterday saying if I could end earlier because there was literally no work for me to do and kind of no reason to come.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this was a pretty funny experience and I learned some things. I don't think I'll ever post a glassdoor review ever again lol Anyone have similiar awkward experiences?

&amp;#x200B;

I will say part of the reason me leaving too, is that the people training me seemed to stop helping me and seemed even threatened by me (two women training me). Also, they were still using some older technologies like the Mainframe. It was a Computer Science intern position."

However, ever since I left school, I now have an immense chunk of free time that I do not what to do with. But most importantly, *I miss the grind I had during my undergraduate years (school full time, a part-time job, a part-time internship, involved in research on top of schoolwork all while keeping physically fit)*. While the idea of getting a part-time weekend job has been floating around in my mind for a bit, I am keeping an open mind and want to see if creating a side hustle through the entrepreneurial route is something that would bring me fulfillment. 

I completely understand that being an entrepreneur is **not a get-rich-quick scheme and that it is a difficult task to carry out**. For every self-made millionaire story, there are *many, many, many* more stories where people have been screwed financially in their pursuits. If I do pursue this route, I am prepared to not make money for the first few months and not see any progress for a long time.

Just as I did when learning how to be a software engineer, it is vital that you learn how to walk before you can run. For those of you on /r/entrepreneur that have created a side hustle while working full time, what are some tasks that you recommend I carry out to get started?"

bkue33,2,2019-05-05,"I'm 41, in grad school, and I'm on my way to getting diagnosed with ADHD",organizeddistraction,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bkue33/im_41_in_grad_school_and_im_on_my_way_to_getting/,"So, I got pregnant when I was 17, and then had three children for the next few years.  I put my studies off because I was(am) a mom.  I did well in school in general, but my parents always made an effort to send me to really goods schools where I thrived.  I have always had a lot of energy, but I always thought that it is because I am Latina... you know, a cultural thing, we're expressive and energetic! (lol)

I went back to school to finally get my undergraduate degree in 2012.  I graduated in 2017 (at age 39) from a very reputable program (in the top 3 in the USA).  I am now in grad school (doing two masters, both programs are in the top 3 in the USA).  I have always been an intelligent high achiever, but I have had significant weaknesses throughout my life.  In the past year things have gone downhill in a very significant way.  My husband and I finally were able to buy our first home, but this is the first time I do not have my own personal studying space.  When I transferred from community college to my local university, I also went through a significantly bad time.  This whole time I thought it was depression, because my brain would just stop working and I would feel overwhelmed.  I got put on Wellbutrin in my junior year in college.  That was the only thing that seemed to stabilize me somewhat.

So I recently went back to counseling at my university and was sent to a psychiatrist.  After trying out multiple anti-depressants that did not do anything, the psychiatrist said that she thought I may have ADHD.  I laughed at her and asked her if that is is just that I am Latina.  I didn't think about it at all for a a few days and then something triggered me to really look into it.  I read about symptoms and nearly all of them fit with who I am and how I act.  The only thing that doesn't fit for me is that I am super and excessively organized.  I think this is what has been masking my ADHD.  I am a very visual person, and need to have my environment organized and ""beautiful"".  All of the places where I have lived have been organized in a way that look good.  My current new home looks amazing right now.  When my place does not look perfect, it distracts me to no end.  All I can think about is how I can make it look good, so I get distracted and cannot focus on anything.  Other than that, I have taken multiple ADHD quizzes, and I get high scores in all aspects minus the disorganization thing.   I am disorganized in other non-visual things, like completing tasks and managing my time.

Things have been really bad lately.  I cannot focus on anything for more than a minute unless it is an obvious visual task.  So, I am in my second year of three years of grad school, but I am taking ""incompletes"" in three of my classes from this spring semester.  These classes require a lot of reading, writing and extensive synthesis and application of new ideas that I am not familiar with.  It has been overwhelming.  So, for the past few months all I can do is focus on my surroundings, so my home looks amazing at the moment and is very clean and organized.  On the other hand, I am exhausted and stressed because I need to finish this damn classes this summer.

I've realized that I am intelligent and this has gotten me through life so far.  I have had good coping strategies throughout my life, but have also had significant weaknesses that I attributed to laziness. I am good with using a planners, and have gravitated towards Japanese planners (the Jibun Techo, to be specific).  I also love technology and tend to be the first to use new technologies, so I use those for organization... my OneNote notebook is super organized, just like my Gmail and Outlook calendars).  I would always sit at the front of class, taken extensive notes (very organized and color-coded... i have a lot of great pens, in many colors) during class, but I totally suck at memorizing and putting together study guides (I would just re-write everything).  I have had low self-esteem when it came to intelligence and studies, but now I'm realizing that much of that has come from having ADHD.  I beat myself up all the time, but when it comes down to things related to my studies, I tend to understand things much better than anyone around me.  I also recently did an internship related to my grad school studies, and I knew a lot more than many of the people around me and it showed.  Of course, I still think I am kind deficient.  I feel I don't excel where it is important.

Getting the unofficial ADHD diagnosis has been mind blowing.  Suddenly a ton of things make sense in my life.  I am also pretty sure my mom has ADHD, but she manages well, and she is 75 years old now, and it really doesn't matter to her.  A ton of her weaknesses make sense now.  I do think that my hyper-organization considerably offset my ADHD.  I mean, I literally organized my books in middle school and high school by the dewey decimal system.  I didn't even have that many books so it didn't make a difference.  One of the masters I am doing now is in Information Science, which has a lot to do with organization and categorization of information, and a lot of my classes overlap with Library Science.

I was at a lunch this past week with my advisor and her advisees.  My friend sitting beside me mentioned her ADHD so after lunch I grabbed her to ask her about it.  Same experience, except I am organized.  I had done group work with her before (I am always the organizer) and I would have never suspected her having ADHD, but her experience has been the same as mine.  She was surprised I have ADHD because I was the hyper-organized one.

It has been frustrating because my psychiatrist told me about her ADHD diagnosis/suspicion, but didn't give me an idea of what comes next.  I've been on Wellbutrin since 2016, and she added Clonidine (secondary treatment for ADHD, lowers blood pressure) to my treatment in March and it helped with my anxiety and depression symptoms.  When I asked her about how and when I would get stimulant medication, she seemed annoyed by my question and seemed to shut down on me.  She went from nice to annoyed and has continued to act that way.  I had no idea what was required for an official diagnosis for ADHD.  My one strength is going all the way when I am interested in things (well not all the way, I famously never complete things, but I try), so I started researching, asking friends, meeting with people who may know, etc, etc. I found out that I need official ADHD testing to be able to get stimulants (Adderall, etc), so I looked into that and my university gave me a ""scholarship"" to cover the costs of that testing outside of the university.  It's expensive (between $2000-4000 without insurance, and nearly $1000 with my student health insurance).  So, I've set up my test for June.  I'll be going to my psychiatrist this week to tell her that I set this all up on my own (without her help or guidance... I'm pissed that she didn't tell me anything about the process).  I was doing particularly bad last week, couldn't focus on anything and was getting really emotional about my lack of focus, so I messaged her through the student health portal.  I sent her a lengthy message describing how bad things were and if I could see her earlier (adjust meds, whatever), and she sent my a two sentence reply stating that we have an appointment set and that this would be my last session with her, and she would be handing me off to someone else.

I am looking forward to the evaluation in June.  I have moments of doubt about having ADHD because I am organized, but I am really really bad in the executive functioning area.  I had to get my husband and my daughter to boss me around and tell me what to do, step by step, to get things done.  If they hadn't bossed me around, I would have sat on the couch all confused about what to do next (unless it had to do with cleaning/organizing what was in front of me).

&amp;#x200B;

What I do want to say is that exercise is important.  I have been great about running regularly my whole life.  In the past few years I have become less good at that and I am sure that's why I have not been coping well.  I've been so bad at it that it is a huge effort to go out and run, but when I do I feel more normal again, or at least I feel like I can get things done.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I got a Google home mini recently and plan to use it to help me with routines, which I have famously been bad at.  I think that it would be a great tool, as long as I make sure that the volume is always set right so it doesn't piss my husband off.  He's still struggling to understand the details of ADHD.  I've been trying my best to point out specific behaviors to him that are ADHD.  He keeps saying ""i'm like that too sometimes"" and it's hard to make him understand that he's not ADHD (he's definitely not).

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share my experience.  I also hope to share tips on how to make things better because I'm always thinking about how to be more efficient in life in general.  Can you imagine how frustrated I've been?  I recently tossed out a bunch of books on productivity because I realized that they are completely useless to me.

TLDR: Recently got diagnosed (late in life) haven’t taken the ADHD evaluation, so I’m not on stimulants yet.  Feels like I’m starting all coping strategies from scratch."

Before these past two weeks I have not had any encounter with law enforcement or any fine imposed on me for that matter. I am mostly worried about my record. I would be really upset if any of this stays on my record or there's no way to expunge them, as i don't want it to affect my upcoming internship/career. The second is the $, my family isn't wealthy enough to support me through college and I'm not sure how i'll pay for all of this besides using my credit card and slowly paying it off.

Two weeks ago I foolishly walked down a busy ""party"" street in my neighborhood with an open container. A cop came from behind me and grabbed me after saying ""sir come with me."" Being intoxicated and frightened from the random man pulling me away, I told him to get his hands off of me as i walked with him to what seemed to be the CSO tent 100 ft away across the street (campus security officer. They are city/student volunteers who give out water and make sure people get home safely. They don't detain people). I knew he was an authority figure of some kind (cso or cop) but i never saw him face to face, he came up and grabbed me from behind and then immediately started walking me away from my friends. I tried to shake him off my back. Yeah I probably would've tried to run but I couldn't get his arm off of my shoulder. He subsequently dropped my ass on the floor and handcuffed me with like 3 or 4 cops that magically appeared out of no where. They interviewed my friends and other witnesses, whom all seem to tell me that they said the use of force was unnecessary. I told him and the other cops I had no idea who he was while sitting in the back of the car and having them question me. I told them I would've appreciated him letting me know he was a police officer before slamming me to the ground, but i understand why it happened of course. I spent the night in the drunk tank and was written up for resisting arrest (the sheet just says 148 (a) (1) PC, i don't see an open container charge). My court date is in a bit over a week. I have been calling the DA's office to see my official charges and they are still pending?? Not sure how i'm to go to court not knowing what i'm defending..

Last night around midnight I went to get fast food with my friend. When we were driving back, there was a random dui checkpoint. My friend was smoking her juul and my car was a bit foggy, and they had me pull over instead of pass through. After informing them of my friend's juul, they asked if I had drugs or alcohol in the car, and now being terrified of cops, decided not to lie and told them there was a bit of weed in the center console. My eyes happened to be red, i was not stoned, but he wouldn't take no for an answer so i told him I had smoked before I watched a movie, at around 8 pm (4 hours ago). This was all true, I smoked at 8 and watched Bohemian Rhapsody. I am unsure of laws regarding driving after smoking, but I was not high after four hours. I smoke marijuana very frequently and have quite a tolerance built up. He tested me by making me get out of the car and follow his pen with my eyes. He said I seemed fine but still made my friend drive us home. I have naturally huge pupils, and my eyes were glossy I was told. I was written up for California Vehicle Code Section 23222 (b) VC. The sheet literally says ""1/2 gram of Marijuana"" in the notes section. There was about 3.5 grams there, but the lady writing it up felt bad I think. She kept saying when her partner walked to a different car being checked that i'm so sorry this is happening, but i have to write you up. This court date is about a half a month after my first.

I have a huge internship this summer- one that could jumpstart my career into what i've been wanting to do my entire life. I need this internship. I am so disappointed with myself because these have been all my fault, and two days before incident #1 i signed on that the company employing me could do a background check. This internship is really competitive and I don't see why they wouldn't drop me for this if they find it considering they have plenty of other smart candidates that didn't make the cut.

Any advice would be great. I received free consultation letters in the mail from lawyer offices. I haven't contacted them because i don't know what to tell them considering the DA's office doesn't have my charges and i'm scared they'll run me up for all the $ i can dish out. I need advice. Do I wear a suit to court? Or a collared shirt? i know one of the elements a plaintiff has to prove is that ""when the defendant resisted, he knew the officer/EMT was performing a lawful duty."" I'm not sure if I can contest this. Any advice helps. I'm clueless."

During that time I developed on a dashboard for internal purposes. During that time I had to Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) data for the dashboard consumption. I also shadowed the Business Intelligence (BI) developer out of interest for a while.

The initial idea was if I impressed I will start of as a junior in the development team but I was not really interested in Dev work and wanted to try something different like Dev/Ops. The company took me on as a junior Dev/ops engineer. I sat around for two months doing menial work and felt like I was going no where. At that point the BI Developer was leaving so I took the opportunity to hold the fort. I.e bug fixing. At that time I hoped that I  could grow and make it my own. This went on for almost half a year where I fixed numerous bugs. I admit as a junior I was out of my depth but I hustled and developed relationships within the company who would help me out. Once the new B.I developer came in they formed us as team.  We work as a great team where my team mate develops the reports and I do the ETLs as well as Dev/ops stuff for the BI side.

Now bear in mind that I was sold a great future for this department. That we were going to use cubes and other great technologies. I even did online courses for things like neo4j and elastic stack. But soon I realized that the main focus is on the product itself and these are just arbitrary btw ""stuff"" that might not happen. As time goes on plans have changed and I now know it will definitely not happen. 

Looking back I feel a bit guilty that I kind of demanded to work with cutting edge technology while I am just a junior. But in that moment everything seemed to be going so well.

Now I am bored with it all. Using old tools and everything has become a repetition. I brought this up with management and they decided to take me back into the dev/ops space. But I feel I am in limbo. I have been doing work but I don't know where I stand. 

I do not blame anyone, my mind keeps changing and I myself don't know what I'm looking for. 

I just would like to know your thoughts. Ask questions that I might never think of. Maybe ignite something within in me to help me make good decisions. 

Most importantly any advice?"

I've attended two semesters so far and working 25 hours a week to pay my bills. However, I've only really been able to take 3 classes because of work and other responsibilities. I want to graduate in 2 years but this would mean that I would have to take 4-6 classes a semester starting fall. I figured this is the smartest thing to do because it will save me money on loans in the end. I would also be looking to land an internship next summer no matter how hard I have to work. 

I know myself, and I don't think I would be able to work and take on 5 classes at the same time, which means having to quit my job so that I could actually attend events and network at my school. Id be taking a loan out to cover my bills for the time being so that i could put my attention on projects and school work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Id like to hear your experiences if anyones been in my position or took the risk."

For example I had to write a two page summary about my internship experience which took me forever to finish. I don't know why but every time I write a sentence I get distracted or start day dreaming. So you can see why writing something simple can take me a long time. 

I started a internship in March and is ending next week, however they really liked me so they offered me a full-time position, which I said yes to. I have notice at the internship I would have a lot of day dreams but will happen most frequently when I have to write an email (I might write a lot of emails throughout the day). The boss had me meet with her to talk about the additional duties I will be doing from now on. She made it clear not to fall behind, so I don't if she knows something is up. I am pretty sure they know I am slow but may not know it's because of my ADHD. 

My questions are the following.

I don't drink coffee but I heard that it helps with ADHD so is that true? I don't have the hyperactivity part of ADHD but my leg does shake a lot when I sit down.

I am taking vitamin B because I read a couple of articles online stating that vitamin B helps with the brain. Is this true if not what vitamins I can take that will help?

Are there certain foods I can eat that will help me? 

Will exercise help me and if so what kind of exercises (cardio or weight lifting)?

Any werid or unusual treatments/activities you guys can recommend me that will help?

I am asking you guys because you have ADHD like me and maybe what worked you will work for me. Thanks in advance.

TLDR: I got a job need tips to control my ADHD"
bl1rjr,5,2019-05-05,On CUNY and Macaulay for interested students,StrikingCollege7,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bl1rjr/on_cuny_and_macaulay_for_interested_students/,"I know this it's past decision date but I hope this will be of use when people search in the future.    
    
Generally, CUNY is the public colleges in NYC, and Macaulay is their special honors program. CUNY is pretty bare bones but Macaulay offers things like travel stipends, free laptops, exclusive classes and stuff.       
     
Now if you are considering either, the **only** reason should be because of cost, if you're a high achieving student. I've spent three years in the system and it is absolutely horrific.    
    
Pros:            
         
* City life, a number of cool things to do       
* Free through the new NYC scholarship thing            
* Flexible courses. The CUNY system does not discriminate against APs and it's actually insanely easy to start taking high level courses. As a result people graduate in two/three years if you have a decent plan.     
 * It's also easy to graduate with a BA/MA in four years with minimal work.           
* Big fish small pond (also a con, depends on person)                       
            
Cons:         
         
* These are 1000% commuter schools. That means no social life, little office hours, no campus, no community, no parties etc. You might be able to find a group of friends but this is atypical. Macaulay cohorts do have some unity but it is still weak. This is absolutely soul grinding. You also get fun stuff like homeless people sneaking in and trying to take showers in the sink.     
 * If you choose to dorm, there are no dining halls, no amenities etc. It is absolutely. The cost of living from subway fares to eating adds up, so it's not really free.                       
* It's a bureaucratic nightmare. Old public school system with weird restrictions that even the administration can't deal with. Macaulay allows you to fast track a lot of it, but only a negligible amount.            
* The people here are not motivated. The graduation rate is &lt;50% for all the schools. Most people come here because they think college is ""something to be done."" These people have very little direction and motivation. It's a prick thing to say, but it's the antithesis of a high achieving student. These are your classmate for the next two-four years and it is so demotivating. Macaulay is a lot better, but lots of people are content with ""big fish small pond"" mentality.                     
                           
The only people who would choose this over other paths are:                  
          
* Premed students. Free tuition and weed out classes are easier since the general CUNY population isn't academically inclined.                 
* People who want to do grad school. Free tuition and the internships in the city with the ""big fish small pond""-ness allows many to go to Ivy League schools post-grad.          
                  
I'm obviously biased but hope this gives you some insight. I did try to give some benefits. You can do well, but it will be hard."
bl23u6,4,2019-05-05,"I landed my dream job, but I’m fucking it up",nauticalsun,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bl23u6/i_landed_my_dream_job_but_im_fucking_it_up/,"New to this sub, but everyone’s stories resonated so much that I thought I’d take a shot at journeying with you!

I’m 27, diagnosed with BPD and ADD about 3 years ago when I was in my third year of medical school. Everything clicked with the diagnosis, but finishing the last two years was still an uphill climb. Last year, I graduated med school, passed the board exams and earned my license as a doctor. Now here was the picture: I have a mediocre class ranking (below 50%, i assure you), and my board rating was average. Plot twist of the year: **I got into a competitive residency program in a top tertiary hospital** despite being academically average and being an outsider (not a graduate or intern of said hospital, which grants points on application). I do believe some of my strengths worked in my favor during the pre-residency (kind of a trial) period, but getting in was still a huge surprise. But there it was. It was going to be hell, but I was bracing myself for the incoming onslaught of physical, mental, and emotional torture that is being a first year resident at this program. 

We’re four months in. 
* I’ve developed a reputation as a slow worker and a sleepyhead (I was off ADD meds until a month or so ago) 
* I’ve gotten into big trouble with my attendance because I am ALWAYS late due to sleeping in despite multiple wake up calls and alarms
* I get people in trouble for forgetting things and they have to cover for my stupid ass. 
* I have difficulty submitting paperwork and requirements on time
* The work is *not* ADHD-friendly. Tasks pile on top of each other real-time and you are expected to find a way to finish them quickly. Routines don’t mean anything here. Different seniors will have their own tasks for you and they all think their tasks takes precedence over others’. They will call incessantly. They will harass you. It’s impossible to plan your day ahead. You don’t know what scut work shit errand some senior is going to pile on you in the next couple of minutes. 

So here we are.
**I’m performing poorly at a job I was lucky to snag.** I’m constantly afraid of being kicked out of the program but I’m also not improving. I recently got on Concerta 36 which greatly improved my wakefulness at work. This is already a big step in making my team mates feel like I am present. I am still quite forgetful, and procrastinate a lot with paperwork. My attendance is dismal. 

**I need changes in my life.** I am currently on sick leave now (just had surgery) and fully intend to keep my life on track when I return. Basic plan is:
* Accountability for tardiness. Real, palpable consequences are needed. Threats of being sacked are APPARENTLY not enough to get me out of bed in the morning. I neeeeeeeed real consequences for my tardiness. Current option: pay for the whole team’s lunch every time I am late
* Compliance with medication. I need to ensure that I have a constant supply of my medication and that I take it every day (easier for Neurotypicals, hard for us)
* Maximize my lists. I have been customizing paper lists for every post I assume. They help and have gotten quite popular with my co-workers for being handy, but they can still be optimized. 
* Maximize alarms. I tend to forget appointments and events (duh) so I will try setting up an alarm at 10pm every night to remind me to review the events of the next day so the team can plan ahead with covering for me as I attend to those events. 

Hopefully I get some structure in with those things to keep me from getting kicked off the program"
bl24fr,1,2019-05-05,"I work for my family's IT business, and I was wondering how I can use my interest in programming and software development to my advantage in such a small business setting.",KomradLorenz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bl24fr/i_work_for_my_familys_it_business_and_i_was/,"Hello all, I hope this kind of question is appropriate here, I did not see quite a question like this so I thought this was fair game.

Let me get into the small background of myself and my situation. Right now, I am very early into my associates degree in Science at my local community college and plan to transfer to the University into their Computer Science program. Right now however, I do not do much coding in terms of my job. In case it is not obvious, I work with my father in the freelancing IT business. System Administrator is probably the most accurate description, but we pretty much do anything that is remotely related to IT work (Networks, Servers, even Cameras, etc.) because we have had these clients for 10+ years and handle all of their systems and problems very well so they trust us.

Now when I say this business is small, I don't mean 10 people, I mean my father, me, and a friend of mine that is also interested in software development. I have always wanted to be able to inherit the business and be able to continue it even after my dad is gone while also pursuing my interest in software development. Right now, I am currently gauging my interests in college and trying to network (my father said that I can even take time off to go do internships and such to find out what I want to do) so that I can be in a good place after I graduate. 

However, I want to be able to try and use programming to my advantage right now in order to not only develop some actual projects for myself, but to be able to expand the services of our business and to be able to help our clients (a lot of our clients we have known so long they are very good friends with us). My problem is I do not know at my current skill level what I could do both for the business and for the company. My friend is into web development, however, our website design on the front-end with HTML/CSS leave much to be desired in terms of how nice they look (Imagine a .com website in the 1990s). Other than website design however, I do not know what other ""problems"" I could solve, many of our clients already have software that does everything they need and don't seem to be looking to automate anything that I could whip up with a Python or Java program to help with. 

So, I was wondering if anyone that works out in the field and have done coding for far far longer than I have would have any insight on how to approach this and find some applications I could use to help out my family's business while getting some valuable experience at the same time. Any input would be greatly appreciated and I do hope this question is appropriate for the subreddit."

bl3lso,0,2019-05-05,"Got a promotion, got even more burned out. But I can't quit if I don't know what my future plan is. Help?",DISTROpianLife,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bl3lso/got_a_promotion_got_even_more_burned_out_but_i/," TL; DR: I got the promotion/position I always dreamed of, possibly at the wrong time ( divorce + health issue). I am beyond burnt out. But I don't know where to go next. Is this normal? Should I just try to take a leave of absence or quit without anything lined up?

About a year and a half ago, I got tapped on the shoulder for a pretty big promotion at the NGO I work with, going from a coordinator to a director. While I was excited about the promotion, I was also very realistic when speaking to the organization heads: the exiting Director had left a lot of unmet expectations and projects; our budget did not allow to hire permanent on-site staff, as a result we were stretched and had low morale; this made the standards the team would be held to were concerning. This was capped off with a very underwhelming pay raise, if it can be called such. They acknowledged my concerns, but said they had faith in me and agreed there would be a learning curve. However, on this last agreement, there was a sense that since I'd always been a more organized and self-directed performer, things would go smoothly.

They did, for the most part. The gains were tremendous. But a year and a half later, my team and I are burnt out. We cannot sustain a lot of what was done in that first year without putting our lives on hold yet again. Despite pointed conversations, our team is and will remain with minimal staffing and I will continue to execute in a dual Director/Coordinator role.  While I'm trying to make sure we focus on area goals and planning (not a forte with the previous manager, or really the organization as a whole), the organization heads either throw their own plans into what is set up for the year or respond to previously designed unattainable benchmarks with funders. Any time the concerns regarding sustainable staffing are voiced, they're talked down (as in acknowledged but not really understood) or turned into a discussion about something else (as in, a consultant can do that website for you...so just make sure you have 5 you can count on in case one is crappy). There's just not a real understanding of what our team does, it still gets written off as ""Oh but interns can do it"" (all well and good, except that in our US office, where I'm based, visa restrictions have whittled our interns down to one with a lot working remotely) or my favorite “Oh well as director, you just need to stop doing certain things so you can do look at the forest not the trees.” (ok but then they will straight up not get done and this is a funder related widget. Without these trees, there won’t be a forest).  


Moreover, it's demoralizing to see when someone transitions from staff to management on other teams, their position is re-staffed. I get it...it's funding related. But right now, we are one of the teams dealing with the most expectations as it is public-facing work in two, sometimes three languages.  What we are asked to do hardly lives up to the reality of what we have. Lately, every day is a trudge through endless amounts of widgets set by donors. Mostly, I don't feel like any of my inputs count, so I save my energy for the things that matter. What is clear is that I don’t want anyone to burn out on my watch.  


I know: I need to move on.  With the funding situation still so uncertain and the work my team does still so poorly recognized, I don't think I will get any of the extra permanent staffing I've been asking for. Furthermore, a lot of upper level staff quit in the one year I took on the promotion. New directors mean new ideas. Things are starting to pick up in ways that will soon become even more unmanageable.  


But, when I think about it, to what do I move on to? The few highs, vacation and insurance package coupled with three personal crises (divorce, chronic illness diagnosis, surgery) that collided right as I was being promoted have kept me locked in. It’s always sad to think about leaving a place you’ve come up and grown in, mostly out of your own sheer force of will.  However, at the end of the day, I got nothing left. I dream about taking 6 months off to just figure out next steps because I don’t even know if I even want to stay in the same career. Maybe this happens when transitioning from a staff to director position that you see things in a…bleaker light? In any case, I’m learning that despite this being something I yearned for 10 years ago, now that I have it, it’s kind of soul crushing, I don’t have the will to seek alternatives at the moment despite always having had a plan and being driven…and I don’t know what to do.

bl5pvb,1,2019-05-05,Data Scientist vs ML Engineer. Which should I choose?,WasRobertPaulson,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bl5pvb/data_scientist_vs_ml_engineer_which_should_i/,"So I have been working at a fortune 500 company in the logistics industry based in the Midwest for a little under a year. Its my first real ""tech job"". My title is ""data analyst"" but that isn't really what I do. I've built a Python package for mining GPS data using scikit-learn and I worked with a data scientist on building an ML model. I'm now in charge of deploying the model using Docker and Kafka. 

I recently got a job offer to be an ML engineer at a small consultancy start-up that I used to intern for. Good chance to be around some very experienced software engineer pros and learn stuff like Spark and Scala, but I wouldn't get to do any model building or real ML.

The current company I am at is making massive investments into DS and the data scientist is sufficiently impressed with me that he thinks I should apply to one of the new positions opening up. When I broke the news I might be leaving, they accelerated things and now I'm going to interview a DS position soon with a good chance I'll get it. 

Now I have a choice, and I need some advice. My background is in math with a masters from a state school, so data science would seem more in my wheelhouse than software engineering, but there also seems to be a ""data science"" bubble going and getting into hardcore software engineering might be a better bet in terms of long-run job prospects. Although DS interests me more, I'm not a genius, and while maybe I'm good enough for my current company, its possible I would have trouble competing in the DS job market generally without some extra tech/engineering skills to bring to the table, although this could definitely be impostor syndrome talking since I tend to be hard on myself. 

Here is a lists of reasons for going for either company. I like both companies, so people/culture isn't a factor here.

Reasons to stay at current company:

* chance develop skills in deep learning and model building
* easier to go from DS to ML engineering than the other way around
* can do ML engineering-type stuff here also
* large company: more stable than the start-up I'd be going to
* other company is wedded to Cloudera's sales channel and Hadoop distribution, some of which is becoming dated
* experience I'd gain: Python, R, machine learning, optimization, tensorflow/keras/pytorch

Reasons to leave for the other company:

* high concentration of very experienced software/big data people, company has a focus on high-quality enterprise scale software
* more generic skills mean more job opportunities later (maybe?)
* DS getting saturated = must compete with top tier talent, so better to focus on something else (again, could be impostor syndrome or misreading the supply/demand in the market?)
* experience I'd gain: Python, Scala, Spark, Hadoop ecosystem, software engineering best-practices

bl6p1t,2,2019-05-05,How should I break up with my friend?,UglarinnsWife,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bl6p1t/how_should_i_break_up_with_my_friend/,"So, I have a lot of context to go over, so if you just want to get to the advice giving, refer to the TL;DR list of points below.

I have this friend I met in college. I didn't really choose to be his friend, but he saw a keychain on my backpack that looked like a Dalek, and then he shanghaied me into a friendship. I wasn't a very social person, but that also meant I didn't have a lot of friends, so I decided to go ahead and befriend him.

When we hung out in person it was pretty nice. College was stressful and it was nice to have a friend. We would go out for pizza one day, hang out in the cafeteria the next, walk around campus, and although he was a bit annoying he was still a friend.

The first sign of trouble was when he convinced me to go to nightclub with him. He said that we were just going as friends, and considering that he was significantly older than me and we had widely different political beliefs, I believed that it was just as friends. And it was! However I had a long-distance relationship at the time, and my boyfriend (now husband) was concerned about this random stranger who wanted to take me out to a nightclub, especially since my boyfriend knew I hated places like that. Reasonably, he wasn't very happy with the idea. Over and over I tried to convince my friend that the nightclub scene wasn't really my thing and also my boyfriend was not happy with the idea because he didn't know him. And over and over my friend disregarded my personal reasons and guilted me into going anyway. I say guilted, because the reason he wanted to go with me was because he was bored and lonely and wanted to do something out on the town. My feelings be damned, I had to babysit him, wherever he wanted to go.

Cut to three to four years later. In that time, he managed to blow his internship by invading someone else's personal space (and then complained to me about it), got a job that requires him to travel a lot (about which he complains to me about how much he hates it), moved back in with his mother and father (and complains about how he hates it). He would complain about his ex, his lack of a girlfriend, how horrible his childhood was (his mom was just a little strict), so on and so on. Every time he called, he would humor me with two minutes of small talk (if that) and then go on for at least a half hour about all of his personal problems. Even the small talk got a little much, with him going on and on about ""how happy I am for you guys that you're in love. I should try it sometime!"" Or ""I'm so glad you moved out of your parents house. You have no idea how lucky you are!"" 

I thought, ""This is what friends do. They listen to each other. If I tell him to stop coming to me with all of his problems, I'll be a jerk!"" So I continued for years, being his shoulder to cry on. But as time has been going on recently, I have finally reached my limit.

Today's call was like all the rest, with him whining about how his ex won't take him back, and how the girl his ex hooked him up with didn't have ""the spark"", and how ""maybe gay guys have a good idea going there"". I was so frustrated, that I cut him short and told him I had stuff to (I did, but the main reason was because I was DONE with his whining). I went on a rant of how sick I was of his crap, which my husband allowed me to vent out (and made this funny meme: https://youtu.be/H8KATrSPVSw).

I've come to a decision that I need to put my foot down. There was a time when we were friends, when I liked to talk to him, but that time is officially over. I want to tell him I don't want to be friends anymore (or realistically, how I want to stop being his faux therapist). Since he lives really far away and often has to travel for his job, we can't exactly meet up and talk in person. Most likely I'll have to do this over the phone, which already makes me look like the asshole. There's also the problem of me being a gigantic coward who's afraid of conflict. I know I have to deal with this, but that doesn't make the fear go away. 

How do I, over the phone, both gather the courage to break up with him, and let him down as easily as possible. I really don't care if HE thinks I'm an asshole at the end, I just want him out of my life.

TL;DR 
* We were friends in college. He was annoying but decent.
*He took me to a nightclub even though I tried to tell him I didn't want to go.
*For years after he left college, he would do nothing but whine about how his life sucks.
*I'm officially over his nonsense and want to cut him out of my life.
*I am literally unable to talk to him in person. It has to be over the phone.
*I'm also afraid of confrontation.
*How do I gather the courage to end it, and how do I do it without being a dick?"

So recently I got offered a job that is related to my field of study but it’s not necessarily something I want to do full time down the road. It is the only internship that I have been offered. I do not want to go back to a mill where I have worked in previous summers but I don’t think I necessarily want this internship. Any advice? Do I take it and continue applying and if I get offered something else leave or does that make me a crappy person? I’m conflicted. I have a few more days to respond to their offer and I’ve been tossing and turning while trying to decide what to do. Has anyone been in a similar situation?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am a recent graduate of a 6 month course/bootcamp where we've studied the fundamentals of front end development. We recently got assigned to a company to do our 1 month internship. We studied all the basics + angularJS and today was our first day at the internship. The mentor/boss or whatever his title is gave us an offer, he said that we could choose to either study general front end skills and to further improve or we could choose to study angularjs further as the company is hiring people to work on this. They have made a deal with 'serviceNow' , a company which , as I understood uses angularjs to develop tools for it's clients to use. So he said that the salary would be quite competitive and that, if we got hired, we'd study for certificates funded by the company. As you may have guessed, my fear is that it might be a wrong career choice since angularjs is outdated and therefore it might be harder to change my job in the future if this job itself turns out to not be as rewarding. What do you suggest, to accept the offer or to just do basic front end and try to find a different kind of job in the future by myself"
blb01e,4,2019-05-06,[Uni] Opinion required: NTU Econs and Media Analytics OR NUS FASS,TerribleName_,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/blb01e/uni_opinion_required_ntu_econs_and_media/,"Hi, I am offered the following courses by NTU (Double Major in Economics and Media Analytics) and NUS FASS and am torn between which to choose. 

What I look for in uni is employability, opportunities to learn more and do internships, CCA and campus life, and enjoying uni life. I am not planning to stay in hall in either universities as I reside in the West.

By the way, the NTU Double Major programme is very very new and it only has one student intake last year (not sure how to feel about this). It is offered by the NTU School of Social Sciences and WKWSCI and I will study 42% in each of my majors, while my remaining modules go to general modules. In NUS, I am currently offered a double major in CNM + Biz but I plan to appeal/drop to just FASS if I chose NUS. I also plan to do a minor in Business Analytics/Management or Second Major in Biz/FASS in NUS.

**Pros of NTU:**

1. Curriculum is something I'm interested in though there are some theory-based modules that I don't really like. e.g. Media Effects, New Media and Society, Media Law, Ethics and Policy.
2. Smaller cohort (only 45 intake for the 6 double major combinations) means better attention by the programme coordinator.
3. I get to learn more econs and media analytics modules as compared to FASS.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons of NTU**

1. Very new programme and with the &lt;5 student population, I am very afraid that I will not have anyone to look out for help in projects, assignments or modules selections etc
2. Given that it is a new degree, employees may not know what this degree is about.
3. Less prestigious than FASS and the events/faculty is much lesser compared to FASS
4. Bad S/U system

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of NUS**

1. Prestigious brand name and FASS 
2. May have more opportunities given that the faculty is more established
3. Better S/U System

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons of NUS**

1. A lot of general modules which I don't like
2. Only 50% of the curriculum goes to the major
3. Too many people in the economics major and competition is high

As seen above, both universities have its pros and cons and I am in a dilemma between the two choices. Are there any prospective students / seniors who have their opinions on this?"
blb1dy,1,2019-05-06,Internship doesn't work out and my school is not supportive,YamiNoYuusha,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/blb1dy/internship_doesnt_work_out_and_my_school_is_not/,"Okay so this is gonna be a bit of a long story but here I go. TL;DR below but to really grasp the situation I suggest reading the entire thing.  


So a couple of months ago I started an internship at a rather questionable company. I initially took the internship because I was a bit late with actually applying on them since I actually wanted to brush up my portfolio before applying to improve the chances of me actually getting an internship on a level I could see myself work in. I knew from the get-go that this company wouldn't be that but I kinda brushed it off and I was prepared to just turn my brain off and just do the work that they ask of me.  


When I started there initially it was pretty fun and me and some other classmates that ended up there as well had a pretty good time. but over time the mood started to switch and the company started to be more strict on how hard we were working (let me add we are **unpaid** interns). usually companies do pay interns in my line of work but this company was kinda bottom of the barrel. so even though I wasn't paid in money at least I hoped I could get paid in knowledge. I do have a student loan going in the meanwhile to support me on the financial front. But unfortunately once I actually started my internship there the only person that was actually employed there that knew anything about our lines of work (our being me and my classmates) got fired because they simply had no need for him there anymore since we were there. so now we're working for 2 people running a business they know nothing about and they're running the project.  
Needless to say they gave very vague directions and made me work I was simply not educated on. so I started winging it and usually they didn't like what I delivered (even and I shit you not saying that the quality is too high for the standard of the project).  


Weeks pass by and slowly morale of the interns is dropping pretty hard. to the point where we all call in sick a lot and its pretty normal for me to when i show up to be completely alone for either the entire day or everyone is just very late by hours (even though they have scolded me on that whilst my commute takes 2 freaking hours!).  


So by now I was pretty done with this company and we just don't seem to be able to co-operate I've tried explaining to them what is not working for me and what is but they simply can't provide that so I can't provide the work they want from me.  


So now me and the person in charge of the company seem to be fed up with each other and I feel like I simply can't just stay around for much longer we're both just really fed up with it.  
**If I get fired or quit I'll have to repeat the year may I add!**  
So I tried contacting my school about mediating a solution. the internship supervisor from school is just telling me its my problem.  
I just had a conversation with my  counsellor at school if there is any solution to fix the problem by either mediate the problem by either all sitting together and just find a way that does work. or to find a way to end the internship earlier maybe by adding some time to the second intership we're supposed to have later this year (which I needed anyway)  
My counsellor basically said its all impossible and that this is how the it works in ""in practice"". 

And I have basically no rights and just have to perform magic and do things I was not trained for and just do them. or I get to do my term all over again.  


**TL;DR Got dealt a bad hand and now I am doing an internship at a company of which the owners are simply hiring free interns (who apparently have little to no rights) and I simply cannot work for this company any longer. Contacted school about it they say I am shit out of luck and have no rights in these manners.**   


Now my question specifically is, how can I not be able to quit a internship term whilst it's obviously not working and what do I do when my school is not supporting me in this in the slightest.  


I do realize most of you guys are probably thinking, ""well you brought this on your own by applying late or even starting there in the first place"". but you gotta realize its a pretty small market where I currently live and I'm planning to relocate for either my next internship or after i graduate. but besides that, I agree but there must be some way where I can get some support in this case? Or is the internship world really this unjust?  
This problem has been bugging me for a while and now tension is really starting to run high.  


Any advice is highly appreciated and if you have any questions feel free to ask them!"

I’ll try to keep this brief.

A little about me:

Male / 29

4yr Air Force veteran (honorable separation)

Bachelors of Science: Audio Production (Art Institute)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Job Experience (in no particular order):

\-Waitstaff, Customer Service (retail), Construction Worker, Weather Tech (Air Force), IT lab assistant (paid intern).

Honorable Mentions:

\-Live Sound (1yr as contractor)

\-Music Studio Intern (6mo assistant)

\-Scaffold builder assistant: sub-contracted for Dominion (Unescorted Nuke Access Req'd - very similar to Secret or TS clearance)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I finally landed a job as a barista and the company actually promotes people. I have been taking on extra work and landed a side gig for them doing brand ambassador stuff. I am still working in the shop as well, and I like the job. If I end up with a comfortable living IE ≥ 50k I will be satisfied in that department. The problem is that my entire life has been just jumping around from entry level job to entry level job, managing to survive on incomes ranging from 9.25hr to 20hr. The higher paying hourly scale being the labor intensive jobs that require a strong back and resilience to the outdoors. I absolutely hate construction work and never want to do it again regardless of the money -among other reasons I have chosen not to share-.

&amp;#x200B;

I ran into a fellow the other day at the bar who basically said ""making that kind of money is easy, there are tons of jobs that pay that much."" To which I declined to respond. All of the people in his circle are programmers and apparently a lot of them work remotely making a decent salary. I simply chalked it up to qualifications and shrugged it off.

&amp;#x200B;

The decision I have made this year is to do my damnedest to move vertically within the company I am at and build tenure. I think the reason I can only get entry level jobs is because I have only worked entry level jobs? This lack of experience I always hear about has been killing me when I apply for anything that pays more than your typical entry level job. Every time I try to shoot for a higher position, I get immediately screened out in the application process. For example: I applied to united rentals working with sales and rental equipment. I was screened out for never working at a rental company despite my customer service/ construction/ tech experience (would've been a perfect fit imo.) Rinse and repeat any job I look into with the following question: ""Do you have VERY SPECIFIC experience with x?"" followed by a rejection letter if they're nice enough to send one.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, a lot of my peers in their mid 30's hold obscure job titles like ""consultant"" seemingly have no problem with money. They jump companies all the time into other comfortably paid positions. They don't seem like wizard people, or any more/ less intelligent than myself so what gives?

&amp;#x200B;

Goals other than moving up in the present? Learn more skills and increase my value to the job market that also makes use of my audio degree (and passion for technical audio). For example: go back to school for journalism and working my way into some sort of audio/ journalist (maybe broadcasting) position. Perhaps I should learn C# and FMOD and become an audio technician for a game studio. I would love to hear from you guys on how I should best navigate my way into my 30's career wise. I'm not here to cry about it, I want to DO SOMETHING about it... I just don't know what.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your time.

TLDR: Stuck with entry level jobs and an art degree. Need advice on moving up in the employment world, preferably something in technical audio."

blec3k,43,2019-05-06,unemployed 3 years after college (frustrations),jetblackswan,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/blec3k/unemployed_3_years_after_college_frustrations/,"I graduated in December of 2015 with a B.S. in Architecture, and the job search just hasn't been in my favor since. In the mean time, I've been constantly volunteering my time with free labor places, and have been tirelessly trying to learn more marketable skills to put on my resume and have been searching and searching for any sort of job. Everybody I know, my colleagues and friends and now my partner, all have these fancy high-class good-paying jobs, and making good names and careers out of themselves, it seems, and I'm still living with my parents frantic, nervous, and unable to get a job STILL. I'm at my wits end right now, and I'm starting year four of unemployment and I honestly don't know what else to do right now except to just sit here and keep applying. 

I've been out of any sort of workforce for so long, I have no clue how to even break into the job market after a period of unemployment like this. I am clueless. Is there a chance to recover from a three-year gap of unemployment after graduating college? I'm not sure how much my volunteering counts, and I'm not a student anymore to qualify for these internships, but I'm actually taking some classes at a community college right now, and absolutely hate it, but I don't have much else to do right now.

Another problem is that I'm a little lost in terms of career, too, so I'm looking for anything and everything right now. I might be looking in the wrong places since all these jobs listed are for assistants, clerks, technicians... It seems there is not a fit for me anywhere, but perhaps living in a smaller city isn't working in my favor. When I do get the occasional interview, I can't help but to tense up and be really nervous. Interviews are simply not my strongest point.

Being out of the job market for so long, I have no idea where to get help (if I need it), or where to turn to. Submitting resumes to staffing services doesn't even help even though others I know have had success with those agencies. I spend my days staring at the computer hoping something will happen, and nothing really has. Creating and designing and trying to get more portfolio pieces (and doing art stuff I like to do) seems like a bit of wasted time because it doesn't seem to be productive to me in terms of job searching. I don't know what else I can do, and I don't want to settle for just a cashier job, honestly... part of me thinks that's the most I will ever do, and the other half of me thinks I deserve a good job, but I don't feel very deserving after these long years of sitting around unemployed (I know I have a shit attitude, but therapy is expensive and I don't want to do that to my budget again).

Besides the occasional temp job I have had, I've never held any sort of real and long-term job before... I've always been under the impression that I've needed some fancy office job or some sort of professional job that I've never been able to get, and that makes me frustrated because I don't want to waste my existing artistic skills, and want to design and not be holed up inside a cubicle all day... I think. I probably have a really distorted view because I lack such experience, and it's really embarrassing because I'll be thirty in a few years...

**APOLOGIES.** This has turned into a rant, but I've been having such trouble and this has really been getting to my head more and more and more and it makes me want to hide from the world and maybe give up after I spend my days job searching and crying all the time. It's really hard to keep your head up when you cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. Advice is welcome, but I'll re-iterate a few of my questions:

How does one break into the job market after a large gap of unemployment?

How do you keep your spirits (and your self-esteem and confidence) up when all your efforts seem to not work?

What are some interviewing tips for someone with bad social anxiety/how do you get over the nervousness??

Is the job market really this hard to break into (or is it just me... I'm sure it's just me)?

How are you supposed to get a good job with hardly any experience? What more can one do?

How do you properly use staffing services? (and is it worth it?)

What more can I do besides sitting at my computer applying to jobs? (whenever I go into places to inquire about jobs, they just refer me online instead)"

One of my internships was with a mid-size RE development firm in an analyst role, but turned down a full-time offer from them to accept my other offer (I'm not re-applying to this firm). I really enjoyed that position, so I've started to apply to a number of RE analyst positions (all mid/small-size, not shooting for the stars with any of the big banks or PE firms). I'm confident my finance experience and degree can at least get me in the door, but am worried about the qualms a potential hiring manager may have about my employment gap.

My question is how to address my now 4 month employment gap. Obviously this is less than ideal, and I would've preferred to have started shortly after graduating, but the WM firm I originally accepted the offer for was adamant that they wanted me to study and then start in July. Should I be upfront that I reneged on an offer or should I just say that I've been looking for employment these last few months?

As an aside, I'm already prepared to have the conversation with my former professor about this. I understand the implications of what I'm doing.

Thanks for any guidance you may have"

2. For an IT manager I'm not very technical. There is no technical skill that I have mastered. But I understand the basics of everything and how things are supposed to interact.
3. BUT what I am good at is managing people and personalities. I excel in maximizing the talent that I have around me. I'm very good at getting projects done under budget before deadlines. I'm born to be a leader and my style I feel allows my teams to work stress free.
4. So I technically don't run a department at my company, but I work directly with the CTO daily. I manage ALL of our vendors and infrastructure based projects (just migrated to 365 and Azure).

In the summer of 2019, I was wondering if it was worth it to do an internship abroad. I’m worried about the costs associated with it since I won’t get enough time to save money + it’ll be an unpaid internship.

Additionally, I was wondering if I should even get an internship abroad during my junior and senior year when I could stay in the states and do an internship with a big company here. Would I be wasting a potential opportunity if I chose to do an internship abroad in the summer?

If I intern abroad during the school year, it is likely it would take more time for me to graduate with my 4+1, but would it be worth it to that so I can get an internship in the states for the summer(s)?

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently graduated from a prestigious college in the northeast with my engineering degree, and got my EIT (on 2nd try). I interned at a  local engineering consulting firm in an industry I thought sounded interesting. The internship went well, and I think I did pretty well. Got good reviews and all that mess. I was promptly offered a job. Kind of the dream, right? (or at least, not the nightmare)  
Well, I've been doing the job as a salaried big boy for several months now and feel like I am in WAY over my head. First, the learning curve is just bonkers. That all makes sense to me given the huge amount of information I'm expected to retain, and I've actually enjoyed learning about most of it. I knew next to nothing about this industry and learning about it has been cool.  


But that's also the problem: I know next to nothing about this industry, and I feel as though I'm behind. Now I'm starting to get handed pretty hefty projects.  


It feels super goofy having just graduated from college and then getting sent places where I am supposed to be the ""expert"" that's being consulted. 9 times out of 10, the contractor I meet with has 100 times the experience and knowledge that I have, yet our client is paying my company thousands and thousands of dollars for me to go out there knowing little more than how to tie my shoes competently. I've avoided exposing myself as a total fraud thus far (barely), though my lack of confidence has resulted in weird interactions a few times, requiring the involvement of my superior.  


I have a very hard time making decisions and communicating because I have maybe 9% confidence in my knowledge-base. I dread making calls because I know I won't even know some of the terms they're using and fear looking like an idiot (especially when being listened to by other consultants in the office).   


I'm starting to suspect that the problem lies within myself rather than the company. I chronically don't have an opinion on what I'm consulting for, though I think at this point I should. When asked ""what should I do with this component?"" or ""is this installed right?"", I never know the answer because I'm indecisive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I genuinely lack the ""soft-skills"" required of a consultant. Even though I'm fairly social, I'm not really very good at work banter, nor do I know enough to have good shop talk.  I don't think quickly enough on my feet to be able to deliver helpful, concise answers or comments, and generally just end up say ""ok"" or ""yep"". In short - the shit-opposite of what a consultant should be. It leads to me feeling defeated all day at work. I'm just really not good at the client thing.  


Is there a moment where it ""clicks""? Do I just need to learn more in order for my own opinions to arise? Is ""being decisive"" something I can practice, or do I need to think about switching careers to something where my job isn't to deliver useful information to clients? I can't really just up and quit because companies weren't necessarily knocking down the door to hire me, and I've got to pay my rent. I'm getting good reviews at work still, but I can't help but shake the feeling that people are starting to realize that I'm not catching on as quickly as I should. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - am consulting engineer. My whole job is to know stuff and talk to clients. I don't know stuff and can't talk to clients. Looking for advice or shared experiences."

Couple of interesting projects under my belt that I felt comfortable putting on my resume, that company reps seemed to find interesting. 

Then I get here, and my life took a 180. I'm struggling in the most basic of courses. ICS33 has been hell so far, got an F on the first project because of the batch tests, only finished 3 questions on the midterm. Then, in CS111, a class I thought I'd be doing well in because I'm interested in visual computing, all the concepts are flying in one ear and out the other. Panicking because the midterm is on Wednesday, and despite help I'm just not getting it. With all of these courses, I don't even have enough time to work on my projects/resume. All the companies I sent my resumes for internships rejected me, which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that my final year is coming up, and without an internship before graduation I know my chances will get a lot harder. All of this completely sucked the joy out of programming, I get physically nauseous everytime I have to code something.  I have so many units left to take, and after 3 years of working my butt off at my CC, I don't think I have it in me to keep going. Plus I feel like I'm actually too stupid to do this for a living.

It’s been a while since some of us have taken an English class, so I wrote a list of paper-cleaning tips I got from my Writing Center internship. I've addressed the most common problems I see when consulting/peer reviewing papers. Hope they help!

 **1.** **Don’t use “fancy words” when you don’t have to.**

&gt;Utilize =&gt; Use  
&gt;  
&gt;Elucidate =&gt; Explain  
&gt;  
&gt;Efficacious =&gt; Effective

“Utilize” is one of the worse offenders. Just say “use.” It means the exact same thing, and it’s two syllables shorter!

&amp;#x200B;

 **2. Reduce phrases.**

I like to go through the paper sentence-by-sentence to find clusters that can be replaced by one word.

&gt;In the event that =&gt; if  
&gt;  
&gt;As well as =&gt; and  
&gt;  
&gt;In order to =&gt; to

&amp;#x200B;

 **3. Watch out for redundancy**

&gt;end result =&gt; result  
&gt;  
&gt;red in color =&gt; red  
&gt;  
&gt;plan in the future =&gt; plan

&amp;#x200B;

 **4. Delete these phrases and cut to your point.**

&gt; I̶t̶ ̶s̶h̶o̶u̶l̶d̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶e̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ no results were found.   
&gt;  
&gt;✔ No results were found.

You are already noting it!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;U̶p̶o̶n̶ ̶a̶n̶a̶l̶y̶s̶i̶s̶, oak trees were the most common.   
&gt;  
&gt;✔ Oak trees were the most common.

We already know that you've analyzed your data.  

&amp;#x200B;

 **5. This, it, and these:**

Because ""it"", ""this,"" and""these"" can be ambiguous, directly name the item you are referring to. 

&gt;T̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶s̶t̶u̶d̶y̶ found that frog populations are declining.

I've been applying to jobs like crazy since December in hopes that I'd have something lined up for after I get out of school, but as time goes on this desire is beginning to look more and more unrealistic. I say this because every job I've applied for has either not responded to me or responded with a rejection. I'm not feeling discouraged or upset, in fact I'm actually feeling really good about the future. Unfortunately, I don't exactly have the most significant work experience in the field. Over the previous summer I worked as an IT intern for a cable TV/internet company, and I've spent the last 2 and a half years working for my school's Help Desk as a Student Technician (we have a decent amount of autonomy for student employees). I also own some ubiquiti equipment (UniFi AP &amp; Switch, Edgerouter X), and a dell Poweredge R710. I was wondering if anyone had any advice as to what I should do next. I definitely want to become A+ certified, and I intend on doing ASAP (I honestly believe I'm competent enough to become certified with the knowledge I have now, minus some networking questions). This post went a bit longer than I wanted, I apologize for that. Also, thanks in advance for any tips/advice (I've posted here before and the responses I've received were incredibly helpful).

It felt like I had my life on track. I was going to college, had a decent part time job, and was in the running for an internship. But then I got in a 4 person car crash, 2 people close to me died suddenly, and I had a sudden surgery that has had a lasting health impact.

The part time job is over now, I had a job as a nanny to this little girl which I really enjoyed. But, the mom lost her job which means that I lose my job.

Because of the car crash, I didn't get to make it to the internship interview.

I don't know what to do. I'm on academic suspension for a year, have no jobs lined up, my mental health is shit, and my lease is about to expire at the end of the month. I'm so scared and I keep having flashbacks to my car crash and surgery (I was awake for it). I have been so sad due to loss. I'm going to a second session with a new therapist but because I only had a part time job, I don't have a lot of money or savings. (I have some, but I'm paying for college on my own)

Any advice? I'm in the US, by the way."
blt4iw,1,2019-05-07,Multiple internship offers conflict,_emma_stoned,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/blt4iw/multiple_internship_offers_conflict/,"College junior here. So I accepted an unpaid internship at a small company, but I had applied and interviewed to a few other places around the same time as that company, and right after accepting the internship I (unexpectedly, I thought after a few days they were never getting back to me) got an email on Friday from a bigger, well-known company offering me an unpaid internship where I'd basically be doing the same things as at the smaller company. The only difference is that the smaller company told me that they require their interns to get school credit while the bigger one does not, and my college makes students pay for school credit so I'd have to somehow get, at the minimum, $850 to work at the smaller company.

There are very few reviews on Glassdoor for both. For the smaller company, there was only one review and it was positive. The bigger company has more reviews, which say that it's overall a good internship but a bit impersonal.

I'm leaning towards the bigger company, but I already accepted the smaller company's internship, and I know a third unpaid internship, also small but is a part of a popular company and is run by a celebrity (like a person most people recognize), is supposed to get back to me in the next day or so. 

I know people will say not to take any unpaid internships, but I have little experience and I'll be staying with family over the summer so I can thankfully afford to do it just this once.

Any advice on what to do?"

bluhh6,201,2019-05-07,My sister an MBBS student is suffering workplace harassment and we need your help,chaosorderbalance,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bluhh6/my_sister_an_mbbs_student_is_suffering_workplace/,"My sister is a MBBS final year intern and her surgery HOD is harassing her on a daily basis. This HOD is a big name in medicine and is quite powerful. He is in his 50s, divorced and has a reputation of asking favors from female students. He demands the girls to go out for drinks with him and misbehaves with them. A girl in my sister's batch is apparently very close with him. She holds a grudge against my sister and one day she clicked pictures of my sister and her friends drinking with the boys and sent those to him. He called all of them in and yelled at them. Words like ""Randi"" were used by him. After that he took a girl's phone and texted my sister the next day, asking her and a few of her friends to go out for drinks with him to a shady bar. My sister replied by saying that she doesn't want to go out and that she hated the man. Her friends actually went with him because they were scared of what he would do. After that he asked her friends to stay away from my sister and stop talking to her. They all have turned against her because they are afraid that he won't sign their surgery log book. This will effectively disqualify them from pursuing Post graduation.

Yesterday he gave a casual leave to all her friends and asked my sister to work overtime. My sister is scared of what he might do next. She is scared that he won't sign her log books and try to destroy her career. He has done this to several students before.

We desperately need your help. We haven't told our parents yet. What should we do?

Edit1: I'm her brother.

Edit2: I will talk to her tomorrow and a few of her friends about this. Will keep you posted.

Update1: 

I just talked to my sister and here is some new info. This HOD has never tried to molest my sister personally. However, he has verbally abused her twice. First time was when he received the photos of them boozing. My sister was in a group with other male and female students. The second time was when he was texting her from a friend's phone asking her out for drinks. This friend is the one who holds a grudge against my sister. When my sister refused and said she hated the man and that she has her own self-respect he called from her phone and abused my sister. 

The boozing photos were taken in an apartment outside of the college. So they can only be used to threaten about informing our parents. Though she is scared of it, I'll ensure our parents support her.

This HOD has a bad reputation in college. Several doctors, especially the females in the college resent him and don't talk to him. The Dean is female and my sister thinks that she will be supportive. His ex-wife, who is a doctor, may also support but we don't know her and this is just a guess. 

My sister is entitled to 6 casual leaves per year and plans to come home this month. This guy has to approve the leave and she is going to apply for leave in the next 2-3 days. She is worried that he won't approve the leave that she has a right to take. The second problem is that he won't sign her log book because she rejected his invitation to drinks. A friend of my sister was harassed by him earlier and he didn't sign her log book for 6 months. He asked her to come to his cabin every day for six months and asked her tough surgery questions and as she failed, he kept rejecting her.

Her friend is supporting her and they have planned to write an anonymous mail to the Dean. I will talk to both in the evening and keep you posted.

Update2: Along with being the HOD, he is the head of internees, chairperson of college and hostel building in charge.

Update3: He has approved casual leaves without making any fuss about it. We are just trying to collect evidence and stay alert at the moment."
bluskr,2,2019-05-07,Working throughout the semester and staying alive-how?,Rotem_22_,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/bluskr/working_throughout_the_semester_and_staying/,"So, im on my 3rd year on mechanical engineering in a good university here. Mostly i see posts about internships, but not everywhere it works this way. Here once you finish and get your diploma, every job you try to apply demands you to have at least 2 years of experience. Plus, since we have to serve in the army for 3 years, theres no way not to work all this time. 
So here are some tips for anyone who feels thats just impossible(feel free to add your own)
1. Try findong a job on your 4th semester and start at summer, right after finals. Even if youre not that good, its a good time to start looking.
2. Be initiative. Some places hires students and has no idea what to do with them. You HAVE to take on projects, suggest improvements, show that you care.
3. Know a lot of people: even after you got your job. You will need good friends to help you with all those classes you had to skip. So join clubs, competitions, talk to people you never did before. Finished homework and you know no one really reads them? Send to semi- friends and make them friends. Next time they will help you im return.
4. Improve your english, no matter where you live, you have to communicate well.
5. Get ready to be somewhat lonely: i work ~100 km apart from home and uni. At word theyre mostly parents on their 30's. Im the only student on my team, the only female student on that area. If it wasnt for my super supportive bf, im not sure if i could make it.
6. Apply for anything. Come to interviews looking good but somewhat casual. Be confident. If you are stressed, your voice is breaking and hands are shaking, break the ice: thats my first interview, sorry im just a bit stressed and smile shyly. They will smile back. 

Thats it for now, hope that helps! Add your own tips :))"

After 5 years I finally finished my undergrad. I’ve decided to make a post documenting my retrospect (because what else am I supposed to do with my free time?). Since I’m from engineering there will be some stats and graphs. Enjoy.

**Background**


Initially I started out doing Biomedical Engineering, but after the first semester, realized there was no future, so I switched to Electrical with no penalty since it was an early switch. In retrospect I probably should have done Computer Engineering instead. Went to a school that is not the worst, but not the best (although I am seeing it get better each year).


**First Year (I’m Fresh, Man)**

Ahh first year, when motivations were high and burn out was but a whisper in the wind. Welcome to the big boy club they say (idk who says that). As is the case with most first years of engineering programs, you got your standard “weed them out” courses. We got your Calc 1,2 Linear Algebra, Physics 1,2 so on so forth. Little bit of overlap from what was taught in high school, a larger workload for sure. All in all I fared okay, did well in some courses, horrendous in others. Didn’t flunk out, no probation (not really an achievement but I will treat it as one) but no dean’s list. Unlike some of my peers I knew the importance of getting an internship early so I applied to a bunch of random places and got exactly 1 callback for something non-engineering related and proceeded to bomb the interview. By the end of first-year I had a sub-optimal GPA, no extra-circulars, and no internship. Ended up working on some side projects for the summer, and in a warehouse. The side projects were fun, the warehouse was not. To say I was asleep at the wheel for first year would be accurate.

**Second Year (Same Shit, Different Year)**


“Okay”, I tell myself, “time to get it together, I refuse to go back to that god forsaken warehouse, time to nut up”. Second year had some more bullshit courses but also some interesting circuit courses. And that’s where I shine. Excelled at the circuit and programming courses, did okay in everything else. Second Year went better in terms of grades, still no Dean’s List but an improvement overall. Joined a club at school, started participating in hackathons (Even got 1st place in one of them).” Okay”, I tell myself, this is the uptick I needed. The internship hunt is going to be better this year. So, I polished up my resume, went back into the internship hunt (applying online like a mad man), applied to more positions than last year. Attended my schools career fair, and guess what? All that hard work … didn’t pay off. I didn’t get shit. ""Fuck me, this is demoralizing, all this effort and I can’t even get one callback?""  I deferred one my courses (Field Theory) to the Spring because I knew I wasn’t going to pass during the regular semester. Ended up getting an A+. My Summer was spent doing that course work and working on more side projects. It was during second year my mental health started to take a turn for the worse…

**Third Year (Dark Times)**

Oh boy… Easily the darkest time in my life (so far). I had (still have) depression and anxiety coming out of high school, entering university, but it got really bad in third year. Like, really bad. Physically my body was deteriorating. I lost a lot of weight (I was disgusted looking at myself in the mirror everyday). I was not cooking proper food for myself (Oh, I should mention I was living by myself near campus for all 4 years of school). Often times I would just not cook anything and not eat because there was no motivation to do anything. This exacerbated the problems I was facing mentally. Zero self-confidence, constantly fatigued, anxiety attacks and dark thoughts. The constant rejections, and seeing friends having more success and enjoying life  while I was struggling started to wear down my spirit. The motivation to continue to do anything was depleted severally. This of course translated to abysmal performance in school (see the nose dive in the GPA chart). Let me tell you, it’s a time I will never forget. And a constant reminder to myself to never go back to that version of me. Now my school has a program called PEY (Professional Engineer Year), which is basically taking 16 months off between 3rd and 4th year to do an internship. 

Side Note: To me this is not ideal. The advantage to this is you get to do more meaningful work given you will be at a company for a longer time and get to experience what working as a full-timer is like. The disadvantage is you are basically stuck with a company for 16 months which doesn’t offer you variety (which is a key selling point for internships), So you better hope you like the work you are doing at this company. Spoiler alert : &gt;!I didn't like mine!&lt;

Given I had no internship experience up till now, and knew it was going to be very difficult to find a full- time job with no experience, I bit the bullet and went through the program. I ended up getting an internship at a semi-conductor company, doing validation work.

**PEY (Recovery + Life Crisis)**


In retrospect I think taking this time off between 3rd and 4th year was good. It gave me time to recover, physically and a little bit mentally. Physically I started eating better and started working out (got super ripped … okay not really). Mentally, working was far less stressful than school. In school there was no separation between school and life. Life was school. Go to lecture, go to labs, do homework, do lab work, study, rinse repeat. Weekends are just days without lectures. But when working a job once I was done my work the rest of the day was mine to do whatever I wanted, including weekends, and that was refreshing. Got to experience what working in an established team filled with people way smarter than me was like. The work was interesting, since I was learning a lot of new stuff very quickly. Things were looking pretty good… For about the first 4 months. Then the learning started to stall, and the work became very tedious. I was pretty much done (done as in bored) after 4 months. I continued for another 4 months. After that I decided to start looking for another internship and try to cut my contract early. No luck, no dice, no cake. I started to panic a bit. “What the hell”, I thought to myself, “I have experience now and I still can’t get an internship?! Is this what the full-time job search is going to look like?”. I ended up stayed for the full 16 months. But did some major self reflection, and an evaluation on where I wanted my career to go (more on this later). 

**Fourth Year (Home Stretch)**
    
Here we go, home stretch. One more year and we’re done. Going into it I had a much clearer focus of what I wanted to achieve and the steps I needed to take to get there. First semester if I wasn’t studying I was applying to jobs and vice versa. Admittedly a mistake I made in first semester was not applying to enough jobs. School wise I was doing well (way better than the past 3 years). I’m not sure if because in 4th year you are getting more freedom in course choices is what led to me doing well, but whatever it was things started clicking. What me and a bunch of my peers noticed was the workload of fourth year was considerably higher than the past 3 years and senioritis was real. End of first semester didn’t get any interviews. Spent the Winter break working on side projects. Second semester I hit the job applications hard and started tracking my job applications… that was maybe not a good idea lol because looking at the spreadsheet was depressing. Applied to over 100 jobs between Canada and the US. From January to February I was getting absolutely nothing in terms of callback. Then all of a sudden, I start getting a few call-backs. One after another in a short span of time (It's like, where were all of you at the start of the semester?!). I told myself, “It's happening!. Stay calm. All you need is one to go well. All it takes is one”.  Did some interviews, the one I thought I did well on did not convert, the one I thought I did poorly on ended up converting to an offer (go figure). Securing an offer before graduation was a huge relief. Allowed me to focus on just school and my final year design project. Got my iron ring (Did anyone else find the ceremony super cult-ish?) Ended up doing decently well on the design project and exceptionally well in academics for the term (highest GPA I’ve ever achieved).  

**Career Focus**

A lot of mistakes were made is the best way to sum it up. Early on I was obsessed with hardware design. All I wanted to do was hardware design. I would accept nothing but design for myself. I thought board design, or IC design, something cool like that. Definitely not testing, or software or anything like that oh no, I want to be a designer. This was a mistake. Don’t do this. The mistake wasn’t that I was focused on hardware, but that I was only focused on one thing. Limiting myself and my options to only one thing. Especially early on, having not experienced the “real world” limiting yourself to one domain is a hindrance. What I should have done is kept an open mind and tried to gain more real-world experience of different domains. Had I done this I would have had a lot more available to me. Ironically as I got older and started to learn more, I realized I didn’t want to do pure hardware. Now with that being said I think going after breadth early on is important as it opens you up to more options, but depth becomes important as you progress and narrow down what field you think you would enjoy long term. A lot of this clarity about where I wanted to go came during my internship. I evaluated what I genuinely find interesting and what I felt I was good at. Once I figured that out I researched what the scope was for a career in that field, and what the requirements were. Based on that I started to build my knowledge and resume around those requirements.

**Stats**

The 2 figures presented are a visual representation of my GPA throughout the 8 semesters (figure 1) and snapshot of my job application efforts during my last semester (figure 2).
 
[**GPA**](https://imgur.com/a/cz4Rhdo)



[**Job Search Snapshot**](https://imgur.com/a/Qr8JGMe)

A snapshot of some of the positions I applied to. I stopped applying after I got my offer. 

**Conclusion**

All in all, this has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my entire life (so far). Definitely some permanent damage to me (physically, mentally, spiritually). But I think I came out of it a much better person. All in all, 6/10. Maybe I should have just done accounting or comp sci instead."

blvn3i,22,2019-05-07,I'm in marketing. How do I get out?,KronoLite70,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/blvn3i/im_in_marketing_how_do_i_get_out/,"I need some career advice here on what I can do to get out of my field. M24. I started college as a nursing major. I really wanted to help people, and I enjoyed what I did. However, I moved out of the house when I was 19, and started living with my now fiance several states away. As I began the second half of nursing school, the hours required simply weren't possible for me. I was working 52 hours a week at three different jobs to make sure we could pay bills, so once nursing required me being at campus on all weekends and have unpaid internships, I had to bail. I had a minor in public relations because I've always been decent at public speaking and writing, and once I dropped out of nursing I chose the communications major, and was able to finish it within a year. 

When I chose to step away from nursing, I was very worried that I would have a hard time getting a job. If you're an RN, you can get a job nearly immediately after graduation. For a communications major, it's not nearly as guaranteed. I applied to a million jobs, and ended up getting a marketing job in an insurance area. 

Here's the dilema I'm at right now. The company is growing at a very fast rate, and I was able to get in at a pretty good time. The marketing department is really me and my boss at the moment, but we have applications out for several other assistants. Within the past 8 months, I've worked very hard to get us caught up on all the big plans my boss and the COO of the company have, and have been promoted three times for doing a good job with what I'm tasked with. I've done email marketing, print design, event planning, any really anything else they've asked me to help with, including tech. I get along very well with my coworkers and bosses, they trust me and have talked quite a bit about how glad they are that I'm here and how much I will be rewarded for helping them grow — and I know they mean it. 

But I hate marketing. I'm a big believer in the phrase ""If you need to market it, it's because people don't need it."" I'm very against social media, but I'm the social media manager. We're a small business solutions provider, so all our content day after day is how we can make people more money. Everything is about money, and as someone who lives very simply and just focuses on basics in my life, it's very against what I actually believe and practice in my own life. I use a VPN so that other people in marketing can't track my IP. I use 5 different adblockers so that no ads can ever get to me. I avoid every ad that I can and do not use social media. I got through college without even having a cell phone because I don't agree with it. 

How the hell do I get out of this now? I hate saying that I feel an obligation to my workplace, but my coworkers and bosses have legitimately been very good to me and plan on using me to help their company grow. Were I to leave, they would be set back very far since I do a lot of tasks that I should honestly be paid more for, but haven't worked there long enough to have reflected in my paycheck. If they were to look to hire someone brand new for what I do, it would be a bigger price range. 

But outside of how I reconcile that to my coworkers, how do I actually get a job in another field? All I have for portfolio and resume materials is just marketing based. All my certifications, work accomplishments, and portfolio materials are based around marketing and graphic design. Neither of those are fields I am interested in pursuing. 

The other concern is money. I live in the Chicago area, and am recently engaged. My current position is 45k a year at entry level, and from what I can gather from my boss, my next promotion would put me somewhere between 55 and 60k. Money is not a big motivator for me, I generally put extras into saving, or usually donate a decent amount of it to charities that I support. However, I definitely couldn't take a pay cut without really affecting my fiance and me. I'm honestly at the point where I'm applying to garbage disposal positions that pay around that area, just so I can avoid the toxic wasteland of marketing. 

I apologize for the giant wall of text, but I'm just really not sure what to do and I don't know how to switch my entire career trajectory, but I definitely want to before it's too late."

I was told that I would be working as a junior developer but they put me up with Oracle SOA developer. I have never made Oracle SOA suite before and I have been struggling a lot ever since I joined (March of this year) however i'm heading off for masters this fall so this is a temporary position so even tho I hate this job, i'm doing it anyway for the money. Now my boss told me that I need to do Oracle SOA certification within a month... But firstly, it costs too much I am saving up the salary I get for college, secondly I have zero interest and this is definitely not something i'll be pursuing in future. I would either go for software developer or graphic designer. So even if I do the certification it will be useless for me after I leave in August. Before taking this internship I already told my boss that I wont be staying for long as i'm going for masters and that's when we agreed that it would be better for me to just be hired as an internee. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so new to the world of career that its stressing me out.  I was also hoping if someone would be willing to keep in touch with me here? Because I really need guidance when it comes to working. When it comes to being a student I know exactly what to do and what to expect from myself and the professor.. But when it comes to working.. lol im clueless."
blvyqa,4,2019-05-07,I am having a very thorough background check done by the police for a City IT internship position - What is typical of these checks? (Kansas),mynewthrowaway47,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/blvyqa/i_am_having_a_very_thorough_background_check_done/,"So, I applied for an internship for the City's IT department and was accepted.  In the interview they told me I'd have to have a background check done since I would be doing work in police stations, and I figured it wouldn't be much.  First there was just an online screening, which I passed fine.  

Then I was sent a bunch of documents I had to sign and get notarized, authorizing a police background investigator to essentially dig through my entire life.  They asked for my social media accounts, so I of course provided my Twitter and Facebook (even though I haven't used facebook in a year).  Judging by everything I read and filled out It seems like it would be the background check a police officer would have to get.

I presume this is really only to make sure I'm not a violent person or a criminal(I'm definitely not).  The only thing other than a speeding ticket was an underage possession ticket for holding a beer when I was tailgating a football game in Iowa 2.5 years ago.

I don't know why, but I'm just really nervous about this whole thing.  Does anyone here have experience with this type of background check? What do they look for?"
blw5sn,1,2019-05-07,Is IT the right field for me still?,poja9,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/blw5sn/is_it_the_right_field_for_me_still/,"Long story short, I jumped into IT because I've always been curious with technology that we use all the time day-to-day and I'd always been decent and finding answers/solutions to my questions/problems related to technology.

I was lucky enough to receive a paid internship with a technical school, (which I also attended) which led to full-time employment and now I'm one of the lead IT individuals responsible for technical support and network administration.

This is all well and good, but I've been thinking about my future (which won't be here as I've capped) and I can't quite pin down if I want to continue into IT or not. I've been exploring other options within IT, and they all seem to be contracted or related to freelance work (or require a level of education I'm terrified I won't be able to afford in the long-run). I don't want this - I want something that's secure and guaranteed (at least more than contract work). Is IT the right field for me still? I've admittedly grown tired of the constantly advancing field which requires I constantly pour money into education just to keep up. I don't want a position rife with stressful responsibility either and it seems if you aren't into programming/development/engineering this doesn't really work out.

All of the roles I've researched in IT generally involve being in one of three areas:

1. Tech Support.
2. Heavy responsibility (admin/pm/manager etc.)
3. Engineering (something related to programming which is either outsourced or contracted).

Admittedly, I didn't really look forward into IT down the line. I just thought ""I like computers, I'm good with them, I'll get a few certs and be on my way."" but I'm coming to find it isn't this simple. I don't want to be in school the rest of my life - more accurately I don't want to keep dumping money / time into something that might not be as secure as I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I have 4 certs: CompTIA A+ and NET+, and Juniper JNCIA and JNCIS-ENT. I can't tell if I'm looking for the wrong jobs (actively looking) or if IT just isn't it for me.

blwm15,1,2019-05-07,I graduate in 7 months and I'm kind of terrified.,murray_hitchock,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/blwm15/i_graduate_in_7_months_and_im_kind_of_terrified/,"I graduate with a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering this December. About 5 months ago, I received a full-time offer from a start up in town that built, changed, and maintained websites for local businesses. Everything was fine until they ran out of money and decided not to pay me for 2 months of work, and it wasn't until I threatened legal action that I received roughly 2/3 of what they actually owed me. I cut my losses and moved on, trying to think of it as an internship rather than me getting completely fucked over.

I decided to start the job search again about a week ago, having just completed the spring semester and a lot more time to research / apply for different jobs. My resume is fairly solid, I would say. I've got a good work history (never been fired, had a job since I was 15, etc.) and I feel like I've got some good projects going (synthesizer made with a Dragon-12 microcontroller board, a college football rpg written in java, and a system of motorized bots that are able to map a room 2-dimensionally). My GPA isn't tremendous (2.9) but if my GPA was based solely on grades I received from embedded systems / software engineering classes, it'd be close to a 3.5. Those two areas have been hands down my favorite areas of study over the past 5 years.

But man, I'm terrified. I don't lack for confidence in my own abilities. I know that, given time and development, I should be a pretty good engineer one day. It's getting people to notice that scares me. Are my projects stupid? Does anyone care? I worked full-time throughout my degree and have been married for half of it so I didn't really have time to join clubs at school and whatnot. I don't have much to put on my resume aside from my projects and bullet-points of things I think I'm good at. 

What's your advice to someone like me, just starting out and wanting to break into this area? Have any of you been in a similar position? What can I do to make myself stand out?"

Long-time lurker here, and I'm going to be a senior in college. The time is coming for me to start to apply/look for jobs after I graduate, but I am not really sure where to start.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My skills and experience: Proficient in Python, Familiar with AWS and Azure, Ansible, Docker, mySQL, nginx. These are all skills that I have picked up from my internship now. My last internship involved a lot of simple help desk tasks, such as working with Active Directory, setting up an FTP server, managing Atlassian Suite, responding to helpdesk tickets, and shadowing the DevOps engineers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had two internships throughout college, and I'm still with my second internship and planning to stay until I graduate. This company is great. I've learned a lot and from everyone that I've talked to here, they always offer a full time spot once an intern here graduates. So for now, I have the possibility of staying here full time. The only thing that would hold me back is that I would not want to live in this area.  My work revolves around a lot of different things, ranging from managing and deploying docker containers to writing ansible playbooks and modules. I get a lot of exposure to different cloud technologies here and I'm slowly able to start utilizing them. This summer, I am planning on going for my AWS Solutions Architect certificate with the help of my manager and the company has agreed to pay for it as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would you guys think would be the best roles to look for? In the New York City area. Thank you."
blyodc,1,2019-05-07,"This maybe a long-shot, but are there any English/Spanish (or just Spanish) books with Programming or IT PM Jargon/terms anyone can recommend?",JigglyPuffer_stuffer,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/blyodc/this_maybe_a_longshot_but_are_there_any/,"Hello, I'm currently working on graduating this summer and starting an internship as a Testing Engineer. I came to realize two major things: 

&amp;#x200B;

* I will no longer be in school,  which means now I have way more time to really work on things that I want. I already have a few courses in Udemy waiting for me (JavaScript, Shell, Golang, and Git)
* I have English and Spanish fluency I would like to put into use within my field.
* I would like to travel/live abroad.
* I just received a CompTIA Project+ cert (kind of like Jr. PMP,) am planning on future PMP or Prince2

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that said, I'm finding a lot of difficulty translating a majority of the technical terms used in this field into Spanish. I have heard conversations where some terms stay the default English, but I was wondering if any Spanish speaking redditors out there can give me a hand with finding a book that gives you technical translations in both English and Spanish? Even a recommendation for a programming or Project Management book in Spanish will go a long way.

I do plan on moving (most likely permanently) to Spain within the next 6 years and continue working so the preference is to connect to that region's language, though I am completely open to Latin American Spanish as well (it's a growing market)."
blyrpg,7,2019-05-07,Should I push for a $2 raise instead of $1?,aprilfades,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/blyrpg/should_i_push_for_a_2_raise_instead_of_1/,"So I’ve been working as an intern at this company for 6 months as of yesterday. I’ve really been enjoying it, even though it’s largely IT support, because I like knowing that I can do this job and do it well. In my major, cyber engineering (basically computer science with lots of calculus, general engineering classes, and a handful of electrical engineering classes), my peers have a real passion for this work. They go home and do this stuff for fun. It’s always given me a bit of ‘imposter syndrome’ because honestly, I’m just doing this to get a job. I don’t have many side projects or anything. So this job is basically a good reminder that I’m not useless lol. 

So I’m working for a pretty small IT team. Me and another girl are the first interns that most of them have ever worked with on this team, so having interns is a pretty new experience for a lot of them, including my boss. 

We’ll call the other intern CG for crazy girl, which she kinda is. She’s really smart, but seems to have a lot of attitude issues and doesn’t get along well with everyone. Lots of drama, which I’ve noticed doesn’t work well in our environment. 

When I started, the only other intern, CG, told me that because she’d be training me, she got a raise, from $15 to $17. Cool, that’s fair. She was there for 2 months before me, and training is a pretty big task. But she didn’t actually train me much at all; it was largely another coworker of mine that did. But I started at $15 an hour. 

Four months later, I’m covering for another coworker that had been fired, and  I’m matching and exceeding the number of tickets some other full-timers are completing, while only being part-time (my boss has admittedly told me). My boss told me he likes the work I’ve been doing and has me slated as a hire when I graduate next spring. He also mentioned he’d work to get me a raise when I hit 6 months because he wants to show me that he’s serious about me staying. Cool, that’s great! 

Im at 6 months now. CG was let go a month ago because she’s given a lot of indications that she didn’t intend to stay on our team, like looking for other work over the summer (which I don’t think is wrong, but she was taking time off for interviews and orientation for her new job and TELLING our boss this, which I think was the real mistake). She’s had boundary issues with people (like rubbing a coworker’s head, general oversharing of her life, etc). 

My review was today, and my boss let me know he’s giving me a raise to $16. I’ll admit I’m pretty disappointed. I was expecting *at least* $17 like CG had already been receiving. The past few months have been really busy (with our only desktop support person and CG both being let go), and I’m just disappointed that my raise doesn’t even match the wage CG had at 2 months. 

Does it seem like something worth bringing up? I was so surprised during my review that I didn’t challenge it. But I’m worried about my position here; I’m just an intern, very easily replaceable. I’m not entitled to anything. It seems like my boss hires interns now for extra support while also evaluating whether they’d be a good fit for the team. If not (like in CG’s case), he ends the internship and gets a new intern with more long-term potential for the team. Our new intern just started yesterday, and I’m doing a lot of his training when I’m here. 

Please tell me if anything here is unclear or if you need any more context. I lack a lot of experience, so it’s hard for me to know if I’m being unreasonable here. I appreciate any guidance anyone can offer. Thank you for reading!"

People who were bad at their majors, what did you do?",kloocoo,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/blzdgp/going_to_graduate_next_semester_with_a_degree_in/,"Background - I’m 22. 

I suck enough where I pass my classes but my GPA isn’t good enough for the big 4 and mid-level firms. I’m automatically rejected when I put my GPA in the application (currently around a 3.18, major GPA is around a 2.8-2.9). They usually cut it at 3.3+ cumulative and even if you’re a 3.3 you better know someone to get your foot in the door. 

I enjoy applying accounting to business (I’m one of the few that actually appreciated cost accounting) but I cannot get the grades for financial reporting. But I also don’t want to go immediately to the private industry because from all the advice given to me, it’s like being pigeonholed. Of course, I don’t know if any of this is true because the school I go to really emphasizes starting a career in public accounting.

I’m so exhausted and at this point, I’m being burnt out so much that I’m regretting pursuing a degree in accounting. Couple that with the thoughts of trying to get a CPA (what if I fail the exam with how poorly I’m doing with the mock tests in my classes?) and the 2 grand I’d need to spend in CPA study materials and certification (I’m already near poverty level) and I’m just so lost on what I should do. I know the firms can pay for the study materials + certification but I don’t even know if I can get into the firms! So if I have to pay for the CPA, it would be my money I’m spending...

On the positive note - I have internships under my belt (none in public). I’ve worked all the way through college in positions outside of accounting (which explains the low GPA). I have a pretty good case of doing good work for the companies I’ve worked for. I have internships in internal audit and government. 

But I’m honestly so lost on what I should do...I’m starting to hate my major and I cannot switch anymore because I would run out of financial aid and I can’t pay for college out of pocket. I also just want to graduate already. 

I enjoy the data analytics side of accounting A LOT. Also being adept at SQL and loving it is pretty much the only thing I’ve got going for me over other accounting candidates. 

I’m seriously unsure if me not passing my exams well enough so I can get a decent B average is an indication of how poorly I’ll do in this profession. Because why would the firms care about GPA so much? 

So, really what’s my path after graduation? 

1) pursue a Masters in Accounting and reset the GPA and become CPA eligible but pay 40k for school? I heard the MAcc is useless unless you want to reset your GPA and/or become CPA eligible. Mind you, 40k is really a lot for me (even with qualifying for federal aid)... and I don’t have anyone who can help me out. 

2) pursue a job outside of accounting (wouldn’t even know how to start with this one)

3) work first in accounting (any place that decides to hire me) then pursue my CPA

4) just chill the fuck out and just let life decide what I should do when the time comes? 

Option 4 is sort of a joke but it’s also a viable alternative because maybe I’m being too paranoid about my future and taking all of this too seriously. I don’t know! 🆘 

All help is appreciated :(

I made a 48 on my first intro CS course‘s midterm and thought about dropping CS altogether and had a 2.5 GPA my first semester of college. After that, I worked super hard to get better and ended my undergrad career last week a 3.47, 4x semester honors, 3 internships, a full time offer in the Bay Area, and graduating in 4 years exactly.  

I don’t consider myself to be super smart, but I do know how to work my ass off when I have to, and sometimes that’s all it takes. Even in my last semester, I wasn’t sure I’d graduate on time because I was struggling with my Linear Algebra course and made a 40 on one of the exams. I studied for a month and got around an 80% on the final and ended up with a B- in the class that I thought I’d end up failing. 

If you’re really passionate about something, nothing can stop you from achieving your goals! Just keep going at it!

EDIT:
In case anyone’s interested in reading a bit more about my journey, I wrote a Medium article on New Year’s which summarizes my experience which you can find in the comments.

I’ll likely write a follow-up article shortly after graduation maybe going into more details about every year I was in college, and different things I dealt with."

Are there better options for a limited budget? I don't mind spending a little more now if that makes me hold onto this PC a little longer

Other processor I found was the Ryzen 2600, but I fear that I might have compatibility issues, plus the fact that I can't find a motherboard as cheap and good as the B360 

As for the RAM there's the Ballistix Sport which a friend recommended me, but from what I can see [here](https://ram.userbenchmark.com/Compare/HyperX-Fury-DDR4-2400-C15-2x8GB-vs-Crucial-Ballistix-Sport-LT-DDR4-2400-C16-2x8GB/3587vs3638) the Fury is slightly better, and in my country both are at the same price

BACKGROUND:

I am almost 31, not a citizen of the United States.

I did my undergrad in computer science from a top 5 (US) , did a software engineering gig for 3.5 years at a fortune 500-1000 company and then went back to my home country to start a company.

After failing at my first venture, I made an attempt to move to venture capital and decided to pay thrice the in-state tuition (international student) Masters of Finance course at a not so well known school ( stupid move, in hindsight ). I am about to graduate within a month.

I have struggled to get any interviews for core business-finance roles, including Investment Associate, any position remotely associated with valuations, let alone Ventures Associate positions. The only thing I could manage was a short unpaid internship at a Private Equity search fund, which was super easy to score. The failure to score legit interviews could be attributed to a combination of reasons : 1) simply not enough valuable experience 2) Not a very 'venture capital' worthy school 3) No VISA sponsorship from core-finance firms, largely due to the trump immigration rhetoric 4) a clumsy resume in all directions 5) Age factor

I naturally began gravitating back towards tech ( where visa sponsorship is relatively easier ) in the latter half of last year, researching on quantitative trading ( fuelled in part by my coursework in econometrics) and playing around with trading strategies on Quantopian. I must concede that I am still scratching the surface when it comes to quant or mathematical finance.

Owing to my experience in Software development, I do get approached by mostly H1B sponsoring consultancy firms for various IT positions like Business Analyst, Software Engineering. Although many consultancy firms do place you decently, a) I did not make the transition to business to revert to IT jobs in the first place b) IT consultancies are notorious for paying 70% of market rate to a consultant c) some, if not many, firms are involved in shady practises like faking experience.

&amp;#x200B;

After graduation, I would have about 3-4 months to get a job and maintain legal status in the US

Also, for what it's worth, I look after my family's passive investments in a sizeable commercial real estate portfolio. However, I do not mention it on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

MY QUESTION:

Given my scattered resume and time constraints, what's your advice on scoring a Quant interview? I am trying to take out as much time as possible for side-projects on ML and going through Quantopian's quant finance lectures. In any case, due to personal reasons, my priorities right now are to stay in the US. So any suggestions on an alternative path to Quant  Research or even a career choice you seem fitting, are most welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Attaching redacted resume.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : 31 year old with an experience scattered across software engineering and startups and a recent masters degree in Finance, looking for feedback on resume for Quant Research roles. Have 3-4 months to find a job. Any suggestions for an alternative career path, leading to Quant or something else, most welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to get some opinions on how people here feel about taking an internship or extending an internship after graduating. My current situation is I am graduating this Spring for my degree in Computer Science but was only offered an extension of my internship from a company I interned at out of state. When discussing whether a full time position would be available they had only offered me an extension of my internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would taking an extension of an internship seem strange to do despite graduating? Obviously, the biggest downfall would be the pay difference, but would you take an extension of an internship if you really enjoyed the tech and the culture of the workplace with a possibility of a full-time conversion later down the road?"

I started the job because it was literally the only job offer I had been given after more than 2 months of applying and interviewing for summer jobs. But today I got an email from a company I interviewed with about a month ago saying that I was one of the top 2 candidates for the position, and that they would let me know tomorrow if they wanted to give me a job. This is a programming internship, so for someone currently majoring in computer science, this position would be amazing. Plus, it pays nearly double and is full time.

Clearly, the internship is the better job, but I'm worried about the repercussions of quitting a job I just started. I feel like an asshole making my boss go through the hiring process all over again, but other than that, is there anything else that could hurt me? Is there anything I should be aware about?

Thanks for any responses."

About a month ago, I received a call from the one federal agency that I have always wanted to work for saying that I was selected to be a mechanical engineering trainee for their facility in Texas starting in January 2020. To make matters even sweeter, I would have the possibility of conversion to a full time position in August 2020 once I graduate. Without question, this was truly the happiest moment I have ever experienced in my young life. Better than passing Cal 2. Better than launching any rocket I made. Better than even getting that acceptance letter. The only thing I needed to do left was maintain my GPA above a 3.2 after this semester to keep my position.

However, today I learned that I will not be passing my mechatronics class this semester. Not only that, but this will revoke my dream job because of this one failing class. I did all of the math based on the course's syllabus and I would not have enough to even get a -C. I've done fairly well on all of the other classes but this one class will be my downfall. This one class helped me learn so much about electrical systems and devices used in the industry while also allowing me to refine my coding and robotic skills. I learned more in this class than I did in most of my past courses. Yet, this is the one class that I just could not pass a single test while everyone else did with flying colors. Like most students, I spent countless hours studying for these tests and I keep earning failing grades. 

I understand this may sound to be a broken record but I worked my ass off to get my dream job. I took up 5 internships starting in 2015 with that same agency. I spent countless all-nighters studying for my classes just to pass them. I even had 6 anxiety attacks and freaking counting to this day from the immense pressure to perform well. My mental health is literally disintegrating to the point where i can't stop shaking since last week and oh man has it gotten much worse since I learned of the current circumstances. I could honestly not believe that I'm going to lose the job that I have always wanted because of one. Single. Class. 

I'm a freaking first gen student who grew up speaking no English and nearly dropped out in junior year of high school to work in freaking landscaping. It took me years to get to where I was 5 hours ago and now it is all crumbling down because of one class."

bm42vr,1,2019-05-08,Stuck in a power struggle between my manager and his boss,personpeople78,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bm42vr/stuck_in_a_power_struggle_between_my_manager_and/,"So I recently started working at this new job as an intern. It’s a really nice company and the internship is highly sought after. You have to really be the best in your field to get chosen for it.

Not long after I started, I found out that my supervisor(who manages a division) had been looked over for the management position of the whole department despite everyone in the company all agreeing that he should’ve gotten the job because of his long years of service and extensive knowledge of the company and the field. They instead hired a new guy who arrived just 4 weeks before I did.

The problems started when the new guy started directly contacting staff under my supervisor’s charge and asking them to do specific tasks. We know he’s the big boss so it’s not easy to refuse a request from him. He has his own staff and interns so he doesn’t need to use people from lower divisions. Many people think he just does it to show that he’s the boss and can exercise authority over everyone. Sometimes my supervisor will ask me to do something but I have to decline and tell him I’m out for the day because the new manager has me doing external projects for him. The same for other people as well. 

Other times the new manager will call a meeting  with all the interns and disseminate new tasks without informing any of their direct supervisors. My supervisor is a good man and I respect him, but I can see he gets annoyed when I prioritize the manager’s orders over his. I’ve seen my supervisor and the new manager walk past each other several times without even glancing at each other, much less saying hello.  

During the vacuum period between when the old manager retired and before the new manager arrived, my supervisor was the acting manager of the department and subsequently moved to the manger’s office which is bigger and has its own special amenities not found in other offices. My supervisor hasn’t moved out of this office and this has forced the new manager to use a smaller, less glamorous office. Whenever we have enlarged department meetings, they’re both civil with each other but it stops at that. They’re not friends and there’s clearly a lot of tension between them.

There are many things I could mention but I think you get the idea. I feel like I’m stuck in a tug of war between two opposing forces and I don’t know or even want to pick a side to go with."

I was asked to do an internship with the company I currently work for and have been doing so for almost 5 months with another intern. Recently, a job opening came up for the position, but only one spot. 

I was pretty confident after the interviews because they went well and the projects I was working on were much more complex than what the other intern was doing and I was excelling. Plus, I have 7 years experience in the industry and the other intern only had about a year, which basic requirements for the job is 3 years preferred. Also I have a degree related to the job. We are similar in age. 

Despite this he got the job over me. I was given no reason as to why. They said i do amazing work and ultimately they hope to keep me, but couldn't promise anything and they I interviewed very well.

Now he is supposed to work on his new projects with the mentor that we shared. They were vague in what the job was during interviews and I didnt know this was the case. I learned his new responsibilities today, when my mentor told me. I have actually been doing the work for my mentor that the other intern, now official employee, was supposed to be working on for the new project. 

It's only been a week, but I do not want to be doing the work of the person that got the job over me. At this point, I no longer want to be apart of the internship and feel disrespected and not truly valued. My mentor had no impact on the decision and seems to want to work with me more.

I'm considering resigning and going back to my old position and very much considering looking for employment elsewhere. What all should I consider? Is this the right move? Should I wait it out in case another position opens? Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: Didnt get the job that was given to another inter with much less experience. Now, working on his new projects unknowingly that he should be working on. Feel disrespected and looking to potentially resign and go back to my old position."
bm5ysk,17,2019-05-08,"My ex, who I thought I would be married to by now, was just recently married off in an arranged marriage. The bride is everything I could never be.",livingonsweetnuthing,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/bm5ysk/my_ex_who_i_thought_i_would_be_married_to_by_now/,"He broke up with me over a year ago, together for just two weeks shy of four years together, and we were essentially engaged w/o the ring. Our finances were tied together, been living together, bought a car together, adopted a cat together and...like even telling people we were planning on getting married. And I'm not talking about, ""o yeah, we're getting married someday"", I'm talking about we were consistently looking at our medical care plans and figuring out the best timing to get together.   


He broke up with me three times, each time saying he was breaking up for some logistical reason (like, it's either break up or do long distance so that he can attend x school sort of thing) before returning back. It took an intervention with his family to get him to come home to me and say we were really done. That he never loved me, stopped being attracted to me, and that he already sent his resignation e-mail before speaking to me. We talked some more, we ended in good terms, and he was gone. Moved out and everything the same day.   


I know I am fortunate that he left me his two paychecks, his father paid for my rent for awhile, and generally left me with a lot of household stuff. I am thankful that I spent nearly four years with someone who was caring and loving. It hurts that he felt that he could only ""really"" break up with me by putting me down, when I was in a pain flare up bedridden and just so utterly low in life. No money, no more savings, unemployed in chronic pain with no prospects. That one moment doesn't define my relationship, nor does it mean I was somehow so lacking and horrible as a partner that I made him fled to his abusive family.   


They have manipulated and harmed him physically, emotionally, and financially. Have cut him off with no support for months at a time, gained illegal access to his bank account, constantly threatened him in some form, have physically harmed him, and just so horrible and mean to him. But, I also know that when he left, he really wanted to make it work. He wanted to be that son that his family wanted.  


I'm latinx, queer, trans, non-binary, disabled, mentally ill, fat, and broke. I am nothing that they would have ever accepted into their family. It doesn't matter that before my fibromyalgia manifested at the latter part of my college years, I was managing a high GPA in a well-ranked university, did part time work, an internship, and two volunteer gigs at any one time. I was that person who did it all, I was the one who handled multiple projects on campus and other students would go to for support. I was the one who introduced him to the queer community, made him acknowledge he was queer himself, and was just...the gateway to so many queer friendships. I pushed him to get his first job, convince him to go to therapy, helped him figure out life goals, and...i don't know, just everything. No matter how low I feel right now, I know that I was a good partner to him. I never would have taken the money if I wasn't suddenly left with nothing but disabling pain with no diagnosis (at the time, I am currently now diagnosed).  


He left me. Then lost weight, went thru the career track his parents decided for him, and now he is married as of a few weeks ago. Arranged marriage, but still.   


And she's thin, pretty, feminine, punjabi...probably straight cis abled from a ""good"" family...and I'm still everything that his family hated about me. Yeah, I made huge strides in my life --got that diagnosis, made big changes to my life for my physical health, kicked out an abuser from the family, and still the family leader in managing so much of the daily poverty-drama of my family. But I am still so much of a failure. I haven't graduated, I haven't gotten a steady job, I haven't been ""cured"" (there's not even a cure for fibro!).   


I don't want to get back with him, I know he wasn't the person I thought he was, and that his decisions don't reflect on me. But...seeing those wedding pictures pop up in my social media was just so hard ya know? Realizing that on paper, he is finally what he wanted to be, what his family wanted him to be. I want him to be happy, I hope he is happy. I guess I am self conscious that his happiness looks like he rid everything that was ever associated with me, and I'm just his dirty secret that he spent nearly four years cultivating and loving only to discard when I was too disabled and ugly to carry on.   


I am not the same person I was when we got together...and I am so upset that I really have been trying to be better. I been trying to tackle my disability, to get working, to be there for my family, to not be a burden, but my progress is so slow and that's humiliating. He never would have been happy with me, and I know that's okay, but it feels more like, no one could ever be happy with me. I offered him everything I could ever give at my best and my absolute worst (when I sometimes struggled even getting myself to the bathroom!), and he left even when he promised me his everything. He still is my only partner so far, we were each other's first for everything, but I am everything that he needed to get rid of to get the life he has now. It hurts to think that I'm not even a thing that could ever be awknowledged in his life now, I never expected me being like mentioned really post-breakup really, but that I cannot ever be known or awknowledge cause I was seen as so beneath him is just hurting. Like, what the fuck did I ever do that could be so shameful? Nothing but just being something his family couldn't ever accept."

Since next semester that starts from September is known to be brutal (7 courses and 32 credits), 

I was planning to take one or two summer part-time courses in advance and get an exemption for those courses. 

This morning, I got an email from the company I applied that I got the internship.

The thing is.. it's only for 3 months and the company is super far away from my house. 

It takes 1 hour and 40 mins to get there (I don't have a car), so 3 hour and 20 mins commute every day.

I seriously can't decide because I'm afraid because I might fail a few courses next term if it's too hard.. and as an international student, I can't fail any course since it could lead to a visa problem. 

But It's also true that you learn a lot from the internship. It's a developer position too.

Unsure as to whether or not my guidance counselor will emphasize this in her essay. in the one year i've had her (previous godsend guidance counselor left :/ ) i've established myself as one of the most unreliable, unstable and uncaring students. i have not left a good impression  on many in this school, especially my counselor after disciplinary action at the beginning of the year (does not show on transcript but had an immense negative impact on my grade).

&amp;#x200B;

as i get good test grades but never participate/do homework the majority of my teachers think of me as apathetic  (i'd describe it as conditionally engaged, i'm either fully honed in or in another world). that being said ill get my LORs from physics and english teachers,  as my occasional participation and explanations in class have been enough to gain their favor.

I grew up with every other privilege you could possibly need to do well: I'm a relatively attractive white guy with wealthy, supportive parents who covered every penny of my college tuition, an above average IQ, and no mental health issues outside of ADHD.  So I'm convinced that if I didn't have ADHD, I'd at least have an apartment and a decent job.

Since high school, I've had a pattern when it comes to certain pieces of work that I don't find interesting.  I've recently repeated this pattern at my internship, and I'm concerned it will get me fired very soon.  The pattern goes as follows:

* Receive an assignment
* Attempt to work on it, become unbearably bored and distractable, put it off until later.
* Realize the deadline is coming up soon, attempt to cram through everything.
* Get overwhelmed and discouraged by the volume of work I have to do in a short period of time, give up.  Get too angry and frustrated to concentrate on the work.
* Calm down after a long break, accept that my assignment will be late, slowly push through it.
* Turn in the work late.

This pattern occurred over and over again throughout high school and college, and it's repeating itself at my current internship.  As the work becomes more difficult and less interesting, my productivity plummets.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to be fired soon, creating yet another gap in my resume, and keeping me in my parents' basement even longer.

I don't respond well to ADHD medication, so that's unfortunately not an option for me.

To most people, it looks like I'm lazy and just don't give a shit about getting the work done.  Some people seem to think I need to have it explained to me that doing unpleasant or boring work is a normal part of life, and that I'm not entitled to feel entertained or engaged every second of the day.  I understand why it looks like I need to have that explained to me, so I don't begrudge anyone for thinking I'm lazy, apathetic, or entitled.

I have no interest in helping other people ""understand"" or empathize with my issues; I'd rather just find ways to deal with them.  I'm fed with this pattern being a defining aspect of my life.

If anyone has some advice for how to break this pattern, I'd love to hear it."
bmbcqa,1,2019-05-08,"Stay with my multi-national tech company internship, or try a research internship?",HaveANice_throwaway,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bmbcqa/stay_with_my_multinational_tech_company/,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a computer science undergraduate from the UK achieving good grades. I am currently 10 months in to a 12 month internship as a core C++ developer with a well known, global, tech company. I took the job because I have always wanted to learn C++, and this was the only job offer I got that was explicitly in pretty hardcore C++. They took me in without any experience, the office is lovely, as are the people.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I took a research project over the summer in my computer science department, which is funded a large government agency. The job sounded interesting, and I need the money to pay rent, so even though it requires writing reports and is using some horrible java library, I'm feeling pretty happy at this point...

&amp;#x200B;

However... My current work have just offered me a job extension over the summer working in the same office, with the same team, doing the same thing...

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have the option of quitting my summer department/government research project and staying with my current job.

&amp;#x200B;

My pros and cons for my current job are; 

* They are a big name on the CV
* I am already settled in the office
* I would maintain a good rapport with them
* I would potentially learn C++ more.... 

***HOWEVER***

* During the 10 months I've been at the company, despite them promising that i'd be a C++ developer, the first 3-4 months were C++, while the rest has been in CMake
* After finishing the CMake and showing my disappointment with assignment to my manager, I have been assured that the rest of the internship will be in C++, including any extensions. Despite this promise, I can't help feel a little off about it all, as I find myself in a position of not knowing much C++, and not feeling like I'm learning much on a day to day basis (but i *am* still around C++ daily). Big global company syndrome kind of stuff.
* On a more personal note, I'm involved with someone who sits fairly near me in my company (a placement student), and am not sure how long this will last

&amp;#x200B;

For this research job;

* It might be good to try out a different kind of career, in a kind of post-graduate research role, rather than in industry
* The people all seem really nice, who i'd be working with
* I'd be doing some heavy java, which I haven't done in a professional environment before
* I could potentially discover some quite interesting outcomes

***HOWEVER***

* It would mean potentially leaving my current job, which I feel they would take personally (or at least my team and manager would).
* I don't have nearly as much interest in java as I do C++
* I don't know how i'll fair... and it may be boring work for all I know.

&amp;#x200B;

**To some up, and propose my actual question:**

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know whether to take the global company with C++, which have let me down a little so far, or take a government funded research project in my department which is completely different to what I would traditionally go for in a job.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a number of variables involved, so what would you say would look better on a future CV (variety or specialisation in an area I want a career in)? And what do you think would be better for me in the short term?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

Things were fine, but at the time I wanted to travel out of my hometown and explore for awhile after I graduated. I received a full-time offer with the company when it came time for graduation, but I also received a full scholarship to study and do research at a well-known grad school in a major city. I chose grad school. This meant rejecting the offer. I was very candid about this, my reasons for wanting to go to grad school, and never spoke ill of the company or my managers. I wanted to leave the door open and not burn a bridge.

I don't regret my choice, but I did learn some things about myself and in the end decided in 2018 that I wish to move back home and spend time with my family. I worried about what my job prospects would be. Unfortunately for me, the big BIG tech company had no job openings at all by the time I got myself home and settled. I took a few months vacation to relax myself. Still no openings. My student loans were coming due.

I ended up taking a programming job at another company, and the commute is over an hour. Things are ok but my manager is a very difficult person to work with, and I have a permanent stress stomachache when going to work. I am not really fitting in with my coworkers very well. I had hopes that this smaller company would have a more relaxed culture and maybe a more lax WFH policy - wrong... the commute is also wearing on me.

Well, we all make mistakes. But the other day, I saw a new job posting for a job within Big Corp. It is somewhat related to what my internship was, the stack is cool, and I know they will offer better salary, better benefits, more vacation, and like 15 minute commute from my home on a normal day. For the heck of it, I decided to throw in an application.

Now like many of you, I know the only way to get my application in front of human eyes is to have someone vouch for me. So I got in contact with my internship manager (who almost certainly knows the offering manager for this position as he is a very influential person), but I don't know what I'm supposed to ask. It looks bad if I say ""yes, i started this other job and now am leaving after \~3 months because I don't like it"" It looks bad if I draw attention to the fact that I rejected the original job offer. I'm not sure my current manager will even provide a good reference for me. And what if I fail the interview? Everyone involved will look bad. I don't want to damage my professional relationships, but I am not happy and want to make this change. I would like to give the company another chance in a new role.

Is there any tactful way to do this right??"

I’m planning to apply in 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

* Work experience:
   * 2 years software engineering at fintech unicorn in SF, left shortly after second promotion
   * For the last 2 years have been working at a series B B2B startup in SF with very good investors. I joined pre-series A as employee 3. I mainly do engineering &amp; product, and participate in sales engineering &amp; biz dev when needed. I lead two developers and work on the main revenue-driving features. It looks like I will have my devs under my wing in the future.
   * Will continue working at this startup for 3 years - we are currently on a good trajectory and I am enjoying the work. Also want to fully vest and see where it goes
   * Hoping to have 6-7 years of WE when matriculating
* Extracurriculars:
   * During college:
      * mentor in the Asian American club (help freshmen with adjusting to college life &amp; academics, plan events, etc)
      * Math and CS tutor/grader
      * School theatre club - leader in senior year.
      * Worked 20 hours a week part-time internship for a startup during senior year as an engineer; would fly to San Jose once per week. Startup was acquired after my internship ended.
      * 1 computational math paper published in a mid-level journal as first author with a professor
   * Post college:
      * teach CS in local high schools 2-3 times a week before work, during the school year (Sep-Jun). I have done this for 2 years and will continue. I started as a TA and now I lead classes. Also participate in recruiting, informational sessions to prospective volunteers, and help with teach mentoring / training.
      * 4hrs/week for a suicide prevention texting line. Been doing this for 2 years and will continue.
      * I help and sometimes lead workshops with local chapters of Black Girls Code and other minority-focused CS/tech education organizations. I really like teaching if you can’t tell.
      * Sometime help out with CS-related workshops at my local hacker space. I am an active participant in it and also help with fundraising.
      * Pretty serious runner - I currently can do a 2:2x marathon. I am hoping to qualify for the US Olympic Trials before applying (2:19 or lower). Also am the social/communications lead/chair for my running club (\~200 members).
      * Ranked top 100 in USA for competitive programming on the most popular competitive coding website; placed in top 1000 for 2 years in Google CodeJam (35k yearly participants) - I plan to continue this. Unsure to include this as this might seem too tech-nerd?
* Undergrad school/major: Computer Science at a top 10 liberal arts college
* Other education/coursework: 1 computational math paper published in a journal as first author with my professor;
* Race/nationality: White &amp; Asian; American
* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 780 (51Q, 48V)
* Undergrad GPA: 2.99 or something, rounding up to 3.0 - this is something I need to overcome

**MBA Info**

* Current goal of MBA: Transition into Corporate Development or Strategy at bigger tech companies. Secondary goals: VC / entrepreneurship.
* Target schools: M7, Tuck, SOM, Fuqua.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to get everyone’s opinion of how I should proceed and position myself in 2 years when I do apply to business school. Coming from the tech startup space, I should have a relatively unique background compared to the MBB/IB folks. My letters of recommendations should be solid if I continue my work here, and will definitely show impact as the startup keeps growing and my scope grows with it.

Is there anything I should do between now and then to improve or solidify my application?

I think my 2yr experience at a unicorn will be respected by the AdComs, but how about my current startup? Hopefully when I apply the startup will be more known, but since it’s B2B I really doubt it. I will highlight the investors and funding amount, as well as who some of our known clients are - should I do anything else?

Obviously, I need to overcome the 3.0 GPA in my applications. I am wondering if anyone has any tips in this respect. My GMAT should be solid enough to prove that I’m not an idiot, and I hope my ECs help with overcoming the notion that I’m a lazy POS. During college I did not focus on my GPA because of extracurriculars, working during school, and frankly not thinking I’ll ever go back to school because I wanted to work in tech. I’m hoping things like having a published paper also helps.

I heard HBX thrown around here for helping with low GPA applicants, anyone have experience with that and how that has affected their applications/outcomes? What about MIT MicroMasters (thinking either the Econ one or the Data Science one)? Online courses are more appealing to me compared to my local community college classes cuz then I can plan around all the other things I participate in.

Any suggestions / opinions / feedback would help here. Thanks!"

I made the transition from consulting to software engineering and given my previous background and personality, I’ve been encouraged to go into a Solutions Engineer role that is both client facing and minimal coding (50/50 is a lot of what companies claim). I’ve heard rumors that you can lose your coding chops if this is where you start. And frankly, attending meetings and answering client emails all day is not what I’m trying to do again tbh. 

Is it difficult to make the transition from Solutions Engineer to Software Engineer? Given that it’s hard to find a software engineering role straight out of a bootcamp, should I consider the solutions role to add experience under my belt then apply to a SWE role? Would Solutions Engineer be better than a SWE internship position?

I just feel like I didn’t pay thousands of dollars to not be able to fully apply what I’ve learned. I want to continue using and learning current libraries/frameworks and not just use JavaScript. 

And this might sound silly, but I want to prove that women can also be software engineers and I feel like because of the nature of the solutions role, I’m sure a lot of women engineers would be pushed towards this position. Not that that’s bad, I just want to prove to myself that I can be a software engineer. 

Any insight would be helpful because everything above is just based on assumptions so I’d love to get input from those who are more experienced."

Happened in 1995.  I know the year well because it was my first real job ever in Sales. This is a throwaway account because I’ve been in this industry for 25 years now and this story is well-known in my circles. I don’t want any of those people to recognize this and see what other sick Reddit shit I enjoy reading.

So I got a 6-month internship with this very large networking manufacturer.  I’m 22 years old and fresh out of college with an Engineering degree. This large corporation has hired six Engineers for an internship program and lucky me was one of the selected few.

I immediately meet my soul mate in the program.  We’ll call him Ted.  Ted is just a ball of energy. Fun as hell and always doing something to mess with everybody. I spend half my time in his cube and he spends half his time in my cube.  We work in a large building and I actually feel like a working man. Dress shirt, tie, slacks and dress shoes.  

Well about three months into my stint we are told that a new VP of Sales has been hired and he will be coming in on Monday.  We’re just little peons working on quotes for the sales guys but if we get in good with the VP maybe after our internship ends they will hire us on as Junior Sales Engineers.

So Monday morning comes and we have a meeting scheduled to meet the new boss.  He steps into the conference room at 9am and about 20 of us are in there waiting.  He’s immaculately dressed – French cuffs with cufflinks, monogrammed shirt, $400 tie and beautiful suit.  This guy has a perfectly coifed haircut and you can tell he’s a ballbreaker that has been around the block and ascended meteorically.  He’s probably around 40 and all of us 20-somethings are in awe of him. Think Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross.

We get out of the meeting and I head over to Ted’s cube.  Ted’s cube is in the back and he’s anxious to tell me something.  Well, he starts telling me that he went to take a piss around 8am and there was somebody in a stall that was just shitting up the place. Ted was laughing his ass off and describing in great detail how the guy in there knew somebody had entered the restroom and kept flushing the toilet the whole time he was shitting to mask the most horrible sounds.  Ted stood at the sink and tried to see who was in there but no dice.  Ted said the guy was literally having a baby in there.

To get to the restrooms you have to leave our suite, walk past the elevators, and down a hall to the restrooms.  So Ted just had to know who it was.  Ted loiters by the elevators and who comes out of the restroom, but the new VP himself. Ted avoids eye contact and pushes a button to call the elevator as if he just arrived in the hall.  Once the new bossman goes into the suite Ted runs into the restroom to see if anybody else was in there.  Nothing.  So it had to be him.

So Ted is telling this story to me in his cube and I have tears in my eyes.  I start squatting in the cube and simulate pushing the flusher as I start making obnoxious shitting sounds and grunting and Ted is just rolling. Then Ted’s face goes white.  I’m just looking at him with my back to the cube opening and continue squatting and making fart sounds and flushing the imaginary toilet.  I sense something is wrong.  I stop, turn around, and see the VP.  He says “I see you two are having a little fun.  I just wanted to come by and introduce myself to everybody personally.”

We both stammer and answer awkwardly and he leaves.  Ted starts howling again.  Ted says “Hey dumbshit, he knows somebody was in the restroom and heard him and he sees you doing this routine and he thinks it was you and that you are telling people!”

I lose it. Oh shit. Not good.  I need to make sure he knows it’s not me.  I have no reason why I came to this conclusion.  It was so very important to me that he understood that I was only TOLD this story and didn’t actually SEE it. Chalking it up to youth.

So I rush back to his office, knock on his door and he deadpan just looks up at me. I say “Mr. Baldwin, I just want you to know that it wasn’t me that was in the bathroom and heard all that” and he looks at me and says “leave my office”.

Oh shit. Great first day. Great start with the new VP.

I avoided eye contact with him for the next three months and never had another conversation with him again. 

At the 6-month period the company hired four of the six interns.  Ted and I were not selected.

I still get physically sick when I see cufflinks and it’s been 25 years.

TLDR: New VP. Caught shitting in the restroom.  Loudly imitated him as he stood behind me. Bad career move."

Some pros for UCI
-offers a double major program with Chemicals Engineering and Material Science
-More recently updated campus (new towers and food hall plus some buildings)
-Ideally located to some major specific internships (Boeing, 3M, etc...)
-Less expensive junior and senior housing 

Some pros for UCSB:
-offers 5 years master with undergrad in chemical engineering and masters in material science
-near the beach!
-higher ranked for ChemE and MatSci

In addition I’m waitlisted at UCB and UCLA so this could just not be an issue.

I currently have my sister's old 2013 MacBook Air 13 inch which is an i5 with 4gb of ram. I was wondering if this will be enough, or whether it would be worth it to go for a 2015 MacBook Pro. I can afford it, but spending money is still spending money.

&amp;#x200B;

Will I experience significant slowdowns using the MacBook Air in my classes and internships?

For those who have made the switch, could you describe how they differed and what was noticeably different.

I like the build quality of MacBooks and would hopefully get something of similar quality (aluminum body).

Additionally, I am considering getting something like an xps 13 and running ubuntu on it.

Necessities:

- good battery life (can easily last full day of use)

- doesn't feel flimsy (especially around the hinge, trackpad, and spacebar)

- can run Linux without any problems

For reference in terms of classes, I will be going to UCLA next year."

He works in retail now and I feel like he has so much experience and potential but he seems to have trouble pushing himself to try(And making much less than he should). When I ask him why not apply and look for a job he says everything's changed so much and he doesn't know where to start. I should also state that he was hired out of college back in the 90's and didn't finish his degree which I think hurts his confidence.

My questions are, What resources and/or advice should would you give him to catch back up? Has the field changed so much that his experience wouldn't help him land a job?

(long post),throwaway25354554,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bmhips/leaving_a_current_internship_for_another_one_that/,"Hi everyone, please bear with the relatively long question, and thank you in advance for taking the time to read / reply.  
I'm keeping things super vague on purpose, don't want to accidentally have someone from my job find this and realize it's me lol.

tl;dr at end of post.

&amp;#x200B;

Last summer I had an internship that paid really well. This year I applied to it again and didn't hear back, so I panicked and found another one (I can't afford to go without a job as I support myself through school). I was offered a software engineering intern position at a local small start up, but they offered me ridiculously little. It was $3 less than my job at the time, which was tutoring children.  
I spoke to them and said I couldn't take it at that rate b/c I simply wouldn't be able to pay bills if I took a summer to do an internship paying so little.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up screwing myself up a little here. The tutoring job I had wasn't full time, and even if I had stayed there, it wouldn't have been enough to cover bills. So I thought I needed something to leverage them into offering me a higher pay, as I hadn't been able to find an internship anywhere else at that point in time and to be completely honest, I really needed a job as I was about to not be able to pay rent... So I told them my previous internship from last year had given me an offer to return at the same rate as before (mainly cuz I really thought they were going to give me the offer, before I lost hope that I'd get it). I knew there was absolutely no way they could match what I made last year (it was literally more than double the rate/hr), so I knew it was a number that would force them to give me the highest they could.

In the end, they said they were able to match what I was making at the tutoring job, which was still lower than I would've liked - but I was panicking, I needed a job, so I told them I'd take it. I tried asking how they'd feel if I stayed for now and left in a couple months and they said they'd really prefer for me to stay the whole summer, that they tend to keep their interns year-round, etc. I didn't really have a choice, as it was the only offer I had, so I took it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well... comes literally the first day of this internship after I get hired, and the place I worked for last year gives me a ring, saying they want me to come back, after I had already convinced myself they didn't want me back. After a little (a lot) of panicking, I told them I'd do the interview, b/c I was reasoning it like, well, I might not even pass the interview anyway, so at least it'll be good practice. The entire time up until the interview I was telling myself I wouldn't take it even if they gave me an offer, I would feel too dirty leaving after promising this small company that I'd stay for the entire summer.  
The interview comes, I do it, and the very next day they tell me another team within the company also wanted to interview me for their team instead. I do the second interview a while after, I pass both of them. I was expecting an offer over e-mail, which would've given me time to think about a reply - but the recruiter called me on the phone directly to tell me the offer, \*before\* sending the e-mail, and asked me if I wanted to accept it right then and there. All of my friends had been drilling me to take it b/c it's such a better opportunity, I was still on the fence / leaning towards not taking it, but when the recruiter asked me over the phone, I just panicked and said yes (she sounded SO excited).

&amp;#x200B;

Even after saying yes, I was convinced I couldn't take it - not only for moral reasons, but for financial reasons - couldn't afford to go where I need to go to take the better opportunity. Then in comes my best friend, who says he'll help me get up there so I can do the internship, and another friend who offers me housing for dirt cheap. So now everything is pretty much set up - I accepted it, I found a place for the summer, my best friend bought my plane tickets.

Also, they'll most likely offer me a full time position when I graduate as this will be my second internship with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having panic attacks over this situation because I don't know what to do. With the plane tickets bought, it's been decided that I'm going to leave this current internship, but I have no idea how to do it or what to say. I didn't mean to lie on purpose or try to one-up anyone, I just genuinely really needed a job in the field I'm going into, and did what I thought I should've done.

&amp;#x200B;

So now there's about four and a half weeks before I have to leave and I don't know if I should tell them now, wait to tell them later, give a two weeks notice, or just say peace on my last day, I don't know.  
I'm reluctant to consider telling them now because I fear they might just ask me to not come back, and I need to work this month. I'm even too scared to try to give them a two weeks notice and have them cut my time there short.  
I'm scared I'm burning bridges, and I guess subconsciously also worried they'll be angry / disappointed that they hired someone specifically to stay over the summer just for them to leave.  
I need to be able to find a job when I get back in town after the summer, and I was hoping it would be in the tech industry, which is already pretty small in my town. If I burn bridges, I fear they'll tell others and other companies won't want to hire me because I left this one like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't know what to say or how to say it. I don't want to lie, especially since I've already added all of them to my LinkedIn and they'll see it when I update it with the new internship, which I eventually will have to. I don't know if I should approach someone in person or if I should just send a message over Slack.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way to do this where it won't be a complete disaster? 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros and cons of each:  
Current internship Pros: Local, don't have to pay two rents for 3 months, would most likely keep me after summer is over as well. Workplace is chill and company culture seems good. There's a chance they'd hire me full time upon graduation, based on what I was told before. However, super small local company, doesn't seem like there's much growing I could do.  
Cons: Pay is incredibly low, would have to get a second job to make ends meet, while already working 40hrs at this place. I'm also not sure I want to stay in this town after graduating and getting a full time job here - it's not a tech hub, the pay is crap for developers, I'd feel stuck.  


New internship Pros: More than double the pay, and they'll most likely offer me a full time position when I graduate as this will be my second internship with them. Company culture / workplace is just as good. Starting salary for a Software Engineer 1 is decent, plenty of opportunity for growth as this is a big company with hubs in several states and in other countries as well - so I could probably get bumped up to SE2, SE3 within a couple years and get pay raises.  
Cons: Will have to pay two rents for the summer (subleasing my current room is not an option). Might not be able to find a job when I get back to town, and I still have a year left of school where I have to support myself. Speaking long term, moving away once I graduate means leaving everything &amp; everyone I know behind, and going to a place far away where I'll be alone.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr**  
**I fucked up by telling one internship I had gotten an offer from another company to try to leverage a higher pay, which I got and accepted - then the other company \*actually\* gave me the offer, after I took the first internship and said I'd stay for the summer. The pay is over double what the current one is paying me, and has the potential to help me much more in the long run. I want to leave and take the better internship but I don't know how to do it. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.**"

From India, living in Dubai, U.A.E. Will be graduating high school in exactly a year and linking up with &lt;INSERT NAME OF UNIVERSITY I FINALLY END UP ENROLLING IN&gt; in Fall 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Intended major:

Something along the lines of Economics and Finance / Government / Politics / Int'l Relations

&amp;#x200B;

Universities currently on my ""shortlist"":

UPenn, UChicago, Duke, Princeton, Claremont McKenna, Tufts, Williams, Pomona, Cornell, Northwestern, UCLA, UCB, Georgetown, JHU, UMich, NYU, UCSD, UT Austin, UW Madison, UW Seattle

(I'm still looking around, so feel free to suggest any you think I could add as matches or safeties)

&amp;#x200B;

Academics / Standardized Testing:

I'm doing IB, idk how to calculate my GPA. I'm aiming for a 40+ predicted grade out of 45.

Higher Level subjects: Math, Physics, Economics, History

Standard Level subjects: English, French

SAT: 1540 Composite (760 EBR&amp;W + 780 Math)

SAT Subject Tests: Will be taking World History in June and Math Level 2 in October

&amp;#x200B;

Extracurricular Activities:

\-- Model United Nations: since freshman year. 7 conferences so far (5 as delegate, 2 as chair). One of my conferences was The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN) 2018; only a thousand or so students from around the world participate in it every year, and I was selected as one of the few students to represent my school as a delegate at the conference last year.

\-- School Student-Run Newsletter Club: since sophomore year. I was the Head of International News last year, and I'm currently the President.

\-- School Student-Run Debate Club: since sophomore year. I simply participated as a debater last year, and I'm currently Co-President. In both years, I participated in the debate team, winning our inter-school competition two years in a row.

\-- Student Council: since sophomore year. I've been elected as a representative for two years running.

\-- School Student-Run World Scholar's Cup Prep Club: only in sophomore year. Had the role of a teacher, helping younger students in my school prepare for the WSC competition.

\-- Toastmasters Gavel Club (public speaking and leadership): only in freshman year. The chapter I was a member of kinda dried up, so I stopped going towards the end of freshman year.

\-- Several Business / Marketing Competitions: since freshman year. Participated in advertisement design and marketing competitions.

\-- Electric Keyboard (music instrument): only in freshman and sophomore year. I finished Trinity Guildhall practical exams until grade 5 out of 8 and got 3 distinction (best tier of achievement) certificates and 2 merit (second-best tier of achievement) certificates.

\-- Ramadan Sharing Fridges (volunteering): since sophomore year. It's an initiative to basically distribute food and refreshments to laborers at local construction sites.

\-- School Badminton Team: in freshman year and now again in junior year.

\-- Job Shadowing: in sophomore year. Spent a week at a local law firm.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there are a couple things I plan to do within the next 5-6 months, before I start applying:

\-- Firstly, a proper internship this summer (ideally at a policy research institute or a think tank or a similar kind of organization that's involved in economics or politics).

\-- I stopped doing practical exams for music, but I think I could create a channel with tutorial videos teaching people how to play the songs from the Trinity Guildhall electric keyboard practical exam syllabus. My former tutor agreed to help publicize it among his current students, and I could talk to the music department at my school to maybe help publicize it as well.

\-- I teamed up with some of my fellow students participating in Ramadan Sharing Fridges, and over the summer, we want to collect and distribute stuff like clothes, toiletries, and even SIM cards to the laborers (to help them contact their families back home in India / Bangladesh / Pakistan / etc.) We just want to take this initiative of helping the laborers a bit further.

\-- One or two online university courses related to my intended major.

\-- As I mentioned earlier, I plan to take Math Level 2 and World History SAT Subject Tests. I'll also take the TOEFL sometime in the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Would really appreciate your thoughts on where I stand, and if you think my application will really be strengthened by the things I plan to do over the summer \^\^

I'd also really really appreciate any other suggestions to strengthen my application, and any additional universities I should add to my shortlist.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all, much love!"

Im a computer science major at University of Illinois, and flunked out after my sophomore year. I took a year off, went to community college (which I did great in, because I was motivated to prove to myself that I could get back in, and the classes were a super minimal amount of work), and reapplied. 


The university was kind enough to reaccept me, but I guess they made a mistake. I needed to maintain at least a 2.0 GPA, but it looks like I'll be getting a B-, B-, C-, and an F. This comes out to a GPA of 1.7525, so I'll be kicked out again.


At this point, I don't know what to do with my life. My parents were pretty accepting last time, but they sincerely believed that I would be successful this time, and I assured them that I would be. I've been telling them throughout the semester that I've been doing fine and that everything is okay, but my whole life just feels like it's falling apart. I know that when I tell them, the amount of disappointment will be immeasurable. They've always had really high hopes for me, and I was an exceptional student in high school. 


I'm not bad at CS either. I love it, and am passionate about it. I create many projects in my spare time - often when I should be doing classwork or studying instead. I just suck at school. Classes, lectures, deadlines, homework, I can't deal with it on my own. With this being the second time I'm going to flunk out, I don't think the uni will ever give me a 3rd chance. Ill just have to accept the fact that I need to get a career without a degree, but I don't know where to start.


The only prospect I have right now is that I managed to secure a summer internship at a company I'm interested in. But, I feel like if they find out I've been dropped from the uni, they will revoke my offer. Even if they don't, won't it be strange if I ask them for a full-time offer or anything?



Sorry, I know this is pretty ranty, but I'm breaking down inside.

I do have big student loans though. But falling onto those is sharp, pointy and painful.  


Basically company ran out of money and so they terminated me with this reason.  Or well, I was terminated ""without any reason for termination"" because of lack of money and cutbacks. I was informed on the spot of this and lost all my benefits that exact same day even...

I'm honestly depressed over this and have severe anxiety about my future.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue is I was a new grad before this job and took an ""internship"" of 16 months where I actually did work on large scale software problems and was coding. So it adds up to over 2 years of experience. But where I live has a few tech companies for sure but they never seem to be hiring and their bar of expectations is very high and I still fall under it. I know this because about a year ago I was applying out like a madman and heard back nearly nothing from anyone. No interview bookings nothing nada....

Meaning I honestly have no idea if I will get a job now.

I feel totally screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

I also was let go with literally 0 days notice. On the spot because of this and lost all my benefits. I have PTSD from a rape that happened to me years ago I was seeking treatment for and was relying on those healthcare benefits. Now I don't even know what to do. Let alone physiotherapy as I was severely injured and the injury still bothers me (odd to say as a young 20s person :/) and no dental cleanings even can be covered...

I am overwhelmed and not sure what to do.

How should I approach this?,theShitPostMaster,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/bmlp1s/is_it_a_good_idea_to_return_to_the_current/,"Hey guys, I am currently on a 4-month coop and have another 4-month coop term coming up right after (so 8-month coop terms for 2 consecutive coops). This is my second last coop (4th coop) and the next will be my last coop (5th coop). I can't do a 6th coop because I am 2 courses away from graduation (I took 3 courses last term so I can do another study term after coops), UW doesn't allow 3 consecutive coops and the government does not allow me to take an off term for internships as an international student.

  
My problem is that I have to decide if I want to participate in job search for the next term which means I have to do Skype interviews and stuff since I am working right now or staying at the current employer for next coop. For a bit of context, I am a 4th year CS student with not so good previous coops. I am working in the innovation lab for a non-tech company. My job involves mostly finding solutions with ML techniques.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if it is better to participate in job search since the next will be my last coop. But it will also invovle a lot of inconveniences since I can't do interviews in school. My current team is young and the project is interesting so I enjoy it so far. I am considering staying for another 4 month and I have already mentioned the possibility during the interview. I know they are hiring for next term, but I am not sure how to approach this to my manager. Any advise on what should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any inputs!!"

Besides this, I had a couple other things going on for me like being elected for leadership positions. 

It took me a long time to figure out, but I realized my close friends were jealous. Like they would try to find flaws in me and casually point them out. When I couldn't hang out with them because I was busy, they would try to find a way to make me somehow regret not going. Not in a extreme way, but enough that I could notice.

At first when my friends just got to know me, they would compliment and call me captain of the group. But as time went by it got worse and worse. 

Don't get me wrong though, beside the jealousy aspect, they were awesome friends who gave more than took from me. But because I am moving to a new place and have to make friends all over again, I'm wondering how I could avoid jealousy in friendships? Honestly, I could have a part in it too though and probably do. How do you deal with jealous friends?"

I'm a junior at a well known east coast state school studying Business IT.  I'm not sure which would put me in a better position for career prospects post graduation. Both internships are located in Northern Virginia and I've outlined the offers below.

&amp;#x200B;

Offer 1: Data Analytics intern at a large (10,000+ employees) well-known government contractor

· Compensation: $18/hr, work from home every Friday, opportunity for remote work during the following school year.

· Work would primarily be analysis in excel with some work in powerBI making dashboards (Described to me by a previous intern)

· Better name recognition than offer 2

· A friend did the same internship last summer and said the team is easy to get along with, but the work is repetitive and there will a lot of asking people for work will be required.

&amp;#x200B;

Offer 2: Business Process Analyst at a small (around 250 employees)  IT Consultancy that develops software for primarily government clients

· Compensation: $15/hr with possibility for overtime

· Work would be building an Access Database, along with adding in forms, automations, and making dashboards as well as interviewing client project team members to identify potential process improvements. (Described to me by the hiring manager)

· Less name recognition, but what sounds like more interesting/meaningful work.

&amp;#x200B;

My degree offers a unique blend of business and programming courses that prepares graduates to go into a technical or functional role after graduation. I’m interested in either Technology Consulting (Deloitte, Accenture, etc.), project management of a software development team, or a business analyst role post-graduation. Not sure which one of these is a better stepping stone career-wise. Any advice would be appreciated."
bmnk58,0,2019-05-09,"Owner of private company regularly harasses employees, need advice on actions to take.",r977ytf,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bmnk58/owner_of_private_company_regularly_harasses/,"Let me preface this by saying I don't work at the company in question anymore. I left over two years ago, and have been wrestling with how to handle what I witnessed while employed there.

I decided to reach out for advice about how to take action after speaking with a friend about the experiences of a young woman who was recently an intern. His comments on her experience led me to conclude that the culture among executives had not changed, nor had the actions of the owner been deterred.


I've only listed situations I personally witnessed or had happen to me during my employment. The company is located in Texas.

While employed I witnessed or experienced harassment on several levels, including sexual and verbal harassment. I witnessed young female interns pressured into private dinners and drinks with the owner, and those who said no were often harassed by senior leaders in an attempt to pressure them into changing their mind.

the owner shoved images of a naked intern, who was still employed, in front of my face and then had him go into graphic details about how he had sex with her on the hood of his car. 

the owner constructed an intern house, talking regularly about the opportunities for interns to ""get high and drunk and f***!""

the owner would regularly target young female interns, finding opportunities to interact with them privately, outside of the office environment. This included unannounced trips without any notice to supervisors, and other employees charged with protecting these students welfare.

When HR issues were escalated within the company, the owner would regularly take the opportunity to openly mock the individual who had come forward.

I witnessed the owner sexualize his son &amp; daughters' high school age friends, and heard interns tell stories about his kids hosting drunken sex parties while he was travelling. He would regularly provide copious amounts of alcohol to minors at parties that I was required to attend. Many of these parties were secured by officers from the local county sheriff's office

I witnessed the owner threaten to kill two employees for having a relationship, while drink and carrying a concealed weapon. He was regularly armed while heavily intoxicated. He also had a bad habit of driving while intoxicated and proudly bragged about his ability to get an accident cleaned up before police arrived. 

I witnessed the owner take an unloaded .50cal sniper rifle and point it at employees who had gathered to look at his most recent purchase, asking them ""who do you think will be the last back to their desk?""
.
.
.
.
.

Anyways, he's not an admirable human being, and that's only a quick overview. Where that leaves me is with options... What can I do? 

I'm not particularly interested in his money, more so his ability to continue functioning in this manner. His companies operate in areas where there is a lot of exposure to highschool and college students, more specifically young females. 

Not only does his business target this space, it operates off of a large pool of interns. My greatest concern is the effect his actions are having on the mental health of the younger individuals he has influence over and contact with.

I've thought about contacting schools they hire interns from, as well as many of the highschool/college age organizations they work with to alert them. I've event wondered about reaching out to news organizations in the surrounding areas.

I want to protect these young individuals, but I want to protect myself as well. Any advice on what I could do, and how best to go about doing it would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

I am fresh out of college and accepted my first ""real"" job. I have done a few internships in IT Help Desk type roles - these roles all dealt with Windows 7 &amp; 10 based PC's and servers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I accepted a great position and the hiring manager was impressed with my background -- but all my experience in troubleshooting and general IT knowledge is all on Windows computers. This company is entirely on Mac and uses G Suite for their emails. I am used to supporting Microsoft Exchange and Windows machines.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Are there any good resources out there to brush up on general ""IT"" related to supporting Macs? I will be working a Help Desk type role and all the users are on Macs and managed by Cisco Meraki. This is an entry level role and they seem to be very understanding and willing to train -- but I don't want to go into the position not knowing anything... My only experience with Macs is I owned one for about a year, but only used it to take notes/school work and general internet browsing.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone lead me in the right direction or share any tips? Thanks!"
bmpki7,2,2019-05-09,Python Tree node and leaf counting,NavajoDemar,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/bmpki7/python_tree_node_and_leaf_counting/,"I've been spending way too many hours working on a problem and my coworker suggested I post here asking for suggestions for a tree node/leaf problem. I'm working in python libtree and pandas.  Currently, I have a single CSV file with over 450,000 leaf nodes, a single leaf per line. The parenting is all in one column in the format 'Parent --&gt;' per parent above the leaf.  Not sure if this is a common format, but it's easy to parse. 

&amp;#x200B;

An example of the parenting column for a leaf node 4 layers down would be ""Node A --&gt; Node AA --&gt; Node AAB"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Resolving to: 

            Root
             |
             +---&gt; Node A
                    |
                    +---&gt; Node AA
                           |
                           +---&gt; Node AAB
                                  |
                                  +---&gt; Leaf

&amp;#x200B;

The kicker is, my team needs to get this data imported into an off-site WebGUI. The WebGUI system has a limited CSV import feature and does allow us to move parent folders around via drag and drop after importing.  It also has the following restrictions. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) The number of leaf nodes per CSV files with less than 8000 leaf nodes, so the CSV needs to be broken down into segments. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Every import will create a new tree off of the root, no merging.  If it exists the import will create a new node and append a generated UUID to the new node name. 

&amp;#x200B;

Example If you attempt to import a new CSV file with a leaf node of ""Node A --&gt; Node AA --&gt; Node AAC"", you would see:

&amp;#x200B;

            Root
             |
             +---&gt; Node A
             |      |
             |      +---&gt; Node AA
             |             |
             |             +---&gt; Node AAB
             |                    |
             |                    +---&gt; Leaf
             +---&gt; Node A-d8c0b6b8-728a-11e9-8848-1681be663d3e
                    |
                    +---&gt; Node AA
                           |
                           +---&gt; Node AAC
                                  |
                                  +---&gt; Leaf                             



&amp;#x200B;

The best solution for this I can come up with for this so far to handle our large CVS file is:

&amp;#x200B;

\*  Break the file down into segments starting at farthest branches down the tree walking backwards till I have 7999 leaf nodes. 

\*  Write out a new CVS file with the top node with an easy to handle name identifying the parent node this should be imported to.  

\* Have an Intern drag and drop the folders using the WebGUI to the correct locations.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a stubborn admin who does a bit script monkey work and I'm finding this a bit beyond my experience level.  Please let me know if I am missing something obvious.    I would like to resolve this in python 2.7x or 3.x to check in at work.  

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if there is a better /r/ area I should drop this in, maybe /r/facepalm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any suggestions or help."

I’m also told to bring a technical journal from my physics class for example and for the exam they said to bring a calculator, pencil etc. I emailed them back yesterday asking what topics I should review and they said this:

“We work with field data, lab data, process data and use statistics to analyze and QAQC our plant data results before the data is used and submitted in monthly, quarterly or annual reports.  We have to be able to calculate Medians, means, rolling median, standard deviations, interpolate if the data is not there based on changes in the data, we write code to do some of the calculations - streamlining the report for us.  We also work with flows, volumes and areas and lots of unit conversions.

The test will show us your ability to interpret data, look at anything that may be wonky or point it out (Sometimes mg/L is reported instead of µg/L or Celsius instead of Fahrenheit).  Identifying good or bad data and determining how to report your statistics. You will write a short summary of your findings.”

Enough so that I figured that I may have something unique to bring to the table in this department. A little about me: I'm 21 years old. 3rd year for Mechanical Engineering. I have a 3.67 GPA and have had three internships in the past, going on my fourth now. I go to a co-op school so I do 5 years of schooling with three mandatory internships. You may say that since I go to a school like this that it is easier for me to find internships, and you may be correct. However, I was able to secure an internship in high school and one other before the coop program, *and* I far outmatch my peers when it comes to getting an interview from resumes (I applied for 9 positions, got 8 interviews, was offered 4 this past year). I have had each of my previous employers bring their input to my resume, including various professors and my father. This is the culmination of everything that I know for making the best resume that you can. So here is my detailed advice: (Also, if you have any criticism please voice them and maybe I can make my resume even better). [Here](https://www.scribd.com/document/409367540/Reddit-Resume) is my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Fist Thing is first: If you do not go to a coop school, **Always** write a cover letter. Write it about anything that you feel you can talk for hours about which is also relevant to engineering and the company that you are applying to. If you cannot write, well, now is the time to learn how.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Second: **Show**, Don't Tell. Many people have problems with this line of thinking. The idea is to show the person reading your resume (henceforth referred to as the audience) a situation in which you acted out the qualities that you want to represent. Instead of saying that you are a team player, illustrate a situation in which you were a team player *and* something got done (or you learned something). This is by far the most difficult part of writing the resume, for it requires you to boil a good situation down into a few sentences. Basically, write a short story about a situation in which you lived out the qualities of what you want demonstrated in your bullet point.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Three: **No Bloody Coursework.** This DOES NOT INCLUDE design projects. You can write in the skills you have obtained that will be relevant for the job, but not the courses you took. The only things that should go on your resume should be what differentiates you from other people. Don't think you have that? It's time to start working on yourself before you work on your resume then.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Four: **Use the Whole Paper**. Eliminate Spacing on your paper. Make the font small. Strategically bold what you want the eyes of the audience to see. If you don't have many internships, try to make the audience look towards your passions or side projects. Don't have a good GPA? Bold your experience and your design project. Show what you *want* to show and tell what you want to tell. Also, I would advise not using any italics, because it is very distracting (at least for myself).

&amp;#x200B;

\-Five: **Action Words**. If you notice in my resume, every detail about a past experience starts with an action word in the *past tense* (remain consistent, if you worked a job in the past, use past tense. If you do the job now, use present tense). The purpose of the action word is to show to the employer what you like to do and in which environments you excel. My action words are, in order: Verify, Submit, Successfully Completed, Assisted, Learned, Worked, Bridged, Updated, Collaborated, Directed, Succeeded, Train, and Prepare.  I want to get across the idea that I work hard, learn well, am very analytical, and work best in group/team environments.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Six: **Activities**. This is a big one. What is your passion? If you don't have one, try one new activity a week until you find something that you love. I row, dance, and slackline. In *every single interview* I went on, I ended up spending the majority of the time talking about slacklining and how I rig highlines (basically I rig lines that I, and many people, will be tied into; life dependant on. The interviewer loves that shit). Now, yours does not need to be as extreme as mine but you got to find a bloody passion and immerse yourself in it. If its video games, build your own desktop. If it's skateboarding, build that motor longboard. If it's hiking or camping, talk about the gear and how you know all the specs. If it's robots, or bridges, or etc. etc. etc. Whatever it is, GO FOR IT. No holes barred. Release all your free time on this passion and see what manifests itself. Then put what manifests on that resume. It doesn't matter if its the rec volleyball team. Become the leader and put on the resume the skills you developed becoming that leader and how you work with your team. This shows your character. This shows that you are confident enough in yourself to show something most people would not dare put on a resume. One of the key aspects to hiring is finding the person underneath; show who you are in this section.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Seven: **Certifications**. It takes an hour to get an autocad cert. It takes little time to get a programming cert. Get them, distinguish yourself, and put them on that resume.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Eight: Anything that you put on the resume, be prepared to talk about a specific experience in the interview. Everything on the resume, when referenced in the interview, should have a whole 2min long story attached to it in your brain. During the interview, be prepared to elaborate on the points you make.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely hope this is helpful, and let me know what you think. Remember, you want to show the best you. You want to put your best foot forward. All my advice boils down to first making your life better with some passions and second illustrating that passion and your experiences in a way that the audience will respond to. Also, I will help the first 10 people to DM me with their resume and intent to make it the best it can be (as long as you are open to it being ripped apart and built back up again).

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Okay so I read all of the comments and there were a few things that I found:

1) **Include Relevant Coursework.** By this, I do not mean Gen-Eds or Gen-Engineering. Commenters have discussed coursework relevant to the job that you will be performing. This includes higher level Engineering Elective courses and potentially graduate courses if you are allowed to take them. *My* point is this: Only add courses if it is relevant to the job or it distinguishes yourself in some way.

2) **Portfolio &gt; Cover Letter**. Focus on making a portfolio of all of your SolidWorks designs and Computer Programs that you wrote, or whatever is the same equivalent for your branch of engineering. Try to include that in your resume.

Please help.,leochemleo,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/bmrcx2/dream_job_want_to_quit_please_help/,"A little background information. I recently got out of grad school. I was doing a summer internship (a year ago) with a top company in my industry. And as soon as I graduated, they offered me a full-time position. I absolutely loved it since I was learning a ton and working on different projects. However, I feel the project managers don't see me as a full-time employee ( and kind of make me feel dumb or not give ""enough"" responsibilities to me) and still treat me as an intern.

A little about my department, so it's basically ""hourly"" and I am supposed to charge my hours to the code allocated to the project. Another issue is that since project managers do not really give me enough work, I have nothing to charge to. Which means I am always stressing about not having a stable income and I'm basically responsible to find my own work. Is that even common in the engineering/consulting industry?

I am literally frustrated due to the fact that I have to go around and ask for work every now plus I'm not even being given the kind of respect I want (no matter how hard I try). The only good thing is the ""pay"" (but ugh only if I get projects/things to work on) and ofcourse, it's a biiiiiiiiggggggg, powerful company!

What should I do? Has anyone experience something similar?"
bmrdz8,2,2019-05-09,Computer Science Graduate Program?,Nimbus-Skye,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/bmrdz8/computer_science_graduate_program/,"Hi, I just finished my first year at McGill (U0) and my major is Computer Science. At the tail end of the semester Dr. Robillard invited some former undergraduate students who were involved in research and asked them to share their experiences. I quickly realized that undergraduate research was especially important for graduate admissions since research is what graduate school is all about.

But I also want to have enough time to participate in applications and the industry by doing internships and joining hackathons or the robotics club, so research is an intimidating concept since I'm not sure if I'll even want to go into graduate school after my bachelor's program. 

I just want some basic advice and stories about what undergraduate research is like and how I should get started if I wish to do it. Furthermore, if any of you are among the few graduate students roaming this sub, please tell me what your life is like.

Thanks!"

Are these internships usually required for you to go on-site to work? In other words, are the companies I apply to limited by their proximity to my apartment/campus? (There aren't too many tech companies near my campus). 

And if I read a job posting as ""Fall Internship,"" can I interpret that as a part-time internship that I can take concurrently while going to school?

I understand the answer will depend on the job, but I'm just trying to get an understanding of what is considered standard, and what to expect if I decide to take an internship while in school (and whether it is even worth trying to look for an internship)."

I graduated in December with a degree in computer science(took me 6 years). graduated with a shitty GPA(\~2.5), no internships and few academic projects(nothing impressive). I was working fulltime during college and was going through some rough time. There were times when i wanted to dropout but i also wanted to get a degree(i am asian, so i hope you understand why) so i kept pushing through. i wasn't sure i would be able to pass interviews after graduating so i spent january and february studying for the interviews(mostly DSA and learned few new languages(python and javascript). I started applying for jobs in march and so far i have been able to get about 5 phone interviews and 2 onsites( i failed both interviews) out of some 200+ jobs i have applied to. currently i am grinding leetcode and working on some projects to show on my resume. My dream is to work for big 4 or some well known company that pays good money. I am stressed and depressed but also really motivated to progress in my career. i am sure if i get my first job, it will pay low salary but i just want to get some experience and prepare for the big 4 interviews. so here's my question, if i work really hard(grind leetcode, maybe get 1 year-2 years of experience and build a few side projects), can i land a job at big 4 or a good company that will pay me 150k or am i just being too optimistic? (i love programming but money is also very important to me). I seriously need some career advice. Thank you.

P.S. I live on east coast(Very close to NYC). Also i m not looking for sympathy, i know i screwed up and i just want some real advice. :)"

### You don’t need a psychologist! You are not mad! What will people say?

***(One day Srishti was walking towards the station when she was suddenly stopped by Meera aunty.)***

**Aunt:** Good morning Srishti! How are you doing? Are you going somewhere?

**Srishti:** Hello aunty. How are you? Yes, aunty, I’m going to the psychiatric clinic.

**Aunty:** (gasps) Oh no! Why are you going there? Is everything alright? Your mom never said anything to me. Do you want me to accompany you?

***(Srishti was confused and didn’t know what to say. Before she could understand why her aunt had an extreme reaction, aunty hailed an auto and took Srishti.***

***Srishti could see the panic in her Aunty’s eyes and offered her water.)***

**Aunty:** Is everything okay with you dear? You can share it with me. I have read articles about having psycho problems.

***Srishti smirks***

**Srishti:** Aunty that’s where I’m doing my internship! I’m a psychology student and I got this opportunity to intern with this Doctor.

**Aunty:** Thank God! I got really scared for a minute. I thought you have some serious problem with your brain.

**Srishti:** If it’s okay Aunty can I ask you a question?

**Aunty:** Yes beta! Go ahead.

**Srishti:** Why did you panic when you heard that clinic’s name? Have you had a bad experience there?

**Aunty:** God forbid! I’m very strong! I have gone through so much trouble and yet I never had any mental problems. I have always faced my fears and never cried. There won’t come a day in my life when I have to go to a psycho doctor. That is only for pagal log (mad people).

**Srishti:** Aunty who told you it’s for pagal log?

**Aunty:** I have seen it in movies. Remember when you showed me that movie with Manjulika? And then the psycho doctor helps her? That was very scary! I thought all mind doctors help such people. Beta, you need to be more careful.

**Srishti:** Aunty, didn’t you visit our family doctor yesterday? Is everything alright? I hope it’s nothing serious.

**Aunty:** No no! I had a little cold so I thought I should visit her. It’s better to take medication beforehand for cold or else it gets inconvenient for me. Then I’m not able to function and my daily routine gets disturbed.

**Srishti:** So why not look at a physician and a psychologist from the same lens. Psychologist and psychiatrists are not all about severe mental illness. Yes, we deal with them but there are many other people who seek help for other reason such as exam anxiety, job stress, loss of a loved one, relationship issues, academic issues etc. Many a time when we repress these situations they manifest into some physical problems. Just like a cough and cold, they interfere with a person’s daily functioning. Questions like what will people think of me? I’m so weak that I’m not able to deal with this, Am I crazy for visiting a counsellor often discourage people from visiting. It isn’t weakness this shows how strong a person actually is. It is high time that people understand the nitty-gritty of Psychology. Gone are the days when psychology was only about severe mental disorder. Nowadays it is about helping people deal with daily life problems and improving the quality of life.

If a cold and cough need medication before it turns into something severe, so does mental health. If you address these issues and nip in the bud it won’t grow into a grave problem.

**Aunty:** I never thought of this. In fact, this is very enlightening. I wonder why no one tells us these things. You made it so simple for me to understand.  Maybe more of us should get together and help you in spreading awareness. If I’m ever feeling under the weather I won’t hesitate to seek help ever.

**Srishti:** I’m glad I could be of help to you, Aunty.

bmxb8t,5,2019-05-10,I have 2 very different offers and not sure which to choose. Need advice,ivaneca1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bmxb8t/i_have_2_very_different_offers_and_not_sure_which/,"Hi all,

I'm a CS graduate with a Master's and I've done a 1 year internship in the UK. I've been interviewing and received 2 offers, both look decent but I am not sure which way to go.

**TL;DR** Java, JS, less money, smaller city **vs** C#, Cloud (AWS), maybe JS, more money, bigger city

**Jobs:**

1. Java, SQL, (Potentially JavaScript too), £29k in a reasonably priced slightly smaller city next to Manchester - developing new features or improvements on mostly existing software. 6 member scrum teams.
2. C#, SQL, AWS, (Potentially JavaScript too), £30k + a C# course worth £4k (paid for by them) at the beginning. Located in a slightly more expensive city but very close to London. Cloud is involved, they have a lot of legacy systems are and building things from the ground up and putting them over to cloud. Remote working highly available. Agile but a bit less formal agile so the teams aren't fixed (I think?). Can put a clause in the contract for a salary increase (£2-5k) after probation period.

I am likely going to try to negotiate a relocation allowance for the second one, maybe even for the first one who might be open to it once they learn I have a 2nd offer. Otherwise, moving would be a pain in the ass and I don't know if I have the savings for it.

**Interview processes:**

1. Chat about me, what I want, etc (the usual), went over the role, went over existing code I had submitted to them previously from my GitHub (Not a task they gave me, but rather something I already had). A few very simple tech questions. Interview wasn't particularly hard and the code I had shown them wasn't particularly good either, it was just me messing around and experimenting, nothing production worthy. No tests, used recursion to handle something I could have handled with a loop, etc. Just messing around and having fun type of code.
2. Chat about me, what I want, etc (the usual), went over the role, did pair programming in C# with TDD and a fairly easy task that would take less than 5 minutes if I were doing it in a language I had decent experience with like Java. In reality took a bit longer.  Asked me a lot of hypothetical questions and / or situations.

Both were very happy to answer questions, covered my travel expenses and I didn't see major red flags.

**My experience:**

1. Bachelor's in Software Engineering
2. Master's in Advanced Computer Science
3. Internship 1 year with Java, MongoDB and debian dedicated servers (not cloud).
4. My C# is not good at all (think not even knowing what a property is until yesterday), but we did a bit of pair programming during the 2nd company's interview and apparently they were impressed with the speed at which I pick up C# and how I go about solving problems.

**Reasons why I can't choose:**

1. On one hand, I am familiar with Java and know for a fact I enjoy it. The location is closer and cheaper, so it's cheaper for me to move and is somewhat commutable from my current location (1h each way) so I can take my time moving closer.
2. Objectively speaking, the 2nd one is probably a better offer. Better location, a bit more money, more exposure to different technologies and remote working is apparently done quite often. BUT they do have a lot of legacy systems and I'm no sure if that's a good sign. They did emphasize that I won't actually have to write legacy code, but rather write the new product from scratch in C#.

**Questions I have for more experienced and more knowledgeable people.**

1. Assuming that my main focus is on expanding my skill set and becoming better, do you believe the 2nd job is better because of the wider variety of tech used? I am hesitant, because I am under the impression Java is far more popular than C# and may be more useful to me in the future. I've also read Java might be higher paid generally.
2. Would you be bothered by the knowledge that you'd be having to replace legacy systems and potentially having to interpret them. Though working with the cloud would be a bonus.
3. Are there any questions you can think of that I should ask before deciding?

I can DM more details like job spec, if anyone is interested, but I don't want to put them here so I don't just advertise the name of the companies.

I received both offers on the day of the interview, though they are apparently known for giving offers quickly if they like the person or so the recruiters say.

Also, waiting for more offers is not an option, I'm running out of savings. It's gonna be one of these two.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
bmxicm,169,2019-05-10,[Off My Chest] I was accused of sexual harassment and it ruined my life,MeTooToMeThu,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bmxicm/off_my_chest_i_was_accused_of_sexual_harassment/,"The background story is long and the draft that I have saved exceed more than 5 paragraphs, so I will let all that nonsense go.

Cutting to the chase, I was accused of sexual harassment about 4 months ago and it has ruined my life since then. It was the day after Christmas, me and 8 friends had been to a pub. The occasion was special because it was like a war coming to an end where the whole group (except me and another guy) unleashed fire at this girl for being a dick to a guy in class and almost getting him to commit suicide. Now, this girl has serious image problems and she just didn't accept that she was putting the other guy down by boasting off about how she has an internship in the 3rd semester of college or how her dad got her a new car or how many guys are *lattoo* behind her and shit like that. The guy loves this girl, the girl takes great advantage of him to the extent where she told him she loves him and weeks later, told him she meant it as a friend. Nazar na lage aise premiyo ko, bc.

But whatever, bottom line, she had image problems and everybody hated her. Me and the other guy wanted to get the group together and for some weird fuckall reason, change her and make her a better person. So we went great lengths to patch things up. Now, that day, out of all the days that I have seen on this planet, I was feeling really really sick because of the pathetic chicken that the pub served. It doesn't help that I had about 30ml of whiskey in me. I drink to the extent where I was scared I was an alcoholic, so 30ml isn't too much for me. But, I couldn't control my stomach and had to be on a toilet seat multiple times. My stomach was paining a lot and I decided to put a chair on the far end of the table which was easier for my multiple toilet trips. This girl wanted to sit next to me and put a chair there. Out of all the places in that restaurant, this was the only place that apparently the stupid CCTV did not cover properly.

We stayed there for 2 hours and during that time everybody was laughing and happy. After a week, college started and it was when I went to college I was pulled aside by two of my best friends who told me that this girl was going about telling people that I took advantage of her the other day we went to the pub. I was furious and I wanted to go talk to her, but my friends told me that the girl only will come and talk to me. Fair enough. They asked me to bunk the first half of college so that we can go talk to this girl. Again, I agreed. One of my friends called her and she asked us to come to her friend's flat near college. We went there, but she didn't show up. When we called her, she didn't pick up. And since we knew this friend, we went to her friend's flat and knocked. Surprise , surprise! Her friend knows nothing about this.

Half of my day ruined, I go back to college where this girl pulls me by the collar and tells me how I have ruined her life. She shouts and cries in the corridor and slaps me before running away. I couldn't process what happened and my friends and I just walked away. Luckily, nobody saw this happen. In the second half, one of my friends went to class and got her out to talk to me and she told me a story that literally none of the other 6 people on the table believe.

Apparently, I grabbed her chest, locked her hands, bit her neck and tried to make out with her. All this, when I was so sick that I could barely walk and I spent most of my time with my head on the table because of stomach pain. And remember me visiting her friend's apartment? That was apparently to threaten her to shut up. I was really keeping my cool, and I told her I was okay with going to the cops. Her boy toy had other plans, he wanted to get a bunch of goons and have me hacked to death right there. He started making his calls to ""guys"" and I just exclaimed ""what the fuck is going on?"". This was also used against me and the guy asked me if I was scared. His only negotiation was, ""you accept you have done it and I won't call the guys.""

I again offered to go to the cops, but the girl declined because the ""Cops Always Favour Guys"". OKAY FUCK IT, FAIR ENOUGH! I offered to take them to the pub, get the CCTV footage and check. Now, the CCTV was placed in such a nice location that if I sat on the chair a ceiling piece would cover me in the footage. There was only footage of me putting my head on the table. Accessing this footage was also a big scene where we had to lie that our phone got stolen from the table and bribe the manager to just be able to SEE the footage on their computer. I spent money to see me put my head on the table. GREAT! Now, remember, there was no conclusive evidence of any of this. She said she didn't want to see my face and I disgusted her. She asked me to stay away from her, never talk to her and I agreed.

I offered her to approach the Ethic committee in college (which is very serious) and tell them to take into account everybody's statement for the day to make a decision but she denied that also because ""college will side by you because you are a better student than me"".

Next day, she goes about telling people that I CHOSE to sit in a strategic location so that I can be hidden from the CCTV and MADE her sit beside me so that I can take advantage of her. And apparently I WAS SO DRUNK that I could not even sit and there was proof because I was sleeping most of the times. The smart person that she is, she doesn't tell this to any of MY friends. She has a much toned down version to tell my friends where I only held her by the hip and ran my hands through her back. 

She got some high of this. She started telling literally everyone different different versions of her fairy tale. I would love to defend, but I dont even know whom she is telling it to. I am hearing bits and pieces of it from people who trust me but even they can't defend me in front of other people because it would then be #VictimBlaming. She has gone and told one of my team mates in an elective of mine that my team mate has to be careful around me because ""he did stuff to me where he SEXUALLY took advantage of me when I was not in my true conscious"". My team mate, who is close to me and very straight forward, asked me if I had raped her.  O.O WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE INTERPRETED HER MESSAGES LIKE THIS.

THIS FUCKING GIRL RUINED MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE. I AM LEFT WITH NO FRIENDS. SHE BLACKMAILS THE FUCK OUT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE TO ME, TO THE EXTENT WHERE THEY PREFER TO STAY AWAY AND NOT TAKE SIDES! I have lost the courage to go out. Fuck alcohol, I am scared to fall sick in public now. What the fuck do I do? I am left with TWO friends. I was a fucking popular dude who knew how to talk to people, who made jokes, who fucking entertained people, who went out and had a fucking life. Now I am just this fucking ""rapist"" that sits at home thinking about if he should've not listened to his friends and independently approached the ethics committee.

If I justify myself when someone asks me, she tells them I am victim blaming and adds more masala to tell other people about how I am still ruining my life. This is like her BMKJ.  She tells people that I was frustrated because I loved her and the fucking reason she gives is ""otherwise why would he want to do so much for me by reuniting the group the other day"".

I AM FUCKING DONE WITH THIS WOMAN. I JUST DONT KNOW HOW TO RESTART MY LIFE AND DEAL WITH THE MESS THAT IS FOURTH SEMESTER OF THIS STUPID FUCKING COLLEGE. I think I am positively going to fail a subject this time. AND I have to tolerate this nonsense for four more semesters.

FUCK my life. Thanks for attending my Ted talk guys. BYE."

Pretty exciting considering I almost dropped out my freshman year with withdrawals in the first semester and failing the second. Naturally I was a year behind and I decided to switch majors. I’m now back on track for a 4yr graduation plan that I essentially did in 3yrs. Which I’ll be obtaining majors in political science and law and society with minors in human rights and forensic science. 

On top of that, for the past year I have maintained a couple different internships consistently for a year on top of managing school and driving 3hrs to the city every week! 

Then to wrap things up, I’ll be texting a U.S congressman today that I have (hopefully successfully) networked! 

Now I just have to have my graduation tonight! 

This is a big moment for me because I was able to do all of this without my medication! I wanted to prove to myself and hopefully one day to others that people with ADHD do not need medication to be successful. Often times my achievements with be down played because I take a “miracle” drug that makes me super smart apparently, I just wanted to disprove that it’s not something we need, it helps us be us, but by no means is the defining thing about us!

1(Easiest): Bank PO.  pretty certain I can clear all the tests and interviews cause I've been preparing the last 3-4 months for it. Also my main focus was on the RBI Grade-B exams but they haven't released a notification yet and I don't think its coming.

2(IT?): Always loved coding and have been doing it since I was like 12 years old. Owing to a couple of bad decisions in college(mainly choosing it) I lost touch with it mid way and really haven't gone back since. Even if I did go back to it I don't have the faintest idea of where I should start. Competitive programming? I mean i did solve the second and third questions for the ICPC online round 2 times(is that good?). I even got a couple of android apps from my first year in college. Some of my buddies wound up becoming slave workers but are now slowly and steadily gaining experience. One guy even suggested some test called elitmus(is it useful?). I'm one of the guys who chose engineering cause I really wanted work with computers but i just lost that love somewhere. I did enjoy coding for my final year project though.

3(useless imo). so that I didn't drop a year doing nothing I enrolled in a local management institute which is as bad as my engineering college(at least the fee is low). I even got an internship with Decathlon which wasn't that hard to get but still this options sucks.

Thanks for your replies(if there are any)."
bmyjq8,3,2019-05-10,Question about SWE career path of an anglophone student,theCavemanV,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/bmyjq8/question_about_swe_career_path_of_an_anglophone/,"Hi all,

I would like to ask some questions about SWE career path as an anglophone CS student. I’ve been overall successful in my coop internship interviews with Montreal based companies.

However, for full time position with more salary and more benefit, the bilingual requirement is less flexible. How can someone here from other parts of Canada successfully launch a SWE position without much French language skill? I’m doing my final coop this summer and also taking a Pre-intermediate level French class. I still would be far off from a professional proficiency since this upcoming semester will likely be my last or second last one here. From what I can gather, most people either move back home or work as a contractor with low salary (lower than average SWE).  would anyone care to share some experience?"

Not sure how to handle this one. I have recently built out a Shell script for new AD users that creates the user in AD, connects to our local exchange server to run Enable-RemoteMailbox on the user, and then sync it up with 365 to then license the user. We have a user that will be returning who was here about 8 months ago for another internship. I would like to delete the user object in AD and start over for this reason. We recently changed all users' email, UPN and proxyaddresses from our old domain to our new domain. So her old disabled account in AD has all the old information. I thought it would simply be easier to delete the user and let the script create a new user with all the right properties and settings. BUT! What will happen to the current ""blocked"" account in 365 that has the old domain suffix (@olddomain.com). Should I delete that there as well in 365? Or does that not even matter? Is deleting the AD user object enough? Just didnt want the script to error out when it came to the 365 part of the script. Thanks!!

I'm currently a rising sophomore in college and am looking towards IB for my career. I believe that I am in fairly good condition but I am scared because of the many forums I have recently read online. I come from an immigrant family, and my parents don't have wealth, and even fewer connections in the industry. I don't go to a target school either. I am scared that without the connections, it might be impossible for me to break in. I need advice on what I can do, and how I can better position myself for a career in IB. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Stats:

* College - ""Semi-target"" college with campus recruitment from middle market and boutiques. We do have a few students breaking into bulge bracket every year. 
* GPA - 3.8/4.0. Dean's List both semesters of freshmen year. 
* EC - Board Member of the school's investment banking club, VP of First Generation Student Society, Club sport, tour guide of my school 
* Experience - Worked as the financial head of a startup that my friend created, sales internship experience, remote finance internship this summer
* Ethnicity - Asian (therefore not considered a minority) - I can't get into the diversity programs. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I position myself better for my upcoming years and the accelerated recruitment?"

However there are probably some that initially planned on graduating this semester that will not be. There is absolutely no shame in missing your original graduation date and in some cases hold a few benefits. I graduated a semester late due to having to drop 2 classes my junior year and it might have been the best decision I ever made. Because I graduated late I had an opportunity to apply for an internship with a company that had rejected me in the past. That summer I worked that internship and was offered a full time job at its conclusion. While it does suck to have to go back to school for additional semesters they payoff is worth it. Engineering degrees are hard to earn but the opportunities they provide justify the difficulty. So if it takes you longer to graduate than your peers, do not get discouraged. Learn from where you failed and use your experiences to your advantage."
bn1q63,39,2019-05-10,TIFU by letting my dad get me a job and then leaving someone to die,datalaughing,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bn1q63/tifu_by_letting_my_dad_get_me_a_job_and_then/,"This happened about 10 years ago, and it was a long-drawn out FU that ended with what was, in hindsight, probably the worst thing I’ve ever done in my life. 

I graduated with my master’s degree in 2008 (that’s right, at the time of this story I was a grown-ass man who should have known better than to do the various stupid things I’m about to tell you about). After graduation I spent months looking for a job with no bites. It wasn’t a good time to be job hunting with no actual paid experience, and according to several interviewers I had, internships don’t count in a lot of people’s minds if you weren’t getting paid for them. I’d had to move back in with my mom, and a few months into things I was getting a bit desperate.

Now, my dad had been trying to talk me into getting into his line of work basically since I was old enough to hold down a job. At first that was oilfield work. At this time he’d moved on to working on power lines. I didn’t want to do the kind of stuff he did, and I didn’t want to work with him. I knew it was a bad idea, but circumstances conspired to convince me to go against my better judgment.

In September of 2008, Hurricane Ike hit South Texas. My dad comes over one day shortly after the hurricane to tell me about an opportunity. There was a storm job in the offing. See, severe weather is bad for a lot of people, but for a Lineman, it’s like striking gold. Hurricanes/tornadoes/ice storms, it all does bad things to the electrical infrastructure. Power lines snap left and right, poles get knocked down; it’s a big mess. Everyone wants their electricity back on, and everyone wants it on right now. So after a major event, the people in charge call in every company they can find to come in and help fix things quick. Base pay is good because it’s tough work, but for something like this, they throw in time and a half because of the urgency, distance and the risk. So my dad says they need extra hands. I’ll start off on the bottom of the totem pole, 16 hour days, tough work, and you never know where you’ll get sent or how long you’ll be there, but great pay. It was too good for me to pass on. I agreed. By the following afternoon I was learning to drive stick on a big-ass bucket truck in a convoy of the things heading down to the Houston area, an almost 8-hour drive for which I was also getting paid time and a half. 

I won’t dwell on the work itself too much. It was mostly long hours of boredom while I stood around (no one sits until the lineman is done) and waited for the guy on the pole to need something. Then I’d run and get it and wait some more. I wasn’t used to standing all day every day. As a result my feet were in full revolt after a couple of days, but they were paying me well. So I was ok dealing with it. The thing that made it clear very quickly that taking this job was a huge fuck up was my dad.

The two of us had never spent much time together. My parents divorced when I was 4. Most of my life I only saw him on birthdays if then. He was around a bit more after I graduated high school, but we were never what you’d call close. Now we were spending all day every day together, and he was my boss. Worse, he wasn’t a patient, considerate sort of boss. He’d mumble things and then get angry when I had to ask him to repeat what he’d said. He worked longer and harder than everyone else and expected me to keep up the pace. What really got me, though, was that he had to correct me on every little thing I did. “That’s not how you use a shovel.” “That’s not how you hold a sign.” “That’s not how you look down a road.” Seriously. He told me at one point to walk down to the road and see if I could spot any of the other trucks in our group. I walked over, looked right, looked left, and called back that I couldn’t see them anywhere. His response was to yell, “You need to look right too!” As if I was too dense to understand that a road went in two directions. I spent every day getting gradually more and more seethingly annoyed with him until I realized I couldn’t do it anymore. I didn’t like the work, but I could live with it. At the 9-day mark, though, I just knew that if I spent another day with him that I would blow up at him, and things would go south fast. The estimate they’d given me for the job was that it might last a month, maybe longer. I had to get out. So I called a friend who lived just north of Dallas and said, please, please, please come and rescue me. He agreed to come down the following day after work.

I only made it through day 10 because I knew I would be escaping that evening. I didn’t tell my dad until we were almost done. He wasn’t thrilled, but he was surprisingly understanding. So was the foreman in charge of our group. They both said things like, “Hey, this job isn’t for everyone.” “Thanks for your hard work.” “Do you need any help getting where you’re going?” They even complimented me because they said I complained less than any of the other first timers they’ve had. I guess I just kept all the complaining inside. Really, I think the foreman knew or at least suspected what none of the guys on the crew knew, that they’d actually be done and headed home in another 2 days. So if I left early he wouldn’t have to pay me for that 8-hour drive home. 

My friend (what a guy) made the almost 4-hour drive after he got off work and showed up somewhere in the neighborhood of 9-10 pm. I hopped in, and off we went, heading right back to his place. About halfway there, we switch off who’s driving because he’s tired, and despite the fact that I’m exhausted I’m more than happy to take a turn. He’s doing me a huge favor, after all. 

Here’s where the fuck ups start to pile on top of each other leading to the crescendo. I should not have driven. If you will recall, I, a soft (frankly out of shape) kid fresh out of school have just for the first time in, well, probably ever, spent 10 days in a row working hard on my feet for 16 hours a day. I’d gotten up at 4 AM that morning. I was beyond tired. To say I was not doing my best thinking would be a huge understatement. My brain was mush. 

I dozed off more than a couple of times while driving only to jolt back awake before anything horrible happened. If I’d been thinking straight I would have woken him up to drive, but my mind was like, “No, he’s doing you a favor. You’re not going to stop him from sleeping. You can do this much after what he’s doing for you.” So instead I pulled out my phone, plugged in my earbuds and started blasting music in my ears to keep myself awake. It kinda sorta worked. I didn’t doze off quite as frequently after that. Instead there were hallucinations. I don’t even remember now what they were. I just remember having to tell myself several times that that weird thing I thought I was seeing wasn’t real. I was just tired. 

Once I made it into the Metroplex proper, I was a little more awake. There were nice wide highways that were all lit up, and I knew we were getting close to the end of our trip. Just when I thought I was doing ok, the final act began. 

It was 1 or 2 in the morning at this point, and while some places in DFW can still be hoping at that hour, the stretch of highway we were on was pretty deserted. I only saw another car every now and then until, out of nowhere, this brightly-colored little sports car comes up. Not sure exactly what it was, except that it was very low to the ground and looked brand new, maybe a corvette. That at least gives you sort of the right picture. I’m in one of the middle lanes (thinking that will be safer if I doze off for a second), and I see this guy (I say guy. I actually just saw a car, could have been any gender driver, any number of people, but in my brain it’s always been one guy) for a second in my rearview coming along in the far right lane. He zooms across 4 empty lanes to pass me on the far left. I was going the speed limit (which I think was 70 or 75), maybe a little over. He blew past me like I was standing still. Must have been going at least 90, probably more. After he passes me, he sails back across 4 lanes to the far right lane again and disappears around the next corner. I was kind of pissed off, thinking to myself, what an asshole. I hope he gets pulled over (clearly not comprehending just how much of an asshole I was being by putting everyone on the road in danger by being tired). Then I round the next corner just in time to see his car flying through the air in the right lane. No idea what caused it. There was nothing else on the road, but I see the car flipping through the air. It hits, pops back up in the air, flips again, pieces flying off everywhere now. It was horrific.

A couple months later I’m back home talking to some friends, and the subject of accidents we’ve seen comes up. I’m reminded of this story and tell them how, not long ago, I saw what looked like a very serious accident. Once I’ve told the story, one of my friends asks what I’m sure many of you did just now. “What did you do?”

I’m taken aback. “What do you mean what did I do?”

“I mean, did you stop to check on them or call 911, or what?” 

“Well, I…” And that’s when the horror hits me.

So, what did I do? I pulled over into the far left lane so I didn’t get hit by any of the pieces and kept driving. I remember thinking, well, that’s what he gets. And I didn’t give it another thought. 

I did nothing. I was the only person around when someone got into a horrible car accident, and I did nothing. What the fuck was wrong with me? I made fun of this person in my head and then drove on without another thought. Was there anyone alive after the car finally stopped? How long did they wait there for help that maybe never came? Did someone or more than one person die because I didn’t stop or at very least call 911 like any decent human being would? Not even because I had some selfish crooked reason for not calling 911, but because in my sleep-deprived brain it never even occurred to me to do it? 

It’s been more than 10 years now, and this still haunts me some nights as I lie in bed. Sometimes I think maybe it was another hallucination. Maybe it wasn’t real. I could never find anything in the news when I looked months later, but I don’t really think that’s true. I’m pretty sure it really happened. I don’t remember any of the hallucinations, but this I remember perfectly. The biggest fuck up of my life, really the culmination of a whole collection of fuck ups, and when I think about it, I’m really sickened with myself. Makes me wonder if that’s the kind of person I am deep down, the kind that doesn’t give a fuck about the next human in line and whether he dies or not. I hope not, because I would really hate that guy.

TL;DR – I dun fucked up."

UBC is better ranked than UMD and no doubt UBC campus is beautiful but I got direct CS at UMD and moreover it is known for its research and CS faculty. So in my own opinion both universities are pretty much at the same level. Plus, I am 100% certain I want to do my masters in US. Bearing this in mind I had a few queries which I was hoping you all could help me out with objectively.

&amp;#x200B;

1) What is the entrepreneurial scene in Maryland like ? How well do student led startups do ? I want to create something and entrepreneurship is something that attracts me to the states which is missing in Canada (at least I feel that startups don't have access to resources in Canada. Please let me know if otherwise)

&amp;#x200B;

2) How is the scene on Hackathons like ? Are there a lot that UMD undergrads take part in ? I saw one on HackMIT but not any other

&amp;#x200B;

3) Can undergrads in their third and fourth year use the Iribe centre ? Heard that the building is insane 

&amp;#x200B;

4) How hard is it to find internships being an international student at UMD ? Because at UBC, I will receive co-op (a paid internship) which will help me cover my tuition and I will be graduating with 16 months of work experience. So compared to that how does UMD fair ? 

&amp;#x200B;

5) Will a US uni for my undergrad help me get into a good grad school in US ? Or a Canadian university is equivalent.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have the right idea regarding the opportunities that are available ? I know I might sound biased towards UMD and am asking a UMD group but I hope you all remain objective."

I recently moved to another part of the city for a summer internship. I moved into a house into a second floor room with a private washroom for $700 a month. The landlady and her daughter stay in a room on the first floor right under me.

At first everything was alright. However, as time went on my landlady started implementing more and more rules and requests to be followed. At first, I was making some dinner around 9 pm and she asked me to make dinner before 8:30 pm as her daughter (in middle school) sleeps at around 8:30-9. I told her it was alright for me and didn't think too much of it.

Next, during the first weekend, she messages me and tells me that I need to vacuum the room and clean the washroom once a week. Again, I don't think too much of it and agree.

When I make food, I usually like bringing it up to my room and eating it there. However, recently my landlady messaged me and told me to start eating at the dinning room table before 9:30 and told me that food aside from snacks and drinks aside from water were not allowed in my room as she was afraid it will stain the carpet. Additionally, she asked me not to shower after 9 pm as my room is above hers and she could hear it. I'm fairly certain she's been entering my room when I'm away at work as I ordered pizza one time and ate it in my room. I forgot to bring the box down with me the next day when I left for work and when I came back it was already in the recycling area. I don't have any evidence that she entered but I noticed some stuff was shifted around and that the pizza box was missing, I later found it downstairs in the recycling. That was the day she texted me about the food thing as well.

I know it's her house, but I feel really restricted by these rules as I feel like it really restricts some of my freedom and privacy. I started considering moving out to another place at the end of my month. It's only been a couple weeks in and I verbally mentioned that I would be staying for four months and I paid a deposit when I first moved in.

Furthermore, this is the first time I rented a room (I'm a student so I lived on campus before) so we didn't prepare a residency agreement beforehand. I understand that tenancy is still established in this situation by paying the deposit and rent and I took a look at my provinces Residency Act and from what I can understand I don't believe she can require any of this from me and definitely isn't allowed to enter without my permission.

What are some possible next steps here, should I find a way to document if she enters my room again? I have a feeling she's done it more then that one time."

* 2 years working in a research lab doing materials fab for quantum sensing/computing applications (know a lot of machines, materials processing, etc.)
* This summer I am working an internship at a startup which involves polymer fabrication for energy applications

I've finished my first intro course with an A, which basically gave a very broad overview of Computer Science as a whole, and then included a brief section on Python programming. But the issue I'm having is that I continue coming up with solutions that are inefficient, take way too many lines of code, or that would just generally make more experienced programmers cringe. I've taken the time to watch some technical interviews and I can't seem to grasp what the interviewers are even asking for in most cases. I know that I've only completed one CS course, and that my grade was good, but the struggle I had with programming makes it very tough for me to see myself in any well-paid career or internship in the next couple years. Don't get me wrong, I'm very passionate about the field, and I do love programming even when things get difficult. It's when things get difficult and *they're beyond my grasp to obtain a solution* that I lose confidence and get so stressed that it's counterproductive to even keep working on the problem. Additionally, I commonly see so many things discussed in this sub and others that I have no idea about or have any clue what they mean, which contributes to the feeling of being lost or off track. I definitely want to stick with this field, especially having come from poverty and having made it this far (two years into degree with 4.0, community college).

So I’m starting an internship next Monday as a Data Analyst at a large tech company, and have a working knowledge of Python, SQL, basic probability and statistics, Agile development practices, and a variety of machine learning algorithms. Overall, I feel rather comfortable working with data, from wrangling it to exploration and then on to analysis and interpretation of results. However, knowing what I know has only made me realize how little I know, so I was wondering, at what point does one know enough to really practice data science? I want to move into a Data Scientist role in the future, and, while I don’t expect to immediately be able to do so upon graduation from undergrad (CS) this fall, I would like to as soon as possible. I just feel like I’m stuck at this point and am looking for any encouragement or direction so I can try to figure out where I am relative to my peers, career goals, etc.

Thanks in advance!

TLDR; I know enough to know I don’t know much, how much is enough?"

My older sibling and I live in an apartment together near our college that we attend, and his health has started to get worse. He is required to do a certain breathing vest 2x times per day for 20 minutes,  but he is very busy and typically never does it (like I can probably count on one hand how many times he did it throughout the entire college semester). A few weeks ago, the doctor told him he had a bacterial infection in his lungs that would have been prevented by doing the breathing treatment. However, he just had a PICC line inserted into his arm (which, to my understanding, is just a way of delivering antibiotics into his body, I think it's something like a portable IV) which will be very complicated, as he has to refill it 4x per day. He is also starting a new internship on Monday, so I am rly worried that this new drug will harm his work performance (his mood has been altered my drugs in the past, and he is already complaining about being light-headed today after he got it inserted). However, the problem is that my parents have been unable to communicate to him how serious it is that he keeps up with his health, as whenever they bring it up he changes the subject. I think he is in denial about it. I know he knows the importance of it, as he is very smart, but he just doesn't like to think about. Does anyone have any advice on how my parents and I should communicate with him the importance of keeping up his treatments? As the issues will only get worse if he doesn't start being more consistent with his health."

Ideas?",DISTROpianLife,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/bn7t27/god_i_am_so_burnt_out_i_cant_think_of_what_to_do/," TL; DR: I got the promotion/position I always dreamed of, possibly at the wrong time ( divorce + health issue). I am beyond burnt out. But I don't know where to go next. Is this normal? Should I just try to take a leave of absence or quit without anything lined up? (more grad school debt: not an option; traveling for a year: I need health insurance after 6 mts)

About a year and a half ago, I got tapped on the shoulder for a pretty big promotion at the NGO I work with, going from a coordinator to a director. While I was excited about the promotion, I was also very realistic when speaking to the organization heads: the exiting Director had left a lot of unmet expectations and projects; our budget did not allow to hire permanent on-site staff, as a result we were stretched and had low morale; this made the standards the team would be held to were concerning. This was capped off with a very underwhelming pay raise, if it can be called such. They acknowledged my concerns, but said they had faith in me and agreed there would be a learning curve. However, on this last agreement, there was a sense that since I'd always been a more organized and self-directed performer, things would go smoothly.

They did, for the most part. The gains were tremendous. But a year and a half later, my team and I are burnt out. We cannot sustain a lot of what was done in that first year without putting our lives on hold yet again. Despite pointed conversations, our team is and will remain with minimal staffing and I will continue to execute in a dual Director/Coordinator role.  While I'm trying to make sure we focus on area goals and planning (not a forte with the previous manager, or really the organization as a whole), the organization heads either throw their own plans into what is set up for the year or respond to previously designed unattainable benchmarks with funders. Any time the concerns regarding sustainable staffing are voiced, they're talked down (as in acknowledged but not really understood) or turned into a discussion about something else (as in, a consultant can do that website for you...so just make sure you have 5 you can count on in case one is crappy). There's just not a real understanding of what our team does, it still gets written off as ""Oh but interns can do it"" (all well and good, except that in our US office, where I'm based, visa restrictions have whittled our interns down to one with a lot working remotely) or my favorite “Oh well as director, you just need to stop doing certain things so you can do look at the forest not the trees.” (ok but then they will straight up not get done and this is a funder related widget. Without these trees, there won’t be a forest).

Moreover, it's demoralizing to see when someone transitions from staff to management on other teams, their position is re-staffed. I get it...it's funding related. But right now, we are one of the teams dealing with the most expectations as it is public-facing work in two, sometimes three languages.  What we are asked to do hardly lives up to the reality of what we have. Lately, every day is a trudge through endless amounts of widgets set by donors. Mostly, I don't feel like any of my inputs count, so I save my energy for the things that matter. What is clear is that I don’t want anyone to burn out on my watch.

I know: I need to move on.  With the funding situation still so uncertain and the work my team does still so poorly recognized, I don't think I will get any of the extra permanent staffing I've been asking for. Furthermore, a lot of upper level staff quit in the one year I took on the promotion. New directors mean new ideas. Things are starting to pick up in ways that will soon become even more unmanageable.

But, when I think about it, to what do I move on to? The few highs, vacation and insurance package coupled with three personal crises (divorce, chronic illness diagnosis, surgery) that collided right as I was being promoted have kept me locked in. It’s always sad to think about leaving a place you’ve come up and grown in, mostly out of your own sheer force of will.  However, at the end of the day, I got nothing left. I dream about taking 6 months off to just figure out next steps because I don’t even know if I even want to stay in the same career. Maybe this happens when transitioning from a staff to director position that you see things in a…bleaker light? In any case, I’m learning that despite this being something I yearned for 10 years ago, now that I have it, it’s kind of soul crushing, I don’t have the will to seek alternatives at the moment despite always having had a plan and being driven…and I don’t know what to do.

bn8g2u,6,2019-05-11,"One year left, feeling nihilistic and not wanting much (Long)",TacoPanda34,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/bn8g2u/one_year_left_feeling_nihilistic_and_not_wanting/,"Before I get to college, I just wanted to say that my time in high school was very unfortunate. At the end of freshman year, I was on track for a likely spot in a top-20 university in the US (I'm an American btw). Then sophomore year came, my dad cheated on my mom, I lost a lot of close friends to private schools, and I guess the rest of my time there was not atrocious, but no longer a top-20 applicant's last 3 years if I want to put it simply. I graduated in the top 5% of my class, but I didn't even apply to many schools (3 in-state, and 1 out-of-state).

I left for my freshman year to go to a very large, mid-tier, in-state university on a partial scholarship with intent to study engineering as I had involved myself in honor society and STEM classes and after school activities, which I had a passion for. At the time, it was a decision that I made simply to just be away from my family because I couldn't deal with their domestic violence anymore. It felt so good to be away from them for once. I did fine freshman year, but I didn't really do much in engineering. Most days, I just went to class, did my assignments, played some video games, then slept most of my days off away. My dad got laid off at the start of my spring semester and I had to transfer back home to help my parents pay bills. I transferred to an as-large institution in my hometown (a traditional school, not a CC) also on a scholarship. I changed majors to economics and college became about working full-time during the day and on weekends while going to school at night. During the day, I would work as a substitute teacher and on nights and weekends I was an usher at 2 stadiums. I have done that up until now, entering my senior year. I have saved up enough money that I'm trying to focus more on school and interning or assistantships if possible.

I kind of lost belief in myself towards the end of high school. Coming out of middle school, I was very passionate about school and really didn't put much effort into succeeding as I guess I was a natural. I just couldn't concentrate without a clear head. I suppose with my case, it only made it worse as I have a very small family with nothing but immediate relatives and it got even smaller a few months ago when someone passed away. I've been fairly discouraged about getting involved at the collegiate level, mostly because I was mistreated by toxic friends for most of my high school time. It was kind of sad too seeing some of my closer friends when I was younger heading off to some higher tier institutions than myself. I kind of look at it from an Darwinist perspective that I was just one of the less fortunate/capable and like not everybody makes it to top-tiers and just live with that.

To a certain extent, I don't really think I could have thrived anyways at a top-tier institution because I find myself culturally poor and intimidated by competitive environments. I look at LinkedIn and at friends I had when I was younger who are graduating and going on to great grad schools or the employers that everyone wants to work for and I see now how they already had parents in high places. Many of their parents were already engineers, doctors, attorneys, professors, etc. My parents never really figured out what they wanted to do; they both are salespeople. My mom hasn't been employed anywhere for more than 5 years and there have been times where I had to help my dad find a job. The only thing I was ever really culturally-rich in from my parents was sports, but I have a very delicate body and quit all of them when I started high school. Even when I was away for my first year of college, I kind of felt that I couldn't relate to other students as many of them spent time doing fairly lavish activities (of the legal ones) outside of school. The smallest of issues are such problems for my parents, to the point where I literally just find the quickest, long-term solution before it starts an argument or interrupts me.

To another extent, I kind of feel disappointed and that I'm missing out on those top-tier environments. At my current school, it's mostly a minority-serving institution (I'm also a minority btw). Only half of the students graduate in 4 years and there's a lot of kids that don't even bother coming to class most of the time. I've made friends outside of school but I guess they are the wrong crowd. I've talked to this girl from Michigan for about 2 years now and she dropped out after 6 weeks and then I also have been talking to some younger dudes from the UK (we like soccer/football) but they are very much into drugs. I wished I could have been in much smaller environments in school, but each of the schools I have attended have had 50,000+ students and ~40 students in each of my classes. Most of the more elite schools take fewer students in general, but they cost more to attend since the faculty ratio is much lower. And I didn't feel *that* extra cost would have been worth it to me.

Last summer, I took an introductory CS class to try it out and I really enjoyed it. I would have graduated this past spring with just economics, but I decided to pick up CS for an extra year and go more in that direction. I actually got 2 A's in my 3 courses so far and a B+ in the intro course last summer. At this point, I graduate next spring, and I want to do graduate school for CS; my undergraduate degree is not from a reputable institution, and I want to be sure that I can go as far as possible with CS. I am thinking about just staying at my current institution as their graduate CS program is more geared towards either an academic career or a private-sector career, and I suppose I'm more in the direction of the private-sector career, and the program is fairly small and people have gone far. I'm hoping to be a software engineer in the petroleum industry, cybersecurity, or in infrastructure. I have a 3.66 GPA and have made the Dean's List every semester, but I don't really have anything to put on my resume outside of that. Since I was working as a substitute teacher, I was thinking maybe I could sell myself in the direction of education (although I am not intent on going for a PhD); I really did enjoy working with kids, but unfortunately, I couldn't take the ones that were so low on the performance spectrum that mistreated me and their inability to learn anymore. I tried every method to help them, but it just didn't happen. I've applied to some undergraduate research assistantships at my university, but I haven't received any responses yet. I'm thinking for the fall, I will likely continue teaching as a peer tutor at my university or taking an internship if I can secure one.

Most of the recent problem for me is what I was told is **nihilism** in that with everything that's happened to me, I kind of have just lost interest in almost everything. Like even with my family and stuff, I don't even take interest in their conversation anymore. To be perfectly honest, even as I finished up teaching a few weeks ago, that was my mentality. Walk in, take attendance every period, and leave at the final bell. I truthfully didn't even care anymore about student's progress as I was fed up of being mistreated by under-performing students. Even being home on days off, I don't even leave my bed for more than a few hours; sleep makes everything go away. The only thing I really get excited about anymore is like watching/following sports (like I'm really excited for Championship Sunday tomorrow in the Premier League) and spending time with the few people I have as friends. I was kind of hoping that if I could secure one of those assistantships, it would be great for me because it would mean more time with a professor or research team and less time in my house with my family. Truthfully, I derive my happiness from relationships with other people and others wanting me to be around. I kind of thought about CS and took that intro course because I heard and knew there was money there, but at this point, it's not even the money that I care about since I am good at it. I need money to live; I don't live for money.

I would like to see myself making it to and through a graduate CS program, but recently, it's become such a struggle in my senior year of undergrad. One of my classes this semester is entirely online and I haven't even touched the content yet (classes began this past week) and my in-person classes are kind of in the same boat. I also have to take the GRE at some point before December and I haven't even started looking into it yet. I'm just looking for advice on where I stand, if I'm too hard on myself, etc. I guess this is all recently my own fault in a sense for establishing ""culture"" into myself of hanging with the wrong crowd, spending most of my time off sleeping, and not really being too involved from the start. Just let me know what you have to say. Thanks.

**TL;DR:** I've had a fairly rough recent history at home with domestic violence and a past of few friends and being involved to the point of burnout. Kind of off to a rough semester in my senior year of CS and struggling to see my way into grad school as I have good grades, but nothing else.

Update (5/12): I touched my work for that online class and finished it at 9PM. It was a little less than I thought and not such a drag."

I have questions regarding financing in Germany as a Student.

&amp;#x200B;

About me :-

I am an Indian student.

I would like to do Bachelors in Germany. ( Computer Science / Applied Computer Science ) ( Dortmund /  Kaiserslautern /  Saarland /  Koblenz )

&amp;#x200B;

I know and have read posts about blocked account.

My dad my  savings total only 14000 Euros.

&amp;#x200B;

As I have to open a blocked account of 9000 that leaves me 5000 Euros unblocked in bank account.

I have B2 German and 4 month work experience as intern web developer.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions :-

1.Should I come to Germany with 14000 Euros or drop my dream ?  (Is it a good plan or risky)

&amp;#x200B;

For Bachelors do they demand for 9000 Euros at first time (Most have said this)

but few have said they want to see (9000\*3 = 27000 Euros) in Bank Account only than they give residence permit.

&amp;#x200B;

2.Will I be able to get a job in Germany (Mini Job or Student job ) and earn money in the first year to support myself for second year and show proof of financing at the time of visa renewal before second year ?

&amp;#x200B;

3. How easy is it to find a minijob in first and second semester ?

And then a part time or student job in cities like Dortmund or Kaiserslautern ?

4.After first year we have to renew our residence permit and show proof of financing ( Is proof of financing only in the form of blocked account of 9000 Euros again or there are other options ,

Like 5000 Euros in bank account + let\`s say I get a mini job or student job before the time to renewal ? WILL my permit be renewed or I will be deported from Germany ?

&amp;#x200B;

[5.Do](https://5.Do) they only renew it for whole one year ?

If some student has eg. 5000  Euros blocked account will he be given a permit for next 6 months or sent back to home country )?

I hope you might have got an idea that my worry is that is coming with 14000 risky or I would be able to support myself after few semesters (As Bachelors is 3 years ? )"

My role would involve doing typical research analyst work, with a focus on data analysis.

One of the big questions was to walk them through a data project I did in the past. I prepared for this question and so I was able to walk them through a project I did. I was a little nervous because the project leveraged some pretty advanced techniques that I knew I could get crushed on if they tried to probe me for the itty bitty details, but thankfully, they didnt.

Unfortunately, one of the interviewers found a fault in something I did in the project (so as to not identify myself, I won't get specific). To be honest, when I submit this project, no one pointed it out, and when I presented it to over 20 people, no one said anything.

But it was definitely an oversight on my part and I can't believe I did such a simple mistake. I simply admit to it, said it was an oversight, and said how I would avoid it in the future.

Aside from that, interview went well -- I was asked some follow ups and I confidently responded to them (with what I believe were logical answers).

I can't help but think that when they discuss my candidacy, the interviewer is going to open with:

""I can't believe he made that mistake... We definitely can't trust him.""

I know I should just wait it out but its really hard (especially when this is the one thing I think I messed up in the interview) and I really wanted this position."

I appreciate all of your feedback! :D

Starting off, I'm a student pursuing a computer science bachelor's and statistics bachelor's degree. Almost finished (2 semesters left). Arrived here 11 years ago. 

I've been searching for internships and applied to many online postings on our University sponsored handshake. I've also met with recruiters, shook hands, handed resumed and kept good contact with them. I've gone through several interviews and got rejected at the part where I tell them I'm not a citizen. 

I've been hearing that internships are super important, but unfortunately have been declined by many.

Where I live, there are a lot of tech companies, banks and insurance companies.  And I have many friends who got accepted to a lot of these places and received offers (consistent $80K starting). So the ecosystem does exist here. 

Essentially, my question is what can I do improve my cs career skills and bring experience on my resume?  Are there good unpaid internships that provide valuable experience?

My current path is to find some research with a college professor, and finish the combined graduate program that they offer at my university. However, I've been hearing on this sub that there's a lot of graduates out there who haven't found jobs. Is it harder to get a great starting job as a graduate?

I appreciate all the responses."

The program I applied to would run from late March to end of June which was fine for me(kind of pushing it though) because I know the summer before senior for cs students is supposed to be your greatest intern and expect an offer in the fall yada yada BUT I did not get selected, big sad :(

So now the only other programs that my school offers for Japan are the ones that run into late July or even early August. My question is it worth it? I talked to a counselor and she legit said I shouldn't go but it was ultimately my choice whether I want personal growth fulfillment or to better my professional life. Obviously it's a tough choice, I've had study abroad in my list of to dos for several years now but I'm also a career-driven person and it's ughhh.

Some background: Computer Science major who applied to several Ivies and T20 schools. Got waitlisted by Cornell and Georgia Tech (still waiting to hear back) and accepted to state school (Clemson). I have strong academics/extracurriculars (1560 + few national-level awards), however, due to applying really late to Clemson, I received no financial aid (except for Palmetto Fellows). If I had applied earlier, I am confident that I would have received generous financial aid.

I know taking a gap year is unusual, especially here in the United States, but after some deliberation, I am now seriously considering taking a year off after school. I outlined my reasons below, but mainly, I will be able to reapply to colleges, get a much better financial aid package (and put the money saved partially towards my gap year), and gain valuable real-world experience. The question that now arises: how can I use an entire year off from school *productively*. 

Benefits of a Gap Year

\- Firstly, a chance to re-apply to colleges and Clemson honors (again, applied too late)

\- Receive much better financial aid 

\- An extra year in terms of development over peers (more maturity and experience)

\- Opportunity to travel or gain work experience

\- Take a break after high school without jumping straight into college

Drawbacks

\- Can't really think of anything major

I could spend a year abroad traveling, improving my language skills and being exposed to different cultures. This will give me more self-awareness and will give me time do decide what I really want to spend the rest of my life doing. However, traveling is expensive and I think it would not be the most productive way to use my time. 

I want to use my year to pursue something academic, such as a research or internship, but I can't really find that many - especially in the field of computer science. While researching programs, I came across coding camps oriented for gap-year students where you can learn programming, but these programs are also really expensive. I am also considering self-studying/taking online college classes for credit.

Has anyone here had experience taking a gap year? If so, is it worth taking the path less traveled by or should I just go straight to college? Does anyone know any good gap-year programs (particularly research/computer science)? Right now, I'm completely open to ideas and will appreciate any advice."

I'm in a very tricky situation that's stressing me out, and I don't know what to do. SORRY in advance for the wall of text. 

I'm currently at a tech startup. We're a very small company with 3 officers, 1 employee (me), 1 contractor, and a few interns. We're roughly at the post-seed pre-series A point, although our actual investor situation is a bit abnormal.

The officers have bent over backwards for this company when money is tight, and a number of them haven't seen a paycheck in a long time. I'm currently the highest paid employee, and I have roughly 1/6th the amount of equity that the cto and coo have.

It's a small chunk, roughly 0.5% of the company, which has a roughly $5m valuation.

I'm an engineer in a very competitive field. Companies have positions for roles similar to mine that take 4+ months to fill, even companies that tend to move very fast with hiring. My salary is on the low end of what's considered competitive for what I do in the context of a startup.

This past fall, the company hit hard times financially. I agreed, in a signed contract amendment, to defer all of my monthly paycheck, with an agreement that I'll be paid back when the company raises $300k. I ended up deferring around 30k.

They started paying me this past January at my standard salary through March. At the last minute in April, after I was supposed to be paid, they told me that they had very little in the bank, and everybody's going to have to take less until they raise another 500k. They're less than 100k away from reaching the 300k we agreed on last fall, at which point they'll have to pay me back my roughly 30k that they owe me from this past fall. They're very close to getting this 100k, they just have to meet one of the milestones set by an investor. I do have the option to take this as equity.

I love the company and don't want to make things worse, and I have faith that we'll make it through this.

My issue is that I've already deferred 30k, which in essence means I'm holding on to 30k in very high-risk interest free debt. Not only do they want me to hold on to this debt for longer, possibly a lot longer than initially agreed, but they want to defer even more pay, adding to this debt they owe me.

I'm financially able to do this, but it will really put a strain on my savings account, which I'd like to use as a downpayment for a home in the near future. 

I've asked a couple of times that they increase my equity if they want me to continue to take on this risk, and make all of these compramises and sacrifices. The CEO is unwilling to budge, and he can get quite rude and aggressive, although I do understand that he's under extreme stress.

I will be very hard to replace, I'm not sure if they really understand this, and my absence will really fuck up the company. I don't want to leave.

At this point I want them to either:

a.) Bump my equity stake from 0.5% to 1.5% (3 year vest). This is not an unreasonable stake for a very early employee with my skill set. At the current valuation, 1.5% isn't worth a whole lot, and if they want me to continue bending over backwards, taking risks, and making compramises, they need to really ""bring me in"".

b.) Give me the option to trade this deferred payment for equity at a very large discount, roughly 30% is what I'm thinking. 

c.) Pay me my normal salary, in this case I MAY be willing to take the 30k in equity. I don't care if the founders have to dump their own money into the company. I'm an employee and I've already made huge compramises. If they're not willing to do one of the above, pay me...

The ceo's head may explode if I present him with these options.

Is he being unreasonable? Am I being unreasonable?

EDIT: This is a publicly traded startup, that's why it's an abnormal investor situation. It also means that the 5m valuation can jump by 20% sometimes in a single week b/c some rando decided they'd be willing to pay X for shares. It's a very different kind of  ""valuation"". This also makes it hard to raise money. A lot of investors love the company and think it's a good opportunity but are uncomfortable with us being public and therefore won't fund us."

I'm a new grad, so I'm wondering if I could stay for 6~ months and be able to find something better and much more easily with that experience? My only real reason for wanting the position is the commute which is only 25 minutes from where I currently live.

I got the offer Friday and have been doing nothing but thinking about it over the weekend, and have until Monday to decide. The pay is about $12-15k under market value for new grads(upper 40s). I don't want to take something though and lock myself in for a year. Would 6 months experience at an actual professional job be good enough for most companies to start turning heads towards me, and instead of me wanting to interview with them it would be the other way around? It's using a very relevant techstack, so I wouldn't be learning anything useless, and since the dev team is really small I'd actually play a role in development rather than just fixing bugs.

Just curious on what others think because deciding on whether to take this or not has been really hard.

Edit: To add, I have internship experience but it's IT related. Every interview I've had(phone/in person) has asked me about this, but I don't think it's a real influence for them."

&amp;#x200B;

* I (22M) am currently residing in the UK (North-East Midlands) and living with my parents while working as a graduate software developer (currently 9 months into the role), earning £28,000 (with the added bonus of a company vehicle).
* I have a First Class Honours in BEng Software Engineering which I obtained in the UK, in the summer of 2018.
* I also have 1 year of industry experience (as part of my placement/ internship year at university) at a substantial global software company.
* My strongest fields of experience includes JavaScript (Angular, React, TypeScript) from my university industry experience, hobby projects and university studies, ABAP (SAP) from my current role and Swift (iOS) development from university and hobby projects.
* I have a relatively diverse portfolio on GitHub which also demonstrates my proficiency in multiple programming language and technologies such as GraphQL, Blockchain and augmented reality mobile development.

I'm very happy with my employment right now but desperately want to move abroad to live with my SO (21F) who's from Ukraine and currently resides there.

She is wanting to study abroad for her bachelors degree in English Philology and I had the idea of moving in with her while she undertakes her studies. I decided that I would cover all of the living costs while she studies full time.

Having done research into potential European universities that teach specifically in English, we’ve narrowed it down to several candidate nations &amp; cities:

&amp;#x200B;

* Sweden 🇸🇪 (Malmö, Kristianstad)
* Netherlands 🇳🇱 (Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden, Groningen, Nijmegen)
* Czechia 🇨🇿 (Prague, Ostrava, Brno, Olomouc)
* Hungary 🇭🇺 (Pécs, Szeged, Debrecen)

&amp;#x200B;

There is also the option of Poland (Warszawa and Kraków) but we consider that as plan Z at the moment. Poland is a nation that my SO despises and will only move there as a last resort - sort of thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I only speak English and have a very limited proficiency and understanding of Ukrainian &amp; Russian while my SO can speak fluently in English, Ukrainian, Russian and Polish (languages are her strong subject). She aspires to be an interpreter or a teacher of the English language while I want to remain in my field of expertise, software engineering/ development. Her current highest level of education is a ‘Dyplom Molodshoho Spetsialista’ (Diploma/ qualification of Junior Specialist) in Pharmacy. In other words, she is a qualified pharmacist who wishes a career change.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m excited about moving abroad but also very worried that I might not find employment to cover the cost of living for the both of us while living in the above mentioned cities. She is wanting to move in the very near future (approximately 6 months time).

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have savings of around £14,000 + my own vehicle (not my company car) which is also estimated to be worth around £4,000 - £5,000, and my parents may be able to provide a small contribution towards our living should we move in together in the near future. So as for our budget, anything that is covered by my salary basically.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal preference would be to move to Sweden, but in case my SO is not able to secure a place at a Swedish university, I have to be open to other options.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering that I’m currently (not sure for how long) an EU citizen, as far as I understand (and correct me if I’m wrong), I have right of residence and work in any EU nation - which means that I can freely move and work anywhere within the EU, as long as I have means of supporting myself financially.

This is substantially different for my SO, because Ukraine is not currently a member of the European Union - which complicates things for the both of us.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Will my SO be able to join me without a student visa if I move to one of the EU nations I listed above?

This is in case she is not able to secure a place at a European university. I imagine this would be fairly difficult to achieve but not impossible? I don’t know.

&amp;#x200B;

2. What is the likelihood that I will be able to find a decent/ well paid job that would be able to support us both financially, in one of these nations/ cities? - considering that I only speak English.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Are my skills considered desirable in Europe?

4. What would be considered as a fair salary for someone of my age, experience and education in the above nations?

5. How much would I expect to pay for a two bedroom apartment in the above mentioned cities (as a rough estimate)?

6. Depending on the nation and location of course, but is the cost of living considerably higher than in the UK? Do any of you currently reside in one of these cities?

7. Is there anything else that you would recommend I consider before committing myself to moving abroad and living with my SO? Anything I should know about?

8. Any other nations or cities we should both consider?"

I’ve been consistently applying to 4-5 jobs every other week (applying for positions one week and then spending the following week calling the jobs I applied for to try and get the hiring managers to see that I really care to get the job). Except for one interview I had for a hotel receptionist position, absolutely no one has gotten back to me. Now it’s almost time for my next semester of school and I won’t have any money to pay for it.

I’m 20 years old and it would be my 2nd job. I worked at Walmart for about 6 months but I had to quit due to mental health problems (depression and social anxiety don’t mix well with retail jobs). The extent of my resume is admittedly limited and besides Walmart it’s mostly full of volunteer jobs. I volunteered at a local drive-in theater in which my jobs was to direct over 300 cars into their corresponding parking spots, I worked as an intern for a wedding videography studio where I mostly edited videos and photo shoots, and I volunteered at a local animal shelter where I was essentially a janitor. 

I think part of what makes this job searching process difficult is my depression and anxiety, but I’ve since become so desperate to find a job that I’ve been applying to jobs that I would normally be adamant against applying to because of my mental health issues, which was the exact same thing I did when I applied to Walmart and that didn’t go so well as it drove me to feeling suicidal. 

I know that 90% of the job industry is waiting but my patience is being tested. Any advice?"

Money isn’t an issue. I have got a good scholarship in UMass and my parents are willing to help me. I’ll also be working part time throughout wherever I go. 

I’m just a bit torn between them because personally UMass seems a lot more fun whereas UWaterloo concentrates on making you more employable with its co-op facilities which also appeal to me. Also. I really can’t decide which one is best to achieve my final goal that’s based on factors concerning a work visa. 

If I go to UMass. I plan to graduate early with an internship or two. Look for a job in my OPT period. If it doesn’t work. Do a masters and specialise in AI and ML because that field really interests me. Anyway. I plan t utilise the training period again. If all else fails. Use my PR to get a job in Canada. 

If I go to UWaterloo. I plan to complete all work terms. Which will take about 4 years 8 months. Then I’ll try to get in the industry. 


My goal after college is to land a great job. Preferably in the US. Preferably sooner than later because my end goal is to become financially independent and go into research. 

I guess, my only question is which university do you think I should choose? I’d really like to hear your recommendations."

bnv3aj,2,2019-05-12,"Looking for a career path with prestige, fewer years of education/cost, flexible. I'm so lost.",pouryour,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/bnv3aj/looking_for_a_career_path_with_prestige_fewer/,"* I don't know how many posts I've made like this and I don't know how to ask for help at this point, so bear with me as I speak from my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need to make a new career path in my life. I have been completely unhappy and unfulfilled with mine so far, but have downright severe and relentless indecisiveness. I need a lot of help. This post became long. I tried to make it easy to read. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What information to I give here?** 

* I am looking for something that gives me a sense of prestige, intelligence, achievement, and ability to feel better than others-- (Not at all to be conceited, but for my poor self-image. I am very modest.) I want to feel good about what I do.
* I am pretty sure I don't want to go to school for 4+ years more unless other aspects are strong enough. I already have a 4-year undergraduate degree.
* I prefer something with more geographic flexibility, not only region to region, but even internationally and online/remote. 
* Money is lesser of a motivator, but to start at around \~35k USD/ year and growing over $50k USD/ year with time I think I can live with. (This comes from a Midwest perspective. I would like to try and live modestly in a major city, so salary may need to adjust.)
* I prefer something with variety. Something where I'm not at a desk all day, or at least not every day. I have never needed to leave my chair in 2 years in my current position. Something where I can get out of my office/building. 
* I welcome the opportunity for travel. 
* I prefer to not spend another arm and leg for education/training. As mentioned, I already am in debt from an undergraduate degree. If other aspects are strong enough, this isn't a hard requirement. 
* I am pretty sure I don't want a laborous job in a factory, construction, etc., though I think I enjoy working with my  to hands, best example is cooking and baking. 
* I think I most enjoy seeing my work creating something in front of me, and seeing the thought/item come to life ex. cooking/baking, graphic design (I've not done, only created items in InDesign), playing and producing music. 
* I don't want a job that destroys /preys on our environment. I don't know, logging, land development
* I hope to be in an industry with a variety of people who are open minded. I have suffered from a false perception that people in say, engineering or computer science are nerdy, boring, too serious and *not my type.* I work in a position now though in which the people really aren't my type. 

**What do I like?**

* Historically I have considered
   * Meteorology (Always been fascinated by atmospheric sciences. Enjoy reading about the workings. Don't know about being on TV and chained to a station. )
   * Environmental Science (I care deeply about the planet and nature. I find plants very interesting)
   * Computer science or web development? (demand, geographic independence, I'm good with computers on the software side. Curious about how everything I use works)
   * Law School (not a lawyer) (Fighting for causes I believe in and defending those I feel are being wronged)
   * GIS, urban planning, something in this area (Enjoy exploring maps, demographics, data on maps. Fascinated with public transit)
   * Music production and performance (majorly considered) (have always loved and been fascinated with music, dream job)
   * Graphic Design (creating a product, being creative with visuals)
   * Marketing research (I enjoy looking at demographics and research about people)
   * Chemistry (I enjoyed it in high school, it made relative sense to me)
* These have crossed my mind as well
   * engineering (I struggle to understand exactly what it entails), botany, supply chain management, nursing (hours, vacation, pay, demand, camaraderie), chef, travel agent.    

**I enjoy as hobbies in free time:**

* Working out and *trying* to bodybuild
* Cooking and baking. Being creative, following recipes, but often tweaking and testing my own ideas
* Travel, especially abroad in South America and Europe
* Studying foreign language (fulfilling, makes me feel smart too)
* Playing music and *trying* to produce music, learning about music tech, synths, etc. 
* Listening to music
* Nightlife and entertainment, concerts. 
* Photography (amateur)

&amp;#x200B;

**What do I already know?**

* Degree in marketing (4 years ago). (I honestly remember a couple facts, and it was all theory. I never felt like marketing was the thing for me, but thought it would bring lots of options and flexibility. Resulting job prospects were not me)
* Communications internship (writing for the internal employees of a company. I haven't had any serious writing practice since.)
* Logistics experience (Very narrow duties and experience. Have picked up a few terms and concepts)
* Very basic InDesign skills (I have since forgotten without using it). 
* Music production (very amateur. Need to relearn. Have not been able to practice due to time constraints, motivation).
* Exercise (I guess I know generally how to perform movements correctly and generally what to do in the gym)
* Spanish (Intermediate level. I struggle with spoken communication most)
* English grammar (Pretty good. I double check a lot, though. )
* I think that's about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions you might throw my way are extremely appreciated. And advice on how to get there. I'm very lost and have the worst indecisiveness you would ever encounter. I struggle from an inferiority complex/ embarrassment, especially compared to those in STEM fields."
bnvcff,7,2019-05-12,"First Internship, Bully Program Manager",Stdcrnt015,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/bnvcff/first_internship_bully_program_manager/,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't really sure if this is the right place to post something like this but I'm looking for some advice. This will be kind of a long story just as a warning. So, I'm going to be interning next month and got this internship through a company that helps connect students to major companies who are looking for interns (so, I didn't apply directly through the company I'm interning with - it was like I had an ""inside connection"" from another company that told me about the internship).

&amp;#x200B;

The people where I'm going to be interning have been nothing but kind and understanding. I can't say that I've had one bad interaction with anyone from this company. However, my problem is with my program manager from the other company that told me about the internship  (she's basically like the ""middle man"" between me and the company I'm interning with). I've been working with my program manager for 4 months and she has been nothing but, to put it bluntly, mean and condescending to me every time I talk to her. No matter whether our conversation is via email or telephone, she always has something mean to say, but I just kept ignoring her until a few weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

We had scheduled a ""monthly update"" so that we could talk on the phone about any important information regarding the internship. Apparently she wanted me to call her first but I honestly was not aware of this. So, I waited for her call and then sent her an email asking if she wanted to reschedule since I didn't hear from her. She sent me an email back stating that, ""\[My name\], you have been my student long enough to know that I always have my students call me first."" Then she asked me what availability I had to talk again. I told her I was not aware that this was her policy with her students and I'd keep it in mind for our future conversations. Then I rescheduled a time with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, when I talked to her the next day, she was not happy with me. She asked me, ""What was yesterday about? Is something wrong with your brain? You've been my student long enough to know that I always have my students call me first."" I told her that things had been hectic because of final exams and that if she had told me to call her first, I honestly must have forgotten. Then she started laughing loudly into the phone and I just sat in silence. Then she asked me, ""How long have you been my student?"" I said, ""Since January."" She said ""Hmph, yeah"" in a way that seemed to say, ""You knew you should have called me."" Then suddenly she got serious and said, ""Yeah, but seriously I may call you sometimes if it's something urgent but usually you're supposed to call me."" I just told her that now I knew that for future reference.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this last exchange was  the last straw for me. I thought her behavior was really inappropriate and her comment about ""something being wrong with my brain"" really was offensive because I actually just lost someone who was like a second mom to me to stage IV brain cancer so for her to say that was just...completely disrespectful imo. Furthermore, she expects me to act perfect but she keeps asking me when my start date is for this internship (even though I've sent her the information multiple times) and she didn't even know where I lived (she had me marked down as a student in an entirely different state) and tried to argue with me about where I lived.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been ignoring her behavior for months but now I am not sure how to handle this lady anymore.  Like I said, I won't be interning with her (thankfully) but I will have to talk to her whenever she has these ""monthly updates"" or whenever she wants me to talk to her. So, that's why I'm reaching out to this subreddit today - I'd like to know, what do you all think I should do in this situation? Should I just keep ignoring her and keeping things polite until the internship is over? Should I see if I can get a different program manager? I'm honestly at a loss here and was really excited about this internship, especially since it's my first one, but knowing that I'm going to have to be dealing with her for 3 more months just makes my heart sink every time I think about it."
bnveho,0,2019-05-12,Duke Full Ride vs Princeton,gauntletd,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bnveho/duke_full_ride_vs_princeton/,"Hey everyone! I'm in an interesting situation. I have to decide between getting a full ride from Duke versus paying about $26k a year for Princeton. Princeton will be affordable for my parents (wouldn't have to take out any loans).

Here are the listed benefits for the Duke scholarship:

* A loan-free financial package for four years, including:
   *  Tuition, room, board and books
   *  Travel to and from the university between semesters
   *  A laptop in the first year
* A fully-funded, six-week summer academic experience on campus, which precedes the first academic year at Duke and is designed to facilitate the transition from high school to college
* Enrichment funding for special research and experiential projects
* One-on-one mentoring from Duke faculty and older students
* A series of professional development seminars
* A community of faculty, fellow merit scholars and program staff devoted to helping recipients succeed and pursue a fulfilling journey throughout all four years of college

I'm looking to study perhaps mechanical engineering or computer science (but may very well change) but I'm just not certain whether or not the benefits of the Duke scholarship would offset the better alumni network, prestige, and opportunities that Princeton would open.

PRINCETON PROS: ivy league reputation, incredibly strong alumni network, proximity to NYC, heavy undergraduate focus, residential college system (though I know it's not that tightly knit), higher ranked for both my intended areas of study and overall

PRINCETON CONS: would have to pay about $26k a year, pretty cold (I'm from the south), possibly more work and stressful than Duke, not a fan of the suburban setting, eating clubs seem meh

DUKE PROS: fully paid for, including travel; arguably nicer weather; scholarship requires me to do things over the summer (building my resume)l; allows double majors (which I may want to do), accepts more AP credits

DUKE CONS: not a fan of the fraternity social scene, not as prestigious as Princeton, would have to miss a portion of an international family summer trip for the six-week academy (which we've been planning for a while), don't really like the suburban-ness of the surrounding city

What I'm curious about is how competitive internships, study abroad, and research are for undergraduates at Princeton, and whether or not they would be paid for by the institution.

I visited Princeton for their preview session, but didn't get a chance to tour Duke.

Thanks for any advice!"

But I was curious about how I can GREATLY change my chances of getting into my dream colleges. Right now my resume looks awful, all I have is that I’m in marching band, I took one AP as a freshman and that was AP gov and for that I got a 3 on the exam, no clubs, a business that I’ve made the name and website for but that’s about it, around a 3.7 GPA unweighted (which isn’t awful per se but it could be a lot better). I have three AP exams this coming week and I haven’t prepared for anything at all, which is kind of stressful rn because they include AP Lang and AP comp sci a, which could be important to college since I want to major in cs. I’m completely awful at history and language arts, those are by far my worst grades and I honestly don’t know why I took AP world this year.

The thing is that I straight up haven’t been paying attention to school. At all. I haven’t once studied this entire year, my homework grades in most of my classes are horrible. The only class I’ve actually payed attention to is computer science, cause I love everything about it. Obviously in the future if I improve my grades, that would be great, but considering how much the last two years could influence my college apps, I need more. Another thing is that I’ve loved coding for my entire life, I often like to code in C++, Java, and Python, which I learned a lot about from studying the textbooks from MIT courses which you can just buy online. I’ve created a lot of projects here and there but nothing influential. I’m very good at math and stuff related to cs, but that isn’t very obvious with my grades. 

Seeing my brother graduate from Georgia Tech and knowing that in about a year, I’ll be a senior has made me start to realize that I’ve got to get my shit together. Talking to my brother also made me realize this, because he was in the exact same boat as me (no shade and if he finds this he’ll probably kill me but he didn’t know what an AP was until the end of sophomore year) and was able to get into GT, but he told me that the acceptance rates for higher colleges are going down rapidly (he told me like 2-3% a year) and if I want to get into a college even close to that caliber I have to distinguish myself a lot more. There are tons of prominent clubs at my school that I could join and possible become leadership in (maybe president of a few clubs that relate to cs because my relationship with my cs teacher is great and he knows all about the stuff I’ve mentioned, but it’s still just a maybe) include honor societies, and I live in an area where there are lots of opportunities for me, including small internships and community service. I’m also a very social person, but social in the kind that I get along with a lot of people easy, not that I’m very active. 

My parents want me to get into a good college but never actually care about what I’m doing to get there. As long as they see that I’ve got As or high Bs in my classes, they don’t care, which is pretty easy for me even when homework is bringing it down like 7-10 points. 

What can I do?

Thank you in advance, sorry for the long post
TLDR; have done nothing in school but kept 3.7 unweighted, good at math and comp sci but not apparent with grades, want to get my shit together so looking for shit to do over the summer and the next 2 years to get into UC Berkeley or mit"

I will starting at UC Berkeley in the fall studying computer science.  I am already working for a company as a wordpress developer, but I also get to see/help with the business and server sides of things.  I know Berkeley is really good with the theory of CS, but isn't the most practical so I plan to keep my current job and find an internship somewhere to increase my practical skills (I have already been offered one by Intel).  

I also plan to take design/cogsci interface courses, and take leadership positions in competitions(Berkeley hosts a huge hacking event I'm super excited for), definitely get involved in research and maybe minor in economics.

I have been teaching myself programming and electronics forever and took/am taking CS classes at my local CC so my working knowledge should help me handle everything.  This really is my passion but I'm not without doubt.  I'm not a genius but I am competing with them at UCB.  Anything can happen in the next four years and I'm trying to set myself up for success.

This is the job list/salary of 2018 graduates from Berkeley with a CS major.  I'm pretty excited about the average salary I see listed there, but I'm hoping to not be average in this case.

bnx4kx,72,2019-05-12,Just graduated and I already feel like I've done everything wrong.,QueenSkunky,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/bnx4kx/just_graduated_and_i_already_feel_like_ive_done/,"Here I've put four years into my degree and for what? Im desperately looking for a job, a career, a goal, a damn life, but everything I look at turns my stomach. I want to go back to grad school but I don't know for what. My major for the past four years has become tedious and vile. I honestly don't even know where to begin. I have hobbies, such as painting, gardening, and writing, but I'm not particularly talented at any of them, especially not enough to pursue them as a career. I've graduated college and have no social life; I've made plenty of friends, but they all seem to fade away after a while despite my best efforts. I am struggling in every aspect of my life and don't know how to turn it around. I keep looking back, dreaming of doing things differently, but I can never place exactly why. To what end? I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

Though everything I know about myself crumbles like sand the moment I reach out to make sure its still there, here is what I'm working with:

I have my bachelors in anthropology. I liked archaeology; I loved it, in fact, but over this past year I've come to the realization that as much as I enjoyed studying it, actually working in the field is not what I want. I applied for internships and field schools and poised myself for a lengthy career in the field; though I was accepted, I could not find it within myself to go. This was perhaps the first in a long list of choices I have made that I hate myself for. I have no interest in anthropology beyond studying it, but who am I to decline an opportunity when I don't know what I want? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that in the future I would like to try wildlife rehabilitation. However, seeing as I currently live with my parents and they are less than fond of the idea of me taking in animals on their nice hardwood floors, this is not feasible at the moment. Not to mention, the pay isn't great. I imagine this will be a side job; a hobby I take on in the future. I am trying to find so much as a volunteer opportunity near me that works with wildlife, but so far have found nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned, I have plenty of hobbies. I enjoy painting, but it is a very fickle, urge-based passion. I really only paint maybe once a week; I wouldn't say I'm particularly amazing, but I am fairly good at painting certain things. At least, I like them, and maybe that's enough. I like writing, fiction mostly, but not enough to pursue a career as an author. I like gardening; I like houseplants. I enjoy baking and cooking, but I've been in such an awful headspace recently that for the past three months or so nothing has come out right in the slightest. Even boxed baking mixes have gone wrong. Its discouraging to say the least... so I don't bake much anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Career wise, I know I don't want something that's 9-5 if I can help it. I need to be invigorated and allowed to express myself, but that doesn't mean I'm against rules and order. I like a mix of predictable and unpredictable and, most of all, (though I realize this is unlikely until I establish myself in a career somewhere), I want to be in charge. I don't like being told what I can't do and I know I thrive in leadership roles. I do well with occasional, somewhat-predictable stress. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I have right now in terms of the future is a dream: I want to live somewhere with a lot of plants; somewhere sunny, with enough wilderness to last a lifetime but close enough to civilization that I can still explore there, too. My house will have lots of windows and dark curtains, in case I decide there are too many windows. I have enough land around me that whatever creatures I bring into my home are comfortable and happy, myself included. There's a pond in the corner; a turtle lives there, but he's a free bitch, he can come and go as he pleases. I want a spouse that loves me; someone kind and gentle. I have work, but not because I have to work: in this dream, I am rich enough to live comfortably and quietly. This work is intellectually stimulating and exciting while not being excruciating, like a cup of black coffee.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how  to get there. I feel so lost. I don't even have an ""if you could have any job, what would it be"" job; I never thought I would be so directionless. I'm lucky enough that my family recognize my frustration, though they don't understand it, and are more than happy to allow me to continue living at home and will support me until I find myself. I just don't know where to look. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the block of text. I don't want to worry my folks too much with this stuff. Please just... where do I start?"
bnx79r,6,2019-05-12,Are my ECs good? What if I can’t do any more?,nile45,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bnx79r/are_my_ecs_good_what_if_i_cant_do_any_more/,"Hi, I’m a HS junior and this is my first time posting on this sub. Sorry for the long post which will follow, but I need advice on what to do because in my opinion, my extracurriculars so far are not that impressive (I will list them at the end with details), so I’m trying to do more things for senior year.

I have my eye set on one EC in particular, which is my state Youth Commission which I believe I am well qualified for and could be appointed to, but my mother refuses to allow me to sign up because she does not agree with the requirement that I would have to travel 3 hours to the state capital a few times a year. The deadline to sign up is this Friday. I am also trying to join Key Club next year (which is also an option for obtaining community service hours to graduate HS), and do a summer tennis camp, but she has been noncommittal regarding both. I believe she feels like these conflict somehow with her schedule, although she doesn’t seem that busy to me. 

I have no idea what to do next, and I want to know if my current ECs will suffice for schools such as USC, LMU, Oxy, or Chapman.

———

CyberPatriot:
9, 10: In 10th grade, I was my team's co-captain, and we reached the highest tier (Platinum) and competed at the state level. This was the EC I had devoted the most time to per week.

Key Club:
9; I was only a nominal member because I had joined without my mom’s permission, so I did not participate. If I join next year, I would be a more involved member.

City Youth Commission:
9, 10, 11: I am the chair of my city’s Youth Commission since April, and before that I had been the Vice Chair since September 2017. I was the de facto chair for most of 2018 since the actual chair was rarely in attendance, and her eventual term expiration.

National Honor Society:
10, 11: I was more involved with this club sophomore year than I am now because it interferes with work and I also feel like the club has become worthless since the former advisor left.

NAACP Youth Development Program:
10: I was very involved with this program and I was elected its secretary, but I was only involved from roughly October to December 2017. However, I officially remained an NAACP member for one year thereafter. I might still be a member because I am still receiving issues of The Crisis magazine.

Toastmasters Youth Leadership Program:
10: It was a workshop structured as a club. I was elected President and recognized for being the only member to attend all meetings.

Computer Challenge:
9, 10, 11: This is a well-attended event held yearly at my local community college which is a competition in various computer-related subjects. I have only won a few awards at this event: 5th in Computer Troubleshooting in 2017 (two-person team), and three 1st place awards in Computer Keyboarding, Information Security Theory, and Cybersecurity - Non-CyberPatriot in 2019.

Internships and work with my school:
Rising 10, Rising 11, 11: I worked at my school in summers 2017 and 2018 in the summer school program, the first year helping 4th graders with academic subjects and assisting in Garden Club (which also included tending to the chickens at our school) and STEM Club, and the second year running Robotics Club. I will be doing this internship again this summer. I currently work at my school for the aftercare program, and I primarily help out (at a more minimal level) with LEGO Club and Intramural Sports Club.

Senior year and others:
Besides what was mentioned above, I have been considering doing CyberPatriot again, and also taking the National Latin Exam, but both seem to be dependent on my mother's approval.

In the past, I have done many minor activities, but unfortunately, I didn’t keep a consistently updated list of ECs back then."

&amp;#x200B;

More seriously, I recently switched industries and I am going back to get a masters in CS. I am close to a major military base and so most local jobs are government contracts and the government loves formal cs degrees (my undergrad is a humanities).

&amp;#x200B;

I started seriously coding in January studied most of the prereqs for masters programs this last semester (data structures and algs etc.)

I was hoping to land a full time job where my employer will pay for my degree. After some interviews I was offered an internship at 2 different companies. The one I accepted was a little less money but they said they would switch me to full time after 90 days.

On to my question. I have a suspicion they might not be switching me over to full time as they mentioned. After talking to my supervisor (he is all for switching me to full time and says I am doing great, he is the only one who interacts with my code) I am not on the schedule for my 90 day review (my supervisor looked it up for me). It is about day 45 now, and I was hoping to get hired full time around 60 days. I think the company is just cheap. They don't even give free coffee. They pay less than most other local companies (based on glass door).  I enjoy working there, but I need more than I am currently making to make ends meet (ie switch to full time).

I was thinking about looking for another job to push them towards offering me the full time position. I have heard they have offered people more money to stay, but typically less than the other company. I would plan to not mention the amount of any other offers hoping they would come up more. My only concern is I am only an intern and this might look bad being there for only 45 days (probably closer to 60+ when an offer materializes). I know the company is a little desperate to hire people. I didn't do that great when interviewing with them and they still offered me the internship. They have around 100 coders and are looking for 50 more.

Do you think looking for another position sounds like a good idea? Do you think it will have the intended result (them offering me a full time gig)?"
bo0e8x,5,2019-05-13,How good should our skill in C/C++ be to tackle challenges in hardware/firmware programming?,xtpw,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/bo0e8x/how_good_should_our_skill_in_cc_be_to_tackle/,"Hi fellow students and ECE enthusiast,  


TL;DR:

Having experience in C via Arduino and basic techniques but very limited experience programming in pure C/C++.  
This make me hard in gauging my own ability in C/C++.

How good should our skill in C/C++ be and How can I improve?  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  


&amp;#x200B;

I have a little conundrum here regarding how to gauge our (practical, real world) ability in a certain field.

There are many internship positions for hardware/firmware programming in C/C++ which I would like to apply but I am not sure with my ability.

So far, I am just using Arduino to program uC and VHDL for FPGA and pretty much familiar with MATLAB to use it as a magical calculator and plotting features. With these, I can get the job done (in school life).

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is many internships prefer C/C++ on their specific hardware which, I am pretty sure, do not use an Arduino sketch.

I did some tutorial in C/C++ in websites like codecademy and have no problem understanding them because those are very basic techniques like flow control, data types, etc. 

Some users in uC forum suggest to translate arduino sketch to C/C++ but I find that is hard because I do not have HW debugger and Oscilloscope. let's just assume I do not have access to those in the university.

This limitation makes me hard to gauge my ability whether I am worthy enough to apply for an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question, 

1. How good should our skill in C/C++ be to tackle challenges in hardware/firmware programming?

2. What can I do to improve my skill in hardware/firmware programming especially using C/C++?"
bo1957,6,2019-05-13,Am I being the unreasonable one here?,JisooEatsKimchi,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/bo1957/am_i_being_the_unreasonable_one_here/,"Hey reddit,

So I'm currently in a rocky relationship with my parents, more specifically my mother since I live with her as my parents are divorced. My whole life I've always had a bit of a strained relationship with my mother. Till the end of high school, whenever I was scolded for bad grades (anything below an A-), she would make up to me by buying me something I wanted and/or took me out to my favorite restaurant. The scolding would be either just verbal or sometimes when I talked back, it would get more physical. Nothing too bad just a few slaps and thrown school binders, but given that I'm taller and bigger than her, it would only hurt for a day or two.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm in college, she doesn't really resort to anything physical. However, when I do move back in during breaks, she enforces a 12 AM bedtime where I should be in my bed and asleep. When she sees me playing video games, depending on whether or not I did anything to piss her off that day, she promptly goes to the router and unplugs the router for the rest of the night and sometimes for a few days. When I ask her to stop treating me like a child, she refutes me by saying that I should stop acting like a child. I never hated her by all means, she's my mother and she's provided for me. My main issue deals with her justification with her treating me the way she does when we get into heated arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 20 and go to university on a school aid that pays for 85% of the tuition because of our financial situation. Before, all my money was from holidays and monthly allowances but I rain into arguments with my mother so I got a student job at the library. Which my mother was very against because I ""should be a full-time student and the job will distract me"". With all these paychecks, I save most and spend some to hang out with friends during the school year. When I want to buy something expensive (more then $200+) I still have to ask permission from my mother. And when she says no, I tell her that I'll buy it with the money I save up; but she gets even angrier saying that that's her money that I'm saving up and spending even though I have a job now. When I argue that it's also the money I save from work, she scoffs and tells me that a student job's wage is a joke even though I work 16+ hours a week and normally save for a month or two to buy what I want.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a whole year since I've gotten my license and I was saving up to put a downpayment on a car since fall of last year so that I don't have to use Uber/Lyft to get around. Honestly, I just want a car. I live in a town where everything is pretty far away from each other and the public transportation system here is not well established and doesn't really go to any of the places that I want. Also, when I stay at home, my mother defines it as me being lazy and not doing anything with my life. Thanks mom. If I could just drive to the beach or a town over, I would probably just sit around in my car and enjoy the view and take a break from the constant nagging and scolding.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I landed an internship at an animation studio that's a 40 minute drive from my house and my dad told me that it might be time to get a used car for the internship. But after talking with my mom, she told my dad and I that I could drive her car while she takes my aunts to work. I was a bit skeptical about it, but I agreed since I didn't want to waste the time or energy to argue. I took driving lessons, since my mother didn't want to let me use her car to practice for the year I've had my license.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, my mother breaks it to me that I have to drive with her there and then Uber my way back home, essentially digging into my car funds. At this, I got heated and reminded her what she had promised and she told me that I'm not being grateful enough for what I have and everything she's done for me and how much of a terrible daughter I was for treating her this way on Mother's Day.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm just asking myself if I'm being the bad guy and thinking I'm childish? I don't really know what steps I should take to come to a compromise. 

Sorry if it got super ramble-y it's 2AM and my thoughts are every where."

bo2jxp,4,2019-05-13,"Young Adult Future Advice, Please",MonzterSlayer,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bo2jxp/young_adult_future_advice_please/,"Hey Everyone,

I hope you’re having a great day! Im hoping to get advice from as many people as possible to decide with what I will do with my life very soon. I have created a similar post previously, but posting again to garner more advice and different view points. 

I have just turned 18, senior in High School and will be graduating in June! With that being the case, my mother is making it mandatory I go to College because she feels it’s the best thing for me. I’m living with my parents and they take care of my expenses, but they require me to attend College for that to continue. 

Let me give you some background about myself. 9th Grade, I created a YouTube channel which did decent during the Pokémon GO days and made me $3,000 within one month. That was my first ever success at making money online. Then I took a break from YouTube. 

I then got heavily into reselling Supreme &amp; Yeezys. During that point I also found Open-Sourced (&amp; licensed) software which I sold to help people in the reselling niche. I made decent money off that but stopped last year. 

Since last year I’ve continued working on my YouTube channel, learning TONS of the in and outs of YouTube, and began growing my audience once again, over 20,000 subscribers. During this time I have created a website around a game I play which I sell products and services to my fans. From that I’ve made $3,000 in 3 months. (Not much, but it will grow)

That’s a short summary of my 4 years through high school. Everyday I’ve been working on something or learning. I’m not the ordinary teenager in my opinion who has fun and enjoys high school, I’ve literally worked the entire time on building myself and reaching for money. 

Now, my future. I do not want to attend college at all. I have $20,000 from my deceased father and my mother is telling me I should use that for college. Honestly how I feel currently, I’m very angry being forced into college because I don’t want to attend and pay for that at all. I truthfully believe that I can become something if I’m able to put my full effort into myself and my businesses. I believe the main reason that I haven’t reached the point where I wanted to is because I honestly don’t have enough energy everyday to do everything I need to do. Waking up at 5AM and getting 4 hours of sleep for 4 years has made my energy level deplete to 0. I went from being super motivated 24/7 to being tired and lazy. 

What do you advise? I believe college would be the safe way, I’d attend a community college to save money, but I don’t know what I’d take. The only thing I have in mind is Marketing because it’s something I can improve my own businesses with. 

In my perfect world I’d be able to take a gap year. Make an entire plan and goals I’d like to achieve during that year and save as much money as possible. Execute everything I’ve been wanting to do and begin college classes during the summer since they’re quicker if I haven’t reached my goals. Im also looking into Marketing Internships which id prefer over college and honestly enjoy, even for free just to learn and possibly get a job later, if not the knowledge is worth it. 

Thanks for your time and possibly advice, have a great day!"

I'm in my early 20s, go to a good school , have working experience in the industry and have been a part of some interesting projects. Since I've started applying I've had 2 face-to-face interviews out of god knows how many applications. I've had maybe 5 companies respond with some sort of test, but the rest of them has been instant rejections or radio silence.

If I was getting rejected after technical interviews or take-home projects I wouldn't have a problem because at least then I would know where to focus on improving myself. But right now I don't even really understand why I'm not getting past even the initial screenings.

bo541u,2,2019-05-13,Man... How do ya'll do it?,Bdubs21,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bo541u/man_how_do_yall_do_it/,"Hey all;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a lurker here for some time and I'm really looking for some advice regarding my current situation and looking for what others have done who've been in similar positions. First a bit of background:

&amp;#x200B;

\-I'm currently a 23 year old college grad with a degree in Sports Recreation &amp; Management, graduated a year and a half ago and after an internship with a local minor league sports team, I got hired by a technology firm in a sales role selling IT solutions, phone systems and copiers. Of course with my education background it was odd getting a call back from a technology company that I had zero experience in to start, but with my background in sales, I figured that was the reason. 

\-Jump ahead to the job I'm currently in. Flat out.... it fucking sucks. And by that I mean the actual job and responsibilities of selling copiers. Granted, I've talked with many people and copier salesmen are sought after for the simple fact that if you're successful in copier sales, you more than likely have the ability to be successful in any role, especially other sales roles because of how difficult it actually is. The pay is good ($40,000 base + Commission) and the commission can be unlimited. My specific company compensates bonuses monthly and annually based on performance and if you hit quota or not, so the earning potential is rather high. We currently have around 70 reps and easily 25+ are making 6 figures, some in the $200,000-$300,000 raise purely based on the fact that we're an emerging name in the industry that has grown quite a bit over the last 10 years in our region (Midwest). 

\-So far in the 7 months I've been here, I've done quite well to say the least, hitting my quota 4/7 months and currently at 128% plan for the year, so I've made decent money, but day in and day out I'm so physically and mentally drained it's starting to take a toll on my body and state of mind and it's clear. Instead of working the normal 40 hours, I put in around 60 by working on the weekends and staying late to try and catch up and plan out weeks in advance. I honestly feel like the only reason I've been successful so far is because of the hours I've put in and if I hadn't, I wouldn't be where I'm at revenue wise currently. 

\-Now the more in-depth stuff. Aside from the job responsibilities and all of that.. the culture here is easily the worst culture I've experienced in my young career. Each day coming into the office I can literally feel a physically feeling of anxiety and nervousness from my manager and reps who have been here longer. The pressure given down from above is so intense and so consistent that each week there's 2-3 instances of talks regarding activity and performance, no matter how well a rep is doing. To say we're micromanaged is an understatement. We're expected to hit a certain amount of activity just like any role, but if we don't we have reviews weekly, sometimes twice a week in which case we're asked about our activity and why we haven't hit the expected amount yet. To me, it's extremely over the top and causes unneeded anxiety and nervousness each day. I also am not a fan of how the company handles letting people go. Since I've been here, in the 7 months, we've had 5 people quit/get fired completely based off activity out of a branch that only has 6 total people in it. So the turnover is high, I've just lucked out so far with a couple of sales that went my way. 

\-Now to the reason for my post. Because of the constant micromanaging and pressure of sales almost daily, I've been actively looking for another job in hopes I can find one rather soon. I've heard so much to find a job you love, even if it doesn't pay the best, rather than a high paying job that you hate. That couldn't be more relevant now. The struggle I find though is based off of my experience, I'm having a difficult time finding opportunities. I've scoured LinkedIn, Indeed, company websites and have now applied for almost 40 jobs with only 2 call backs, from positions I wasn't necessarily TOO interested in. I ended up having an interview for both, and the one I was hoping for more straight up said my experience (or lack thereof) limited me compared to other applicants. That was for a mortgage loan position with a local bank. I've really been focusing on industries, or more specifically positions that is more laid back, more structured, and COMPLETELY out of the traditional sales role. I've been focusing on banks positions, IT positions (have a bit of background) and really anything else that I can just go into work, do my job, and not worry about it after 5 o'clock. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL'DR; 

So I guess my question is, what have you done or what advice do you have for someone in a position of hating their job, looking for something more structured in a a role/industry that has advancement opportunities, completely out of sales but little to no experience in?"

You stop fitting in with your family. You change and they don't. The way you talk about things, the places you go, and things you know are all different. My family doesn't even listen to me anymore, as I only have ""college ideas""

What does that even mean?? I am the same person I was before I left, and believe the same things, i can just articulate it better. But why does it matter if i'm basically barred from conversation? if now i'm annoying to the people around me. 

I want to share everything I learned! I want to connect with my family, I want them to be proud of everything I've accomplished.  It's not like i am lecturing them or correcting them, I'm just talking about things I've done or experiences I had in college like a normal person. But the more I learn, the more I go to school, the further we drift apart. 

I'm not sure why I didn't see this coming. They were confused why I went to college. They didn't understand why I chose Economics. They don't get why I do internships and volunteer and travel. They weren't even proud that I've made deans list every semester. 

It's just really hard to feel out of place at school, and then come home and know that you're out of place there now too. College has divided me between two places, and now I will never truly fit in either."

I’m currently a college student studying IT focusing in Networking/Cyber Security. I’ll be starting my senior year in the fall, and should be graduating spring 2020. 

My university requires me to get an internship in order to graduate, and I was truly lucky/blessed to land a position at Raytheon BBN as a System Admin intern over the summer. I say blessed, because I have ZERO experience, ZERO certs and they’re paying me extremely well (25/hr).

I realize many people start at Help Desk positions, possibly unpaid, so I consider myself truly lucky to have this opportunity with such a good company. 

My question is, what are the chances I move up from here? Will other companies see it as just an intern position and expect me to start as Help Desk? Or did I jump the ladder luckily and I can only look up?

bo88et,3,2019-05-13,Master's degree in Finance (+Bachelor's in Management) with no perspective of getting a job in the field. What should I do?,RodasVRTX,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bo88et/masters_degree_in_finance_bachelors_in_management/,"Hello redditors!
I'm a 26 year old Finance graduate (Bachelor's in Management, Master's in Finance) with no job, no direction on where to go and no ""plan B"".
Let me tell you a bit about my ""track record"" before I go off on my desperate plead for advise on what to do next.

I enrolled in a top University at my country in Economics. Things weren't going so well and I changed to Management for two reasons:
1) The content of the courses was more ""hands-on"" (if that makes any sense) with courses that involved more Calculus and Finance instead of History and Macroeconomics.

2) I failed miserably during my first year and a half (point at which I decided to change) and felt I needed a change in teachers, classmates, courses, basically everything. 

Looking back I probably should have just changed Uni since the one I attended for my Master's degree is more job oriented and less ""this is what and how things have been taught for the past 50 years so deal with it"".
I finished with a below average GPA (12 out of 20) and was having some trouble finding a job after graduating. I decided then to apply to a Master's programme (something that is pretty standard nowadays around these parts, finishing your Bachelor's and going straight into the Master's mainly due to Bologna degrees coming into place, my opinion on that is pretty much irrelevant but I think it was/is a complete mistake by the Universities in Europe). My Master's degree was the opposite of my Bachelors', I focused on being at the top of the class not only grade wise but also in understanding how things work. I graduated from the Finance Master's with a good GPA when compared not only with my previous stint but also with my peers (4th best in the programme, 16/20 GPA).


After that the obvious path was getting my ass to work. I thought I had developed my skills enough to be (at least) considered for Investment Banking, Corporate Finance/ M&amp;A Boutiques, Wealth Management companies or the Big 4, but I guess I was wrong. The few interviews I had weren't that good and I ended up not getting a job for a while after finishing my studies (July 2018). Fast forward a couple of months (October), I applied to an international internship programme and I passed all the recruitment phases just to get to the end of February (this year) and be informed that a suitable match was not available for me. I was completely devastated (still am honestly because they gave me 0 reasons and 0 feedback about it) and left in a situation where I have no job and most companies have already finished their recruitment and were already hiring for September.


Thinking (idiotically) that any job was better than nothing, I ended up in a shitty company doing a shitty administrative job that required as much skill as taking out the trash. (EDIT) One important issue I had was that I wasn't hired to do administrative work, the job posting never mentioned it and in both interviews the job description did not match the actual job. I quit that job because it was driving me insane, messing with my personal and social life and overall turning me into someone I'm not and that I don't aspire to be (at least for my well being it was a good decision, criticise me all you want, the pay was close to none, the skills were, again, close to none and it wasn't going to get me closer to anything since the company has a really bad reputation and has been in financial distress since 2013).


Regarding other work experience, I never did an internship during the summer (another regret I have) or during my dissertation/ final project/ thesis/ whatever you want to call it (again, wasn't called for interviews and we had a limit of 5 companies we could apply to [bureaucracy bullshit from my Uni] so I did it the old fashioned investigation way) and the only ""work"" I've done is on my parents' farm (something I've grown to like a lot and that at least relieves my stress and has me thinking about something positive). Money isn't exactly an issue since we can make some bread on the farm selling wine and wood (especially wood, last month we made 11k and the wine production isn't that much [around 510 litres/ 135 gallons] with constant decreases due to diseases on the vineyard) but I would like to do it the same way my dad does it, as a ""compliment"" to his actual (former, he's retired now) career and something to do on the weekends and get away from it all. Regarding that issue I'd personally like to get into the farming business with a specific fruit (I'm not sharing everything lol) with which my cousin has made a small fortune.


Another thing to add and that is extremely important is that there aren't many Investment Banks, Finance Boutiques or Brokers around here despite being the 2nd largest city in the country. Everything is centralised in the capital and due to my father's increasing age and decreasing health, allied with the farm issue, I'm more reluctant than ever to relocate.


I'm now considering Real Estate as an alternative, given the ""investment"" and ""valuation"" factors involved with the area but I feel I would be letting myself down if I did that. I'm also considering HR as a short/medium term solution since I don't have a super analytical profile; I like to deal with people, I'm good at creating empathy and despite being a bit nervous when meeting new people I tend to leave a positive impression if they give me the chance to. Another thing I'm considering is a graduate programme for a home improvement and gardening retailer that has given a close friend of mine a good head start in his career (he's in sales however but has spoken wonders of the programme and said it was great to get started and to develop his commercial skills).


I've learned that I don't want to work as an administrative nor in accountancy and that my accounting skills are pretty much the basics I needed to get through my Master's degree (checking financial statements for information useful to do a company valuation). I also honestly think I spent too much time on my hobbies (and smoking weed) during my Bachelor's and too much time focusing on my grades during my Master's. 


I'm hoping that a kind soul is out there and can advise me on what to do with my life given the information I provided. Regarding short term plans I'm going to see my Uni's psychologist (only next week she's on vacation now) and I'm also going to see my psychiatrist pretty soon (I recently quit weed [over a month and a half already, yay on that issue] after 10 years of daily wake and bake) to see what he says about things. Tomorrow I'm going to a friend of my mother's company (Logistics) to get a feel on what they do as a company and what each function is inside it as I feel my Bachelor's University did a terrible job not only in preparing us for the workplace but also in informing us what each job possibility is after graduation.

Any help and advice is welcome, I know I'm an idiot but I can't change the past, only the future. Have a nice day everyone and sorry for the long post :)

TLDR: Master's degree in Finance with no job and no perspective of getting one in that field; below average GPA on Bachelor's, above average on Master's; no previous internships or relevant work experience; considering other fields but feel like I would be letting myself down after spending time and money on a Master's degree."
bo8d11,3,2019-05-13,Feeling completely lost and without direction after Bachelor's in Management + Master's in Finance and no job. What to do?,RodasVRTX,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bo8d11/feeling_completely_lost_and_without_direction/,"Hello redditors!
I'm a 26 year old Finance graduate (Bachelor's in Management, Master's in Finance) with no job, no direction on where to go and no ""plan B"".
Let me tell you a bit about my ""track record"" before I go off on my desperate plead for advise on what to do next.

I enrolled in a top University at my country in Economics. Things weren't going so well and I changed to Management for two reasons:
1) The content of the courses was more ""hands-on"" (if that makes any sense) with courses that involved more Calculus and Finance instead of History and Macroeconomics.

2) I failed miserably during my first year and a half (point at which I decided to change) and felt I needed a change in teachers, classmates, courses, basically everything. 

Looking back I probably should have just changed Uni since the one I attended for my Master's degree is more job oriented and less ""this is what and how things have been taught for the past 50 years so deal with it"".
I finished with a below average GPA (12 out of 20) and was having some trouble finding a job after graduating. I decided then to apply to a Master's programme (something that is pretty standard nowadays around these parts, finishing your Bachelor's and going straight into the Master's mainly due to Bologna degrees coming into place, my opinion on that is pretty much irrelevant but I think it was/is a complete mistake by the Universities in Europe). My Master's degree was the opposite of my Bachelors', I focused on being at the top of the class not only grade wise but also in understanding how things work. I graduated from the Finance Master's with a good GPA when compared not only with my previous stint but also with my peers (4th best in the programme, 16/20 GPA).


After that the obvious path was getting my ass to work. I thought I had developed my skills enough to be (at least) considered for Investment Banking, Corporate Finance/ M&amp;A Boutiques, Wealth Management companies or the Big 4, but I guess I was wrong. The few interviews I had weren't that good and I ended up not getting a job for a while after finishing my studies (July 2018). Fast forward a couple of months (October), I applied to an international internship programme and I passed all the recruitment phases just to get to the end of February (this year) and be informed that a suitable match was not available for me.

bo8d19,2,2019-05-13,How to become a Business Analyst?,JobSeeker35,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bo8d19/how_to_become_a_business_analyst/,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 35yo male, and I went back to college in my mid-20's and got a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems from a reputable public university. I did not do internships, which, in hindsight, was my biggest mistake. At the time I was helping out with a small family business and thought I can just work my way up after graduation. WRONG!  Thank god I ended up getting financial aid and a scholarship so I graduated with almost no debt.

My professional experience is mostly in management and sales. I've changed 3 jobs over the last couple of years because I kept wanting to get out of sales. I did Project Management for a remodeling firm, but it was too stressful and left after 6 months. My latest gig was with a national new home builder, I went through their training and then got placed in a struggling community, in a middle of nowhere, where they haven't gotten a single sale for almost an entire year and went through several sales people before me. Few months in, they've decided to shut the community down completely and told me I can quit or they will let me go as they had no other communities for me to be placed in. So now I've been searching for something related to my education, but it's impossible to even get an interview. I live in the Baltimore/DC area and you'd think there would be thousands of jobs, but I don't even get past the first screening. Especially now, because of my shaky employment history. I am totally lost and about to be broke. I also have a wife who is doing an unpaid internship in DC (she can't work legally because she is from another country), so the times are really tough. I am currently waiting for my US citizenship oath which is taking really long. It's very close and has already been approved, but the office is so busy that they haven't scheduled it yet. I figured after I get it, it could possibly open some more opportunities since I also speak 3 different languages, but I don't know if I will be able to even get my foot in the door with my employment history.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I am not sure if I should take classes at a community college and get some certifications and try to get a job at a help desk (I have a couple years experience working as IT support tech for a small business). Computers and IT have always been my passion, but I don't have the analytical brain required to become a programmer. I figured information systems would be a good choice as I could be something like systems or business analyst, which is what college had me sold on. Now I realize how worthless the degree actually is and how I should've concentrated on getting an internship and networking instead. MBA is way too much money and I don't even know if it would help, anyway."
bo8ipz,2,2019-05-13,How many lone sysadmin / 'it managers' are out there? what size is your company and what do you get paid? Trying to figure out what is a reasonable salary.,franklyADHD,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/bo8ipz/how_many_lone_sysadmin_it_managers_are_out_there/,"I'm an IT professional with 10+ years of experience. Started working at an MSP, worked there for 6 years to Senior status, moved on to a few large scale companies, and finally settled at a 100 user, 15 server, ~120 computers, ~100 cell phone company, 2 primary location + small remote sites. I'm trying to figure out what others in similar positions are getting paid as it's hard to find direct information on lone admins.
My official title is IT Manager but that's obviously just a fancy title and by no means your traditional IT Manager position. I manage an intern that we rotate every six months. Other than that, I'm only managing vendors and an outside MSP that we use from time to time and for larger projects. I'm responsible for everything IT related... break fix, equipment purchasing, handle contracts, budget tracking and forecasting, vendor relationships, internal infrastructure, annual reviews of spending and evaluation of other products, conduct staff training's. and some other stuff that people classify as 'technical'. I've been here for 4 years and the company has grown substantially since I originally took the job. I really enjoy the work I do. I only report to one person and they're extremely flexible with my schedule. The line of work I'm in is something intriguing and also satisfying to me. I'm OK working on basic desktop issues as they've become less and less. Currently pursuing my bachelors in Business - IT Management (previous was technical degree).

When I research my States (midwest) average IT manager salary it's $106,515 to $131,004. But as stated, I can't truly call myself an IT manager. I took the job offer at 80k and currently am high 80s. That includes a 3% raise annually with bonus depending on company performance. The company, and my roles, have grown substantially since I took the position.

Am I crazy thinking I should be paid closer to 100k? I want to stay with the company for the foreseeable future and a salary in that range would scale much better to what I'm looking to accomplish over the next few years."
bo8vel,2,2019-05-13,"Stick with current job, or go back to old one with better pay/title?",AffinityGauntlet,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/bo8vel/stick_with_current_job_or_go_back_to_old_one_with/,"Looking for opinions on my current situation. Super lengthy post but there’s a lot of factors that are making me want to leave/stay my current work.

I’m in a creative field and my current job:

-has super relaxed hours

-gives me a ton of creative freedom

-8min drive from my work

-girlfriend works with me


The problem with this job is that my director is a slob who rolls in at 10am, best buddies with the executive director (his superior) so she’s been slacking at this company for about ten years since graduating college. My girlfriend’s director is a super sharp designer who’s acknowledging her work left and right and making that recognition visible by the executive director.

The other problem is that while I have creative liberties here (compared to my last job), there’s been so many budget cuts we haven’t gotten much work over the last few months.

My last job:

-intern to junior position there

-worked for about three years under a SUPER talented director, very disciplined and taught me a lot

-VERY strenuous hours, 35-40min commute, and executive directors will burn you out demanding creative solutions, a lot of times doing the work for THEIR ideas

My fear is that I’m 25 right now and I’ve had little to no creative growth over the last year. I’m worried about ending up at a dead end like my current boss, versus going somewhere - even if that means back to my old job - where I can be challenged to work harder and become a better designer.

So two factors that are coming into play:

-my annual review is coming up soon and I’ve already put on my director’s radar that I’m going to be asking for a raise. I currently make $60k at this company and I’m only wanting to ask them to match cost of living, see if I can push them to $65. This does not solve the existing issues with my director’s irresponsibility and lack of work

-my old boss has reached out to me, for maybe the third time now since I left the company, to see if I was interested in coming back to work for him. He said there’s a position for senior designer that he thinks I’ll fit perfectly into, and I’m assuming with that will come a salary increase, I’m expecting him to offer $70k but I think if I ask for $75k they will probably do it.

While the girlfriend and I love working together, being able to sneak off for lunch, we both agree that we’re not going to let the relationship get in the way of our careers - and she’d be pissed with me if they offered a $75k senior title and I didn’t take it!

A colleague has reminded me there’s “no perfect job,” that I’m always going to have to make sacrifices to make more money or be happier. Im in a very delicate financial situation right now and part of me wants to make sure if I’m moving to another company it’s NOT just for the money.

Sorry for the short-story, hoping someone can shed a different perspective on this! Thanks in advance"

I submitted a few resumes to some random Engineering internship companies and got a reply real quick.

The deadline isn't even over and I have my interview next week.

The company is small (50-100) specialized in optic applications and spectrophotometry (which I have no clue about). It is rated 2.4 either 5 reviews on Glassdoor and I dont know how legit the company is.  They were looking for a current EE student. I have a decent GPA and some previous brief work experience (retail). I have ZERO extracurriculars at school (hence my gpa).

However, I barely have any relevant experience besides the skills I learned in my EE labs in school. I was wondering if I should be honest about how little knowledge I have in the stuff they do? It seems all too niche. 

Also, how quick do internships expect you to learn the different tasks/responsibilities? I feel like I won't understand what I am doing unless I am given some time to adjust to a new environment. I dont want to be slow down them either cause the application says that I will be under supervision and assisting with their tech, data, etc.

Some background about me for those that care. I had no coding experience prior to college. It took me more than 4 years to finish my CS degree with a less than 2.5 GPA. Probably because I spent 5000+ hours playing League of Legends. Too bad you can't put the fact that you're Master Tier on your resume. Anyway, I was essentially a straight C student. No internships. No clubs. No projects. I would just go to class, go back to the dorm, and play games with my friends. Eventually, I graduated, I got out into the real world and realized that just having the sheet of paper from college wasn't enough to get me a job. Oops. So to pay the bills, I started doing data entry work. I learned through this subreddit and other resources what I should have been doing all along. So for 2-4 hours, every night after work, for a year, I would study all the stuff I should have been working on in college. I would put in about 4-8 hours of study on weekends. So now, here are the stats and I'll follow it with another wall of text.

&amp;#x200B;

I started applying to jobs in Oct 2018, found a job in May 2019. I did a lot of studying before applying to jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Total Applications Sent:** 64
* **Number of Applications That Never Received a Reply:** 38/64
* **Phone Interviews:** 7/64
* **On-Site Interviews:** 2/64
* **Offers:** 1/64

&amp;#x200B;

I sent out a cover letter for every job. The cover letter was not totally generic. I had a template that I used to customize each letter. Writing each one probably didn't take longer than 3-5 minutes. A few companies that I really liked received fully original cover letters, mostly because I had a more genuine interest in them. Of the 7 phone interviews, 5 received these fully customized cover letters. Of the 2 On-site interviews, both received fully customized cover letters and mentioned things from the letter during the interview. I was only asked to do Leetcode style questions once for a technical test. I was more often asked about my projects, asked to take an hour long test on-site, asked to do take-home test, and asked conceptional questions like ""What's the difference between an array and a linked list."" I was fine with this as I hate Leetcode. In fact, I used a site called AlgoExpert instead as I found it more useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice? I didn't shotgun my resume out there, mostly because I felt that method was more exhausting. I know that method works, it just wasn't for me. Companies that aren't trying to copy Google's interview process seem to be more interested in what personal projects you have done in whatever technology they use. The projects don't even have to be complicated. Just be able to explain what you did, and why, and what challenges you faced. the CTCI book has a section on how to explain your projects. I just copied that format. I didn't apply to any FAANG companies, mostly because it wouldn't have been a cultural fit, so I am not sure what their process would be like. Also, studying and having a full-time job as I did gave me little room for a social life or hobbies. I couldn't go out with my friends or family anymore, I was constantly stressed, and I constantly wanted to give up. However, I took that as a punishment for wasting my time during college. I had my fun, and now I was paying for it. A lot of post on here prevented me from doing that though. If you're in college still, please take advantage of all the resources available to you. Internships are so valuable, and doing projects while you don't have a full-time job gives you more breathing room. 

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, that's it. If anyone has questions, I'll do my best to answer them."
bo9wgk,754,2019-05-13,Heartbroken and frustrated,Tadahh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bo9wgk/heartbroken_and_frustrated/,"I read the rules and I don’t really know if this type of post is allowed but I just need to rant and let feelings out. 

I was laid off in February along with 100 other tech focused co workers. This was my first job out of college since being an intern. I worked on the CRM team or the “Salesforce” team... working on both backend services written mainly java and developing salesforce code with JavaScript. 

Truthfully I thought I was good at my job. I got promoted twice over the span of about 4 years, even though inside I hated it all. I always wanted more and my co workers were more “I work for the paycheck” kind of people... so if I wanted to do new things I had to just do it myself. Most of the time it ended up being something I learned/read about but never got to implement because there was no enthusiasm. 

Lay offs aside, I figured this was a great chance to find something I truly wanted to do and make my next career move into a more traditional web development role. (If any of you know salesforce, it’s not very traditional and sets some limits on what is possible). So I took the opportunity to build on top of my JavaScript knowledge and just learn for about 2 months. There wasn’t much else I wanted to do. I took Udemy courses on JavaScript and react primarily and feel like I have somewhat of a good grasp on it. 

I then began sending out my resume and all looked promising. Had many phone calls with recruiters and those led to a few in person interviews but nothing has yet to stick. 

Fast forward to today. I had (what I thought) was a very very promising interview last week. It was the 4th round after a tech screen leetcode type google hangout interview, followed by implementing something in react to then a 4 hour in person interview. I received an email from the HR recruiter say “i hope you had a great weekend, the team has made a decision and would like to setup a phone call for later this afternoon”. 

I did not want to get my hopes up but deep down I thought “hey there is no way someone would call you after saying some nice things and using exclamation marks to give you bad news”..... turns out, that’s exactly what happened.

I literally started sobbing in my chair. 

I’m crushed. I’m sad. I feel nothing but dumb. 

And I just don’t know what to do anymore.  

The obvious answer here is... 

“well did they say why? Go take what they said and just go study it more”

“Build more stuff”

“Link your GitHub and contribute more”

“Better your portfolio” 

“Freelance”

These are all obvious to me and maybe I want a pity party but maybe I don’t because only I’m to blame at the end of the day. 

I’m sorry my anxiety is flaring and this is really really hard. And I don’t even know if any of this is coherent to understand

Thanks for reading."

As I understand it, a server is basically a computer that is listening for requests from other computers, and sends replies. And, sql server told me is a database management system. 

Am i correct in saying that sql server would be program installed on a server machine? I'm confused as how those things work together. How do computer servers use this application? Also, why the confusing naming of 'server', why not name the program sql db management, or something along those lines?"

Couldn't find internship here for the summer, but did in home country as a back end developer.

Here's my current resume: https://imgur.com/a/tO00P7M

Want to get into backend development/data engineering. Over the summer I will extend the web app in my resume with CI, deployment, authorization, caching. Have a friend who I'll be doing some weekly LC problems with also. I'll also try to learn SQL more in depth, ETL scripts/jobs and just general DE knowledge when I can but I won't push it for the sake of my mental health since I'll be working and that's a top priority.

Joining ACM club for my final year(on recommendation from friend who is active member) so will go to meetings, I will also attend most if not all university provided networking events and participate in atleast two more hackathons. I have some contacts who I will be passing my resume on to but they can't for sure guarantee even an interview but I figure I may as well try.

Does this sound like a decent enough plan to get me a job once I graduate? I will be able to fall back on a master's admission at this same university once I graduate so it's not like I have zero options. With any luck, I'll also be accepted as either a undergrad research assistant for either semester next year but that isn't 100% so I'm assuming this will help immensely as well.

Edit: I did post this before, but I had a ton of information and it was a little all over the place, and I added more information and overall revised my plan."

Last October I found out that other  students had been applying to internships in August and I had completely  missed the deadlines and I don't want that to happen again, when do  people start applying for jobs after college? Also August going into  their senior year? Also what should I work on over the summer to raise  my chances? So far I will be working at a really small start up and will  likely be considered one of the founding members. I'm also hoping to  get assigned to a consulting project for web development through the  school. Both part time remote jobs and the startup work will be mostly  hardware based with a raspberry Pi and the consulting if I get it would  likely be web or mobile development. In addition to this work I had  planned to do leetcode type questions on a daily basis, at least one,  but I'm not sure what a good number to do each day for the entire summer  is. Some other info about me: GPA is a low 2, no relevant prior work  experience but the closest thing I have to that is two project based  courses at the school: one where you come up with your own project and  work on it over the semester and another where you're assigned to work  on a project for a 3rd party person as part of a team. Sort of like  consulting roles but unpaid we were compensated with class credits. I'm  also the secretary for a CS club on campus and I have a relatively  unique side hobby: flying small airplanes.

Here is a timeline

* **January**: My department manager decided to leave the company after the relationship between him and his boss (and the rest of the company).
* **February**:  My direct supervisor was expecting to be promoted to the manager position, however weeks went by without any change. Knowing that he would be taking more responsibilities without a pay increase, he decided to leave. 
* **By now the remaining 4 of us all wants to get out of here ASAP.**
* **April**: The other mechanical engineer in our group found a job closer to home and decided to leave.
* **May**: The controls engineer found a new job and decided to leave.

**4/5 coworkers gone**

The interim manager and interim supervisors they decided to put in place are product engineers while everything we do is automation/controls engineering. They basically have no idea what we did for the company and spent the first few weeks just learning the basics of what we do and how things work. They are also are making sweeping changes and trying to reverse/undo everything that my previous manager did and seemingly out of spite. We have voiced our concerns but we are met with the usual old-veteran-experience babble. 

Now it is just myself and the electrical engineer. I have been searching for a new job for the past weeks but with no luck. The job market seems pretty tough in Maryland and all the people who left went out of state. I feel trapped here and I had unfortunately took a long vacation before everything had unfolded, thus do not have much time off to spare. 

So here we are now, I want to quit without having an immediate job lined up. I know this is generally a bad thing to do in any career but I don't think I will benefit any longer staying here. I luckily have saved up a pretty decent amount of savings, enough to last me several years if I spend modestly. 

I just don't know what my next move is and it has been difficult finding a new position. I have close to 2 years of experience in manufacturing/mechanical engineering and have had a 2+ year internship before during college. 

Any thoughts and advice on what I should do next?"
bobs8i,0,2019-05-13,Deciding between two teams for internship at Disney,csthrowaway97,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bobs8i/deciding_between_two_teams_for_internship_at/,"Hey all - 

I had the good fortune of getting two intern offers for the fall at Disney, and I am really struggling with choosing the right one.

For background, by the time I start in the fall I would already have two internships (1.5 years) doing c# [asp.net](https://asp.net) MVC and c# [asp.net](https://asp.net) web api. I want to get into software engineering after I graduate, so I think I know what the obvious choice is, but I'm not too sure.

The first job has the title ""systems engineer intern."" I would mostly be working with terraform. I am seeing this as a dev ops role. If this is indeed something that dev ops would do, would that be better because I am more well rounded instead of tacking on another software engineering internship?

The second is a traditional software engineer intern role. I'd be working with Java / Spring and porting over legacy apps for the cloud. 

Overall, both teams seem nice and I'd be happy with either of them. I did ask a few questions during interview to screen for culture fit, but I am kicking myself now for not digging enough about the actual projects. Lesson learned. (Segue, what do you guys ask to really get a good feel for the project)

I'm going to try to schedule a meeting with representatives for both teams.  I need to come up with questions to get a better understanding of what the role entails, and what would be a better decision career - wise. There are certain things I'd like to know, but i don't know how to put them in questions:

* How ""devops"" is the system engineering role
* Assuming it is devops, how much better would that be for me if I want to get into software engineering, since I already have development experience
* Even if it's not better for software engineering prospects and it's not/is devops, would this be a better decision long term since I get to see the other side of the development life cycle?

What questions would you guys ask them? What position would you take?"
bobtzh,0,2019-05-13,Internship Fears,nightcloud42,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/bobtzh/internship_fears/,"So, I'm in a sort of complicated situation today, as I turned down an internship position I really would have enjoyed, as I felt the compensation was unfair for the amount of work I would put in. I have another internship lined up, for part time work (25 hours), but am not sure if I should take it and was looking for advice, as I enter my final year in university after this summer. I want to go into business development in sustainability, ultimately. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently the founder of one startup that has raised a couple hundred thousand, but we are at a research phase right now that I don't have the skills to assist with and am only managing through R&amp;D, trying to finalizing IP, so am not working on fundraising.  I am also working on launching another one in another region of the world by the end of the summer, but would not be compensated for this. I realize if I take on another part time internship, I won't have the time to learn the language of the region, which I should probably do, as I want to move both startups to this country in the long run (my parents and boyfriend live there :) ). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, this brings along two fears for me. I grew up fairly poor and have worked through two jobs while attending school full time--so not pulling a few thousand dollars from a part time position would definitely affect me. Having the two part time jobs and one startup, as well as not having a good high school education leaving me behind my peers, has had an effect on my grades, which I feel like will affect future recruitment. If I was able to work this summer, I would likely have the opportunity to take only one job for at least one semester.

&amp;#x200B;

 My other fear is, if these startups do not succeed and I did not make a connection this summer through an internship that could lead to a full time job, how is this going to translate for future recruiters? Most of the other students in my university are leaving with internship experience from IBM, Facebook, Google, etc and I feel like building two startups that can only muster between $500k and $1mil in seeds is not comparable, especially if neither ends up getting acquired and that recruiters in the future are just going to look at me as a student that enjoys going against the flow and not one that would be good in the workplace since the experience I could be developing is so different. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't take this internship position, how do I make my startup experience look viable?"
bobypv,10,2019-05-13,"TIFU by mentioning my friend's wedding plans to my grandmother, which inevitably found it's way to his mother.",bulbousbaguette,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bobypv/tifu_by_mentioning_my_friends_wedding_plans_to_my/,"This is a throwaway account, but I'm not sure how much traction this will get. I will refer to my friend as X and his girlfriend as Y. Anyway, here it goes.

I will begin this by saying that X and Y had mentioned to me a few months prior of how they were thinking about getting married around winter break the year I'll be studying abroad and how they'd want me to be there for their marriage ceremony. They didn't want me to tell anyone because it was just an idea they had been tossing between them and no one else knew. I didn't mention it to anyone else, and it completely slipped my mind until a few days ago.

So I was visiting my family for the first time in a few months after getting out of school (sophomore at uni), and we were all driving together for a celebration thing, but that's not what's important. Anyway, it was a long drive and I was driving with my grandmother and the rest of my family were in another vehicle. So it's just me and my dear old grandma, and since she hadn't seen me in a long time, she wanted to catch up as grandmas do. I tell her about my semester and classes and plans for the summer and what shows/books I've been reading/watching, and I inevitably get to talking about my future foreign exchange plans.

The foreign exchange program I'll be doing will involve spending a full school year in Europe where the first half/semester will be spent taking classes at a university, and the second will be committed to an internship program. My grandma was curious about what I'd be doing during the winter break between semesters and I said something along the lines of:

""Well, I'll probably try to do something cool like go skiing in Switzerland or backpacking in Spain or do something adventurous. 𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐈 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐦𝐲 𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐗 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐘 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧.""

And that was about all I said on that matter and moved onto something else. I didn't think my grandma would think anything of that. She hardly knows X and has little reason to care. But somehow, afterwards, she thought it was important enough to mention it to my mom.

My mom heard the story from my grandma and took it to mean that my friend X and his gf Y were engaged (which they are not atm, still just dating), and by some ridiculously stupid stroke of luck, my mom ran into X's mom at the grocery store or somewhere of the sorts.

So I got a call from my mom a few hours ago explaining how sorry she is and prefacing it with how much she feels bad and hopes me and X can forgive her. She said that after meeting X's mom in public she congratulated her on the engagement. X's mom was shocked (from what little I know X's mom and Y don't get along very well), and she did not take that news too well. My mom said it became very tense and awkward after that. And a little bit after she got back home she called me.

I know I'm a fool for letting that slip. It was so stupid, but I never would have thought my grandma would latch onto that brief remark I made in passing and share it. And I never would have thought my mom would misinterpret it and happen to see X's mom in public soon after. It's like the worst chain of events I've ever known. But I guess I've learned my lesson that no matter what the circumstances or who I'm talking to, secrets like that should always be guarded.

TL;DR - briefly mentioned my friend's still-up-in-the-air wedding plans to my grandma on a car ride. She thought it was important and told my mom. Mom thought my friend was engaged. Mom saw my friend's mom in public and congratulated her. Shit hit fan."

I have a decent student job at the moment. Good schedule both during the summer and during the year. Also a good salary for such a job. I'm pretty good at that job and I feel no stress at all going to work and having to perform as I'm good at it.

Now this new opportunity comes from my soon to be boss from that internship job. He'd like to hire me for the summer and keep me on the payroll during my internship, which is quite the offer! But I would be dropping everything I have that's stable financially and time-wise and putting my destiny in that guy's hands.

Guy actually said on the phone that it's possible they have to decide my job has to end if he feels I don't do the work the way they do it. I would end up unemployed and financially vulnerable, aside from that internship that would be starting real bad... I still feel he's warning me but is in fact just a serious guy being boss at that place and wants me to fully put the effort. But at the end of the day, I would be risking a lot and it's scary even though the offer looks good.

Salary is pretty much the same but schedule would be way better as I would not have to work a second job aside that internship. Also I would definitely get many more paid hours as I would still be working full time throughout the year, without having to squeeze my time on the weekend. This means lots of additional cash for me.

I'm hoping you guys have any advice for me! I'd appreciate your view on the situation as I'm kinda shocked by this new dilemma haha"

&amp;#x200B;

However,  it turned out that solving that problem only created a  much, much  larger problem... a problem much worse than an undead outbreak would’ve  been. Hell, I at least I could’ve stopped a zombie apocalypse, before it  ever got past patient zero... But I was *not* prepared for what really happens, when one alters death's laws.

&amp;#x200B;

I  will tell you the story, as it occurred. It won’t absolve me, but   perhaps it will give me some sort of peace. And perhaps, you can prepare  yourselves, dear readers, for the things to come. Some have  surely  seen it, already, but I’m afraid that those people have now passed. To  borrow from Shakespeare... “Something  wicked this way comes”. And I  must bare the guilt of knowing that I unleashed that terrible evil on  the earth...

&amp;#x200B;

And  for that, I am truly sorry. I couldn’t have known. You have to  understand that I did what I thought was right. I did what I thought  that I must. Is that not all we *can* do?

&amp;#x200B;

I pray that God have mercy on me for what all that I've done...

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier  this year, I worked at a privately-funded research facility. The  facility name is irrelevant. It doesn't exist, anymore. It was the first  casualty of the Exodus. That's my name for it. You can call it whatever  you like, when you finally have the facts. Before I can give you those  facts, there is a lot you must understand. Stay with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I  and my wife Annabelle were the only two real members of the ‘Sciences""  branch of the research facility. My specialty was physics, and hers was  psychology. We were allowed to recruit outside help for our ongoing  projects with a terrible caveat that we would learn later... In fact,  Annabelle and I had been recruited (many years prior to the Exodus), but  we proved to be “remarkable scientists... the best in the land, in  fact”. That, at least, was the view of the private individual whose  money and influence kept the place going.

&amp;#x200B;

He  instructed us (through intermediaries; I never met the man) to stay on  permanently, instead of as “interns”. That was the organization's term  for the poor temps. They were paid well. It wasn't as if they were  overworked and underpaid. They were overworked, for sure, but the head  of the organization ensure that everyone was well compensated for their  services. At the time of our hiring, we didn’t know that we would be  asked to run an entire department by ourselves. We also didn't know of  the horrible things we would be asked to do... or how close we came to  death...

&amp;#x200B;

Annabelle  and I were horrified to learn the truth about what internship actually  entailed, at the facility. We were asked (again, through an  intermediary) to dispose of the couple-dozen interns we had chosen for  our ""team"". They had done great work, assisting us with a wide array of  projects. Interns were not allowed to continue working at the facility,  after they had served their six-month stretch. That could've been us. We  could've been one of the lost. Sometimes, I wish I had turned the job  down and just allowed them to kill me. Then, maybe the Exodus would  never have happened. But we'll get there. Sorry, readers. Be patient. I  promise you that I'm helping you. I'll explain the Exodus and everything  else, in time. For now, let's get back to the bit where we were fucking  asked to murder twenty-plus innocent people...

&amp;#x200B;

You have to understand something, here, dear readers... We were not murderers. At least, we were not murderers, when we *started*  at the place... I wish I could say we would’ve turned the job down, if  we had known beforehand what horrible things we'd be forced to do. But  we later understood the truth... that our financier would only have  disposed of us and hired his next choices. Rinse and repeat, until he  came across people who would comply. Human lives were not a factor in  the owner's equation. People were disposable to him. A currency, if you will.

&amp;#x200B;

That  is why we continued, after we learned what was being asked of us.  Please, understand, readers... we were good people, once. We had never  hurt anyone. When we picked our interns, we were so thrilled to be able  to hand-pick whomever we wanted. We were going to begin a grand new  chapter and solve the world’s problems. We were going to advance  civilization to the next level... a wonderful new era. Our funding was  practically unlimited. We chose only the absolute best and brightest,  for our first round of interns (which we called “teammates”, back  then)... I even remember giving some heartfelt speech to them on  orientation day, about how we were going to truly change the world. I  even praised the bastard who owned/ran/controlled the place, calling him  a “true  visionary and a remarkably altruistic individual”. I assured  the interns that there was nowhere to go but up, after they finished  their six-month internship. I couldn't have been more wrong, and it  haunts me to this day that I gave them hope. I tried to galvanize them  to do their best and help each other to build a foundation for something  great. I even cited Annabelle and myself as “success  stories”... And  believe me when I say that I have since seen things far worse than  death. You’ll see them, too, no doubt. Even now, I’m sure the dark  result of the Exodus is slowly tearing its way across the land. But  we'll get to that. Hopefully, there's time for me to explain everything,  before it's too late for... well... humanity...

&amp;#x200B;

When  we were asked to dispose of our first batch of interns, we pushed back  hard. They had become our family, but it's not as if that was the  primary factor, here. We were being asked to kill people, and the fucker  made it sound like he was asking some simple chore of us, like washing  the dishes. Clearly, this type of thing happened all the time, at this  place, and we had just not been around long enough to understand the  depth of evil at the heart of the organization.

&amp;#x200B;

My  wife and I received a summons to meet with an unnamed individual. The  summons was sent through a secure connection, which we received back in  the primary mega-laboratory. All the computers ran on an encrypted  intranet, using an elaborate encryption system. The data not only  remained encrypted in-transit. It also remained encrypted on arrival.  The facility provided smartglasses to all the high-level (non-intern)  employees. Embedded in each pair of glasses was an RFID. This RFID  possessed a dynamic code, changing every five seconds, for the employee.  Our computers had a sort of partner code (think ""lock plus key""), which  was synced to change exactly when the smartglasses reassigned the RFID  code. The glasses weren't networked (no wifi, bluetooth, etc.), so it  took a while for the higher-ups to figure out how to sync them properly.  Smartglasses only had the programming for decryption and the dynamic  code program, and they had an ever changing signature code that  projected onto the screens of the glasses. I only really noticed some  slight movement, in my visual field, but I got used to it after a while.  An RFID reader protruded from each computer on a narrow strip of  plastic. See, these RFID's only had a native signal range of about  one-foot (or so I've been told). The point of the system was that you  had to be sitting at *your* computer with *your*  smartglasses, for them to work. The RFID reader would scan every five  seconds (in sync with when the codes on the computer and on the  smartglasses changed), so you had to stay close to the reader, or it  would shut down the decryption program.

&amp;#x200B;

I  know what you're thinking: Just take off the glasses and hang them on  the little plastic strip thingy. That's a clever idea, dear reader, but  they set up a couple of methods to prevent that. One, beside plastic  strip and the built-in webcam (which, by the way, was always on), there  was also a *fucking retinal scanner*  that was programmed to block the decryption process, if the person's  eyes were unable to be scanned for a set amount of time. As well, the  scanner only functioned if it detected the correct eye and the correct  unique encryption code that projected onto the screen of the  smartglasses. The scanner expected these to be roughly in the same  location... or no dice.

&amp;#x200B;

Once  all those stars aligned, the data on the computer could be read. The  glasses screen would change to a unique color setting. The computer  screen would do the same, but of course with a different color. The  colors of the screens complimented in such a way that the hidden  text/data/whatever would be readable only if the glasses were using the  correct color and the computer monitor was using the correct color.  These colors changed every second, or maybe less. I recall an intern  trying to use Annabelle's glasses and having a violent seizure. We never  saw that intern again, and at the time, I just assumed he had been let  go for trying to access his superior's data. Now, I'm sure he was put  down like a dog...

&amp;#x200B;

I  only say all of that, so that you understand the level of paranoid  security that the facility used. I don't know if the seizure was a  coincidence, or if there was some fail-safe frequency emitter that  forces seizures, or god-knows-what-else, if you use glasses that do not  belong to you. Let's just say that I never used my wife's glasses to  test that theory. But I digress... Forgive me. I got carried away, but I  need you to see what these people were... what level of security they  used... They were not fucking around.

&amp;#x200B;

At  any rate, Annabelle and I were in the hallway, after we received our  super-mega-secret communications, via computer-glasses link and all  that. The walls of the facility contained some sort of Faraday cage  system to block all wireless signals. The intranet was entirely  hard-lined. The hallways were special, as well, as they were lined with  scrambler-type devices, or something, which were designed to prevent all  electronics from functioning, whilst in the hallway. So... tough luck,  if you had a pacemaker.

&amp;#x200B;

The  man that met with us wore a mask, which has a bright yellow smiley face  on the front. Something about it looked utterly... wrong, though. The  man also wore an all-black suit with matching leather gloves. All that  we knew, from the communication was that we were to listen to this man  and do exactly as he instructed. The message also said that it had  something to do with the interns, but I had no idea what, until...

&amp;#x200B;

""Get  rid of them,"" the man said. I could see his eyes, through the holes in  the creepy smiley-face mask. Something about his eyes made me nervous,  and I noticed that Annabelle was picking up on that, too.

&amp;#x200B;

“Now,”  I said, “when you say ‘get rid of them’, you do mean to  cut them  loose, right?” There was something dark in the way he had phrased the  instruction, which I could not aptly quantify. Annabelle looked at me  curiously, when I asked the man to clarify. I don't know if she was afraid that I was questioning him or what. Maybe she just didn't notice  how cold the man's tone was.

&amp;#x200B;

The  man simply shook his head. At this, my wife started to panic. I could  see the terror forming on her face, as the masked man turned and walked  away.  He was halfway down the hallway, before my wife called after him...

&amp;#x200B;

“Then,  what do you mean, exactly?” she yelled, her voice echoing  down the  long hallway. The man became irritated. His body language changed from  distant and cold to completely outraged. He turned around and walked  back to us. Clearly, he had not anticipated any push-back, when he had  been ordered to pass down these instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

“Get... fucking... rid of them,” he snarled, his horrible gaze fixated on my Annabelle...  She turned pale. Not wanting to risk allowing harm to  come to her, I  cut in:

&amp;#x200B;

“You want us to kill over twenty people? Is that some kind of sick fucking joke?!”

&amp;#x200B;

That’s  when the man punched my wife in the nose, breaking it and  causing a  river of blood to flow outward. I almost killed the bastard,  right then  and there. It was difficult to suppress that urge. Annabelle screamed  and fell backwards  onto the floor. She pulled herself into the fetal  position and covered her face with both hands. Blood began to pool on  the tile floor of the hallway, illuminated by the bright fluorescent  lights.

&amp;#x200B;

“You motherfucker!” I began, “Why would you hit her?! If you’re going to attack someone—“

&amp;#x200B;

The  man put his hand over my mouth. The grip was firm, and I was  so  shocked that it suppressed my powerful desire to punch him square in his  stupid face.

&amp;#x200B;

“Let me just stop you right there,” he said, his patience clearly thinning, “I hit her because I knew that you *both*  would learn your lessons if I did. It was quicker this way. Or it would  be, if you would take a fucking hint and learn your goddamn place!”

&amp;#x200B;

With  his hand still covering my mouth, he pushed me - with immense strength -  and I fell back onto the hard tile. I lay there holding my wife, as she  sobbed hysterically, more from the horror than from the pain, I’m sure.  She was cupping her hands over her face. Blood oozed out from between  her fingers and gathered in the pool that had already formed. Our  assailant/apparent-superior turned to walk away, once more. I  realized  that I couldn’t fight him on this. We were beaten. I could only think of  one more thing to say, and it was a question that I absolutely needed  answered. My only hope was that asking that question would not further  incur his wrath...

&amp;#x200B;

“But  how? What should we do?” I said, trying to sound subdued. That was easy  enough, as I - a grown man - lay in the floor of a hallway, in a  department that I thought my wife and I controlled freely. But we were  not free. Not even close. Our authority was an illusion. We has spent  the last six months believing that we had complete autonomy. That belief  was destroyed, as soon as the reality of what we were being asked to do  had finally settled in. I could tell that Annabelle was still sorting  it all, God bless her. This was almost the exact moment that I gave up  hope, completely. I now understood that our ""perfect job and perfect  life"" was over. Neither of us would ever be the same again. We both knew  that.

&amp;#x200B;

The man didn’t even turn around. He simply waved his hand casually, as he walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

“You’re smart. You’ll figure it out,” he called back.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, he was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Annabelle  and I lay there for a long time. We felt like helpless little children.  I held her as she cried. She was still sorting out the horrors. With  her impressive psychology background, I’m sure she had a lot to process.  She would be analyzing just what brand of monster the smiley-face man  was. More importantly, she’d be analyzing what kind of monster would  send that man to give us those instructions. *Who  was running the place? Who was the actual head of the organization? And  why? What would ever possess someone to go to such horrible lengths?*  Surely, all these measures were unnecessary, but that wasn’t our  biggest dilemma at the moment. We had to dissolve our entire moral  code... just to survive. In essence, it was “us” or “them”. Either we  would die or all twenty-six interns would die.

&amp;#x200B;

But  no... it was worse than that. It was “kill them” or “someone else  will... and we’d have been killed right along with them. Our deaths  would not be granted mercifully, either. There would be pain. And there  would be a whole hell of a lot of it. I don't know how I knew that, but I  did. The reality was that we now had to murder over twenty brilliant,  hard-working, innocent  individuals. We had to. We fucking *had* to.

&amp;#x200B;

# *   *   *

&amp;#x200B;

Annabelle  and I, after a trip to an urgent care place, went back home and had a  long talk about all the things that had happened... And what the fuck we  were going to do about it. I will tell you about that talk and the  events that followed on our next encounter, dear reader... I won't lie  to you... I was scared absolutely shitless, after that day. And the  worst had yet to come. I told you I would tell you the story about how I  unleashed a great evil on the world... about how I destroyed the  concept of death, as we know it and caused the Exodus... something that  would prove to be worse than death.

&amp;#x200B;

And  I will tell you that story. We will get there. But you have to  understand the events that led up to it, first. I can't have you  thinking that I'm a villain. It isn't so. Rather, it *wasn't*  so. I don't want to force you to have a particular opinion about me. Of  course, I hope that you'll see that I was only trying to do good. But...  all I can do is tell you the truth. Even being forced to *dispose*  of - and I absolutely hated that term - our interns wouldn't be the  worst of it. But there will be time for you to learn of those things,  later. I have to prepare myself mentally, before I can talk about the  first Intern Purge... And there is much more to tell, beyond that. Stay  with me, here. You need to be prepared, when the time comes.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise... we might all be doomed. And if that turns out to be the case... then, I cannot apologize enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I  hope this message finds you well, dear reader. Take care of yourself.  Stay alert. Goodbye, my friend. I'll be back, soon. I can't remain in  one place for very long.

I think they wanted me in a interview is because of my pretty decent 3.87 GPA. 

I haven't dont been in any extracurriculars or have done any personal projects related to EE or engineering. Absolutely zero. How can I counter this when the real reason is  because of my focus and workload with school that occupies most of my time?

I'm not sure if there is a good answer to that. One thing that I'm probably going to say would be my confidence and skills in perform the lab portions of my EE classes as well as generating a lab report. When it comes to my coding classes, I only spend a lot of coding for projects and when I study. I am the type of person who likes to focus on my classes and pour probably 200+ hours into.

I did buy an arduino a few months ago. Now that it is summer time, what projects can you guys suggest that I can do with the basic ol' kit?"

So I've just recently graduated with my BS in CSCI and I have a couple offers on the table. I have been an intern at a Fortune 50 company for the past year and have an opportunity to start there as in a position that would be using some proprietary software for a fairly decent wage. I have another offer from a smaller company that does government/military contracting software development which would pay slightly less but I would be working in Spring Boot/Java which I feel would be much more marketable. I suppose my question is how much of a salary trade off should I be willing to accept as a recent graduate to sacrifice learning a skill that is more marketable? Inside the bigger company I would have plenty of opportunities for growth/advancement but they are not a tech company where the smaller company focuses on tech exclusively so I know that they value my skillset.

I posted this in order groups similar to these, but I thought since I was a South Asian this would be an appropriate place to share my story.....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**FOR** years in my childhood, I had thought my life was going to be this great thing. I was going to take charge of the world around me, and work hard to help all those that I believed needing helping. I believed that I could make a positive difference and make a life for myself. Soon as I came into adolescence, a lot of what I believed would go my way didn't. I was a weird kid with barely any friends who was to brown for the white kids and to white for the brown. I just wanted people to enjoy who I was, but I was just a ghost to them. Soon I went to acting out in class in order for anyone at all to notice me, but this just lead to people bullying me and treating me like I was this weird kid. I thought, ""now may not be my time but when I am older I will be able to fit it and enjoy life"". At the same time I developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which worsened my experience of life greatly. I was very dedicated to playing tennis and going far with it, hopefully getting a scholarship. Because of my IBS, my tennis career was ruined, I couldn't go through matches without my intestines feeling like they were going to implode. It broke me knowing the one thing I truly felt like I belonged in was taken away so quickly, because of issues I couldn't control.

So I waited, and went through my whole emo high school phase. I did everything I could to seem cool to people who had similar interests to me, and wanted to embody this person that fully adapted to the things he was interested in. This soon just had me not knowing who I was, so I ended up just drifting between groups. The same issues of the past had come, but I now knew how to resemble seeming normal when talking to people. As college came around I believed that I had the chance of improving my life, my senior year of high school was awesome. I had a solid group of friends, and a lot to look forward to. College was fun as well to begin with, but as time went on I realized the people I was associating with were toxic to mental health. These people only cared about sex, competing, and doing drugs. There wasn't anything deeper to any of them, and having feelings to this group of people were seen as ""being a pussy"". This left me feeling isolated and alone, in a completely new place. Then my dorm was infested with black mold, and I was stricken with intense allergies that have not gone away for 3 years. This worsened my spirits, and contributed to worsening effects from my IBS, but I was able to push on and make new friends. The next year went fine, and I felt like I was finally getting to a good place in my life. I had a plan for the future, great friends, great health. I overall felt great. Then I had my first panic attack...

From there my life has changed forever. From the moment I had the panic attack, my body did not leave fight or flight mode. I was constantly fearing for my life, and my body constantly pained me. The IBS was worse, I developed Restless Legs Syndrome, and my heart would not stop racing. I spent months barely holding onto life, barely keeping my internship in the city, barely going out into public. I was so exhausted all the time, and when I wasn't exhausted I was in intense pain from my IBS or thinking I was going to die. I soon went to therapy where I was diagnosed with GAD, which gave me hope. I wanted this to be gone so that I could return to living a normal life, and expected this to be over within a month. While I did see some relief, suddenly out of nowhere the Depression hit me. I had never felt this awful in my life.

Depression is one of the worst things to happen somebody because it takes the joys and beauty of this world and turns that against you. Depression makes you hate the things you used to love, and too tired to do anything. It makes you feel like there is no point in living anymore, and that there's no point. I soon developed OCD about windows because many of the thoughts I had about death and giving up involved the windows at my office. I would spend my days trying to survive and convince myself not to jump. It was one of the worst times of my life. I was in therapy and trying so very hard to feel better, but it was so difficult. A 4 hour roundtrip commute is a lot on it's own, but combine that with the mental issues I was having, and it felt like there was no way I could get on with my life. Soon it got to the point where my Depression was so bad that I had to get on medication. I had to go back to school, which caused intense anxiety attacks for me just thinking about it. It was a difficult decision even trying to go to school and not dropping out. I still felt like dying everyday and the Depression had not seized, though my anxiety was slowly improving. I was prescribed Celexa to begin with, and the week I was on was complete hell. It was gasoline to the fire that was my anxiety. I was constantly feeling this intense heart racing, and my body didn't feel in control. I couldn't eat anything, I was so exhausted. at night when the medication would wear off was the only time I felt in control, but I was too exhausted to do anything. Then I switched to Xanax and Zoloft, and was on my way to school.

I started at 50 mg with the Zoloft, and was given 10 pills of Xanax in case of severe panic attacks. Zoloft is kind of like a bandaid, it helps to ease the bleeding of mental illness and doesn't let it get too bad. Xanax is a parachute out of a burning plane that may have you killed. I have no used Xanax once since I had to try it for the doctor, and Zoloft has continually been something I have used, and currently take 150 mg.

I went through this next semester in a state of flux. I was able to party with my friends and go to school and have freedom, but there were so many internal battles I had to fight. I went to a therapist, but it was every two weeks which was a significant amount of time. I spent a lot of time alone since I was screwed out of the living arrangement I was supposed to be in and ended up living with random people. I would go through everyday wondering ""would I ever get better, would life ever get better"". My OCD was the worst at this time, and I couldn't do anything without the image of the window on my mind. I also spent most of the time dealing with the side effects of upping my dose of zoloft. This meant intense feelings of lethargy, trouble with sleep, constipation, jaw pain, anxiety, and headaches. With that said, I still felt like I was more in control of my life. The Zoloft by the time I got to 100 mg had essentially defeated the Depression and the OCD. I occasionally still have episodes but they are not nearly as bad as they were before. It was a trying semester but I got through it. My therapist was able to help me explore my perfection issues and my issues with relationships. I also worked everyday, was on a vitamin regime and did yoga. But then, I had to go to a compelely different country.

I had spent years dreaming of studying abroad in Ireland. It was something that I had decided would be an integral part to my experience in college. With that said, I didn't anticipate the issues that I was going to deal with mentally. I spoke to various doctors and therapists, and they ultimately said it was up to me. My parents were extremely worried about me going to a different country considering it was hard for me to handle myself but I pushed for it. Even if I did get really bad, I could always come back.

In the beginning Ireland was rough, I was extremely depressed, anxious and exhausted with the culture shock that comes from being in a new country. I didn't know if I could get through the semester and I spent much of my time focusing on improving myself. It was hard for me to improve even with working out, meditating, eating right and having the medication. But then I became involved with therapy at the host university I was at, and did acupuncture that was specifically targeted towards mental illness. These two things helped me immensely in recovery. The therapist and I clicked and we were able to get deep into the issues that I had. A lot of it was the feeling of never being good enough to others, and feeling like the only way people could ever like me is if I was good enough to them. I also found that this caused me to judge myself and others hard, and made life for me more about competition compared to actually enjoying it. My acupuncturist spoke to me about trying to find my true self, because much of the pain that I was dealing with was repressed from my younger self. My parents were pretty aggressive south Asian parents, so there was a lot of pressure on my part. There was a lot of screaming and anger directed towards me, and it felt like it was my fault all the things going wrong in my house were happening. She also helped me deal with the physical pain in my body, where she said that the Spleen points of my body were messed up, which was caused issues with digestion and fear. The needles were able to release the tension that was in my body, and it didn't hurt at all. She also did cup therapy, which helped to release the ""weight"" that I felt in my back and legs. I also started listening to these podcasts hosted by ""the anxiety guy"" and it was tremendous in understanding what mental illness is. Depression is really just anger and suppressed emotions being stuck, causing the body not to be free and clean. Anxiety is just emotions that are stuck in the body not being able to come out, prompting fight or flight. Having these issues but not dealing with them was the reason for a lot of my suffering. I also participated in a anxiety group where we were able to share our issues and learn from each other and also not feel alone. It was crazy how much I identified with everyone else, and it is ridiculous just how many people silently suffer from these issues.

I can say now after going through a semester in a new country alone, having to be independent at the age of 19 that my recovery process has been increased exponentially. I look back at the times of my past in my recovery and though I feel the pain that I had felt before, I realize just how much my life has improved. I do have a ways to go but mental health is a process and shouldn't be rushed. Something to help deal with your thoughts is doing infinite questioning exercises.

For example,

I feel tired, Why?, because I didn't eat much today, Why?, because I didn't feel hungry, Why?, because I was really anxious, Why?, because I don't think my Depression isn't getting better, Why? Because I dont feel any improvement, Why? Maybe because I don't really remember what it feels like not to have Depression? Why? Because I have identified with it maybe?

This helped me a ton with getting feelings out of my body. Meditation was also great in releasing emotions when in a zen state. Feeling the pain while in this state helps to release it. If you are reading this and feeling like there is no hope, and nothing that can be done to help you, I say there is so much that can be done.

Meditation

Nature Therapy

Self-Help Books/Podcasts

Vitamins

CBT

Psychotherapy

CBD

Accupuncture

Group Therapy

Anxiety Guy Program

Medication

Diet Enhancement

Mindfulness

Yoga

Exercise Regimen

If you are wondering about how you can get involved with any of these or are in the Dublin area and interested in finding the acupuncturist I had mentioned message me!

Please note that I will be staying with the same university so I am not sure if that matters but I have heard from my department that it helps in the regard that you are a known commodity and they know that if you get in the program then most likely you will finish it as well. Additionally I would like some perspective on my overall stats and whether graduate school is a valid option for me in respect to my overall stats (is it even worth trying to apply is what I am asking) 


**Stats are as follows: 
**

**University Information:** 

**Minimum GPA:** 3.00 (Last Sixty Hrs)  - Requirement Met (3.61)  

**GRE Waiver:** 3.3 GPA – Requirement Met (3.41)  


**Personal Information:** 

**Pros (I guess?):** 
**Major GPA (Might be relevant since I am doing my undergrad in the same department):** 3.83 

**GPA (Last 60 Hours):** 3.61

**Letter of Recommendations:** Five from professors with two of them in the graduate program. Two more from employers. 

**Deans List:** Last five semesters

**Research/Internships:** five relevant projects and 2.5 years worth of internships plus contractual work in relation to my field of interest.  

**Now the bad parts: **

**Overall GPA:** 3.44 (apparently the average GPA of an applicant is 3.1) 

**Two withdrawals from classes:** one of the classes I was forced to drop because my petition to replace that class with another credit got approved later and hence the late withdrawal. The other withdrawal was because I was already taking two other courses in the summer and my summer internship bumped up my hours so I had to drop the one of the three courses.  

**Two D's:** one of them was an extremely difficult course which I retook and got an A- in the following semester and the other was just my ego getting in the way and not dropping the class. Switched majors and went from a 1.5 GPA to a 3.44 overall with a major GPA of 3.88 in my newer major (computer science). 

Guess my question is that I know it is a holistic process but in terms of stats will I be okay?"

Not sure what it is with Chinese parents and UTSG, but mine fall into the catagory of those who worship this school (I'm not even an international student!). They are convinced that I have to go the the St.George campus to have any chance at finding a job after graduation... and by extension any success in life. But I want to go to UTSC for coop. 

No matter how much I tell them the campus doesn't matter after graduation, or I like coop because I want to have experience working for multiple/different types of companies and the experience will be beneficial to my future career, or PoST is too hard to get into and I might end up not being able to study CS at all, or people find jobs at facebook/google/famous tech giant at UTSC just like in UW (I know it's rare, but I'm trying to be persuasive here), or I'll be able to find better jobs because I'll have worked at progressively better companies each year at UTSC, or... you get the point. They just won't stop getting angry or cutting off the convo every time I bring UTSC up. There's no changing a stubborn asian parent's mind I guess😫😢😵

The reason I say they are forcing me to go is because of my financial situation. My parents have kept me from saving up with a part time job, or making any money on my own. They insist on providing their financial support instead of allowing me independence like a normal human being. I guess some would consider this lucky, but at this rate I wont even be able to afford the deposite that comes with accepting the application without their support, and will have no choice but to go to UTSG for CS. So I was hoping some of you guys can help me out a bit:

 
1. Is it really as hard as they say to get into PoST or does it just seem difficult from the outside because most people who enter CS don't really put in the work, or some other reason?
2. How difficult is it to find my own paying summer internships without any coop structure? How can I do it?
3. If I do get absolutely obliterated by PoST, how difficult would it be to transfer to UTSC? UW CS?... I'll even take ryerson.
4. If I choose to go rebel mode and run away to UTSC, what advice do you wise, responsible uni students have on putting yourself through university?

 Tldr; I've been put in a situation where I have to rely on my parents to even pay the deposite it takes to accept uni offer. I want to go to UTSC Coop but &lt;insert title&gt;. I would love it if you could ples help by answering the above questions.

Sorry if this isn't the right place to post, I just figured that you guys and gals on the main sub would have more knowledge on this stuff."

My problem is that I feel as if I am the opposite of most people. Most people say they hate their job but love where they live.. well I love my job but I really hate where I live. The deep south really just doesn't cut it with me. With as many engineers as there are here I just can't get used to the whole southerner vibe.  Not to say that I haven't met southerners that I like but there are a ton of stereotypical ""yee-yee"", bacco spitting, bro-doser driving people here. I'm also single and trying to find anyone to date in an engineering field is bad enough, let alone trying to find someone who either 1. Isn't too country or 2. Doesn't have a kid already... and I'm barely 27.

I moved to Huntsville immediately after graduating college because it was the first, and only, job offer that I got and I was desperate for a job. Now that I'm more settled, financially and mentally, I'm looking for a place that better suites me but also isn't short of software engineering jobs. I love to play and watch hockey, cold weather, good food, I'm not much of a party guy.  I really just want a place that has an ice rink to play hockey in my free time and eventually get a house for my dog to have a back yard. I also have guns and would like to move to a city that is gun friendly so obviously not California, New York or New Jersey...

Looking around on Indeed I've kind of narrowed my choices to 3 major cities: Austin/Dallas, TX; Charlotte, NC; Salt Lake City, UT. My current lease is up in March 2020 and would like to move straight from there to my next city. My question for you all is, What places would you suggest even if it's not a big city?

borro4,2,2019-05-14,Transfer Advice,sl--p-rc-ll00,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/borro4/transfer_advice/," Hi (posted this earlier in r/computerscience),

TLDR

I am a freshman at a very small liberal arts college for CS and Mathematics, and I am very torn on whether to transfer schools or not. Here is some of my reasons to transfer and not to transfer, in no particular order of importance. Of course, the goal of college, in my view, is to meet people who I can have long term beneficial connections with as well as get a high paying job, or even better, make a great, successful living being self-employed.

Reasons not to transfer:

1.) I am at the top of the class. Have already taken Data Structures and Algorithms, OOP, Computer Architecture, Differential Equations, Linear and Abstract Algebra. Lowest grade I have so far in my college career is a 96.

2.) Faculty loves to work with me, as do I with them. At one point, one of my professors told me that he feels guilty as a teacher because he feels like he is getting paid to do nothing as I get the concepts quickly and breeze by his tests.

3.) As a result of reason 1 and 2, I have had some (when I mean some, I mean so far only one) insider opportunities. My CS adviser recommended me for an internship of which he told he would never do especially for a freshman. In addition, the CS faculty knows of only one alum who goes to a FANG, Big 4 company. They always keep talking about her, and saying big statements about how they can connect me with her and in terms get in me to work at her company.

4.) Small class sizes make learning easier. I am well-known in the school to be acing junior-level classes. If I were to transfer, then I ***may*** lose the luxury of standing out in the class as well as having such a good, personal relationship with the professors.

Reasons to transfer:

1.) Prestige and connections makes the job search easier. There is a higher probability to get those insane paying jobs at brand name colleges.

2.) Difficulty of the courses. I am pretty sure my current CS and Math classes are heavily influenced by the class. Meaning to say that many of my classmates do not grasp the concepts as quickly and thus the class is slower paced/assigns easier homework assignments (relative to what I know and what I consider is easy/challenging)

3.) Teachers acknowledge that I am not challenged in their classes; despite getting a recommendation for an internship as well as being admired heavily by faculty, I don't see any other support systems or opportunities that they are giving me that will help advance my career. (as a freshman, maybe I'm just being impatient and haven't seen everything yet; maybe I'm just expecting too much. I don't know)

3.) There is little to no exciting CS/Math environment; my school's career fair were geared towards military, actuarial, and health sciences. There was only one booth that had something slightly connected to computer programming. In addition, the CS and MATH club is very inactive. When they do have activities, its similar to what you see in high school: making pie on pi day (that's the only event both clubs ever had, so I can't list any more for you as examples)

4.) I am a TA for some of the introductory CS classes. In addition, I tutor as a part-time job. I can say that I spend an average of 12 hours a week helping students out. The amount of time I spend helping others out starts to bog me down; rather than collaborating with classmates on projects I want to do, instead, I am helping them understand rudimentary concepts and help them pass the class. I don't feel like I'm advancing my career/knowledge.

5.) There are very, very few competent CS/Math students at my school. I'm not saying this because I have a superiority complex. I'm saying this because the majority of my classmates statistically do not do well on exams or assignments despite having a very small class size, and long open professor office hours. The majority of my classmates have the ""C's get degrees"" mentality and I can't find anyone (except for one) who is self-motivated enough to create things for the sake of creating things you can be proud of. In addition, I watched the senior capstone CS projects, and I was a little underwhelmed by what they had created in the course of a whole semester. Although the projects were not rudimentary, they were not anything a self-taught programmer could do in the same amount of time, if not better.

\------------

I know that the name (and its respective academic rigor) of a school is not everything. I've read posts here where people's passion for CS has brought them to great opportunities, jobs, etc. In addition, I might have too much of a high/fantastical view of prestigious colleges as the key to the high-paying, very desirable jobs. I do enjoy being less stressed in school, spending a short amount of time on class work while still getting high grades, and having more time to do whatever I want (side projects, challenge myself with online classes). And despite sounding harsh on my reasons why I should transfer, the amount of attention and respect I'm getting is very uplifting for me and I do think the teachers do genuinely care about me and are very serious in getting me to good places.

Despite this, I have friends that go to premier CS universities, and I definitely have FOMO when I compare their CS career fairs to my non-existent one, their problem sets versus my assignments, their class content versus my class content. They're going to FANG, Big 4 internships, while it took me 500+ internship applications to land one at a small local business.

I have a love hate relationship with my current school. It's a place that boosts my confidence that I can grasp what ever will be given to me. It's also a place where that is not rigorous enough to advance my career goals, and I must find ways to supplement this myself through Leetcode, side projects, etc.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you thank you thank you."

I've posted before about my internship, and I got an internship interview at some small company specialized in fiber optic assemblies. I just need some input on the internship.

Here is the job description:

https://i.redd.it/ygg75ht8may21.png

https://i.redd.it/2xoymge3may21.png

https://i.redd.it/4lxqq2evlay21.png

This will be my first internship interview. The company is pretty small and has little to no reviews. Some employers from glass door are saying that they are fraud or something. The internship is full time and i'm only looking for a summer internship. I just finished my sohpmore year. So far the classes i've taken are principles of EE 1,2 and digital logic &amp; design, probability, calc 1-4. I know some C++ from class and know how to use the DMM and the oscilloscope from my lab class. I'm afraid that I would not be able to perform all these other responsibilities that they are asking me for.

&amp;#x200B;

The pay says $15 /hr. I'm just not sure if im fit for the internship. I can't help but feel that they think i'm capable of all this based on my GPA and scholarships as a result of that.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, when it says I will be under ""direct supervision"", does this mean that they are going to watch over me or just assign me tasks and leave? I'll probably ask when i get the interview.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i'm paranoid or something. Is this gonna be a stressful internship?"

bou2t8,1,2019-05-15,How to format resume with medical leave followed by return to grad school?,scienceresumehelp,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/bou2t8/how_to_format_resume_with_medical_leave_followed/,"Hi r/resumes, 

I left my old job in about three years ago due to severe health issues - think two years living in the hospital with 25+ surgeries severe - and slightly sketchy fact that my previous boss pressured me to leave by first lying to me about the long-term disability options and eventually trying to bully me out of the position (but that's a story for another day). Luckily my partner's job is rather high paying and has excellent benefits. So after sitting down to consider all the pros and cons, we decided that it would be best for me to leave my position and focus on my health. And while I spent the majority of my time hospitalized, I was able to complete my second Masters after making special arrangements with the university. And as of the start of this month, I received a clean bill of health and the blessings of my doctors to get back into the working world - which came just in time as I found my dream job! 

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm so excited to apply for this job (and the others I've found that interest me), I'm nervous about submitting my resume because I'm not sure how to best display some things and have a few questions. Quick background - prior to medical leave, I was holding a manager position in policy and had about 7 years of work experience + a masters. So that being said, I was wondering the following:

* Layout - since I was out of work due to medical and in school most recently (however no work/internships due to medical), should I display my education section at the top of my resume/above my work experience or should I keep it at the bottom like in a standard resume?
* Addressing Medical Leave - What should I say and where should I say it? I don't want to draw too much attention because I'm worried that employers will look at me and think I'm going to be forever sick when I'm not. And if anyone has any advice about overcoming judgement for a three year gap on resume for medical leave, that would be great.
* Addressing the short time I spent in my previous position - Like I said, my condition became rather serious near the end of my first year of my position and I left shortly afterwards. Aside from internships, I've never had a job last for such little time. Should I address this?
* The new position is policy so I figured a regular resume would be the best choice but I want to mention some of my published work and research experience as it is relevant to this position, should I create a separate section like I would for my CV or should I just add it under the relevant work experience?

&amp;#x200B;

I think that covers it but any other advice would be welcome! Thanks so much!"

Currently, I am seeking a way to get a software engineer job overseas without working more than months in Japan (I am not going well with ""Japanese society"" at all. I wish I could make my life without getting out to the public. But at the same time I am not going well with my family as well. I wish I could survive like a lone wolf). As I researched, one of the few possible ways is to get a CS degree and find a job in the country.

Details:
- Japanese citizen
- Unrelated STEM degree: Bachelor in Agriculture (Ecological Studies), and currently pursuing Master in Agriculture (Ecological Studies, majored in theoretical ecology / mathematical biology), 3.7+ GPA
- Very strong programming contest experience (10+ years participation, IOI (Informatics olympiad) silver medal, ICPC World Finals silver medal, Google and Facebook contests' finalist), Scientific Committee member at several IOIs
- 2 internship experiences at top-tier tech companies

Plans:
- I also considered to work with J-1 visa and get L-1 afterward or use the intracompany transfer to Canada, but I can't get an offer in an international company, even in Tokyo.
- I am planning to apply for PhD and MS as much as I can. For most PhD in US/Canada, I can survive with funds if I can get in. Also, I guess I can manage to graduate from some Canadian universities' MS (e.g. Regina, MUN) without having huge financial problems. But this is also ""if I can get in"" situations.

Others:
- Although I am always motivated to learn languages, right now I can study at higher education or work only in Japanese or English.
- I have $40k right now, and I can make about $10k a year by remote part-time jobs based in Japan while continuing my study.

So, the current concern is that I do not have a CS degree and that might be a huge barrier to get in CS grad programs. I want to be involved in theoretical / algorithm research at the university which I hope I can do well, but I have no idea how I can secure I can be in at least one program.
Also, I don't know well about grad schools in other countries, especially in EU. Do I have chances there?"

I managed to make the top 20, but unfortunately didn't make it through to the top 10 (top 10 are offered internships). I was quite devastated after having put so much work into this application process.   
Two weeks later I saw that the project manager for the summer internship had added me on linkedin, and I decided to just go for it. I found her e-mail address and sent her an e-mail saying I had become very invested in the company and wondered if I could have an internship anyway. She said she'd send my request to the HR-department but couldn't promise anything. Two weeks later she contacted me and asked if I'd heard anything. I told her I hadn't, and she gave me the HR-manager's contact info. At this point I had completely given up hope. 

I sent him an e-mail reiterating my sentiment, and he replied that he'd heard a lot of good things about me and was impressed at my resolve. We then had a chat over the phone, and a week later he called and said the CFO wanted me on his team this summer! I will be working in the finance division at the national headquarters of a F500.  
  
I think the moral of the story is: it doesn't hurt to ask."

boxfae,503,2019-05-15,My Dream Job Has Become a Nightmare,hashbanger,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/boxfae/my_dream_job_has_become_a_nightmare/,"I started my first day at the station after it had finally fallen back into obscurity. This was just fine by me. I had dreamed of being police since I was six, and traded my skirts for my brothers blue jeans which just barely resembled my father's uniform.  It really does run in the blood, that sense of justice. The determination. The drive to make things better than they are now however you can.

Being hired as a dispatcher at the small station gave me such a sense of accomplishment.  And the fact that the floodlights that had been thrown on the Stoddard Police Department had fled in search of newer news made it even even sweeter.  No one who lives here wants their town defined by tragedy.  Most of us at least knew of little Katie Dunn and her mother and many of us were close to the family.  Once the photos of her torn and twisted body reached the media it was as if the entire town and everyone in it was defined by this darkness.  Sadness. Loss. Unspeakable wrath.

Stoddard is more than that. I'm more than that. And once accepted the position, I knew I could finally make a difference in my own small way.

I had volunteered on and off for a year before my predecessor left the position abruptly.  So I was almost entirely trained and ready to take the reins on my first day. I received an hour or two of training, mostly review, and hopped on the radio, checking in with each squad car in turn. Once the initial check-ins were completed, and the slow breeze from the window began to lull my by playing across my neck, I shot up to organize my new desk. It would not be ideal to fall asleep on my first day. It would likely end with Calvert giving my a Sharpie mustache, his mouth agape in dumb amusement.  I had the pleasure of seeing his handiwork on interns the previous year, and would not wear his craft proudly.

I pulled envelopes from the wooden organizers build into the desk, sorted them, cleaned up the log books, adjusted my computer and radio, and generally applied some sense of order to the chaos left by my predecessor. It was then that I saw the red  telephone.

On a deeply set pull-out shelf beneath the filing slots was a red telephone that looked like it had been teleported from the 1980's. Not only was it in perfect condition, but a quick check confirmed that it was hard wired and functional.  Apparently this had not been upgraded to the digital service now used throughout the station. I wondered for a time if this was a way for the officers to phone their partners at home without it being logged and recording by the digital system.

I took lunch in the break room with the captain who looked thrilled as I sat across from him.  I wasn't surprised at his overt reaction.  I'm no knockout or anything, but the stories about Abe were fairly pervasive.  Let's just say that he had the reputation of one, though of advanced age, had a  burgeoning and still mounting appreciation for women.  It was just as well known that he was, at his core, a gentleman. And his exuberance toward the opposite gender fell on the side of charm, rather than creepiness or pushiness.

We had exchanged a few pleasantries before I popped the question.  ""So what's with the red phone?""

Abe put his sandwich down, and tried to meet my eye line.  It was several long seconds before he replied.

""Listen Victoria. Don't worry about it. Don't answer it, don't use it, don't even think about it. Forget it's there.  O'Conner takes care of that.  If it rings, it rings for him. So leave it alone.""

His eyes had begun to tear immediately, but he quickly wrested his reaction towards strict control.  I knew better than to question him.  His eyes told the important part of the story, even if his words had not.  I asked and got and answer. Just leave it.

And leave it, I did.  For several months.  I remember the first time it rang. In fact my ankle is still aching from the fall I took when it did.  The noise was loud and cutting enough to launch me from my chair. But more than that. That sound was final. A conclusion. An end.

O'Connor stepped right over me, ankle in hand on the white linoleum, and took the call. At the time I had laughed at the idea of a one-armed man jumping over a woman with a broken ankle. O'Conner had lost his hand on duty twenty years ago, but had remained as a desk-jockey.  I respected him greatly, he was a lifer.

I pulled myself back up into my seat and saw the consternation on his face as he stood perfectly still with that garish red cradle against his ear.

""West."" He said quietly and placed the handset back down on it's base.

His tried to acknowledge me for a moment before eyes fall to the floor. The darkness behind his eyes. It was all encompassing.  Regardless of the turmoil he had been through in life, O'Connor was never morose.  He took what life dished him and returned the favor with a smile.  With a genuine thankfulness.  When new people visited the station we would all wait to hear which missing limb joke he would subtly worked into the conversation.  It was always in the first few minutes of introduction, and always got everyone laughing. Immediately diffusing the inevitable tension of meeting someone with an obvious disability.  At that moment though, I saw an unimaginable grief beneath the warm exterior.  I saw the void behind his eyes, and the chill beneath his warmth. and felt it alongside him

This happened twice more over the following months. Each time O'Connor would answer the call, reply with a single word and hang up.  Each time I made a special effort to deliver him some coffee, muffins, or another plant for his desk.  I couldn't bear to see him in pain like that.  And for what? For what reason?  And why did he insist on handling it alone instead of asking for help?

When the phone rang on O'Connor's day off, I decided to find out.  As always, the shrill noise cut through the quiet station like a scalpel.  The headset was against my ear before I could even think and I checked my surroundings to make sure that no one saw what I was doing.  My heart banged away like it was trying to pound through a door, and with each inhale the walls seems to close in around me.

Silence on the other line.  Abundant, verdant silence.  Then the noise. Like creaking compression. Like wood imploding into itself, screeching in agony at it's self destruction.  And then that little voice, small and young, but far from innocent.

""How many fingers?"" The voice asked.  I could picture my niece at this age, hands behind her back and smiling up at me.  There was no smile in this voice.

""Two."" I blurted, overcome by the desire to end this immediately.  The line disconnected immediately and I hung up.

""CHshhhht!"" The radio jumped to life the moment I returned the handset.  ""Officer Injured, Fisher and Mount, east side abutment.""

I jumped into action directing paramedics and backup to their location.  It was only when I visited the hospital later that evening that I got the full story from Officer Jerring himself.  He had pulled over a black mustang for speeding on Fisher Road and had rested his hand on the driver's door when asking for ID and registration.  The man behind the wheel, acting perfectly relaxed,  had taken up a knife and slashed at him before speeding off with Jerring's pinkie and ring fingers in his lap.

When I arrived at the station the next morning, I saw that O'Connor had beat me there, and was sitting in my seat. He looked as though he had been crying.  I could not determine if he was crying out of sadness or happiness. I'm still not sure.

""How many fingers?"" He asked. I knew that he was not asking me how many, but if that is what I had been asked, and I nodded slowly.

He smiled, then held the bridge of his nose with his fingers.  An awkward laugh left him and he struggled to center himself before meeting my stunned gaze.

""It's yours now.  The red phone. It was mine, but now it's yours.  You answered it.  You must continue to answer it. To answer her.""

""I'll just…. I'll just keep quiet."" My voice felt feeble and broken. Frantic to claw my way from what this meant.

""No. You won't. You can't.  It's worse when you don't answer.  They told me when I started but I didn't listen.  I tried it too. I'm telling you now. You must listen.  You will answer. You will choose.  And you will live with it.  It's the best you can do. The only thing you can do.""

""What happened when you didn't answer?""

His head fell into his left hand awkwardly and he remained silent for a time.  Wiping his face he told me. ""I decided not to answer the question on May 26th. The night that Katie's body was found.""

His sobs shook his body as I stared down at him,. I understood his burden.  It was the job that I had just accepted.

Last October I found out that other  students had been applying to internships in August and I had completely  missed the deadlines and I don't want that to happen again, when do  people start applying for jobs after college? Also August going into  their senior year? Also what should I work on over the summer to raise  my chances? So far I will be working at a really small start up and will  likely be considered one of the founding members. I'm also hoping to  get assigned to a consulting project for web development through the  school. Both part time remote jobs and the startup work will be mostly  hardware based with a raspberry Pi and the consulting if I get it would  likely be web or mobile development. In addition to this work I had  planned to do leetcode type questions on a daily basis, at least one,  but I'm not sure what a good number to do each day for the entire summer  is. Some other info about me: GPA is a low 2, no relevant prior work  experience but the closest thing I have to that is two project based  courses at the school: one where you come up with your own project and  work on it over the semester and another where you're assigned to work  on a project for a 3rd party person as part of a team. Sort of like  consulting roles but unpaid we were compensated with class credits. I'm  also the secretary for a CS club on campus and I have a relatively  unique side hobby: flying small airplanes. Hoping to get my private  pilot license this summer. What is the best use of my time this summer  to get a job after graduating?"

I'm actually kinda ""nerdy"" and like to study, solve problems, read books, and do academically-related stuffs. The only extracurricular activity I have now is teaching secondary students to learn how to code. I am currently planning to do some internships at a local university or company in my area. However, a friend of mine suggests that I should do some extracurricular activities that are ""socially-related"" (e.g. volunteering, debating at model UN, or joining a summer camp/social clubs) to show my social skills, such as leadership, team work, community experience, etc. I don't think I have any ""socially-related"" activities in application yet, and I also don't have much interest in them. I have seen a lot of posts on this subreddit telling me that ""be who you are, not who you think colleges want"". I thought extracurricular activities are meant to be things you love to and are willing to devote your effort and time in them, but my friend think that my interests are ""too narrow"" and inadequate for my application.

What are your opinions on this? Is it necessary to do activities outside my interest to show that I'm a socially active person who are willing to help my community?

boz9h0,2,2019-05-15,Looking for advice on CS jobs for PhDs (research scientists or other),TechySpecky,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/boz9h0/looking_for_advice_on_cs_jobs_for_phds_research/,"I will be taking an MSc in computational mathematics at a top 50 university, with the goal of undertaking a PhD and then entering the tech field as a research scientist (or other).

My issues/dilemmas: 

- Do I do MSc Computational Mathematics or something like HPC or maybe even just computer science?

- For PhD should I target probabilistic programming, machine learning, pattern recognition or other visual processing projects, HPC project?

The former is linked to the latter, since deciding my MSc, and PhD will most likely impact my future career.

I am planning on undertaking an internship prior/during PhD but I still cannot decide which path to undertake.

On one hand pattern recognition/vision processing will most likely be important to future tech as it becomes more viable, on the other hand its getting very saturated.

Machine learning is currently hyped and I am in the process of writing a paper/publishing, but I am not really ""in love"" with it, and I am worried about what happens when the field collapses.

Probabilistic programming is interesting but all the PhD projects I find seem mindnumbingly boring.

Here is a table of how I feel right now, I have several months to form a final decision on PhD, but only a few weeks for MSc decision.

Project Field | Feelings | Job Security
-------------|--------|------------
Applied AI | Cool and Fun | Seems very dodgy
Machine Learning | Cool and Fun | Very theoretical, is it applicable and wanted?
Probabilistic Programming | 50/50 could be fun or boring (I am sick of graph theory) | Great, probabilistic programming will always be in need I think.
Computational Mathematics | I am sick of nonlinear dynamics and don't have enough experience | Good
Pattern Recognition | Can be cool at times and fun with the right project | Maybe good? Seems like it should grow but its saturated
HPC type stuff | Cool and Fun | But does it apply? and is my MSc then the wrong one?


Another issue is that a lot of the ""cool"" projects I find are at top 20 ranked unis, which for saturated fields makes me getting a position highly unlikely, so I don't want to depend on that.

In terms of work in CS after PhD, I am really having a tough time making a decision. Research is great, but I am also a fan of money and academia here is a real pain. CS companies seem like a dream come true where one can juggle both the CS salaries that tech commands as well as getting to do research.

I am also attracted to the quant research route since the salaries are so high and perhaps if I got a position I could aggressively safe for 4 - 5 years and then switch to an academic role.

I don't know anyone in real life who has gone through these routes as it is uncommon in europe, any advice/info is much appreciated."
bozgpm,20,2019-05-15,"Admitted to Columbia Business School and Tuck, struggling with the decision",ThrowawaySCP,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/bozgpm/admitted_to_columbia_business_school_and_tuck/,"Before you say it, I know just how different these two programs are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background on me:

Currently working in private equity and looking to return to the industry post-MBA, offer to return to my current firm is still being negotiated, no one allowed to advance here without an MBA (stupid rule I know)

Post-MBA geographic preference is for Boston&gt;NYC in that order

Don't need to be at a megafund post MBA

No money from either

Love the outdoors AND the city (I do a lot of skiing even though I live in a major city)

Undergraduate experience was from a large city school, where I loved certain aspects of the school, including the good friends made and at times hated the lack of cohesive community. Overall it was a successful experience that I liked, but didn't love. 

&amp;#x200B;

I initially started this process thinking that Tuck was the school for me and that the immersive/transformative experience, combined with the powerful alumni network was a perfect recipe for me and going to be the antithesis to my undergrad experience. I also applied with an understanding that the school has a fantastic reputation within the PE community, where it places exceptionally well given its size and that it's not HBS/GSB. Overall, I have always loved the idea of committing oneself entirely to the MBA, actually learning something (versus just getting a diploma and a new job), building a strong network/making lifelong friends, and continuing my career in an industry I love. 

However, I also applied  to CBS for its inherent strength in finance. As I learned more and more about the program, did the ASW, and just got an overall sense for the opportunities that being in NYC offers CBS students, it's hard not to take a step back and think there's a strong fit for me at CBS as well. CBS is an awesome program with a seriously underrated community and a stellar academic program that has great placement in multiple industries. While I understand the community is less cohesive, I got the sense that the current cluster structure builds strong bonds. It is hard to discount the fact that I know of several individuals doing in-semester internships at PE funds while at CBS, which to me is truly a unique aspect of Columbia. In short, the elbows may be sharper than Tuck but are a lot less sharp than they used to be at CBS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I stand

1) I feel lucky to be in this position and understand there is really no ""wrong"" decision. My gut tells me I will be happier at Tuck, but soliciting advice from strangers is what I have resorted to so it's clearly less decisive than I thought. 

2) PE placement. I have seen a downward trend in Tuck's PE placement over the past few years. It used to be 5-6% of each graduating class and now its closer to 2%. Hard to pull out of the statistics who is returning to their old firm vs new placement and the ""quality"" of that placement. Having a PE/VC center and fellows program is one thing, getting those students PE jobs is another. CBS's PE program consistently places 5-6% of the much larger class. I know CBS's top field is investment management, but for not being H/S/W this placement is pretty good. Again, hard to pull out of these statistics who is joining CBS with a return offer in hand thus rendering this statistic a little sketchy.

4) Quantity vs. quality of the alumni network is a delicate balance. Getting a job in PE requires you to have pre-MBA PE experience, great stats, AND you have to have an ""in"" with that being either your MBA program gets you an interview (see HBS) or your own networking gets you in the door. CBS allows me to network while in school and has a bigger network, Tuck's alumni network is second to none in terms of help. Feels like this might be an advantage to Tuck but at either school, I will have to work my tail off to get the next PE gig. 

5) Going to school in NYC is going to be painfully expensive. This concerns me in the short term as I am not sure that I will be able to experience everything I want to at CBS, while the dorm situation and cost of living in the woods will be helpful to the bottom line. 

6) Trajectories of the schools. I have tried my best to avoid the rankings game from clouding my judgment and have acceptances to two schools that I thought were well aligned with my career goals, are a great or good cultural fit, and generally considered ""elite"". But I have to look at what has been happening recently to Tuck with a bit more concern than ever before. Columbia's building is opening in 2021 (great timing for my class of 2021), its already juiced its stats to play the U.S. News ranking game and sits at number 6, and continues to diversify away from finance as the U.S. economy shifts as well. To me, CBS will sustain a firm hold in the T5/T6 schools for the foreseeable future. All while Tuck's rankings have never been lower. If this were a one year blip, I probably wouldn't care, if Tuck's PE placement had stayed constant, I probably wouldn't care, but it is hard not to ask oneself, am I jumping on a sinking ship when the one next door has a new mast and can get me to where I want to go?

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think? What haven't I considered?

I'd like to experience the academic side of CS more but I'd rather not jump directly a PhD program.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my stats:

* Undergrad was at the University of Toronto (not sure if it's ranked high enough to make an impact on admissions)
* cGPA: 3.15, Last 4 sessional GPAs: 2.4/3.4/3.57/3.81
* 1 third-author pub in an engineering journal (tangentially-related field, but focus on scientific computing)
* Taking the GRE on the 29th, averaging around 167Q, 160V, but I'm confident that I can reach for 170Q and \~165V.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also planning on officially taking CS pre-reqs (discrete math, OS, DS&amp;A, networks, etc.) to offset my GPA but I can only do so through online accredited programs since my undergrad school is notoriously saturated with CS students, making enrollment almost impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that for research-based programs publications (or in CS, conferences?) are worth a lot in addition to LORs from distinguished professors. I have one down in terms of LORs but obviously in a fairly different field. How does someone in my situation gain research experience as an alumnus (reaching out to professors at my university seems like a stretch, being in a different faculty)? Is it feasible to do it part-time after work/on the weekends? Should I focus specifically on projects at work that would have academic value? Any insight is greatly appreciated!"

My dad and I were having a discussion about Boxing. I heard somewhere that most boxers are on performance enhancing drugs sometimes

but I had no proof for this but based on what I read on the internet I said to my Dad I had reason to believe that a lot

of boxers may be on performance enhancing drugs, however I said I was no expert on this (my Dad's stance was that there

are not on drugs). I said I don't agree with my Dad's stance based on some of the things on the internet, but I said the if I had

the time to research more about it I could either verify his stance better or my stance better. My Dad has this thing where

if I'm conversating with him, and I'm agreeing with him it's fine and then he just talks at me. But if I show a hint of disagreement

with him, he basically gets really upset and takes it personally and makes it as if im trying to 'get a rise out of him' - why he

does this I do not know.

Long story short, he would say his stance, I would disagree, then he would basically repeat his stance again and personally attack me.

For example, he would say that I'm just jealous of the Boxers skill or their physique or something (which is obviously not true). I'm not a boxer,

I am a student. I would basically reply back but it would be us going back and fourth like this constantly. I had time so I thought I'd play his game

and 'entertain' him for a bit. He then goes on to say his stance, and then before I could say my opinion on what was said he would walk out of the room and pretend

he has 'won' the argument (him winning the debate/discussion is him not allowing me to say my opinion/peace) rather than agreeing to disagree.

I said to him ""have you gone to applaud yourself out there"" (out there refers to he went into another room). He heard that and got angry,

and said that the debate is finished now and that everything he says is fact. Which would have been fine if he did not want to discuss anymore, but he would

say the argument is finished and then still continue talking about his opinion, and if I interjected he would say ""no the arguments finished now, leave me alone"" and then

would still continue talking. I just thought the behaviour was a bit odd.

Because we were talking about performance enhancing drugs, mainly steriods, which by knowledge allows boxers/fighters to train/fight harder for longer or just to basically

'enhance' their performance, I made a joke that maybe he should take drugs like the boxers in order to continue the debate/discussion as if to say he's lost his stamina. He said, ""what, take drugs to be like you?""

And I said ""wait are you talking about antidepressants"", and at first he tried to deny it and then full on said that he meant it. For context, I've taken antidepressants in the past and have gone through therapy

to help with my depression and am doing a lot better now. I wasn't offended by what was said, but I didn't like how he had to bring up antidepressants, but he said it's fine because ""we were talking about drugs"". I was

joking about performance enhancing drugs, because those were the drugs that we were talking about for the past 1 hour and a half,but he was saying that it's okay to joke/poke fun at/mention my antidepressants in that

way and that I'm being immature for joking about the performance enhancing drugs thing to him, as he said I was trying to attack his 'mentality' and imply that he was 'crazy and insane'. Am I being gaslighted here?

I talked to my mother about it and she said my Dad was justified and that I should apologise, so I apologised to my dad, expecting him to apologise about the antidepressant remarks, but he said he didn't have to apologise

because he was justified. Is this a double standard or am I in the wrong here?

Since I secured a year long internship, my Dad then went on to imply that I was trying to play the 'big man' and be the 'man of the house'. This again wasn't true and caught me off guard, so I started dancing around and doing the

michael jackson crotch touch 'he-he' thing to show that I wasn't trying to be a 'big man' and wasn't trying to 'undermine his masculinity'. But then he said but doing this I was being immature, and in hindseight I feel like

the dancing thing was so I aplogised for that too. When I tried to explain why I did the dancing thing to my mum and dad, they again said I was being immature, and then this time implied that I was trying to 'play the victim' because

I brought up the fact that bringing anti depressants into a debate about performance enhancing drugs in boxing was wrong.

I'm not sure if I'm being gaslighted here or anything. Am I in the wrong here? I aplogised for what I did, but it seems as if my parents never apologise for anything, and just name call me constantly ""immature"" ""trying to be the big man""

""playing the victim"". My Dad is the same dad that would say getting professional help in the form of medication means you are weak, and I should ONLY EVER be depressed if someone in my life dies, no exceptions.

I remember in the past I exclaimed that I was worried that my little brother would grow up depressed, but because I've been through depression and I'm better again, at least I can advice him as to what I did to get better.

My dad just replied ""what so he can go on drugs like you?"" in a kind of condescending tone. Is he justified in saying this? My take on it was that I wouldn't 'force' my brother to take anything, just that I would advice him as to what I did

but whatever he chooses to do to help his depression would be his choice. I just felt like my dad was being rude saying this, as if going on medication to get better is a bad thing.

My sister caught wind of what happened and eventually moved out, I have moved out also. I still maintain the position that they crossed the line, but I'm guessing my sister things they havent after having further talks

with my parents and I'm guessing she feels that their behaviour (what I've outlined in this post) is acceptable.

Am I in the wrong here? It just feels like they are saying that everything is me being immature, but they are blameless and feel not need to apologise. They then said, even after apolosing, that I have no manners and that I am immature.

I did some research, and it seems like some form of naricistic personality disorder. However I am not doctor and can't diagnose anyone.

All this drama over a discussion about boxing and I just feel I can't live there anymore.

My mother then went on to say that if I wish to live in her house that I have manners (which translate to you must agree with me all the time or I will threaten to kick you out). It just seems like a lowkey threat to me idk.

Like maybe in the heat of the moment my dad replied to my joke about drugs and brought up my antidepressants, and if he said that I would have been probably fine with it. But instead he was saying that he was 'righteous' in bringing up my antidepressants, even though the argument had nothing to do with antidepressants, at all. It just seems like he was just using ad hominen attacks throughout the argument? Or am I overthinking it here.

He then went on to say that I was depressed because of my attitude in life; (Because I don't believe in christianity and the idea of life after death and wrestled with existential thought for a while, - however through therapy and self-help I was able to overcome those thoughts). It just seems like he was using black and white thinking. He would then go on to call me a mommys boy for some reason (even though my mum was the person who was disagreeing with my point of view). It was really wierd.

I later reconnected with my parents to try and have an adult conversation about it and my concerns (as I admitted the dancing thing was immature and apolgoised for that). And when I tried to conversate with my parents, again came the name calling etc, and the random laughing at me when I was trying to get a point across. They said that I was immature in the past and deserved more lick (hitting with a slipper) and more discipline. I asked them to explain what else about me was immature in the past, and they said that it was 'self explanatory' and they shouldn't have to explain it to me? They then said I was spoiled in the past, even though I moved out to gain some more independence (which they disagreed with the fact that I should move out for uni/college and I should stay home with them so they can cook and clean for me - and apparently that is why I'm depressed because I moved out (just seems like a half-truth here)). Before leaving, I asked them if how I conducted myself during the duration of the conversation if it was mature of me or not, and for the first time they argreed I was being mature. Then a week later, my sister told me that my parents said I was again being immature and 'acting out of character' in the family talk. So it went from me trying to explain myself in the family talk, to them basically name calling me again and bring up the past and they thought they I was offended/triggered or something. It just seemed like a bunch of ad homiuems to avoid discussing what went on, and they would always try to interject me. Also, when they asked me a question, I said I needed 2 minutes to think about the answer (As truthly I didn't want them to twist the answer or misconstrew it in anyway), but they said I needed time to think about it as I was 'plannig to lie to them and avoid asking the question directly"". Wtf?

tl;dr: Am I being immature and unreasonable here? Do I lack basic manners based on the fact that in an argument/discussion I feel they should not resort to bringing up my anti depressants? This isn't the first time they have done this (in a discussion with my dad pertaining to my little brother). Am I in the wrong here?"
bp0vvq,2,2019-05-15,Struggles with getting first internship,coldsong,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bp0vvq/struggles_with_getting_first_internship/,"Hello all,

So I've been so frustrated recently with managing to get an internship recently. I'm an applied math undergraduate student at a state college, who is also minoring in Computer Science. I'm mainly aiming for internships in Data Science, Data Analytics, Software Engineering/Development, and Research. Within the past 2 months I've applied to over 170 positions. Only 4 have reached out to me for next steps in the hiring process, and out of those positions I have not received an offer. What sucked was that during my last candidacy for a data science internship, everything was great: the recruiter found my resume to be perfect, and the first 2 interviews were almost solid and i clicked with both the recruiter and data scientist very well, but I had just lost the position to somebody who had more experience. Either that or they had a better educational background or a graduate degree. I'm just wondering how I can successfully land my first internship when I only have retail experience. As for my resume I have all my projects lined up and skills which match the position, but no work experience to back it up except for maybe a few positions in my college organization. Can someone provide me with any tips on how they managed to land their first internship? Any pointers will help me at this point

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"

I'm dealing with my first mixed episode since I was 17 (now 26) and caused me to be hospitalized for 3 months. During that last episode I had psychosis and was on at least 10 different medications that I don't remember what exactly happened/ how I felt/ how the episode ended. Currently I think I'm getting better and then get bad news (generally school and work related things) and it sends be back to where I was before. Unfortunately, any meds that I've been placed on to help me out have made my symptoms much worse, so I just have to ride out the mania without any extra medical help (been on lamictal since I was 16 and have always been med compliant). I had to take an incomplete in two classes and don't have an internship for the summer because I was rejected for everything I applied to (never do interviews while manic because then you might be ""too high energy"" for the job) , so I have a ton of free time to get better.

Here are my questions;

1. How do I know if I'm actually getting better?
2. Will I crash like other manic episodes?
3. What can I do to get better?
4. Will it continue in waves?
5. When will it end?"

&amp;#x200B;

It is now that I've come by several quant trading positions, and they seem to fit my interest perfectly. I must admit that I have almost become addictive to looking at starting positions, and I am not even done with my bachelor degree yet.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that I sometimes worry, maybe for nothing. I am currently in my second year of Economics (3 years total). At the start of next year, I will pursue a minor abroad, where I follow mathematics courses. Additionally, I am curious to pursue a MSc degree in Operations Research. During my masters it is possible to follow several programming courses.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't choose between an MSc in Quantitative Finance &amp; Actuarial Science and Operations Research, would you say that with my background and an MSc in Operations Research (which is of course also highly mathematical), I am suited to get an internship as a quant? If not, could you guide me on how to proceed further?

Thanks in advance!"
bp273u,116,2019-05-15,"When it was, in fact the network",101musicmen,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/bp273u/when_it_was_in_fact_the_network/,"Before I go into the actual story, there is some background on the site that is important. I started an internship for IT support at the university I go to about a month ago, where they put me with the team in the middle of the city the university is on the outskirts of, primarily handling the college of medicine. Although our group and the main campus group are merging, we use different PC images and are still essentially separate. There is one building that we support that is under the main campus IT, which is where out story will take place.

&amp;#x200B;

During my first week, on the 5th of April, a ticket came in saying that the PC that a previous intern tried to install was unable to connect to the network, but their old PC could. So, being the diligent new employee that I am, I go over to their office, and see the issue for myself, and after confirming that it is in fact not connecting to the network, I take it back to our office to look at it more thoroughly, and where I could also re-image the machine if it needed it. Upon booting it in the office, it works, and provided us our first clue that it might be a networking issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Taking it back to the $User I asked if there was an empty station that I could use in order to see if it was just the $User's desk that had an issue, which it was. With that information in hand, I ask the networking guy on our campus if he can fix it, to which he says no but gives me the email for main campus $Networking and I put in a ticket. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a month of essentially no response the other intern tries to call $Networking only to get the general helpdesk which are not the people we want to be talking to. I eventually try hitting 0 to get me directly to an operator from the phone system and get put in touch with the $Networking tech $C. I tell $C that the PC works on every port other that $User's desk, that I had already emailed about it, and ask her to send a tech out to look at it. $C replies that she will look into it.

&amp;#x200B;

$C's version of look into it is assume that it is to sit around and ask questions for a week, even after we confirm that $User's old PC is the only one that will work on that port, insisting that we check that the machine is on DHCP and does not have a static IP and saying that activating the other jack at the user's desk would cost a fee.  Eventually a tech is sent out and to no one but $Networking's surprise, there was a bad connection in the server closet causing the issue. The tech moves some cables and $User was able to use their new PC as of yesterday. I also made a mental note that the response time for $Networking is about 40 days.

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note, the other intern and I might have created a Wall of Shame from sticky notes, and Main Campus IT might be on it, for more than just this...

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - I tell networking it is a networking issue, they say no it isn't, I say yes it is, they say oh look! it is a networking issue."

A bit of backstory first to explain my point

I'm a 3rd year CS engineering student in a top school in my country.

I met an alumna of my school at an event and handed him my resume. He was super cool (the only good guy in the story) and told me he was thinking of taking an intern to do a project he doesn't have the time to do by himself. He works for the company that we're going to call A. This company pays him to work for another company so he is never in his company office but another one.

Fast foward one week later, company A sends me an email telling me they would like to meet me so I meet them, everything is going just fine. The alumna I met wants me to do the project as a paid summer internship. (he wasn't there when I went to the company)

I agree cause it was cool (machine learning project) and the company people were really super cool. As the internship is not 100% written, they tell me they will contact me again in order to discuss the exact topic and what i'll have to do.

We meet again 3 weeks later, the topic is awesome, they tell me they WILL pay me around 600$ a month for my internship. The next day I received a phone call from the company A and they said it may be a bit less than 600$ but still that THEY ARE GOING TO PAY ME.

2 days later, another phone call. They tell me that due to a company policy, they simply won't pay me. Their policy is to only pay students who are in their last year of study. I was really like ""wtf"". I couldn't even believe what they were saying.

I told them I would think about it and sent an email to the alumna I met to tell him I wouldn't accept a non paid internship, especially after they told me they would pay me. He then answered me he didn't understand as they also told him I would get paid. He told me will try to talk to them to understand.

Next day, I get a phone call from a senior engineer working for A. He tries to explain to me the policy of the company and tells me that ""If the internship is a success however, we will give you a bonus."" I told him I didn't believe the company would give me a bonus after they already lied once. He gave me the week end to think about it.

I started to look for other internships and planned on accepting their offer until I found something else.

I called them today and in the end they told me that they didn't want to work with me due to my ""bad"" reaction to the fact that they won't pay me.

Today I also got an email from the alumna. He told me he was deeply sorry to hear that the company didn't want to pay me. He also told me it would be totally understandable if I was to decline the offer and that he was even asking me not to support this kind of policies. He didn't even know his company didn't want to work with me anymore.

I sent an email to the company telling them they were dishonest and incompetent. I may end up posting in r/pettyrevenge if I can do something against them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to find another internship for this summer but it may be kind of hard as it's already so late.

Companies are trying to screw interns and use them as much as possible but we're not slaves. Please don't let yourself fool by them as I was.

Needed to tell this story as i'm kind of mad, sorry if it was too long

&amp;#x200B;

tldr : got screwed by a company who promised a paid internship but after 1 month in the talks, told me it was their policy not to pay students that arn't in their last year of studies.

Edit : just to add a bit of info, I'm french and in France you can't pay an intern less than 634$ a month which is why most companies pay their interns 643$ a month. Companies are required by the law to pay an intern only if the internship lasts more than 8 weeks. And also ofc I won't be working for them.

Edit 2 : grammar mistake"

I currently work part time. I applied for a full time job but was offered a full time internship instead. It would start 3 months from now. They said I needed more experience. It's truly a good opportunity. I'll be able to network, gain experience, and be closer to my end goal in my competitive industry.

However, I'm concerned that I may secure a full time job in the next three months after accepting their offer. Obviously, I would take full time work over an internship so I risk the chance of burning bridges. While my field is competitive, it's also small. Everyone knows everyone. In the chance that I don't find full time work in the 3 months and continue with the full time internship, I am concerned that the company may not bring me on in a permanent capacity. Most of their current employees began as interns which is promising, but at the same time nothing is guaranteed.

as title says I just finished an interview for an IT Intern position at a local Trust foundation.
Keep in mind I’m currently a college student pursuing an Associate’s in CENT(Computer Electronics and Network Technology). I was interviewed by the CIO of the company, and I have to say it was quite nerve wracking. This was my first time in an interview that has anything to do with I.T. other than networking with some company reps at career fairs. The biggest things I took from the interview were that I need to gain some experience in two areas ASAP if I want to be at least decently marketable in my local job market. 
1) Basic MacOS troubleshooting
This company pretty much runs entirely on MacOS which is a huge negative for me since I have more experience with Windows, and basically no experience with MacOS other than taking a class on Windows/MacOS troubleshooting that focused more on Windows.
2) Networking
Unfortunately I haven’t had the opportunity to take the Networking class for my degree, actually taking it next semester.
I was pretty disappointed in myself after the interview, even though I know I asked good questions (noted by the hiring manager).

The reason I posted this was partly for information to those that are trying to get into the IT field on the basic knowledge that employers will ask you for, and also to ask the subreddit a couple questions.
1) What other basics should I try to learn before another opportunity arises?
2) How do I gain experience prior to job opportunities, if no IT position in my area hires without previous experience?

TLDR: Had an interview today and it made me realize the knowledge I’m lacking, really want to make myself more well rounded. 

Thanks everyone."
bp3wsi,48,2019-05-15,I am at wits' end with this job hunt,SureBlackberry,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bp3wsi/i_am_at_wits_end_with_this_job_hunt/,"I'm so angry I don't even know where to begin. I graduated from a coding bootcamp that taught fulll stack early last year and have been on an excruciating job hunt for a while now. Prior to attending the bootcamp I had no CS background, but I really worked my ass off once I started getting into coding and haven't stopped since for over a year now. My bootcamp's career assistance program is useless so I've pretty much been on my own with the job hunt ever since.  Everyday I'm working on building personal coding projects, trying to find other devs online to build apps with, and doing online tutorials to maintain my skills in addition to sending out apps. I think I know where I stand in terms of my abilities, based on my bootcamp cohort mates' job placement rates, other devs I've talked to, reading the news/forums/job descriptions, etc. and have been applying to junior/entry dev roles. First of all, there aren't many of them and EVERY company seems to only want a mid or senior level developer which is so frustrating. I get tons of calls from recruiters but they're all looking for devs who have 4+ years experience (and a lot of them tell me I'm not the ideal candidate because I don't have a CS degree, that I've only been working on side projects and not with a ""real company"" since I've graduated my bootcamp, etc.) My experience dealing with recruiters has never yielded anything good. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to have experience working with a ""real company"" if I can't even find a job with one? Yeah I'd like real world experience with a REAL company too, but how the hell do I get it if you're not even giving me a chance? I've sent out dozens of apps online cold style for junior dev positions and managed to get some contacts to put in referrals for me at their companies, but as usual I got no response or a generic message saying I don't have the qualifications/experience they're looking for. I went to many dev meetups, tried networking and meeting new people, but haven't found it very helpful either. Most people are either job hunting themselves or tell me to look at their company's website and see if there's  a role that suits me which I can put them down as a referral for. But most of the time their company is only looking for mid/sr devs.

While I don't have dev experience with a ""real company"", I've built full stack apps that I've tried to really showcase my skills. I don't have many but the 3 that I do, I put a lot of time and effort in perfecting them. Have them all working, deployed, displayed on my github and linkedin, etc. and even continue improving them in my spare time. But whenever a recruiter or an interviewer talks to me, I feel like they don't even care about my projects, choosing to focus more on my degree, and years of experience. I swear half of these ""technical"" recruiters don't know what the hell they're looking for (like I list that I know Javascript and they think it's Java).  It makes me feel like all the blood and sweat I put into these projects were wasted. I spent months on them and dedicated almost every waking hour on them, so I just feel extremely frustrated that people are judging me based on my ""years of experience"" instead of what I actually built and what I'm capable of.

After over half a year of this agitating routine of hearing nothing promising, I got desperate and resorted to applying for internships. I even helped people I knew to build their websites/solve their tech problems for free in exchange for experience. But many times when I get interviewed for an internship, the interviewer always tells me that I'm a bit overqualified and that the position is usually for fresh grads or people who are still in university. Most of these internships pay nothing or minimum wage, which is also another frustration point for me. My family has been pressuring me everyday to get a job to help with the finances, and it doesn't help that that makes me feel extremely useless, that all this effort, time, and money I put into my coding journey has produced nothing and that I can't even support myself soon. Everyone always tells me to stay positive but no one's really willing to help either. I just get a bunch of ""good luck. You'll find something eventually."" Every day is a struggle and I can't shake off these feelings of worthlessness. I can't go out and enjoy myself/socialize because I have no income and I'm so sick of hearing people tell me I ""don't have enough experience"" or empty encouragements. I put in so much time to prep for the coding interviews by doing toy problems on sites like leetcode and Hackernoon, spend lots of time on the few take home tests I was given, reach out to devs working in the field for coffee chats (but most of them don't even respond). I seriously don't know what to do anymore. No matter how much positive things I read/hear I just can't believe them anymore. No matter how much I put myself out there and really make an effort to better my situation, it leads to dead ends. I don't even know who or what to be angry at anymore and every day I get depressed when I see my bank account decreasing. 

Some people have told me to get a part time job while I job hunt. I tried working at a shop part time for a while but it took away too much time from my studying and because there's not much in my town, most of the part-time opportunities are in the nearest city which is about a 2 hr commute from me. By the time I get home, I'm exhausted and I don't even want to touch code, so this route would only delay me in finding a dev job. I want to focus all my time and energy on coding. I don't even know what to do with this job hunt anymore. While my passion for coding is still there, I'm getting really discouraged and depressed. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm not picky and am not searching for the ""perfect job"" as long as it's related to coding and the languages I know. I'm willing to relocate, willing to work for a bit less, and willing to work for any company as long as they treat their employees well. I'm not even looking to work at big name places like Google or Facebook right now, I just want to get my fucking foot in the door. I know there are some loopholes in my learning my bootcamp didn't cover, so I try to review those concepts on my own. I build projects to showcase what I'm capable of. I'm friendly and easy to get along with, and I try to be helpful when I work with others. I've made an effort to network and reach out to people since I initially never had any contacts in the industry, but I'm seeing nothing promising. It makes me wonder if hard work is even relevant anymore. I've seen some of my cohort mates stop trying after they graduated or slack in their personal improvement after finding a job. I don't want to be like that and I'm still trying my best to improve every day but it's hard when you're in this alone and nobody seems really interested in helping you. Sometimes I just want to throw my hands up in their air and give up too. I feel extremely stuck, financially and  career-wise and sometimes I go to bed wishing the next day would never come.

Sorry for this extremely long post. I honestly don't know what to do anymore other than continue doing what I've been doing but have my faith die slowly day by day. My goal since starting my coding journey was always to be a developer/software engineer and I'm not going to stop because I know I can't. That would mean abandoning my dreams. It's just so disheartening and lonely when all you hear most of the time is along the lines of ""you're not good enough"" or ""suck it up"" or ""why can't you find a job? What's wrong with you?"". I can't sleep properly, I don't have an appetite often, and I barely socialize anymore because I don't want to bring others down with my depression and I don't have money to spend on social activities anyway. I always hear ""if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything!"" well, I'd like to believe it and I've been putting my entire being into becoming a developer for a while now, but I haven't achieved anything. Hopefully I can achieve my dreams of being a dev/software engineer before I die or have to declare bankruptcy. I don't even know what I want out of this post, but if anyone who has been through the same experience and wants to sympathize or offer advice, go ahead."
bp41xe,1,2019-05-15,This post is long overdue.,lost-somewhere,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bp41xe/this_post_is_long_overdue/,"I lost my father in December 2017. I graduated from community college in December 2017. I got married in November 2018. I've been completely lost with myself since December 2018. I don't want to make him an excuse and I know my father be highly disappointed in me for this shit.

When I got out of HS in 2013, I was sure that I wanted to be a teacher. I ended up doing an internship and absolutely hating it. Then my dad said what is something you're interested in when you were a child, and I told him fossils, rocks, earth. Anything related to that. BOOM! I found out that my uncle was a Geologist, how fucking cool. I took every geology class in community college and fell in love. Now im stuck, right? No money, no financial aid. My community college had a shorter and cheaper program for teaching. I thought maybe because I was so young then I just didnt like it. So i decided to give it another chance with another internship for teaching. Still fucking hate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am stuck. 

I can't afford to go to a 4 year school for Geology. 

I fucking hate the thought of teaching.

I've been looking for a job in office work because I figured that's easy and easy money. BUT I HAVE 0 EXPERIENCE. 

I got a job at a warehouse recently, walked out the first day because that is not where I want to be. 

I got a job at a pizza place because that was my first job when I turned 16, I quit today because I feel so degraded.

My husband is a chef, and loves what he does. He has no college experience, nothing. He's happy where he is. I feel like I am just falling behind. 

I cannot figure out what I want to do.

I want to work from home because this is my safe place and I feel comfortable. Every time I look for ""at-home jobs"" its practically impossible. I'm trying. I'm failing. I'm falling, I don't know if i can get up at this point. 

My mother is somewhat helpful in the fact that she knows I am struggling with building myself up again. I have no motivation to work at a fucking warehouse or a pizza place. That's not who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I love reading, writing, geology. I lack money to afford schooling even though I have an A.S. I seriously don't know what to do with myself. 

I thought I hit rock bottom when I was addicted to drugs (I am not anymore and pass that stage in my life.) 

I think I am now hitting complete rock bottom. I don't know where or who I am anymore. I use to fight so hard for what I want and now I cant.

Someone please help me or guide me into the right direction. I'm lost."

I'm a CS major, 30 years old, with one year left at a second-tier state university in a major US city. My GPA is 4.0 so far, and have a passion for CS and programming, though obviously I have a ton of basic stuff still left to learn.  I'm also doing a research internship with a couple of professors at my school this summer. I wanted to get out of the family business after 10+ years and do something intellectually stimulating.

Still, I can't help be thrown for an absolute loop about the seemingly agonizing and unpredictable process of finding a junior developer job. I'm good at making things work out in my life by working hard, but there seem to be too many variables outside my control in the job search. I know I can master the technical end of the interview process, but can only imagine how I might be rejected in the behavioral portion. I had an upbringing in a very strange rural community (I now live in a major US city) and my friends are all wonderful weirdos as well, so honestly I don't really understand what kind of vibes I give a ""normal"" middle class American, or how to get them to want to hire me. TBH, my fear of the job search haunts me on a daily basis and I still have a year left of school. Argh!

So, my workaround is to start my own business, maybe with other people I know. I've worked in my family's small businesses (farming and selling products from our farm to retail customers) ever since I was a teenager (I'm currently 30 years old) and have an understanding of the basics of business management, bookkeeping, and marketing. I've been successful in retail sales for the family business as well.

 I don't need to make more than $40,000 per year any time soon, and I won't be upset if my business only offers simple services for small business at first. I know I can raise a few grand in capital from friends and family. What's important to me is gaining experience and being master of my own fate. So, could you tell me why spending the 6 months after I graduate on trying to establish a modestly successful small business is a worse idea than spending 6 months on a junior dev job search?"

I have one semester left in a pure math and stats undergrad at uWaterloo, with a 95 average through my last 4 semesters and several software internships, one at a unicorn. I'm currently doing a research assistantship in discrete optimization and enjoying it a lot. I'm considering another full-time research assistantship in the fall. I don't have any papers published or anything like that.

For grad school I'm mostly interested in algorithms, discrete optimization, and game theory, though I only have ~1 course in each of these areas. I would be applying to start in Fall of 2020 or 2021.

For those familiar with the MS CS and with TCS, do you think it's realistic to get in with this background? U of T is a great school and living in Toronto is an ideal situation for me personally, so plenty of my decisions over the coming year depend on my likelihood of getting in.

Also, do you have any general advice for me and other prospective applicants to Theoretical CS or the MS CS in general?

Looking for a private room to rent from the end of May till mid-August (dates are flexible). Budget is \~$1000/month (including utilities). Open to live just about anywhere as long as its safe and within a reasonable distance to my work. Access to a parking spot or at least easy street parking would also be ideal.

About Me: I'm a 21-year-old male who just finished up my Junior year at Ohio State. I'm studying film and was lucky enough to obtain an internship with a production company in LA, which is why I'll only be there for the summer; the internship is paid so no worries on being able to afford rent. I'll be at work from 9-6 on weekdays and in my free time I enjoy movies, TV, video games, working out, going out with friends, and meeting new people. I'm very neat and tidy and will ensure that the place is kept clean throughout my time living there. I'm very easy going and keep to myself most of the time, and I'm open to living with just about anyone! Like I said, I love making new friends!

I wanted to share two opportunities over the summer, which will hopefully be of interest to some of you here.

1) We have a machine learning research group, currently with 3 members (including myself). I guess you can think of it as a machine learning lab of some kind, where we gather together weekly (somewhere on campus) to work on interesting machine learning problems and try to publish some papers. If this is something you are interested, I can share more about who we are, the papers we've published/submitted in the last 6 months (3 papers in total, 1 journal and 2 conference), what we are currently working on and also hear your interests. It's not a job opportunity as no payment will be involve (you don't pay to join the group, and you also don't get paid by anyone of us). We simply get together, work on problems and try to get our names on a paper together. I am doing this completely out of interest but some other members use the opportunity to get publications for their graduate school applications, so we welcome people with all sorts of interests/motivations/backgrounds.

2) I also want to share a summer opportunity for my own startup (currently just myself, but with one other person joining soon). It is a data science/ML startup with some early traction. I thought post it here if anyone is interested in some summer work which can be very flexible (we can meet and work on campus, you can take classes during the summer, etc). It is in its early stage but you will be paid. Not gonna be Google interns level salary of course, but it is still some money + work experience and I'll promise to try to make the experience as fun as possible. Experience with web development will be very helpful. If you'd like to learn more about me, or the venture I'm working on, I'd be happy to share more.

If any (or both) of these opportunities interest you, please pm me for more detail!
Thanks

Reason being  I want to apply to this company because they are the only ones offering 100% WFH around here, but the position they are hiring for closest to my qualifications is asking for 3 years of fullstack .NET experience (next closest is asking for 4years of MEAN stack), which I do not have but which I believe I can get up to speed with, basing myself on my performance of a 5-month (fulltime/paid) internship. So... Somehow I must communicate that I am capable enough to be given a chance at this position, and so I've come for your advice.

You can stop reading now

&amp;#x200B;

A little about myself and to justify my confidence a little bit: I will graduate after my internship. My internship has had me working fullstack from scratch to finish on a reactjs/nodejs/mysql webapp with a team of interns, I may not have the experience to quickly tell which CSS property is pushing a component out of alignment, but I get things done at a reasonable pace even if they haven't been done before by anyone in the team, I love finding solutions to the difficult problems. We do code reviews and I've had to modify parts of everyone's code at some point. I can easily see myself being as productive as someone with 3 years of experience that had a slower start. I'm also very adept at internet-communication which I wold deem particularly important for a remote job.

&amp;#x200B;

So how to approach it? should I give them the idea that they could give me a test-run on a contract for a few months before employing me full time? Should I reach to their HR person or their recruiters in linkedin, or just apply through their website, maybe both? should I mention that I dont have the years of experience to justify that I think I am capable of performing or should I just omit the lack of experience in a cover letter?

bpbwzy,5,2019-05-16,Is PHP a smart career choice?,Jorself,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/bpbwzy/is_php_a_smart_career_choice/,"Hey /r/webdev,  


I am a cs college student probably like  many other here. In about a month I will be graduating college. So far I am mostly experienced with PHP through the internships I have had.

But everywhere there is quite some hate towards PHP. As far as I see the hate is mostly directed to how easily it is to implement PHP poorly (and how often that's done) giving it a bad rep. 

But still it makes me wonder will it be a good career choice to start working as PHP developer. Or should I invest myself into learning a more respected language. Say I start as a PHP developer and keep doing this for 5 years how would those 5 years of experience match up vs 5 years as .NET developer. (Personally I quite despise the entire Microsoft stack).

I know there are a lot of PHP development jobs available and will be for quite some time. But in the same way there are still job openings looking for Haskell or similar languages. I would like to work with as new as possible best practices.  So far the most annoying thing I have encountered is solving an issue that is already fixed in a later version of something but you are running legacy code. Php isn't exactly legacy but if I'm solving problems ineffectively it doesn't make me feel proud of the work i produce, which in turn will make me lose motivation for the project/work. 

As a final note. I'm not going to pick a job solely based of the language. There are lots of factors I'm considering but this is one specific subject I'm looking for input on. Please let me know do you think PHP is a good startup for a career?"

Here from an account I made some time ago to make this post but I've never had the strength to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I introduce myself: 23 yo engineering student living far from home for study purpose. To be more specific I'm in this other city for 4 and half year. I'm attending bachelor's degree and I've passed half of my exams. The whole bachelor should last 3 years, so I'm definitely in late. I'm also in a relation for 2 and half year with a girl a couple of years older than me, but also her is in late with her medicine studies.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I got a mail in which they proposed me an internship for one of the biggest company in the world in my field and I was really excited for that so obviously I told her about that. At the beginning she didn't seem really happy for that because I said ""I could leave university for this opportunity"" and than things are gone worst today when she wanted to talk again about that and I said that I would go everywhere for this company. She felt like not so important for me... and to be honest I'm also thinking about that...

&amp;#x200B;

She is awesome but sometimes I think she is not the right person for me because of some health problem she has and that can be a limit for my and our future; she can't have children and she is transplanted so she often get sick.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be considered an asshole, but I've figured out today I have to think about my future for myself to get the best I can for my self, and maybe this won't be possible for me if I stay with her.

&amp;#x200B;

 She maybe is also the main reason I don't come back home despite my parents are asking me that for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm totally confused right now... I'm thinking to break up with her, leave university here and come back home to my family, but I feel really bad for that. I'm feeling a complete failure.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is not I'm not enough intelligent or something like this; my problem is that I don't study and I waste my days or studying things related to my subject but not to exams or completely laying on the bed full of depression. This is more true when you see my marks, because when I study I'm really good at what I do.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a really complicated moment of my life and I feel really bad because I don't know what to do... What to do with my girlfriend and with my life at all...

&amp;#x200B;

So.. two problems... university and girlfriend... maybe a cliché but I feel really bad for that...

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am, with a new account to tell you my story and asking strangers for help....

&amp;#x200B;

Really glad if someone could give me advice or let me think in the proper way about this things...

I am a first year CS student (3 years degree). Even though I have completed my first year I practically don't know anything. At first, it was my inferiority complex - I was afraid of how incompetent I was and how there is so much to learn and that everyone is better than me - so all the time I was you know feeling down and didn't do anything. Academically also I didn't do good in both of my semesters. It isn't because it is not for me - I want to be a CS graduate but it was because of the fact that I would compare myself to other students who basically landed junior developer job in 1st semester itself. I have moved on and realized that it was just basically hindering my progress.  


So - I have a 3 month long summer holiday (I will also be working at a factory - to fund my education) and my goal is to be a full stack developer (not in 3 months but when I graduate out of the university). Since I am basically starting from scratch I am thinking of buying Bjarne Stroustrup's book (Programming Principles and Practices using C++) and learn C++ and data structures (I really want to learn C++). But the thing is where I am from software companies are mostly looking for JS developers, so is it a good idea to learn C++ and JS simultaneously or should I learn C++ for 2 months or so (because I really want to learn this language ) and JS for 1 month. My goal is to land an internship next summer. I have also completely removed Windows from my PC and am also planning to use Emacs as my ide.  


  
Thank you for reading my post - next semester I will be taking classes like Operating Systems, Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Networks - any tips? Because I really want to do good next academic year."

Option 1: Stay at company (1.5 years working here)
 
Pros:
- Vacation paid out per pay cheque
- contractor position
- good relationship with managers
- nice office and co workers
- work life balance is great
- more well known company
- started off as intern, they gave me contractor position

Cons:
- company itself just did layoffs but I was told I’m safe until next year so a lot of smart people left
- no benefits
- contractor position due to lack of headcount
- nothing new to learn
- don’t seem to be getting rewarded for my efforts

Option 2: new company 

Pros: 
- can get same pay but with full time (benefits, PTO, 401k)
- more learning or growth in skills?
- they say they are on a growing path

Cons:
- new environment
- unsure actual workload
- smaller or startup company
- unsure managers expectations
- smaller office

Option 3: keep looking for other jobs

Give it up, forget about it. But prepare for the next best thing. 

2) Beckman is a beautiful study space with working charging wall plugs and numerous desk space and group study places on all floors. Watch out tho, cause it's not open to us on the weekends and access closes at 6PM on weekdays. 

3) Apply for access to Seibel whenever u join a CS class. VR, 225, 173, it doesn't fucking matter. Get access to seibel, it'll be super helpful over time. 

4) CS classes are free. Like crazy free. 173, 225 are very rudimentary. 374 is free if you take it with Mahesh Vishwanathan. CS 4xx classes are jokes so take them as much as possible for tech electives. 

CS 410 had 4 MPs on which I spent less than an hour each, weekly quizzes which took 2 hours to study for, no exams or finals. The final project was free too. 

CS 460 with Bambenek is extremely interesting, and easy enough if you put in the weekly work (decent amount 10-20 hours especially if you're like me and don't know any security). No exams, quizzes, or finals. 

CS 498 classes are usually super easy, such as Digital forensics and case in point VR, AML which I will talk about next. 

5) For CEs take VR and AML for your advanced electives. AML has no exams or finals, and VR has two exams but is free apart from those (the exams can be studied for the day before). No finals. 

6) EE and CE can interchange majors pretty easily. If you want to relax and live a comfortable life doing no work and sitting back making 6 figures while working 10 hours a week tops at a fortune 500, switch over to CE and take as many CS classes as possible. 

7) NETWORK. Fuck me. ECE is full of snakes and tattletalers. Ignore them. The vast majority of them are useless. That one dude who is aight, doesn't really know his shit but can talk a big game? Yeah he's goin places. Stick with em. The best way to get hired as an intern is to be refereed in. Find chill peeps at these companies go grab a beer. 

8) You better get a hundo on all CBTF exams. There's absolutely no reason not to. If you can't u need to find a better group or infiltrate one of the chineese. 

9) GYM. The arc is chillin right there. GO. 

10) Leetcode like a motherfucker. 1000 problems. u have them memorized? that's gg you can get any software position at any company globally. 

11) Startups are hard work, boring, irritating, and annoying. 99% of people are gonna lose money. Stay the fuck away, sit back with ur 6 figures at a fortune 5 hundo, and enjoy the benefits. 

12) ECE classes are annoying. Conflicts are the same exams. Network, use ur resources. Teachers recycle exams. 391, 411, all have problems from past exams. Get previous exams from past semesters which the profs haven't made available. Frats and chineese have the banks of these. 

13) I'll think of more. For now i'm relaxing with my pina coladas so fuck off.

EDIT: Holy fucking shit. This fucking blew up -- thank you kind one for gilding."

I wanted to get some advice from anyone who is willing to help. This has been tearing me apart for a while. 

Career:
So, I’m a senior at Kent State University, I graduate in December. I have an Associates Degree from Eastern Gateway Community College in Information Technology which focused on Networking and Server work. I wanted to get more education under my belt so I’m at Kent for my Bachelor of Technical and Applied Studies: Computer Technology Applied Computer Security and Forensics Technology Concentration. 

I know for a fact I will have to start out at the Help Desk. Which I’m happy with, right now I work for Penske as a Sales Associate and a Assistant Store Manager for Ace Hardware. So I have no IT expierence, I never got a internship in either college. I tried applying for them, never got them. So I’m kind of screwed for expierence, in my area there’s really nothing here for jobs I’m lucky to have what I have.

My questions are:
Has anyone worked Help Desk? What’s it like? What am I to expect? I’ve been googling but I want real world outlooks. 

After 5 years of college, I know I do not remember everything I learned which kills me. I try to keep everything fresh, all I have is my notes. 

Any advice y’all can give to me as an upcoming IT guy?? Speak away if you have anything.


Moving:
I hate it in NE Ohio. The winters are brutal for me, I hate driving in the snow and it is depressing. Companies are leaving the area. My girlfriend is from the south and she wants to go back home. So, we have 2 places in mind, Jacksonville FL or Orlando FL. Personally, my mental health is worth more to me than the cost of living difference, which Ohio is not cheap in the first place. 

What are some good companies in the area? I have been researching a lot lately and found some companies like BrookSource, iVenture Solutions, and Kelly Services. All have contacted me willing to talk when I get closer to graduation. Kent State has been up the students rears trying to get us all a job before graduation, it makes the school look better. 

Any advice for the area please help! I can’t wait to move but I want to get a career at a company first. 

Thank you, 
Christian."

I‘m currently interning for a software company and have been assigned a simple task where I have to extend the application with a few new features. Compared to the other people who work there I need at least 3-5x the amount of time until I get these tasks done. 

It really worries me because I‘m not sure if I am fit to become a developer and become as fast they are. I know I am still an intern but it still feels like I’m producing nothing at the end of the day, besides the headache I get after work.

I've been looking for an internship for the summer since fall but have only had any responses in the last few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was given an interview and then offer from a company (company 1) for a part time (16hrs/wk), unpaid IT internship. After not having gotten any interviews (much less offers), I accepted it and decided I would get another job for an income, thinking some experience is better than none. I would be starting this position this coming Monday, May 20. 

&amp;#x200B;

The day immediately after accepting the position, I was contacted by another company (company 2) over the phone. This position is full time, paid (12-15/hr), and closer to what I am interested in (software development rather than IT). They seemed interested in me, and wanted to set up a more proper interview. Of course, nothing is easy, and the person I would interview with is on vacation all week. The person that initially contacted me said she would try to see if we could set something up anyway, but has not contacted me regarding an interview since (I have gotten another email from her with a form to fill out, which I did). I would much, much prefer this internship over company 1.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what the next step I should take is. Currently my acceptance to company 1 is only via email and I have not filled out all of the paperwork. Do I go in Monday for company 1, and then quit if I get accepted to company 2? Ask company 1 to start later (though, I already did that once - the day they wanted me to start I already had something planned, so I asked to start Monday)? Something else I'm not thinking of?

Regardless, I've been considered creating a site, and I recently purchased a domain name as my next big step. I was going to just go ahead and create a wordpress site and find a decent host and go for it, but now I've become a bit conflicted as I've heard many people talking bad about wordpress.

So I guess my question is, what should I use to create and host and whatever else my site? I have never created a website before so while I know the basics of HTML and a little bit of CSS, I would never say I'm practical in my knowledge of either.

Is wordpress fine for a simple personal site? Or a huge nono now? I expect to mainly just put some basic stuff contact information, maybe some projects or something and potentially a blog for fun.

Any help regarding hosting would be appreciated as well, I've looked at hostgator and saw they had pretty decent prices I thought, but there may be better of course.

I'm a pretty big novice overall when it comes to this, but I want to start working on more personal projects and what not to help build experience and also get a better idea of what I want to do in the future.

tl;dr, where do I host/create my website and what other things do I need to know? Is wordpress good or nah?

bpha4o,2,2019-05-16,Layoff or Severance package?,BushcraftHatchet,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bpha4o/layoff_or_severance_package/,"So a friend of mine is facing a layoff sooner or later. Writing is on the wall. Industry is in decline, layoffs every year, consolidation of departments from multiple sites in to a downsized departments servicing multiple sites, declining sales, upper management now sacrificing some middle management positions. Friend has been pretty safe due to multiple years of experience with the company in key positions. 

So to quote Shakespeare, ""To take severance or not to take severance. That is the question.""

Maximum severance is 20 weeks which he will cap out at so this is significant. OR should he brush off the old resume and start hitting the bricks? I will say that it is my opinion that this fellow is old school experienced. About nothing phases him about his line of work and he is good at it. However, the job market in this area for these positions is drying up so he will probably get hired but it will not be for what he is worth. Think about the movie ""The Intern"". He reminds me of DeNiro's character in this movie.

So what should I counsel him in doing? Hold out making more and possibly take a nice fat severance or cut your losses (and the current job frustrations) and just move on?"

I'm a second year student but am considered a junior because of my credits. Anyways, a month ago, I signed an offer for my first internship and am extremely excited. That being said, I've never really worked in a professional setting like this and I'll begin working in a little under three weeks. Here's what I'm worried about mainly:

* I'll be interning as a data scientist and have taken a data science course in R but I think my position will be demanding Python. I do know the basics of Python but am not too familiar with all the data science / ml related modules. What should I be doing to prepare? Any resources you would recommend?
* Is it really true that there are no dumb/stupid questions to ask my mentor? Like honestly, the place where I'm interning is pretty sick and I'm literally surprised I made it in and so I feel like there's going to be a lot of people more knowledgeable than I am or are able to process information much faster, and I'm just afraid of sounding dumb. I know this can be combatted by doing my own research and only asking when I can't find help through that, but at the same time, I don't want to feel like I'm constantly pacing myself to reach the level of others. If it's possible, I would like to reduce that as much as possible right now by increasing my knowledge in pertinent areas before starting work. Idk, I'm a bit overwhelmed by this whole thing. I know I shouldn't be worrying so much about it, but I think the idea of it being my first time ever doing this is adding a whole ton of stress.
* Are there any good data science or software engineering practices that you all would recommend mastering ASAP?

Aside from all that, I'm a rising senior and have no clue what I should be preparing for next year. Should my main focus be on securing a full time offer after my graduation (spring 20)? My dream is to land a full time offer with a big N company straight out of university (I won't be crushed if that doesn't happen). Anyways, what should I be focusing/paying attention to aside from school work?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently finishing my sophomore year of an undergrad degree with majors in computer science and math, and I have some questions about grad school and admissions. I've posted on a few relevant professional groups and talked with my CS major advisor, but the decision on what to do and process still seems like Herculean task to me. I'm trying to decide now because if I'm going to go to grad school straight out of undergrad, I need to research schools next year, start working on a statement of purpose, and take my GREs.

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, a 4.0 is not within reach for me. It's taken a lot of effort to get to a 3.2-3. I'm doing better in higher level CS and math classes than intro classes, but I still think the best I'll be able to do is a 3.5.  All of my professors agree that I understand far more than my grades suggest, but have trouble showing it sometimes, in large part because of my time management problems. I came to a very well-ranked women's liberal arts college from an okay public high school and a family whose members range in education from no high school diploma, to a bachelor's from a public university, to part of an online master's. The adjustment has been an ongoing process. I'm worried that my GPA will be an immediate turnoff for any institution I apply to, should I apply straight out of my undergrad. This has contributed to some people suggesting that I work for a few years before applying to a PhD program, but I'm concerned that a regular industry job would do nothing but hurt my qualifications.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I'm participating in research when possible, but am unsure of any benchmark I should be aiming for. I write literature reviews for my computer science classes every so often (not to be published anywhere, but I know how to write an academic literature review decently), have been a research assistant in some human-computer interaction lab projects (that I have presented on at my school's student research conference), have been wanting to do an independent study on a topic of interest in networks, want to thesis (potentially on that networks topic if I can dive deep enough into the problem I'm considering), did some of the web development for the campus hackathon this year, and write workshops for the kids' coding center I work at. This and last summer I've taken industry internships, doing databases and QA work respectively. I've done more than that, as I've been very involved with computer science since my freshman year of high school, but figured a short summary of my explorations into CS would show my strategy for exploring my future.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very unsure of how to look for computer science programs or decide on a research area. I'm leaning heavily towards computer science PhD programs as opposed to master's programs, because computer science research interests me deeply. I know I don't want to do human-computer interaction (or really much to do with the front end), or pure theory. I have some interest in systems, networks, and security research, but don't really know how to know if I would do well spending the better part of a decade on those subjects. I would really enjoy a department that used technical computer science research to further social justice. I have no idea how to pick schools to apply to, or how to tell if they are within my reach.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice at all is appreciated."

How do I get out of my current career path and move to another one?",Bread_Sheep,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bpjlh2/been_working_as_a_software_developer_for_almost_2/,"So, I went to school for software development at a community college for my ASOE (associate degree that isn't transferable; mainly used to try and enter the work field without having to go to school for a 4+ year degree). It was an enjoyable experience that now has me rethinking exactly *how* easy it all was. I entered the work force expecting to do a bit of internship work followed by that dream-cash-money-making career, and I started my internship as a data analyst at a tech company, moved onto working a Summer job teaching elementary students the fundamentals of programming, and then landed another internship at a courthouse as a web designer.

As my internship at the courthouse is coming to an end soon, I started looking for that dream-cash-money-making career I thought I was building myself up to. I have almost 2 years of work experience and a degree, seems like any company's dream software developer, right? Not at all. Turns out all the stuff I've been doing has been barely scratching the surface of what it means to be a real software developer. My community college experience pushed me through it's courses with ease and the work I've put into the jobs have little transferable skills into the workforce that I was trying to get to make the dream-cash-money-making career I was hoping for.

I found myself pondering where I went wrong in my years trying to become a software developer and why I can't get a decent job. I thought back to when I used to love programming in school, and how enjoyable it was to teach. Then it all clicked, the reason I can't get a job in a software developer field of work is because I don't have a passion for solving complex problems. I have a passion for making video games! It all clicked, in school they taught a lot of lessons using games, then I taught the students in my class using exclusively video games, and I've loved playing video games since I was a kid.

&amp;#x200B;

This leads me to where I need some advice. How can I change my career path from a software developer to a video game maker smoothly?

Here's my conditions: I've got my ASOE in software developing (which isn't that out-of-tune with a video game designer.. i hope). I live on a pay-check-to-pay-check type of life. I know I shouldn't spend every penny I make, but it's hard to save much when you don't make much. I rent a room with my girl friend, so I have to consistently make some kind of money to pay for bills."

My highest paid internship in college was $10/hr. I landed my first job after 4 months of searching, and was led to believe it was a full-time marketing position. When I got my contract, it said I would work Mon-Thurs, 8-5, with the occasional Friday. At first I was stoked—3 day weekend—but then I realized it was so they didn’t have to offer me benefits because I was labeled “part-time” in their system (even though i put in 85 hrs my first paycheck). I also asked for $35-40k if salaried, or $15-20 an hour (which is standard for my area for marketing). She offered me $15 an hour, which totals $31k a year, if I worked 40 hrs a week. She also explained the expectations of the job as exactly what I did at my internship, so I thought this was a good deal ($5 more per hour).

I’m now realizing that this is WAY more responsibility than she originally expressed, and two weeks in, she has me supervising people now. It’s a small business, and I’m basically her only employee (besides the woman I’m overseeing), so I’m doing everything administrative AND the marketing. 

I haven’t even gotten my first paycheck (I started May 1), but I’m quickly realizing I’m being underpaid, but I just started &amp; can’t lose this job. Is it appropriate to address my concerns w my boss? Do I risk getting fired for asking for a raise so soon? How can I pitch the conversation to her? Plz help, TIA.

I'm a third year college student, going to my last year in the fall. I recently interviewed for a web dev position and I got an offer. However, it sounds like it would be a contract position (I get assigned jobs and get paid as I complete them) rather than a full time/part time position. Overall I feel kind of anxious and worry that it might be like a scam.

When I tried to research the company it was difficult to find information on them. I would Google the company's name and their webpage wouldn't show up, but duckduckgo was able to bring me their website (took me a while to figure that out).  The website has three different pages total (the usual landing page, contact, and an about us). They're a fairly small company (I think 10-20 employees), so I don't know if that adds much.

This would be my first professional experience coding (no prior internships) so I'm willing to admit it's also maybe first time jitters? Imposter syndrome? Would contract work be good for my first experience?"

My GPA is not fantastic but not terrible, somewhere in the range of 2.9 to 3.3. I interview fairly well, but when I look at engineering job postings for internships and full-time positions alike I never feel I am qualified. There seems to always be skills I lack that the job postings suggest. 

If I graduate with no internship and my current GPA, is it unlikely for me to be able to find a job post-graduation? Is it possible I could do an internship after graduation?

bpkrnz,0,2019-05-16,What should I do,sealdragon2,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bpkrnz/what_should_i_do/,"So, I was an Intern with a company that contracts out and in the remaining weeks I want to say around four they had no work for me so basically, I was on a as needed basis because the project I was supposed to help with got pushed back. Now I am finished with my internship and for the most part it was a positive experience. But what really bothered me was the lack of communication for when I finally got the answer I was looking for. Now the company has not spoken to me since I got the email back nor have I tried to reach out. Right now I think there’s no position I can apply for that I would be a fit to work. They do like their interns for positions before others. They have not officially terminated me in the time I was waiting for work because I would think they would have been professional about it if they really did not want me. I can't wait around for a position to open where my skills can align if they are still interested. I already talked to one of the managers about a psoition a few weeks prior to this that I did not get with the company. How and when would should I go about emailing my former manager and asking about using as a possible IT related professional refence? I already started applying for other comapies and now playing a waiting game for interviews.

What would you do in my situation as all the people I did work with where nice and I did learn a lot but at the same time I need to look after my best interest and that is getting a full time position somewhere. I don't wan't to come of wrong if I try and send an email once I have some interviews lined up."
bpkxlj,4,2019-05-16,Im confused on what to do with my life,avatar4real,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bpkxlj/im_confused_on_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"So I made a post on r/teenagers and though the response was positive, I still wanted input from you all. Basically a copy paste but here you go.

I'm 17, in high school. I'm a guy and pretty nerdy ig, like into Star Wars, comic books, etc. I love art and movies, super into psychology. I love to swim, and helping people a passion(check post history for specifics). 

The thing is, I don't know why I feel the way I do. I've got a few really fantastic friends, both irl and online. My parents are (usually) pretty nice, I get along with most my classmates and teachers. Yet, I always find myself so lonely, and idk why. And it feels wrong to complain about it, because I see so many of y'all talking about other issues that feel so much more real, like no friends and stuff, and who am I to bitch about being lonely. The friends I have are in school friends basically, because the minute school ends, we never meet up irl or do anything fun together. At most we have a discord chat, and as nice as it is, because like I said, really great dudes, but nothing could replace just hanging out and doing wacky stuff. Doesn't help that I basically have no control on my life rn. I can't drive by myself(started late), I'm in tough classes that I really couldn't care less about because college, and I feel so trapped. It's like my entire life is stuck between school and home and that's it. Nothing more than that. It used to be nice during swim season, but that ended too.

I feel like it's this lack of contact that made me value romantic relationships way more than I probably should, but just seeing people around me having someone who always shows affection and care and support, and I don't have that, it makes the loneliness thing worse. I mean if the only relationships( only 2) I've had are an online ones, that says something, because I'd most likely never meet those people. I mean, I see people around me driving, having sex, and moving on to bigger things in life and I am stuck here, alone, never even had a first kiss. This also leads to a ton of self esteem issues, like I find my self really unlovable at times, and wonder why tf anyone would waste their time with someone as pathetic as me, when she could go for someone way better(not like anyone confesses their love for me anyways but still). I actually call myself unlovable and undeserving of love because I figured that maybe it would stick one day and I can move on. \*\*UPDATE\*\*: Now I just gave up trying completely, like I don't have a crush, nor do I find any girls interesting in that regard, and the ones I find attractive I don't approach for reasons above or make excuses with myself that she's ""not my type"" and shit.

But like, I feel like I have no real goals or future. I'm going to college because people keep telling me that I need to go to get a good job and get money. I take hard classes and join internships because they will look good on college apps. And this also has led to me being an anxious mess a lot. It's a vicious cycle of not seeing any purpose or path in life, so that leads to no motivation, no motivation leads to bad grades, bad grades leads to anxiety, and anxiety leads to being more clueless in what to do with my life and so on. And even though I have like friends and stuff, I feel like I'm the one that reaches out to talk and stuff, like they only talk to me when they either think I'm depressed or if they want to know if an assignment is due the next day. The only time I feel nice and good, is when I am helping people online with their issues, because if I can't help myself at least I can help someone else.

Like, honestly sometimes I feel like I would be really content just dying, like if I somehow died, I'd be really okay with that. I'm pretty sure if it wasnt for my friends and family, I would have ended it all like a thousand times over by now.

I might be depressed, who knows. But rn, I have this stress on me with classes, and ACT, and internships and honestly, I just want to go. Sometimes it feels like even friends don't really care and the love from family is conditionally based on how I do in school. I can't help not feel sad.  


So my question is, what can I do to make myself not feel like shit all the time?  Thanks"

Likewise, if you did get into watelroo for cs or eng, it does not mean you will get an internship in cali. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to get a cali internship, you first need to turely build a passion and understanding for CS/Software/Hardware engineering. Figure out which one of these topics you truely love, then start teaching yourself as much as you can. Try to really get good at something that you are truely passionate about. Universities can give you resources, but they can't teach you passion. Resources without passion is meaningless. 

I met some one in cali, who architected an entire Operating System and was incharge of Nvidia's hypervisor for their autunomous car team, and he went to an unkown community college. I also met someone who worked as a security engineer who went to a less well known university in the states.  

I also know some one from waterloo, who graduated from engineering and is now working in the middle of no where in ottawa, and several ECE students who never made it to cali by fourth year.

I'm a recent grad starting my first job later this year as a software engineer at a mid-sized startup. I accepted my offer last fall, and in the coming week I'm to have a phone call with my recruiter, an engineering manager, and someone from HR regarding my team placement. 

I'm under the impression that there are a couple possible teams I may end up on, and that they will weigh my opinion/preferences when placing me. I switched my career path to software development pretty late, so I've never had any CS internship experience and don't know exactly what to look out for or consider in terms of picking a team. The only thing I am pretty sure of is I want to work on software that is outward-facing, not software that will only be used by other members of the company (does that make sense?) 

So, I have a couple questions for you all!

* What are some good questions for me to ask about the teams on this phone call? 
* What kinds of questions can I expect them to ask me during this call? I have a bit of imposter syndrome and feel like I don't know all the CS jargon because of my lack of experience... I'm just a little worried this call will turn into an interview and I'll sound like an idiot.

But at the same time, the offer from that company that would require relocation is beyond anything that I expected. Anyways, here are the offers:

&amp;#x200B;

**Offer 1:** Business Analytics Intern

* Pay: $24/hr with multiple stipends and a ton of employee benefits
* Relocation required, but everything is covered by the company (including housing)
* Very large company with a fair amount of weight to their name (not big 4, but fairly close)
* Great corporate culture (haven't met anyone besides for the manager of the team yet though)
* Huge intern class with ""a lot of events planned"" for the summer
* I'd be doing quite a bit of data mining and consumer behavior analysis and learning how to make business decisions based on those findings (seems like the work will be a lot more impactful and I'll learn a lot more here)

&amp;#x200B;

**Offer 2**: Data Science &amp; Analytics Intern

* Pay: $16/hr
* Would be living at home (which I prefer due to health reasons)
* Very small company (the company itself doesn't carry much weight, but isn't exactly a startup either)
* Meh corporate culture (seems very boring and serious when I went in to interview, but the team I'd be working with seemed fairly relaxed and nice)
* I'd be one of like 10 interns, and no intern events
* Even though the title has data science it, the manager seemed to be only expecting me to do fairly low level and easy stuff (nothing much more than learning the SQL queries that have already been written and automate systems with some light data mining when necessary)

I have never picutured myself doing web development but I figured that it would be useful to learn. Either I can use the skills to freelance, land an internship, or possibly build a site that produces some income while I'm in school. So far I am enjoying the tutorial I'm taking. However all my project ideas seem like they would be better suited for mobile applications. I know the basics of Java already so I'm tempted to hammer down on Android Development instead. Especially because I'm starting to confuse the syntax between Java and JavaScript. 

So my question is this: If the sites I want to build would most likely be landing pages for businesses/mobile apps and not much else, should I bother with learning so much web development? Or should I try something like WordPress for websites and focus on Java for mobile apps? Or should I try learn Java/Android and JavaScript/CSS/HTML at the same time?

Just to be clear, this is not a question of which I enjoy more. It's more that I only have so much time to work with and I want to maximize my productivity. I would love to learn both if it's feasible/worth it."

I’m about halfway through a post-baccalaureate computer science program and am seeking some advice on making the transition between fields (26 y/o).

My first degree is in Industrial Safety. I previously worked as an industrial hygiene consultant for 3 years (measuring occupational exposure to hazardous vapors/fumes/particulate matter with direct reading instruments and software), and currently serve as the safety manager for a hospital. 

I’ve always been pretty tech savvy but just didn’t make the right choice of major previously. I’ve been working on a mass communication desktop app for the hospital I work at for emergency management/communication. It’s based on Twilio and written in C#/.NET. Partly because it’s something we really need and also because I thought it would just be fun to make. I really enjoy creating things, solving problems, and debugging.

The program I’m in has been very Java heavy and has included a little C#, as well as SQLite and SQL Server. I’ve taken DS&amp;A, along with the rest of the fundamental courses and feel proficient with the concepts, especially OOP. 

I’ve started applying to junior level dev jobs all over the place. Is it too early to do so? I feel a bit discouraged sometimes by some of the job postings that may want you to know a different DBMS or some framework that I’ve yet to be exposed to. I am unsure what technologies we will be exposed to in the remainder of the program.

I’m looking to get started in a developer position as quickly as possible and I’m very eager to learn and willing to go the distance to make it happen. I feel like it will be much easier to pick up some of the hot topics once I actually find a developer role. It’s difficult to spend around 50+ hours at my current job and every bit of 30+ additional hours going to school full time. I do have an interview Monday for a software analyst 1 position and am just seeking some general advice from any of you who have made a similar transition. I’m pretty worried that the lack of other projects, internships, and prior experience is going to seriously hurt my chances in changing fields."

So this isn't as serious as some other posts here but it's something really important to me.  


I turned 21 6 months ago. I always had this idea of 21 being the age of making friends and learning how to be a social adult, but instead it's just a lot of the same.  


  


A bit of context for my life situation. I've been with my now girlfriend for almost 5 years. I love her very very much, but I think the one thing that kind of bitters the punch for me sometimes is thinking of what life would be like if I had a bit more freedom.   


I spent most of last year on an internship on the other side of the country from my girlfriend. While there  I made a TON of friends and would go out all the time. I thought the experience changed me and I'd come back home and be able to do the same. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as I came back home and it was like my life away from here never even happened.  


So basically I'm looking to get back into that.   


My girlfriend has some nice friends and they hang out from time to time but I just want to find people I can party with and include my relationship in. People who I can go to bars and get drunk with.   


I just have a really hard time making friends. People generally like me, and I make good work friends, but I mean I'm here on reddit asking for social advice. Dorky white dude doesn't exactly fit in with that crowd all the time.  


How do you guys suggest I get into that kind of thing? I'm thinking of going to a local concert tomorrow night and trying to meet people. I just don't know how to approach people I guess.  


What do you talk to a stranger about? How do you introduce yourself? How do you approach someone at the bar for a conversation? I know drinking will help for sure.   


Let me know any suggestions!"

The world is pale today.  Murky.  The trees float jerkily past my car as it delivered me to the station.  I don't think I had managed to sleep for more than thirty minutes that night, before the damnable ringing sound would wake me. I would sit there quivering for an hour before attempting to lie back down. Each time my mind began to fold itself away into restful darkness, I would hear it ring again. Sharp and clear.  As if it were right next to my bedside.  The shrill noise seemed to come from all angles.  Like that red beast was ringing from inside of me, demanding to be heeded in order to complete it's sinister work.

Realizing that I could not stand to be woken like this one more time I gave up on sleep at around 3:30am. I arrived early today after hours of thinking, bathing, thinking, cooking breakfast, planning and re-examining my options.

In the end I was most comforted by a question that a very perceptive and thoughtful person had posted online. They asked what would have happened if I had answered ""none"" to the question.  The caller had asked ""How many fingers"", and so if I had answered ""none"" then Officer Jerring would likely still have his two missing digits. The idea gripped me.  I just needed to be quick. Thoughtful and clever, but quick.  By the time I was getting into the car, I had convinced myself that I could avoid any further tragedy if I simply played it smart.

Though I was exhausted when I sat at my desk, I busied myself immediately. brewing coffee, cleaning up, organizing mail.  Anything I could do to keep my eyes off of that crimson form tucked into the shadows of the desk.  The instinctive part of my mind told me that looking at it directly was to invite it in. I tried to ignore it's existence. The idea of it, the knowledge of it's impending alert, grew in my mind just as fiercely as my eyes darted past it's recessed home.

Then it rang.

Jumping from the chair I steadied both of my hands on the desk before me.  I shot a look left, then right.  No one else had arrived quite yet and the only officer on duty was out doing his rounds past the local banks.  There was only me and the phone. Ringing again, so soon.  My mind rebelled.  There was no way that this could happen every day. It just wasn't possible. I would have noticed it when I was an intern last year. I knew that I had to answer it. It was my duty now. I had taken this burden from O'Connor and could not ever risk putting it back on that sweet man's shoulders again.

The receiver felt frigid against my ear. The chill sent numbing waves through my head, enhancing the deep ache behind my tired eyes.The same small voice spoke over the din of groaning and snapping sounds on the line.

""Brains or Brawn?"" The note of that little girl's voice was playful but serious. Alongside her impish glee was the clear expectation of an answer.

I fought the exhaustion.  Think. Think! Fucking think! I shrieked at myself.  It only took a moment for the adrenaline to overtake my system and get my mind racing towards the answer.  And just like that I had it. It was so simple in retrospect, just as that person had pointed out online.

""Neither""

My ear began to scream out in pain as I realized how hard I was pressing the phone to my head, my fingers gripping it as if it were a life preserver, waiting for the silence to end.  For my answer to be accepted. And it did. The call disconnected, and the question was answered.

I fought to feel relieved.  My plan had worked right?  Nothing, I had chosen nothing.  And whatever rules of this game, they must be firm.  There was no point in playing a rigged game. Right?

Relief never fully arrived, but the hours did pass.  Employees came in and out. Donuts and coffee were incrementally depleted. The sun made its journey from one window to another. Each hour that passed without tragedy built upon the previous, until some baseline of cautious optimism began to settle inside me as the sun set in the west.

My mind had circled back and forth all day.  It had worked, I told myself.  But there was another voice in the conversation too.  It's the voice that asked ""How do you know?"".  ""Would you know if you just killed a complete stranger?"" I told myself that I would have picked it up on the scanner.  That an ambulance would certainly have been called by this late hour.  The voice asked how I knew it would only affect someone in Stoddard County?  How would I know if someone silently died, or was injured alone at home? Or in another county or even another country.

There were too many questions.  I didn't understand the rules and that was a problem.  It appeared that I was safe.  I let myself believe it.  But I also decided that I needed to silence that other voice at the first opportunity.  Tomorrow morning I would bring Starbucks and ask O'Connor to sit with me over breakfast.  I would get as much information as I could in one shot and never being it up again. One rip of the bandaid. I couldn't bear to ask any more of O'Connor than that. I couldn't bear to see that sadness in his eyes again.

It's a miracle that I got home without killing myself last night.  I must have nodded off at the wheel five or six times  and on one occasion jerked the wheel sharply to avoid a hospital gurney loitering in the middle of the road.  Luckily I arrived home before another hallucination sent me careening into a ditch.

With the application of a hot bath and self talk that I had the power to manage this situation and that I would confirm it with O'Connor first thing tomorrow,  I fell into a deep sleep.  I won't say that I slept soundly through the night, but I did sleep deeply enough to feel moderately rested this morning.

I sat my Starbucks feast of coffee and cake pops on the conference room table and pulled up a chair, trying not to feel like I was a trapper waiting for my prey.  An hour passed. Everyone had arrived. Except O'Connor.  My leg became restless and I picked at the side of my fingers, glancing at the clock every few minutes now. I could feel the coffee tearing away at my stomach lining as the hour got later.

The captain jerked from his computer as I blasted into his office. He quickly settled into a more business like posture.

""Victoria, what can I do for you, dear?"" Behind his kindness, I could see a touch of fear.  There were questions he did not want from me.  He was ready for business as usual, and nothing more.

""O'Connor did not come in this morning.  Did he call?"" I tried to keep my voice as calm as possible. Just one officer inquiring after another.

""He did."" The captain smiled now, relief showing in the corners of his mouth. ""The man has not taken a vacation or sick day in over a decade.  He called this morning and told me he wanted to spend the day with Suzie.  Can't begrudge a man for that. Especially after how hard he's worked over the years. He deserves as break, don't you think?""

I nodded in agreement.  ""Of course"".

""Well then, one other thing.  Just wanted to let you know that Jerring is scheduled for his final surgery this afternoon around 1pm.  If you'd like to visit him you're free to take a few hours. In fact Calvert has already agreed to cover the radio for you.  But listen.. If you don't want to go, I would understand.  We would all understand.""

That hung in the air for a moment, before I replied that I very much wanted to pay him a visit and bring him a little something.  It was my fault.  I had done this to the man. I had caused his injury, whether I liked to admit involvement or not.  And I was surely not going to duck out of looking him in the eyes and sharing some sympathy.  It was literally the least I could do.

So I arrived at the hospital to sit with him for a time before he went in.  We didn't talk much, but exchanged some pleasantries, a small gift I had bought for him on the way, and I stayed until they wheeled him away to the operating room.

I was headed back to the car when the shape of a man caught my eye at the other end of the hallway.  There's no mistaking that haircut.  That square shave at the back of the neck, and cropped top that just announced to the world that the police have arrived.  I turned and headed towards him to peek my head into the room he had just entered. I dropped my keys in a cacophonous clatter at the scene before me.

It was O'Conner. Some part of me knew it in the hallway, the moment I saw him from behind. He was bent over a hospital bed. Bent over Suzie, his wife of twenty five years, who lay silent before him, eyes open.

He turned at the noise I had made and his agitated eyes began to stream with tears as he recognized me.  I rushed to hold him before he collapsed onto the floor, holding his back and stroking his hair.

""I..."" there was nothing I could say.

Minutes passed before he wiped his face and spoke, still staring at the floor.  ""It's a stroke.  On her… on her spinal cord.  They say she's paralyzed.  Permanently.  And they think it affected her mind too. Her… It…. Their saying she's brain dead."" His head fell back into his hands as his sobbing shook both of our bodies.

Paralyzed. Brain dead. Those words echoed through my mind.  Brain dead. Brains.  Paralyzed. Brawn.  Brain dead and paralyzed.  Neither brains nor Brawn.  Neither.

Something happened inside me as I sat with them.  The sadness. The guilt.  It twisted and turned inside me, gaining momentum. Like that first gush of wind quickly becoming a storm. By the time we decided to part ways and I was back in my car, I was no longer sad.  I was livid, raging, and determined.  I would not let this madness continue.  I didn't fear making it worse anymore.  There was nothing worse. Nothing worse than answering that call and destroying another life. Many other lives.

I'm ready now. Ready to fight.  My next move is in motion and I will end this. I can promise you that.

And I've got a lead. I have a cousin who works for the phone company, who was very helpful in cutting through the red tape.  I have an originating address for the calls. And I'm headed there now.

I  am a Finance intern at a Fortune 700 company that does a lot of financial reporting.

My boss thinks it would be a good project for me to tackle this summer. I know how to code R, but I am just starting to learn Python (from a summer class). I’m not entirely sure what the capabilities of Python are. Is it possible to create a script that does the following:

\~Read Microsoft Outlook for a specific folder, then read for a specific email within the folder for an excel file.

\~Open the Excel file within the email and look for a specific cell. Copy the contents of the cell.

\~Paste the contents into a cell in a different excel file. 

What may be the kicker is that every week the script will have to look for the newest week (For example, there might be emails for ‘Orders Report Week 10’ , ‘Orders Report Week 11’, and ‘Orders Report Week 12’, and I would like it to look into ‘Orders Report Week 12’. 

In this example, all of the Sales Reports would follow the same excel format from week to week, what would change is that the newest Sales Report would include updated numbers in a new, adjacent cell for the newest week. \*Is it conceptually possible to code this?\*

I have to keep track of about 15 of these reports every week, and it would save a lot of time in the long run if I just developed the script to do It for me.  If I need to clarify what I am trying to do more, or if you have any other questions, then ask away!  Any response is a big help."

(Maladaptive daydreaming, obsessive behaviour, dropping hobbies too constantly, the low self esteem and anxiety, not able to listen/focus)

It never affected me in my first two years of study. Most courses were just open the textbook do as many problems and get a brief understanding of the theorems. But then when I had courses like electricity and electronics. I had really no idea what was going on even after reading the textbook and listening to the prof did not help. Energy drinks did not stimulate me and I could not focus with them. I’m on meds right now (was originally prescribed with 25mg with foquest but they made me angry and I was REALLY angry at the idea that I was blamed a lot in childhood for being lazy instead of my parents realizing I had ADHD, gave me low self esteem and anxiety which I was also berated for, ended up shattering my spare laptop and phone, doctor immediately took me off after telling her) currently on vyvanse of 10mg and lectures feel different because I know listen and comprehend everything the professor is saying but they make me feel so fucking tired and fatigued that once I get home I have no energy to do homework and just lay in bed and close my eyes.

I have 0 distractions in my room. Only my laptop which is running archlinux, a desk, pencils, textbooks and a cumbucket (the vyvanse has skyrocketed my sexual libido..)

I was not able to find an internship because I’m trying to sort these things out and I’m really behind with my course sequence.

I understand it will take me a extra year or two, maybe even three? to graduate but if that means I will graduate with good academic standing and have learned stuff then I’m glad.

I’m thinking of taking just 4 courses each semester and I’m only taking 1 course right now in the summer (electricity) and trying to work on some personal work since it’s less stressful than taking a ton of courses and want to get adjusted to meds.

Anyone else with ADHD can give me some tips or pointers? I’m studying computer engineering with a minor in data science."

I was thinking of a chess game that interacts with an SQL server for the game information so two can play from different devices.

Things I would need to specifically learn are:

* Making a multi-platform .NET application (C#)
* Interacting with an SQL server from a .NET application on multiple platforms
* Simple graphics for a .NET application, gonna find a framework because I don't expect to be doing platform work in the internship (I think UPS uses something called Xamarin, so I'll try using that)

I have a AA in Business Management. I don't possess any certifications. I have about 6-7 years of professional IT experience and the rest is Audio Engineering or menial labor jobs. Some of this experience includes two internships, one for Amazon.com AWS data centers and the other was for The CATO Institute (a prominent think tank in DC). My experience and skill level is Server+ and Network+ equivalent.

I have had a very difficult time trying to get my life started. While many friends are married, having kids and getting houses I have been unemployed for four months after being laid off (budget reasons) from a MSP and I'm still living with my mother. I hardly get any calls for interviews. I even tried to apply for menial labor work like Walmart and get no responses. 

I really don't know what to do other than get certifications or go back to school. Which both are very expensive and no guarantee. I used to pride myself on the fact I know technology like the back of my hand and that what I don't know I can learn on my own and I didn't need to pay for some over priced piece of paper to tell me otherwise. But I don't get what employers want anymore. It's obviously not experience because otherwise I would be getting calls. I feel like a lot of people hiring for IT have no idea what they're looking for. I don't know though since I get hardly any feedback from interviewers.

I feel so dejected and let down. I wanted to get into IT because it was a way for me to have a career that could afford a family and a house without having to acquire huge amounts of debt. This is looking more and more like an impossibility. The other part of this is I am trying my best to deal with Complex PTSD. My dad was extremely abusive throughout my life and I have complications from that and dealing with others. I don't let that be an excuse for bad work ethic and I don't burden others with it. I feel though I am an enigma or just unusual enough that I inadvertently cause tension with others when I don't mean to. This I feel has hampered my networking abilities and how many contacts I should have.

I really don't know anymore. This has toiled with my mental health. I can't afford therapy and I feel like I'm fighting a uphill battle on my own and everything I have done to improve myself makes me feel like I'm not better than where I started. I have spent most of my 20s living with my mom and that is where I still am. She is wanting to retire soon to so this is not going to be a tenable situation for much longer. I didn't have a mentor and I had to figure a lot of this out my own. Can't add that to experiences or skills though. 

Anyways I don't know if you guys have suggestions. I feel like certifications wouldn't hurt and I'm confident in my ability to pass them. Also its a hell of a lot cheaper than college. I'm brushing up/reviewing on my Server+ and Networking+ and studying for Security+. I feel like it won't make much of a difference because I have experience and some of the jobs and internships I had are considered on the top end in their respective industries.

Any pointers or tips will help. I'll answer any questions I can.

Honestly for the tech information and jargon that's in my current resume, I imagine that hiring managers at these jobs might be confused as to what they mean."

Here’s a quick overview of my work history: 

I have my BS in Business with an emphasis in Marketing and a Communication minor. I’ve been out of school for two years now, and I’ve had three internships with varying tasks under marketing. I’ve had three different marketing positions and my current title is Content Marketing Specialist. I have a lot of experience with social media, website creation, content and copy writing, graphic design, and a whole bunch of other marketing tasks through work and consulting courses. 

Here is the backstory of me applying: 

I applied and interviewed for a Product Development Intern back in October of 2018. I was the top candidate although HR wasn’t involved. Nothing ever came of that because the position wasn’t technically available. I’m sure if it was though I would of been offered the position. 

I applied and interviewed for a Marketing Internship January of this year, HR was involved and I actually got the connect to interview with the Marketing Manager though my hair stylists. I was offered a temporary internship that had a sent end date. 

Here’s the problem, my current job pays me well with great benefits. It’s not for me though. I’m not happy because it’s not at all the industry I want to be in. It’s a great job, just for someone else. 

I tentatively accepted the internship offer with hopes that I could work part time at both jobs. (Just Incase I wasn’t actually offered a full time position at the end of the internship.) Long story short it took my current employer two weeks to ok me working part time for a few months. (I know it was possible with my current work load. I am bored most days, hell I’m at work now and had time to do this.) I was in contact with the HR manager at the company that offered me the internship but they couldn’t wait any longer and filled the position internally. 
This was my mistake, and I should of chased my dreams then! 

A few weeks later I was contacted by the HR Manager at the company. She said that their Marketing Manager sent my resume over to the Customer Service department where they were looking to hire an Influencer Relations Specialist and they asked me to interview. I interviewed, and after weeks of following up I didn’t get the job. 

I’ve never been so passionate and determined about anything career wise like this before. So I went to a local hiring agency that works with this company. It’s been almost a month now and nothing has really come of it. The lady keeps ignoring my emails, and when I stop by she just keeps saying “we will update you tomorrow”. 

There are a few marketing positions that recently opened up at the company, but I am hesitant to apply since I’m working with the hiring agency. 

I don’t think I’m over or under qualified for the positions I’ve applied to and interviewed for within this company, I think I might have applied and interviewed too much. (Is that even a thing?) The HR Manager knows me by now, and I just feel like I’ve being over the top persistent and in my mind annoying about trying to get a job there. 

In your experience do you think I’m being too eager? Have I lost my chance at landing a job there? Should I apply even though I’m working with an agency? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated."

I used to go to a place in my hometown that would do this for me, but I can't go home for the summer because of my internship.  Also, I \*could\* ask for the same haircut that I got from them last time, but I want to see if maybe a different hairstylist will have a better suggestion that I never thought of before.

bpx7ah,10,2019-05-17,Computer Science Living Learning Community,RutgersCSLLC,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/bpx7ah/computer_science_living_learning_community/,"Hi! Many of us from the Computer Science Living Learning Community (abbreviated as CS LLC) are excited for the incoming computer science freshmen and made a reddit account to answer any questions people may have. If you have any questions, feel free to comment on this post or message this account and we'll answer!

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some answers to questions incoming freshmen have asked us before.

**What is the Computer Science Living Learning Community?**

The CS LLC is a part of the Douglass Residential College and an opportunity available to first-year undergraduate women at Rutgers New Brunswick interested in Computer Science to live together in the same building.  It provides Computer Science educational, career, and social resources to individuals in the program!

&amp;#x200B;

**Do I have to live in an all girls dorm on Douglass?**

The CS LLC is on Busch Campus in Allen Hall and only your floor is all female, the rest of the dorm is co-ed. Many computer science majors and classes are on Busch campus so you will be surrounded by individuals with the same interests.

&amp;#x200B;

**What are some benefits of the Computer Science Living Learning Community?**

* Touring company offices (e.g. we got to visit the *Facebook* NY office and share our resume with recruiters)
* Research: the Douglass Residential College has a program called Project SUPER where you are paired with a professor to do research with. The professor I was assigned to was actually doing his research alongside *Samsung*, so I got to work with Samsung and learn so much about how computer science was used in the real world!
   * My research helped me score interviews with a lot of companies (a lot of them were really interested in it) and I got two software development internship offers from *Microsoft* and *Amazon* despite only being a freshman!
* Peer Academic Leader (PAL): an individual who lives in the same dorm as you and who's an immediate resource to everyone in the LLC
* Big-Little Program: an upperclassman (Big) who is assigned to just you and you can ask them for help about anything
* Externships: the Douglass Residential College has an externship program where you can experience what it's like to work for companies (one of the companies participating in the externship program was *Google*!)
* Friends: everyone in the LLC spends time together and it's an easy way to make a lot of friends at the start of college. Moreover, you have individuals to study with for your classes
* Networking Events: as a member of the LLC you can attend networking dinners and speak to recruiters from companies such as *Verizon*, *Lockheed Martin,* and *PSEG*
* Professors: Professor Centeno is the faculty co-advisor as well as teaches a private class to only the girls in the CS LLC about how computer science is used in the real world, the CS LLC is a great way to become close to a professor
   * Professor Centeno is also the course coordinator for Introduction to Computer Science, so having the opportunity to become close to her personally is a good one! She also has private review sessions for Introduction to Computer Science and Data Structures for individuals in the CS LLC

There are many more benefits of the CS LLC, but these are the main ones. Members of the CS LLC will be monitoring this reddit account so feel free to reach out!"

Background: I do not want a job in IB. I'm specifically looking for a job at a Hedge Fund after graduation. I just finished my Sophomore year of College at a target school, with a Major in Economics and a Minor in Finance. I thought everything was going dandy but a couple of bad things just cropped up.

Freshman Year: I was Pre-Med during my Freshman year; it wasn't my choice at all, my parents kind of forced me into it and since I didn't have anything I was interested in I did not find an alternative. I was very depressed for my first year of College, and hated everything I was studying (the Pre-Med program at my school meant that I did not actually take only Core classes in the first year, but specifically Pre-Med Classes. Those took long hours, including lab hours and I could not motivate myself for them). Obviously not an excuse, but my lack of motivation or care meant I ended up with something around a 2.7 GPA at the end of my Freshman Year.
Sophomore One: One class that I had taken just for fun in Freshman Year and stuck with, though, was Statistics. And as I learned much more about it and its practical applications, the more interested in Economics and Finance I became. I ended up finally convincing my parents to allow me to switch disciplines. I hit the ground running; I took a summer course in Microeconomics that had to cram 5 months worth of material into about 1 1/2 months, and still ended up with an A in the course because I loved what I was studying. I went into the first Semester of my Sophomore year and continued to do well, ending up with a semester GPA of about a 3.6, even getting an A- in a specific Financial Accounting class that most of my classmates termed a ""grade-killer"". I ended up getting on the Dean's List that Semester, and had boosted my Cumulative GPA up to a 3.1. I figured that this wasn't particularly high, but my Major GPA was high and I'd simply continue to further boost my GPA again my Sophomore Second Semester. At the end of the Semester, I even landed a summer internship at a hedge fund that I am starting in a couple of weeks from now.

Sophomore Two: Long story short, this semester I did not do as well. I did well on most of my other classes; if not for this one specific class, I would have ended up on the Dean's List again. This was a particularly nasty Econ class; it was not personally classified as high level but most of the people in the class were Seniors, and halfway through the course (!) our teacher informed us that we had to have taken a high-level Macro class to understand this class (which I had not taken, and am taking next Semester). For one of our projects, we were literally asked to base our work off of the foundation of that other high-level Macro class. I ended up with a C- in this class, ending with a Semester GPA of 3.00 and dropping my cumulative GPA back down again to a 3.03.
Problem: This is a large hiccup in my grades that I'm sure looks terrible on a transcript. I'm sure hiring teams and employers can look past a bad freshman year if everything else afterwards is pitch perfect, but this far from that. This is a sudden regressive dip again and I'm not sure that it fully represents the work I put in or the difficulty of being forced to learn a class while simultaneously learn the high-level class I needed for this class on my own time. Worst of all, I'd already dropped my Resume, including the fancy Major GPA that I'd been so proud of, to a large amount of companies I was applying for a 2020 Internship at, which I am now almost 100% sure I will not get because of this, as I do need to do an updated Resume drop now that my Final Grades have come out today.
I have absolutely no idea what to do. Is there any hope left for me / anything potentially open for me for 2020 Summer?

;tldr, bad Freshman Year. Amazing Sophomore Semester 1. Sophomore Semester 2 would have been good too except for one class that made it mediocre. Do I have any time left to fix this?"

Brief Intro: 4.0/4.0 GPA so far, plan is to get a Master’s from a T20 school and scram.

What exactly is research experience? 

Is research done at current University or outside?

Do internships count as research experience? 

What does it mean to get publications?

Do I have to get publications for my research to be considered research?

How does one get publications for his/her research?

So research is not only for PhD student?

Can I/ Should I do research as an undergrad?

Do I have to write in algorithm that takes a picture of a black hole and write a 200+ page paper on it?

Sincerely,

Lost and Confused

Thank you."

I have had a couple of terrible experiences as an intern at (different) big tech companies. So now that I'm about to manage an intern myself, it is eye opening to be on the other side and realize just how much responsibility rests on the intern mentor/manager to set the intern up for success.

When I was interning, I knew the my project and mentorship quality weren't ideal but I sucked it up and gave my all to get an offer. I did get the job but I never wanna feel as stressed and anxious again and I hope that no intern has to feel that way. 

They have some guidelines for intern managers here so the rest of this is based on that and my own experiences as an intern. Not all of it might apply to you (specially if you're at a place that doesn't have a structured intern program).

So here goes:

* Making a normal undergrad intern work on an ambiguous, research-y, and exploratory project is not a good way to evaluate them. This will of course be different for specialized roles. But for most undergrad interns, it is vital that the project is appropriately scoped and proper goals are set. If you feel like you're shooting arrows in the dark and have no idea what the endgame of your project is, speak up!

* Intern managers should provide clear, actionable, and frequent feedback to their interns. If your manager says you're doing 'fine' and 'good' in all your interactions and nothing more specific, speak up! It's better to know what you can improve upon early in your internship rather than at the end. Some intern managers are inexperienced or afraid of providing constructive criticism till it's too late.

* You are okay being somewhat of a dummy at the start. You should be provided more than enough guidance to get started with your first few tasks. If you feel like you've been thrown in the deep end right at the start, please ask for help. Sure, if you need to be handheld 6 weeks in, then its an issue. But if you get judged for not figuring out your dev setup or how to grep the codebase right at the beginning by yourself then it's not fair.

* Your team should make you feel welcome. They should at least have lunch together sometimes and people should make an effort to include you in conversations and team activities. Of course, this won't always happen. Take the initiative and ask people if they want to have lunch or get coffee!

Good luck to all of you!"

Is it necessary to do some kind of course in UX / Interaction design in order to get a job? Or could I be qualified enough after taking an online course (eg. Udemy) and designing a few things to make up a portfolio? Or do I need to learn as an intern and then move up?

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!"

I am kinda typing this out of a whim, I always have seen posts on Reddit that get a lot of good feedback for people that are trying to find the next phase in their life or deal with depression.

 Life for me was a bit hard for me growing up because I had autism, and was bullied to the point of no return, almost to suicide in high school. I went to a local community college and started to pave a new life for me. I lost 40 pounds in 6 months, started being more sociable, and Last year I graduated from a pretty good college in IT with a concentration in Cyber Security. 

At my university I was always driven and motivated compared to most people. I was on the front page twice of my university for my successes, and helped re-design the whole Cyber Security program there. I worked part time 25 hours a week and also founded a Cyber Security Club that is still active there today. I ended with Cum Laude with a very good list of companies to work for with the successes that I had ranging from 65-80k a year starting.

I always hated my hometown and area I grew up at. The college I went to was about 3 hours away from home, and I definitely wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for me making the decision to go. Now I work at a Fortune 100 company not too far from the university I was at. Its in between my hometown and the place I grew up at. 

Right now as you guessed, I am doing Cyber Security, and really am enjoying my job. My boss loves me, and I am doing very well as they tell me. My time finds myself going back to my alma matter often, and I find myself not having a good time like I used to. I view myself a bit more mature than everyone there, and others look at me and kinda wonder why I go back often. This is primarily because the town I am in is very family-oriented and small. It is not built well for a single guy such as myself. 

I am having issues it seems with talking to people from the Midwest culture, and I don't like the weather here. Its very cloudy all the time, with temperatures usually being below 32 degrees for six months of the year. I feel everyone wants to just sit in their houses all day, and not follow through with plans often. People that are even successful back out of plans often. Everyone seems to only care about themselves more than other people. I often tell people I meet online that a good portion of people here drive by your car if you get into an accident, or don't say thanks when you hold the door open for them.

Myself? I like to treat people with respect and dignity. I find myself often relating and helping people out with my experiences I had with my Autism. I pay for people's meals at lunch often if I have a good conversation with them, and attempt to do my hardest to put myself out for other individuals. At work I am a mentor for 15 interns and also am involved in the inclusion committee for employees with Autism. At my university I was a mentor for multiple incoming freshman. I just like to help people. 

Reddit - as you can probably see, the culture and personality of people don't mingle well with the way I view things. And I honestly am really, really tired of it. I really want to jump the gun and try getting out of the Midwest to a much more hospitable area. I tell some of my friends this and they often tell me I have absolutely no reason to ""bitch"", as I am at what is viewed as the best company in the state, and have the job making more than most people at my age. I have nothing holding me back, and have the world going for me. They often tell me to grow up and have no reason to be depressed. I agree with them in some retrospects. However, I believe that I really worked my ass off to get where I am today, and my work ethic compared to others is I feel a lot better. 

I have tried getting involved with multiple activities sports, and friend groups, which often find me not continuing due to something that rubs me the wrong way (going back to the midwest culture). I have tried so many different things to just get out of this funk of depression that I am in. 

The thing I am most interested in is moving down to Texas or Arizona, as every time I visit my family in these states I am just absolutely in love with the culture and people that reside there. I visited Austin last year and absolutely loved it. There is always something going on there, the weather is absolutely beautiful, and everyone is just so friendly. I was so surprised when people stopped for me when my car stalled I was renting, how many people say thank you when you hold the door open, and just how social everyone is. I see why EVERYONE is moving there. On top of this, it is a tech hub, so my experience will add up here well. There's much more opportunity there than in the Midwest. 

The problem? The company I am at almost guarantees you being set for life. It has IT budgets that will open up new positions and room for ranking for the next 10 years, and it definitely looks really good on my resume. I doubt I will be able to make more in Austin from where I am now. My parents are also aging. My dad turns 65 next year, and everyone on his side of the family usually passes away before they are 70. 

What should I do? I am depressed as heck staying in the community I am at, but my job is very good and definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity. How Is there anyway (besides finding a girlfriend) that I can get out of this depressed funk?"

I came into university at 17 years old thinking I knew what I wanted and that I was going to start a business, make friends, make a name for myself etc You know, the typical driven guy bs. By Junior year (3rd year) I was struggling in my program (Aerospace Engineering), struggling to make friends (I have like two I can trust and that number is being generous), struggling with romantic relationships, diagnosed with ADHD, depression and general anxiety disorder. In my head, I have failed at basically everything possible and it has gotten tough to wake up in the morning happy to see through the day. I can explain how I feel to the few people in my life because i'm afraid they'd think I want self-pity but I don't want pity all I want is to stop feeling like a fraudulent imposter who doesn't deserve life.

The only thing going for me is that I have a research internship lined up for the summer but when I get into the lab, I see that I'm surrounded by hyper-intelligent individuals who are far better than me and so it further fuels the voice in my head that tells me I'm a fucking fraud. I thought I'd go to grad school, but Its not looking likely now, which hurts.

On making friends, I'm a weirdo or so I've been told. I believe it stems from growing up alone despite being in a home of two happily married parents and 5 other older siblings. The youngest of my siblings is 29 years old, which is 8 years older than I am, given such difference in age, I never felt connected to any of them. I learned to interact with the world through video games and reading sci-fi books which gave me an interest in computers, aerospace etc. I've learned to think on my own and I not really learned social conventions. It is really fucking hard to explain to people or let people know I'm not so freakish just slightly different in the way I view the world.

I'm so sacred I'd never have a family, become an aerospace engineer, marry, be accepted, find friends and generally be less of a freakish imposter who doesn't deserve life. Sometimes I wish I were never born.

These are only my current test scores. I'm retaking the ACT in June and I'm hoping to improve significantly in reading and science.

Subject Tests: Planning on Math IIC, Physics, Chem. I got an 800 in an official Math2 test; I'm taking the real test in June. Due to taking all AP Physics next year, I'm anticipating an 800 in that. I'll probably only send chem if I get a 770+ on it.

Intended Major:  Undecided, but if I had to pick it'd be one of these: Engineering (not sure which type), Biology (or something within biology), Neuroscience, Physics.

Note: My school is implementing a BS rule where I can only be on the exec board or a student leader in one organisation at a time, so that's why I can't be on both Mu Alpha Theta and Science Club exec board next year. I will choose Mu Alpha Theta over Science Club if I get into both.

JHU: Usually 1, sometimes 2 per year out of however many applicants (last 3 years had 7, 3, and 8 applicants w/ 1,1, and 2 acceptances respectively)

Stanford: 1 out of like 50+

Dartmouth: No acceptances out 25-30 applicants

UCBerkeley 5 or so acceptances from 25-40 applicants (per year)

CMU: From the least 3 years there were 3 acceptances out of 19 applicants w/ a 0% yield rate

Harvey Mudd: 2 applicants in 2015, 1 reject 1 waitlist (idk if he/she got off or not)

Olin: 2 applicants in 2016, both rejected

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I won't be applying to all of these schools as my school only permits us to apply to 10 schools, so I'm doing this chanceme so I can get a better idea of my chances at the aforementioned schools to decide which ones to apply to."

Essentially, after shuffling some papers around for uni I‘m studying (mech eng) part time this semester, full time next semester and then I’ll graduate May next year. I scored a reasonably well paying and engaging summer internship in December internship at a reasonably large company in paper manufacturing. I was very much thrown in the deep end, because of both planned and unplanned changes to the engineering department and the company overall. Due to my part time studies, my supervisor and his supervisor both told me they were more than willing to work around my uni schedule, and I was able to just tell them the hours I want to work and they made it happen.

As a result, I have now been here for more than 6 months and am transitioning into an engineering planner role, which is permanent, part-time, and comes with a good pay increase. Due to the changes in the company, I now have experience with, among other things, the following:

- Machinery decommissioning, relocation, recommissioning.

- Plant layout, set up and design.

- Maintenance planning and scheduling with a reliability-centered maintenance approach.

- Inventory management and purchasing.

- Post-Emergency damage assessment, clean-up and rebuild. 

All in 6 short months. I am rather adamant that there is nowhere else I could have been for the first 6 months that could have given me as broad experience as this, which I am definitely grateful for.

However, I feel like I’m using very little of what I studied for this job. There have been a few times I have used somewhat basic dynamics, and I have talked with QA about failure mechanics, but other than that I feel like I’m just using general mechanical knowledge that I would not have necessarily needed to go to university to gain. 

This kind of has me worried, as I still don’t know exactly what path I want to go down career wise, all I know is that I am enjoying my time in manufacturing. I just don’t want my *only* future opportunities to be in manufacturing.

I guess my overall concerns are:

Would it be hard from me to transition from this sort of role to an engineering design role outside of paper manufacturing?

If it will make it harder, what are the best ways for me to make the transition easier in the future?

Should I really be concerning myself with these matters this early in my career?

It's important for me to say, that i have had a good life - my youth was not a place of depression or despair at all. I had friends, girls and i did really well in high school, despite almost no attempt. I had a quirk, however, that still destroys me to this day - i have this tendency to push people away in a very dramatic way when they get to close. That naturally do mean, that i speak to noone from my high-school days or even before - the majority have explicit hate towards me.   


Anyway, the story of how i am where i am today:

  
During studying for my [B.Sc](https://B.sc). i got a relevant part-time job on the side - and i absolutely hated every minute of it. I made the choice to finish my degree and basicly take extra-cources regarding topics that cought my interest and i could ses myself pursueing a career in. Since my [B.Sc](https://B.Sc). is in economics and business administration, i had the opportunity to influence it to a certain degree.   


Fast forward to when i completed my [B.Sc](https://B.Sc). I was incredibly lucky to get  enrolled into exactly the master's degree i had intented - on top of that, i met the girl of my dreams. Everything was lining up perfectly and the plan was made. Study like a madman, spend time with the girl and apply for relevant part-time jobs or internships - rince and repeat every day.   


And i did. However, my grades were going down the drain and despite several interviews, i did not get any job. 9 months into my Masters, my self-esteem is non-existent and its taking a toll on my relationsship. Since my GF would never even think of leaving me at the time, she was always a bubbly person and her life was progressing quickly for the better - she put things on hold to help me get up again. This were something i could not live with, i have no intention of holding anyone back or make their life a compromise - so i decided to leave her. I still remember the last thing i said to her at the time ""This is the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life"".   


Fast forward 3 months, things are going even worse, i completely realize that soon have a close to worthless degree and cant get a job, and i am ashamed to even see my friends who's lifes are lining up perfectly. However, one day, a hear a silent knock on my front door. Its my now Ex-girlfriend with tears in her eyes, she tells me she loves me and i am the only one she ever wants to be with - i tell her i love her (first time i ever told anyone). We get back together.  


The next 4 months are horrible, i start seing a psychotherapist without my girl knowing. I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety and sleep deprivation. I get medication for all of it. For some reason, every second is pure agony to me and i eventually plan my own suicide - January 2019.  


By November 2018. I decide to leave my now ex-girl to lessen the blow of me passing away.   
Going all november and december planning my suicide while doing my exams. I somehow decide the give life another chance. It's hard to explain, but people around you can sense when you doing horrible, i got random message from friends telling me i was a good guy and other encouriging words out of the blue - despite no one knowing of my condition.   


New years eve i get a long text from my ex-girlfriend, that she loved me, she will never forget me, that we might me some where down the line in a better place.   


One week after, i decide to go to her place, just the way she did for me, in hopes of a sweet reunion. However, things go really dark. She is home with another guy. She's angry at me, she's says she hates me. She tells me that she called the cops. Right after she deletes and blocks me from any form of contact and social media. One month later, she's engaged to this succesful rich and handsome guy - seemingly as happy as she wll ever be. She loved me until she found something better.   


The months after are tough, i plan another date for my suicide. 1. July 2019. I continue to write my masters thesis and try  to meet new people.   


I just delivered my master thesis, its horrible - final nail in the coffin for my GPA. I managed to get no part-time jobs or internships despite 75 applications during my studies.  I have applied for close to 150 full-time jobs the last 6 months. No interviews. The girl of my dreams are getting married to a guy, who is everything i tried to be, but could not. By October, i will be out on the streets with nothing but debt. My friends are doing well and i am ashamed to see them.   


I once heard someone say that suicide is only a viable option, when there is no hope for a better future. I believe there isn't. Even if i get a job to scrape by. I will have to live a miserable lonely live because of the decisions i made. I dont believe i can.  


I still want to emphasize that i have had a good life. However, i do not believe there are any more happy moments for me. Spoiled - i know. 

  
Sorry for not so well-written english and the wall of text. I expect nothing, but it certaintly does not hurt to write it out."

* I have the choice of 2 complementary courses from below (that I feel are relevant)...

I'm very interested in computer vision+deep learning and I would like to explore more of that.

I'm uncertain if I want to pursue a Masters, mostly for financial reasons and that I am 31 and feel that I should be getting out in the field for experience.


My questions are

* I have to do one 4 month internship before graduating. What are some entry level internship positions that could help me get my foot into the field - esp. since I am not at a Masters level ?
* What would be a good portfolio pieces that would be good to start working on that would give me an advantage in the job hunt process?"
bqhhzx,13,2019-05-19,Marketing Assistant Job Scam Advice,Slver129,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bqhhzx/marketing_assistant_job_scam_advice/,"Since I've graduated college a year ago I've been desperate for a steady job. Even if it wasn't in the major I had studied, I'd be willing to take it if it was full time. Ever since my junior year I have been nonstop applying to jobs and internships and still not receiving anything of note. So few days ago during my daily routine of applying to 10+ jobs online, I had applied to a ""marketing company"" on LinkedIn for the role of Marketing Assistant. The job advertised that I would be making $44,000-$58,000 annually, it was in an area in the city that I was dying to work in, and I could start as soon as possible. It sounded like a dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

Less than a day later I got a response via both email and text message saying that they had loved my resume and wanted to bring me in for an interview. So the next step for me was doing some research on their company. They had a website but there wasn't much on it besides their values, some stock articles about marketing advice and a vague description of what they did. It used only stock photos and looked like it was made through something like Squarespace. There were no actual credit to the work they did anywhere on the site. I have a friend who is very well versed in everything computer related and he found through the source code that the website had only been made back in January. My friends all thought it was fishy but I just kept saying that it must have been a startup. I brought all of this up to my parents but they agreed that it was a startup and that I should still go through with the interview the next day. I called in sick from my current job and went to the interview the next afternoon.

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday I arrive at the office. Its a shared space with a couple of other ""marketing companies."" There were like 20 other people there for interviews. All of them, like me, were college aged (18-early 20s). The space was super tiny and I never got to see past the first two tiny offices. I filled out a form with my reasons for being there and current job. 20 minutes after my scheduled time I was called in by the company's president. A young guy probably not much older than 30. He told me that this was just a ""meetup"" to get to know me and not an actual interview. He told me that the job would start out at Marketing Assistant and between 20-40 weeks I'd be leveled up to Branch Manager. The reason he told me is because this was a ""startup"" company. If he liked me at Friday's interview I'd be contacted later that evening for a second one the very next day. And I was. And I called in sick from my current job for a second time. 

Yesterday I went back to the same office and had an interview (again 20 minutes after my scheduled time) with another person, this time a woman. She told me and this other guy that there were six of us chosen out of 100 people for this position and that only 2 would get the job. Weirdly, this interview was with both me and that other guy but he was for a Marketing internship position. So it was me, this rich Ivy League School guy wanting an internship and the interview woman. We walked down the street and got coffee and tea while she explained ""direct marketing"" and all of the big name work that has no evidence behind it. Then we said our goodbyes and she told us that we would get a response a few hours later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lo and behold I got the job. I was stunned. ME. A guy from State University of F\*\*\*ing Nowhere who doesn't even have a degree anywhere close to marketing got a job as a Marketing Assistant. My family celebrated and my friends all told me congratulations but I still couldn't shake a feeling inside my guts. So I googled ""marketing assistant scam"" and my heart sank. My gut was right. ""Direct Marketing"" was throwing people out on the street to sell sh\*t and not a real office job creating campaigns like they had initially described. I had just said yes to a job that was a scam. I had told them I can start work and attend training next Monday. The president told me that they would get back to me yesterday with even more details about the job but so far I haven't received anything. I want to report them so bad after I get a response but my parents are telling me that that is a bad idea and that I should just say that I can't take the job and let that be the end of it. There were so many people there for interviews. I don't want them to get hurt. Is there a good way to report them anonymously ? Has anyone else gone through this kind of thing before? They have my contact and job information and I am terrified. I'm not sure what to do next."

Any ideas which topics I should brush up on or learn in these couple of days that will help me in the interview. There are some desired skills in the internship like HTML and CSS (which I’m quite familiar with), SQL (I know the basic querying commands), JS (I’m a little familiar with this as well) and Agile Development (I’ve learned about the agile scrum methodology). Any help or guidance will be hugely appreciated.

I am a 23-year-old graduate just out of college and looking for freelance work to help me gain contacts in the industry. I'm here to develop AI using Python, SQL, etc. that can blow you out of the water.

**Why should you consider hiring me?**

I am passionate about this work. I've already developed an image recognition AI that I wish to pursue even further in other areas like cryptocurrency. I work until I finish no exceptions. I've just come out the other side of one of the toughest courses in Ireland and want more challenge in a new area.

**Why I'm going to help you make a business idea you can put in the bank:**

Unlike other developers, my main background is in Physics, and thus in solving problems. That's what I do best. I'm given a problem and approach it from every way possible to come to the best solution. I've also learned how to code during internships in the financial industry making my skillset quite unique and valuable to a business.

**Sounds Good?**

Perhaps in 4 years I'll decide to stay here in the UK, closer to family and friends, but I'd like to find out the path to take if I want to work in the US and do everything I can to keep my options open.

What is the easiest path to take in this situation? Do I basically need to get good grades in school, try and get as much work experience as possible and build some good side projects and then apply for some kind of visa? What are the chances of obtaining one of these? I've seen that some people study for a masters degree in the US after getting their bachelors over here, but I wasn't sure of the advantage to this because wouldn't they need to take out big student loans to cover the tuition costs?

One route I've heard of people taking is to get a job at a company like Google here in the UK, and then see if you can transfer to one of their offices over in the states. The problem I see with this strategy is you could end up spending years waiting for a transfer that never comes, unless this kind of thing is easier to do than I realise?

Even if I reach the point where I'm able to work in the US, would I be at some kind of disadvantage because I studied at a UK university in comparison to US graduates? One thing I've noticed is it seems a lot less common to get internships in the UK earlier than your last 2 years of study, and there's no programs like Google EP or Explore Microsoft for first and second years, so it's a bit harder to graduate with 4 summers of internship experience.

I'm curious, and forgive me if this question doesn't make sense because I have very little experience with geospatial programming with python; will learning for desktop cross over to working with pro?

My parents are high up in their professions respectively, so they were working 7-5 during the week. My older brother was his own version of Dennis the Menace, so daycare was no longer an option. My parents hired a day nanny, we’ll call her Kay. At the time, she was 57, and had just been divorced. She has 1 child, who married and had 3 kids. From what I understand, her daughter in law and Kay did not get along so well, so it caused her and her son to grow distance, but it was always okay because she always had my brother and I. 

She loved my brother and I unconditionally, and was with our family every day until I turned 14 or 15 (I’m the youngest) but the relationship we developed was like having a 3rd parent, or even having a 5th grandparent. Even after her time with us ended, we always remained in touch, and I would still visit her whenever I had a chance, and call her a few times a week just to chat. She always came to our birthday parties, and just became a part of the family. 

Fast forward to now: I am 22 years old, and her health is in decline. To clarify, I knew her health was declining, but I didn’t know how bad it actually was. 

Kay did her best to shield any details from my family and I, but I returned home for spring break and actually took her to her primary care. She always had problems with her knees from an injury she sustained some time ago, and now it pains her to walk. 

She had a BP of 202/97, was diagnosed with non-diabetic neuropathy, and is in need of a double knee replacement. Until I had gotten on her case about eating, she would only eat 1/2 a meal every day or so, so she currently is dealing with chronic weight loss. (I didn’t know she wasn’t eating.) She is also clinically depressed. Her doctor has prescribed her antidepressants in the past, but idk if she is taking them, along with a slew of other meds she’s on, but she assures me she’s taking all meds as recommended. 

I call her every day, and she is always down, and often crying; fun fact, the saddest thing in the world is listening to a little old lady cry on the telephone. 

She needs people to help take care of her. I’m currently away from home on an internship, so that greatly effects my ability to see her. My brother goes grocery shopping for her, and her neighbor cuts her grass, and helps her around the house, but she needs someone there all the time. I contacted an organization that has been providing her with some PT, Occupational Therapy, and a nurse to come twice a week, but they won’t see her for much longer, as they specialize in post surgery care. They have referred me to an agency that specializes in care for the elderly, but it’ll be another 2 weeks before anyone can come interview her to see if she meets requirements. 

She is currently on Medicare, and has a very small monthly income, but not so small she can qualify need based (even tho the money she gets equates to a working person receiving $9USD/hr.) 

She is currently an extra $200 a month over this organizations monthly income limit from being accepted on a needs based standard, but the woman from the agency assured me that there might be something they can do. 

In the event that she doesn’t qualify for the in home healthcare, I really don’t know what to do. 

Her son is so apathetic to the state of his mother, in my eyes one of the kindest people to walk the Earth, that it feels like he’s just waiting for her to die. I just don’t understand how someone could be so apathetic to their own mother. I understand that no parent is perfect, there is no way he could be getting enjoyment from watching this little old woman suffer, regardless of what may or may not have happened between them. 

A retirement home/ assisted care facility is also not an option for her (she can’t afford it.) 

I live in the US, so if there is anyone out there that knows a way to get care to the elderly, when they desperately need it, please help me.

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for all of the advice; even tho the post says advice received, the more the better."

They have a whole IT department and sometimes have internships, contract, and job openings. He and others in his department had been trying to push for an intern or contract job( then I’d apply for it and have a connection to give me a much better chance at an interview). It’s been a couple months since. From what I gather I think HR denied them an intern this year.  Anyways, a full time job opened up about two week ago and I applied(my connection told me about it). He said things can move slow. Could be a month, 4 months, a week. He has no idea

I’m an online student, finishing up my IT BS hopefully this fall. The job opportunity is insane, but I worry nothing will come of it. At least it was posted and I was actually able to apply for it. I technically qualify for it so I may get an interview.

Here is my question. I’m not sure if I should be “casting a wider net” by search and applying everywhere. I’m a college senior and time is running short on getting an internship while I’m in school. I’m sure the answer is yes,  but I worry about this scenario: I take an internship or job and work for a couple weeks or a month, but then get called about this job at the power plant. So I could just leave that job even though I was expected to stay longer or I lose the opportunity at the nicer job? Should I be patient and wait for a great opportunity or hurry up and get something?

I hope this make sense. This guy has been working hard at trying to get me an opportunity at the company. It’s one of best opportunities i have, but I can’t just wait around for this specific company. 

How do you professionally handle something like this. If you take an ok opportunity, but then soon later get offered the better opportunity. Is it appropriate to just leave the company? 

Hoping this up is understandable enough to get some advice"

I felt like I haven't really learnt anything that I can apply to a career in these last few years of education. Halfway through I begin feeling like I didn't want to be a journalist and instead wanted to do something a bit more 'creative'. I have no work experience and no real skills. The last year or so I've been experimenting with different hobbies to find something that clicks. I've tried graphic design (logos and posters), creative writing, blogging, coding, music and 3D animation. I learnt a lot in this time but nothing has stuck with me and even after ages of practicing and learning I still haven't being able to produce anything I'm proud of. I used to think I had a creative mind but I've lost all confidence over this year, I'm starting to feel like I'm not good at anything. 

I've been looking at job listings almost every day and not one thing comes up that I'm even half qualified for. Like I said before I have no experience other than a few months of working in retail and as a receptionist. Most jobs want either a relevant degree (mine is never on the list) or 1+ year of experience which I don't have. I've looked at temporary work, internships and volunteering but still no luck at all. I feel like I have absolutely nothing to offer any company or employer. 

I'm questioning what it is I even want to do as a career. I used to love writing and wanted to write articles or screenplays but during my time at university I've been set endless essays which have completely burnt me out and now I don't really enjoy writing at all. I always felt so creative and thought I had some really good ideas that I've never been able to execute. I ideally wanted to work on projects where I could be rewarded by seeing the final product and knowing that I helped make it happen. I thought social media marketing would be a good fit too but there have been no job listings at all in my area. All the other marketing and communication jobs require years of experience, no one wants a newbie to have to train up. 

I'm really struggling coming to grips with all of this, I've been in a really bad state mentally and I can feel my motivation draining away more each day. I'm so scared I'm going to end up working in retail again and stay there for the rest of my life. I feel like I've completely wasted these last three years at university and all I've got to show for myself is 50k of debt. I would really appreciate any advice anyone has to offer about what my options are and what I could be doing to help my situation. Thanks so much."

Irish university student here, we split our masters degree and put one year of it into our ""Honours Bachelors degree"", making our standard degree structure 4 years rather then 3 (which is typical in Europe), and our masters degree only 1 year. If im able to get into late interviews or job offers, i'll pull out as the industry experience will prove more valuable (and the irish honours degree is only more valuable in ireland, most other countries dont distinguish it differently from their 3 year degrees). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I am considering pulling out of university with a standard bachelors degree as most jobs that even list degrees find that as the desired standard (only irish companies , of which there are actually very few mention wanting the honours degree instead). But im nervous about my ability to gain work as a junior/entry level engineer as ive heard many stories of folks struggling to find work even with intern-ships and good GPAS, although our graduate employment rate for IT related degrees is solid (namely 7/8 find work after graduating), but still. So im considering applying to Honey pot IO for work in europe instead of going down the mass application route (or as a supplement to it). Has anyone had any luck with them? Apparently even entry level folks dont have too much issue getting work with them, but not many reviews of them especially with folks with low experience are out there. Cheers lads.

bqoz3v,4,2019-05-19,First employee compensation advice - Am I getting screwed? Please help.,potemkin42,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/bqoz3v/first_employee_compensation_advice_am_i_getting/,"Hi all, this is my first post in this subreddit - I'm here because I'm new to startups in general, and have received an offer from a startup which the cofounders say is fair but my gut says is not.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the story:** the startup is ""Company,"" and we'll call the two cofounders ""CEO"" and ""CTO"" (their roles). Myself, CEO, and CTO all just finished our Junior year at the same university, and we're all good friends. CEO and CTO started Company around 2 years ago, and after some pivots Company started getting some real attention and a bit of money through pitch competitions and such.

Last summer, I was doing an internship in the same city that CEO and CTO were working on Company, and since we're friends they asked if I could help them build out some of their proof-of-concept technology (neither of them know how to code, and I do). They offered $20/hour, and I spent the evenings and weekends of the summer building their proof-of-concept, which was good enough to secure Company a critical industry partner at the end of the summer. I loved the work and Company's mission, and CEO and CTO really enjoyed working with me. Last September, CEO and CTO decided to take the semester off from university to really focus on Company, and they offered that I join them in exchange for a 5% stake. I felt that this offer was a bit too low, and besides I was looking forward to returning to school, so I turned them down.

The fall semester goes by, and in the spring CEO and CTO return to school (they missed their friends, and also thought they could still work on Company while enrolled in classes). Just before the spring semester, they reach out to me about wanting to assemble a team of students to further develop Company's tech; they want me to lead that team, as they know I'm a responsible manager and I understand this part of the tech way better than they do. They said they'd give me 1% equity at the end of the semester for my troubles, and I was excited to learn more about new technologies and technical management, so I agreed.

To complicate things, also around this time CEO and CTO managed to attract several large angel/pre-seed investors, giving the company around $600k @ 3m pre-money valuation. As such, around a month ago when it became clear that we would have to extend our technical development through the whole summer, they offered to pay me a market-rate salary to join them full-time during the summer. I agreed, quitting the internship offer I'd lined up for myself as a result.

It's recently become apparent to all of us that, since CEO and CTO don't know how to code, I will actually be a critical part of the Company (essentially CIO) until much later this year when we try to raise a Series A. As such, CEO and CTO want me to take the next year off of school with them to work full-time on Company. And I want to join them, because I'll learn a TON in this role, I like working with them, and again I love Company's vision. This week, we've been negotiating the terms of my role/compensation.

**Here's the tricky part:** (bear with me here) I technically never signed any paperwork at all because I trust my friends, so as of now I don't technically work for the company, I haven't been paid, and I own no equity. I know, probably stupid of me, but CEO and CTO are genuinely trustworthy guys. Anyway, that means the contract I sign now must take into consideration everything I've stated above, and I just received my offer.

**The offer:** $25/hour backdated through the previous summer (totals around \~$8000). Market-rate salary (TBD) for all my full time work from here forward. 1% equity on an accelerated (1-year, \~3 month cliff) vesting schedule. I become the CIO until we raise a Series A (probably in 6-8 months), at which point the (heartless, haha) new investors will likely want to bring on a CIO with actual industry experience. I should note that I won't personally be building most of the core tech from here forward, because it's much more complex than the common databases/website/app you see in many tech startups nowadays (we need things like custom cloud architecture, custom computer vision algos, ML/analytics, visualization, etc.). We'll be hiring experts in these subfields, but I will be the one managing them and filling in all the inevitable gaps that arise when building a technical product.

**Equity questions:** When I noted that 1% seems low, they noted that that's all they've set aside and that giving me any more will require them to dilute current investors and will likely be a red flag to future investors (makes sense). However, I can't shake the feeling that, for the first employee and the only manager who knows anything about code, 1% is *still* really low. Not to mention the fact that they seem to want to recognize me as a co-founder, probably just because I'm their friend and that title is a nice thing to have had down the road, but still. For reference, CEO and CTO each have over 35%.

I understand that since CEO and CTO started the company, have really stuck with the vision through thick and thin, and single-handedly raised over half a million in funding, that they should absolutely have more equity than me. But is over 30 times as much still fair? I was thinking a first employee in my position would generally receive something along the lines of 3%, and if I was truly positioned as a new cofounder than that'd rise to around 8%. Again, I really am not sure how to make sense of any of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this offer seem fair for my existing/future contribution to the company? Is it true that there's really no good way for the company to issue me more equity? Thank you all so much for helping a newbie!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Looks like I was presumptuous to assume market rate for salary. Does anyone know how much below market rate seed-stage startups typically offer for salary? My plan is to take the salary along with the 1%, which will vest by the end of the year, at which point my contract will expire and I can return to school. I'd only stay on if they want to make me a better offer at that point - the way I see it, I'm still young and this is a pretty good outcome for 1 year of work. Thank you all for your responses, you've really helped my put the situation in context."

bqqmnf,5,2019-05-20,should my lack of Friendships/relationships be a concern for my mental health,fallingbanana,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/bqqmnf/should_my_lack_of_friendshipsrelationships_be_a/,"Hello, I am 21M about to go to my 4th year in college. I just turned 21 and I am struggling to understand if it better to be alone or attempt to be with people, (sound stupid I know)

&amp;#x200B;

When I am home, not working or going to school or participating in some internship, I am alone for most of my day. I see my mother, my gym partner that I see 3 times a week, and chat with some kid I play video games with, yet I don't leave the house(because I don't have a car and even if I did I wouldn't know where to go) and I feel very alone by mistake, I felt that I have made many grave mistakes on my path. This is not how I imagined 21 to be like, I imagined 21 to be the time I figured out my work-life balance and made friends who support me and care for me, I feel that my mother is my only real support. Being alone feels bad, but once I am around people, I miss being alone,  unfortunately, I feel that people are problematic and it better to be alone.

&amp;#x200B;

When I think of people, I remember negative feelings and circumstances I have had in the past, I think of my coworkers and boss who always need me to do something(I am used to this) I think of people in my classes who only talk to me because they need answers for HW they can't do by themselves. I think of women I tried to speak to but fail to build a connection or have some kind of spark. I think of times where I have to make myself look happy and put on a mask that shows I am making progress with my life(I am making progress, just not social progress) When I am around people, I am reminded of the feeling that I don't fit in, that I have low amounts of influence in my relationships with people, and that I miss being alone. I don't hate people but It hard for me to not to see them as problematic 

&amp;#x200B;

I try to make friends but I am not intuned with the college culture, I occasionally drink/smoke but I don't glorify the activity. I feel depressed a lot but I can't drink/smoke to ""chill the fuck out"" because I don't have connections(this is more prevalent to smoking, I just turned 21 so). I have put my focus on schooling, professional networking, organizations and jobs, and preparing for industry work, I have really neglected the idea of finding people to meet because I figured friends will come once I improve myself so all I ever do is things that improve me professionally.  When I am not working, I participate in hobbies such as drawing, playing the paino and harmonica, playing videogames, etc.

 

I think this lifestyle I have been living is/will negatively affect my life in the long run. I have been feeling this extreme loneliness for 2 years now. I sleep at 4:00 am every day because I have no plans or obligations to attend to in the morning, I get more work is done (coding related) and I don't feel as bad for checking social media when everyone is sleeping. It just feels natural to me, I philosophize more, and I am more artistic/creative. Also since no one texts me and knows my whereabouts I have to be extra cautious about my physical and mental health. I have the fear of dying alone but at the same time, I wonder if that actually not that bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Starting my 20s I feel I set the bar for my 30s and onwards. if I am lonely now, I have the fear of becoming comfortable as some 40-year-old virgin, no friend, life hating, ignorant bum who missed out on life. Those are my 2 cents on how I see my life at the moment, I was wondering for any advice, philosophy or comments positive or negative. I know some of my points are contradicting and I am trying to figure out myself, if you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this."

I'm not currently majoring in CS, but something associated with it, being Cognitive Systems (very similar to cognitive science elsewhere). 

I've taken a couple programming courses, but I feel that all the things I learned were conceptual. For example I took a course using Java to teach object-oriented programming, but I don't feel like I learned to really make something on my own. I understand that many courses introduce you to common concepts in languages, but I really want to make something I'm proud of. I've also taken a fair bit of algorithms and data structures.

I don't want to waste too much time learning things that I've practiced already, which is probably why I have trouble following a lot of these ""learn to \*insert language here\*"", although I know I should probably just commit to finishing some of them.

I'd be interested in making simple web apps, android apps, or games as a personal project.

I was fortunate enough to be accepted two full-time, paid internships this summer with major companies, each lasting about 8 weeks. I'm a junior living in Western Washington planning to head into medicine.

I'm having trouble deciding, and just wanted to ask if there really is any overwhelming factor I'm not considering between the two of these and if anyone could weigh in:

thanks in advance for your time!

&amp;#x200B;

**Boeing:**

*Pros:*

\-30 minute 25 minute commute w/ traffic; off at 2 pm

\-concrete job definition as of now (787 final assembly line with hands-on composite materials opportunities and rotations to different departments)

\-one of the most sough-after hs positions offered by Boeing to my school district; one with a large amount of highly-qualified applicants

\-$2.00 more per hour (:$17.00)

\-many friends from hs participating

\-program only available to juniors

&amp;#x200B;

*Cons:*

\-less selective; 20 positions offered throughout entire school district; not nationally-known

\-I'm more likely to become involved with computer science than engineering although chances of both are low

\-current downturn in Boeing publicity

\-recent participants gripe about doing nothing much; although, my position seems the most promising

&amp;#x200B;

**Microsoft:**

*Pros:*

\-Microsoft culture

\-Being able to contribute to industry projects; one potential role is creating a chat bot for the new Azure cloud space (boeing might just be busy work)

\-my team and interviewers are project managers; fits into my interests of logic and planning, leadership and communication practice

\-friend who did Microsoft internship last year said she thinks (biasedly) that Microsoft is better

\-extremely selective (2,000 applicants, 140 positions), listed in nearly every online ""best summer hs internship programs""

&amp;#x200B;

*Cons:*

\~3 hour commute every day round trip (shuttle available halfway if i were to drive myself to pickup location)

\-unknown hours and job description

\-less pay

\-overpriced lunch

\-seemingly higher-risk, higher-reward in that it may absolutely suck or be super amazing; boeing seems the safe bet

\-could technically re-apply next year if declined, although unknown if acceptance this year changes chances next year; if I take it this year, I definitely cannot apply next year

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning Microsoft, but the commute, pay, and quantitative factors make it seem like a no-go. I could also technically re-apply next year, although who knows if my acceptance this year would lower my chances. Boeing is a safe bet, but Microsoft just has the star power, if that's understandable.

I’ll be applying for grad school (Computer Science) this year for 2020 Fall. 

My background: 
- 7.5/10 CGPA. BTech in CS (India). 
- A semester-long undergraduate research intern at University of Melbourne. 
- 1 year of relevant work experience in IT company. 
- GRE: 326


I’m planning to publish a paper in a local Indian conference (happening for the 4th time) but I’m afraid that instead of boosting my profile, it might even hurt it !

Does the adage- “Having something is better than nothing” apply for paper publication in grad admissions - be it a local conference?"

However, after visiting the school campus, it really turned me down and disappointed because the SCSE building looks like a factory.... and many people are telling me the negative things about NTU. 
I am also offered business and computer science double degree in SMU, however, people say that the computer science degree in smu is not technical and not a good degree for CS. I’m very lost now, can someone give some insights? Any NTU CS seniors can share your experience, how are the profs, environment and internship opportunities?

[Edit] : I’ve chosen NTU, thanks for all the suggestions! :D"

I recently graduated with a BA in Political Science, hoping to go to law school but lost any interest in law after an internship.

I'm now interested in getting into coding but I'm not sure what path to take. Should I go back to school and get a CS degree, do a bootcamp, or teach myself online?

There seem to be endless coding languages, front/back end developing etc it's a bit overwhelming. My main problem is that I don't have a goal that I can work towards. How exactly would I develop one?"
bqv1iq,1,2019-05-20,Internship or Mental Health,brightboomerang,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bqv1iq/internship_or_mental_health/,"Hi, I have been offered an internship for the summer relating to my economics course which I am currently halfway through completing (2/4 years). The pay is 320 $ a week for 37 hours. The pay is not that important, but the experience is what I will value and learn the most from.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand my mental health has deteriorated a lot over the last 7/8 months. I have developed health anxiety (hypochondriac) and i am currently on zoloft which i started over a month ago. This anxiety problem has affected my schoolwork a lot. I love my course but was unable to focus in class or produce any quality work over the last few months. I am sure I failed at least 2 out of 5 of my exams because of my inability to study and panic attacks during my examinations.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I would have jumped at this opportunity but after seeing how my school work was affected this semester I am afraid that if I accept it my mental health will not have improved come September. I was planning on improving my mental health over the summer and get a part time job locally with ensuring my education was given priority.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone think I will be making a mistake by passing it up? Will accepting the position potentially improve my mental health?

Thanks to anyone who can help!  (M 21 - If that matters)"

bqwxbj,3,2019-05-20,Should I look for a better job?,JoeyPitlock,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bqwxbj/should_i_look_for_a_better_job/,"Hi everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 24 yrs old and I recently graduated a well-renowned school in my state with a bachelors degree in IT with a 3.0gpa, along with an applied business certificate, and a few smaller certificates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before my bachelors degree, I earned an associates degree in IT from my local community college and had a little over three years of experience in IT doing internships and part time IT service desk jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

The company I currently work for now is one that I was originally just contracting for and then they offered me a full time position once I graduated because they liked me a lot and I was quick to learn the processes of most things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I accepted the job offer and I currently have been working here now for about 6 months part-time + contracted, and 3-4 months full-time. After some thought and research though I am really reconsidering if I am making what I should be, coming out of college with everything I have built up. The biggest issue is the salary, I am starting at 40k a year with this current job.. I feel like I am regretting my decision and may have just took the offer because I am familar with the job and wanted to have work right out of college. I have close to 30k in student debt and my biggest priority is to get that all paid off so money is a big factor for me. Here are the pros and cons of my current job though: 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:  
\- Good health insurance 

\- Lots of traveling opportunities (I love to travel)

\- Very laid back environment (no dress code at all, sweatpants allowed)

\- Top of the line computers provided to us for work/personal use

\- Very short commute (10 min train ride) 

\- Best manager I have ever had. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cons; 

\- Salary

\- No tuition reimbursement   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, given my accomplishments and experience do you think I am selling myself short? I know in terms of salary I could do much better I feel like, but the job does have other nice Pros as I've listed above, but like I said, paying off my student debt is a MUST and ASAP for me. What do you guys think? How much should I be earning, or expect being a new graduate? Also what should I look for in jobs that can make up for lower salaries? Any advice helps to be honest!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,

Joey"

I  wanted to get an internship position for this summer so I could graduate next semester with some more relevant experience. I have had a summer internship in the past as well as having worked in food service. After 80+ job apps, most with personalized cover letters, in various locations throughout my state and some bordering states, I've had no luck. I've been sending these out since March, and I haven't gotten a single interview. I've had professors and advisors look at my resume and cover letters, and they have unanimously said they are well written and formatted. I also have strong recommendations from past managers and professors. This leads me to think that it's my low GPA (2.82) and my lack of relevant certifications that's preventing me from getting any interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: what should I be doing this Summer, aside from an internship, to bolster my ability to enter the workforce?

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, my plan is to retake two classes, that I got C's in, over the Summer to increase my GPA. I also want to complete, or at least begin, certifications in Revit, Inventor, C++, Excel, CNC, ANSYS, and Java. I also plan on getting a part-time job, and any suggestions would be of great help here. I just don't want to graduate and have my lack of senior-level internship hold me back from getting a good start to my career. I want to have a solid response for future interviewers when they ask why I don't have an internship over this summer. Any help at all here (skill, cert, job, project, or volunteering recommendations) is greatly appreciated."

I currently work in IT (it's been 4 years now) and I am pursuing a CS degree. However, this degree is taking a looooong time to complete. I am traumatized from paying off my student loans from my first degree and I have taken a lot of time off to get my career together, save up, climb out of living below the poverty line, getting married and help my parents after they lost their house.

My question is how will this look for future software eng/dev jobs? Will they question why I started this degree in 2015 and have taken time off (like years off, I've only completed 3 classes since I was enrolled in 2015, then took time off, and am now back) and am returning to take one class per quarter? Not sure if this would disqualify me from internships for taking forever even if I have strong work experience and a high GPA.

TLDR; Had to take a lot of time off from school because my life was a mess and have recovered, but am now returning to complete my second degree in CS. How will this reflect to future CS or software job or internship opportunities? Or am I worried for no reason? Not sure if I should have a reason ready once interviews begin."

We couldn't decide on an idea, and I told them my idea and we decided to run with it. I set up the dev environment, and coded like 80% of it by myself whereas the another member (Bill) coded the remaining 20%. The entire idea was mine, I wrote most of the code, did all the github stuff (branching, merging etc), managed the servers, and deployed it. The other two members (John and Jack) did not code anything because they didn't know how to read the documentation and write code (they were self-proclaimed ""amazing developers""). I asked John to do a very simple task (link css with html using django) but he kept trying to get me to do it because he didn't know how, despite telling him to figure it out for himself. He kept adding negative output by constantly asking irrelevant questions and distracting us, as well as hardcoding API keys (despite telling him to read the keys from a file or use env variables multiple times) and pushing non-working code to master, which I had to go back and fix.

&amp;#x200B;

At the presentation stage, one of the recruiters for a local company inquired about the project and John took charge and said he built it all, and that everything was done by him. The recruiter told Jack to add him on linkedin, and apply for internships for fall 2019/summer 2020. When the recruiter pressed for more details, Jack told them I can explain it (which I did to an extent because I essentially wrote all of it). The recruiter messaged Jack recently and said he wants to hire him on a contract to extend what he built at the hackathon. Jack messaged me saying he wants me to ""help"" with with it aka do all the work again.

&amp;#x200B;

Would I be the asshole for messaging the recruiter and setting the record straight? I feel as if I should have gotten the connection on Linkedin and the contract, because I did all the work, whereas he threw Bill and I under the bus. I did not want to cause an argument while we were presenting by saying that Jack lied, and I wouldn't have ever messaged him if it wasn't for the contract. That should have been me and it very well deserved to be me, not him, because he didn't do anything and lied that he did it all.

&amp;#x200B;

So would I be the asshole Reddit?"

Will life get better once I get into IT?,moshywilly,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bqzvfg/i_hate_working_in_an_entirely_middle_aged_and_old/,"I live in NJ, I am a 20 year old guy go to college here and I finished my junior year. I can't even get an IT internship here or even the small IT jobs that don't require a degree. Seriously, that's how bad jobs in NJ. So I am stuck doing a menial job as usual.

I hated retail like most people do, but I loved my coworkers at the time (age 19 at the time). They were in their late high school days and some were in college and they were fun to be around. I enjoyed the grocery store job while it lasted, but I escaped retail!

Since last May, I am working a part time clerical job at a law firm. I hate the people here and the atmosphere. Everyone in the office is a typical annoying narcissistic Baby Boomer and there is only one other young guy working here and he is an attorney. I am not kidding, but I hate being in an environment where is everyone is middle aged/older. I hate people born before 1980 in general. They are always so entitled to everything, they act just as narcissistic as my parents, the people at my workplace are always befriending each other while I am in misery from being the youngest. I hate my job. The people at my job can treat each other like friends and I can't, because I can't get along when everyone in the office is born before 1980. One reason why I hated retail. I prefer to work in a company that is predominantly young and where Boomers don't make up the majority of the company's employee population.

Regardless of age group, coworkers are NOT your friends. Coworkers are always out there to get you in trouble too (haven't done anything bad at work). A good lesson for you to learn

I got an unpaid IT internship (on the side) last semester at a non-profit organization (organization that takes care of people with disabilities) and I was impressed with the high amount of young people working there (which most of NJ lacks due to young people leaving the state). Wasn't a relaxed company, but I felt happier and more energetic there although I didn't click with the IT guy and the other young employees.

When I get an IT job in my future, will there be more people my age working around where I can act like friends around them and not just a bunch of people older than me (where they dominate the whole office in terms of employee population and their narcissism) where I can't even say shit to them?

I don't want to be that one guy who eats lunch in his car in an empty parking lot (My job is part time, so no lunch)."

In a nutshell, at the end of my sophomore year, what is like a general list of things that I should know/ be comfortable doing? I'd like to bridge the gaps if I'm lacking on any front. TIA."

During my final semester I became really interest in a career in Data Analysis, so I researched what I have to do and learn, and to no surprise it's a lot, but I want and will do it.

Now that I'm a graduate, I'm going to be teaching myself all the skills necessary for this career. I realize this is going to take time, and I also need to have an income. I want to do something relevant to my career path, I have been thinking about data entry or maybe even do an internship to pick up experience as I have none.

br26i6,7,2019-05-20,My former boss is threatening to sue me (California),legaladvicepls12345,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/br26i6/my_former_boss_is_threatening_to_sue_me_california/,"Hi Reddit, 

&amp;#x200B;

The company I previously interned for is threatening to sue me. The company was fraudulent and abused students coming straight out of college. My boss sought me out after overhearing me talk with another recruiter at a job fair, and the company was in my field so I interviewed and was offered an internship, which was supposed to turn into a full time position, which never happened. And likely was never going to. The company is not profitable, and keeps itself afloat with free labor by hiring interns to work for free from the local university's career fair, and letting most of them go before the next one. Sure enough, I was let go the day before the next career fair. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple days after, a girl reached out to me on linkedin who met my former boss at the career fair asking me about if she should join the company. I replied with a 3 page document about the fraudulent practices, and why she shouldn't work there. I mentioned that the company was not profitable in the document, and proposed that was the reason why the company was engaging in it's current practices. Another intern who joined nearly the same time, but wasn't there as much as I was (full time) contacted me a couple weeks later asking for advice about whether to stay with the company or not, and I forwarded him the same document that I sent previously. While I was upset by my experience at the company, I refrained from posting a public review on either google or glassdoor.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, about a month later, I received an email from my former boss because my signature was missing from the last page of the exit package, and she wanted me to sign and return it. I thought it was strange that she was looking at my documents all this time after I'd left the company. I asked my father about it, and he said that it was to ensure that I wouldn't sue the company in the future. I was busy so I didn't reply.

&amp;#x200B;

 A few hours after this occurred, I received an email from her attorney with a cease and desist letter attached, stating the potential to sue me for a million dollars if I do not follow through with some of the demands, which includes $1000 to cover attorney fees, as well as taking back the statements I have made to the people that have seen this document. Somehow, she was able to see this document. I'm fully willing to retract my statements, but paying the $1000 seems excessive. I never intended to damage the company, but give advice from my poor experience to others who asked about it to prevent them from going through the same thing. Again, if I really wanted to cause damage to the company, I would have done it in a public place online, such as google reviews, or glassdoor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given all that has occurred, and that I didn't sign my exit package documents, what would be the best course of action to take?  

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice is much appreciated."

Need some feedback.",adopter010,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/br2z7s/graduated_5_months_ago_offered_a_qa_software_test/,"**Personal Background:**

I'm a 28 year old CS major, 3.20 GPA (not rounded) with a Math minor. Transferred to a respected school as a junior from a local CC, ended up spending 5 semesters to graduate due to transfer credits. Project lead for a capstone project with five other students and I ended up doing a lot of the work (easily seen from my GitHub). Got on the Dean's List (&gt;3.50 term GPA) my last two semesters so obviously the earlier semesters were a little rough. No internship (yeah I fucked up), a weird smattering of projects in different languages on my Git (Java, Racket, Clojure, Python, C#) but nothing horribly impressive. Coding competition experience outside of school during the summers (got paid for accommodations) never placed high as a solo competitor. Previous job experience has nothing to do with CS. Two of the people who were good/I got along with in my Capstone group are both three months into Software Engineering positions 2 hours away from here. Salaries are ~$60,000 and $63,000. 

**Job search background:**

I'm trying to stay within my current area due to an older family member. Most of the openings around here have multi-year C# experience requirements, even the ones listed as ""entry level"" want 1-2 years. Another common requirement: Experienced with testing, Selenium experience being a ""huge plus"". 

**Job background:**

$25/hour Junior QA Automation Engineer (""Junior Software Test Automation Engineer"") for a 6-month contract, then an offer for a full-time position assuming the company doesn't flake. Selenium is going to be used and they're explicitly stressing that they'll offer comprehensive training using it. Both automation and manual testing, participation in team meetings, reports, designing tests, etc. It was the first time I got even a remote technical interview, and wouldn't you know I was horribly sick and dizzy for it. Messed up a lot, somehow got confused in my head for multiple minutes about interfaces vs abstract classes in Java. Still got the offer. It's about 1.25 hours drive from home. Other current prospects is a Junior Software Analyst position at a small ~30 person company and Java developer job at a financial risk-assessment firm further away. Neither prospect is guaranteed. 

**My plan:**

Spend 6 months there, scope out how easy it is internally to jump ship from QA to other roles. If it looks like it isn't easy, decline the offer at the end of the contract and try again closer to home with the Selenium/QA experience as a boost. My impression is that having that background could be valuable for a Junior/Entry level Application Developer.
 
 
Feedback? Does my plan sound reasonable? What questions should I be asking as I'm on the job? Should I risk holding out longer, or am I right that any experience is good experience at this point in the game? Other things I should do while at his position to help me along? 

Thanks for reading."

br48e9,0,2019-05-20,First Post - Trying to pivot from ChemE to SWE or DS but feeling really stuck,ChemEtoCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/br48e9/first_post_trying_to_pivot_from_cheme_to_swe_or/,"I'll try to keep this short, but it's a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I've been reading A TON, but never posted anything. I could definitely use some help though. Basically, I'm about to be a 5th year at NCSU this year (B.S. Chemical Engineering, minor CS). I convinced myself about this time last year that Data Science is the perfect track for me. One year masters, average starting salary is \~$105k, I love programming, math, and stats, everything Data Science claims to be. Everything was going well: enjoying my CS classes and even got a Data Science internship with barely any DS experience! Well... I got pee shy during drug test and they pulled my offer in May :).

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, I pulled out another internship (which I just started today) as a ""VBA Programmer."" They want me to just automate a bunch of boring shit with VBA. Cool. I'll get paid and have fun, but VBA isn't quite the most sought after language.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after this summer, I'll have 4 years in college under my belt, three internships (Systems Engineer at RoviSys, Automation Engineer at Merck, and now VBA Programmer at this new company), but it's just really depressing to me because I feel tech hiring managers will treat my resume as if I have 0 experience so they're not relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

But here is where I'm really stuck: I don't know what I should do when I graduate, and here are my options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Get a SWE internship, then get masters from NCSU in analytics following year, then full time DS, then potentially pivot to SWE (pro: will have much more $$ sooner, but might not enjoy it and be stuck until I get some personal projects on my belt to get into SWE)
2. Try to get a full time SWE job, although knowingly will not get paid nearly as much as DS, then do GT's OMSCS     
(pro: masters of CS, might help me down the road land a sweet SV gig?)
3. Get a full time SWE job and try to somehow land a nice SWE job with only a minor

&amp;#x200B;

Really, my main concern is just having the CS minor. I'm afraid it's going to hold me back from the top tier SWE positions that are my end goal. But, then again, is working a few years in Data Science going to be any better than working at a less prestigious company as a SWE gaining valuable experience? I just don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have a 3.93 GPA right now, not sure if that even matters for SWE jobs, but maybe it could help.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Stuck between Data Science and SWE, not sure which route is best"

br4hco,4,2019-05-20,Pigeonholed in educational services and can't find a way out.,0xf00dc0de,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/br4hco/pigeonholed_in_educational_services_and_cant_find/,"Quick stats:

* Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, 4.0 overall, minor in computer science (2016) from famous Texas university,
* Master of Science in Mathematics (2018) from same university.
* Worked in tutoring for 2 years and served as a TA for final year in master's with *actual* teaching duties.
* Multiple years of experience helping run student organizations as an elected organization officer.
* Lots of programming projects in academic research.
* Have current projects in Android development, but unfortunately they're all duct-taped together and/or unfinished due to large scope of projects.
* No internships in anything.
* Been unemployed since 2018 because I'm a complete Aspie.

The last bullet point has changed as of today. I managed to finally get another job, but it's working 10-12 hour days as an academic advisor at a community college. Teaching duties also included. It's REALLY not what I want to do for a salary of $47k a year with a master's given the stress it'll include--I need much more money to afford the psychiatric help I'm going to need from the job's stress.

I blew countless interviews from May 2018 until February 2019 due to the fact that I'm a total Aspie--asking inappropriate questions, not asking *any* questions because I didn't know what to ask, poor eye contact and attention skills--you name it, it happened. Eventually, I figured out the recipe for success in interviews when I finally started bringing in a clipboard of all my research on the company/interviewer so that I had a cheat sheet of it all right there. I've managed to completely impress the interviewing committees of the last five on-sites I've done, but they seem to avoid picking me due to ""misunderstood credentials"". For example, I interviewed at a national laboratory. My master's research is in robotics. The national lab was looking for someone who has experience in that and they came across my resume which really interested them. They asked me to make a presentation about my research, and when I get there and present, there's this, ""Oh shit, *this* is what he meant by *robotics*..."" look on the hiring manager's face. They all personally tell me they're impressed, but they were completely caught off-guard with respect to my resume--they wanted someone who has worked with actual robots and not just algorithms behind robots.

**As well**, I recently discovered a trick from /r/cscareerquestions where I search LinkedIn for people who are `#hiring` Android or Java developers and try connecting with them to see what opportunities they have. I found my last interview for a Junior Android developer role with that, but it was all the way across Texas and they wouldn't pay for travel expenses or relocation if I got the job. They also asked me to make a demo Android app project, which I did. I took the risk and drove 6 hours to get to the interview out-of-pocket, and the interview committee's team lead kept repeatedly alluding to the possibility that I *won't* get the job, even before I'd even done anything at all. So that opportunity busted unfortunately. Their feedback was:

&gt;Unfortunately \[we\] went with another candidate. \[We\] liked you but decided the ramp up time was too great for \[our\] current needs. Hope we can work together on a future job opportunity.

As a mathematician, people say that I should be good at actuarial science or data science. Well, unfortunately, my master's program had no such way for you to get involved in that stuff. My math department focused on getting its students into academia more than industry. Hence, that's where all of my brainpower and focus went while I was there: making sure that I graduated on-time and completing some bullshit research project.

In any regard, coming home from my first day as an academic advisor left me completely exhausted and drained, and it's really not where I saw my life going post-graduation, for *that* kind of salary, anyway. I want to quit, which that's going to be a shitshow on its own given that I've been given my own office and everything. I think I need a plan of action of how to get there.

# To the point:

I want to get a job as a Java developer, given that's the language I've been using most in my personal projects as a self-taught Android app developer. But I need some help developing a roadmap how to get there. I live in Texas currently, and am nowhere near tech meetups for networking (think LITERAL small town Nowheresville). Friends I went to college with that were actually computer scientists can't help because their companies are moving VERY slow at the moment with regards to hiring anyone, given the fact that their stacks are on fire at the moment. I looked into getting my master's in software engineering from... the same university that I went to for my bachelor's and master's, but paying for it will be interesting. I only have $7k saved up. I could work the advisor job and make about $10,000 by the end of August to help pay and just quit, but I feel like that's not a solid plan of action really. And, given that I still want to look for work, it'll be hard to do that when I've just barely started. Is more education what I need in order to accomplish my goal? I have the huge disadvantage of a year-long gap in my resume, so that's also a factor to consider in my roadmap. Going back to school as a master's in software engineering student would also allow me to get access to internship opportunities again, seeing as how every place that I've tried applying as an intern won't let me since I've already graduated."

There are no windows anywhere in the unit, except for the door. The bedroom contains two doors, one to the main living room (with the door opening to outside), and another door that is locked to what I can only assume to be a maintenance closet.

Is this a building code violation? Additionally, I moved into the property with several other issues such as the smoke alarms not even being hooked up or containing a battery. Is having no windows/ only a single exit a violation for living spaces? If so, what should I do?"

I only have a Bachelor's in Math with very few programming classes. I can't take algorithms as a non degree seeking student for another 8 months. I have no programming internships. I am just starting to make personal projects and only have 500 lines of finally decent code written.

A job takes up 40 to 50 hours that I do not want to waste unless I am working as a programmer or data analyst. I am currently living with my parents. Do I take the first job that falls in my lap, regardless of quality even if it encourages bad practices, or do I stay unemployed living with my parents until I get entry level certifications in AWS / Associate Project Management / Lean Six Sigma, build my github portfolio better, and take more CS courses / get better at high quality technical interviews....so I can get a better first job even if I am unemployed another 6 to 12 months living with my parents?

I made an entirely new account to post this in efforts of staying anonymous. My best friend, who we can call John for privacy, has been struggling with anxiety and depression for years now. However, this year, these struggles have finally seemed to consume him.

John and I had met back in 7th grade and have been friends/acquaintances ever since. We were never really close until July 2018 where we started becoming close. At the end of August 2018 we had a falling out and didn't talk until the end of October 2018. Ever since then, we have become super close and he is my best friend. We are always there for each other, talk on a daily basis, hang out very often, support each other in any way needed, and my friendship with him is extremely important to me.

In January 2018, when me and John were not friends, he had tried weed for the first time. He claims that this had been an amazing experience and I believe this has been a gateway to other drugs. Ever since then, John has reverted to drugs in times of depression. It is very common for him to ask me if he can get high when he is sad or down. I of course tell him to instead talk to me about it instead of just trying to escape reality. He has talked about overdosing on Xanax or other prescription drugs which he has easy access to. I have stopped him multiple times from doing so.

There are times where John is very happy to be alive. For instance, for his 18th birthday, I got him these polaroids of memories we had made together. Shortly after he had expressed how happy he was to be alive despite his previous thoughts of suicide. There are a few other times where he has expressed his happiness to be alive and it really made me feel happy because I thought he had reached a good place in life.

However, in the past few days, John has fallen into some sort of depression. I asked him today what was wrong, he said:

* He believes that he only has three friends (me and two other girls). I know this belief is not true. John is a very social person and he talks to many people. He can easily make conversation with just about anyone and has friends in all his classes. I reiterated to him that many people only have a few close friends who they can trust, and that these three friends are REAL friends which is something many people do not have. I also expressed to him that he has many other friends who may not close, but that he had tricked himself into believing that these aren't actually friends because they aren't close.
* He believes that he does not have anything going for him. This is not true as well. We are seniors in highschool. All of us are about to graduate and go off to college in order to build our futures. There is no reason why John should doubt himself based on where he is now. He has A LOT of time to grow skills and fulfill his potential.
* He believes that he lets people use him. Yes, this is true. A lot of people have taken advantage of John and it has taken a big toll on him. Recently, John realized this girl had been using him. He said through a text, ""how \[could\] someone i was so close too just \[use\] me now"". I told John to stop being friends with this girl and that he had to learn from his experiences to prevent being used in the future. I told him how I was used a lot throughout the years, and that I still am today sometimes, but that I learn from it and not let it happen to myself in the future.

Today, John said, 

&gt;\&gt;i genuinely want to be dead lol   
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;i don’t like being alive   
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;i try so hard to be happy but every moment of happiness is temporary

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the entire day, John told me he has been having suicidal thoughts. I am going to go to his house tomorrow to comfort him. However, I am truly scared and concerned for his safety. I want to make him feel better and realize his self worth. I have contacted some of my contacts in the tech industry and have arranged for John to get an internship to make him maybe feel worthy of something. John has a psychologist, but he has not gone to her for a month or so. He currently takes Zolofot, this anti-depressant his psychiatrist prescribed him. This causes him to have mood swings and ""weird moods"" as he calls it.

I wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience where their friend was suicidal, and what they did to make them feel better. I am particularly looking for help on how I can make him improve his image of himself, and how I can make John become happy again. Thanks."

The program will be ending in about 3 weeks and they gave me an offer to go to the San Francisco branch. They offered $5200/month salary before taxes for the first 4 months and then get an increase to $5,720/month.  They also will give me a $5000 relocation lump sum for the move.  This position is in sales so when i asked if there was anyway to be given a higher offer, the director's argument was that i don't have enough experience and that my commission will easily put me closer to 6-figures. I have no doubt that i can make a lot of money eventually but my concern is the first 6 to 8 months where i wont be making a lot of commission and i wont have enough to live. I know SF is the most expensive place to live in the United States. I haven't done the math but what they are offering me does not sound like a living wage.

I told the director that i will think about it and get back to him in a week. So my question is what options do i have to get a little most pay? I'm fresh out of college so i'm not sure what my arguments are other than SF is so expensive. My friend suggested that i ask for a contingent pay for the first 6 months, an additional $2000 per month until my commission is stabilized.

Any help would be helpful, cuz i don't know what my option are anymore and i feel like im being forced to take it."

Also, I’m a little worried about my ECs this summer before senior year. I’m going to a few camps (summer seminar at the naval academy, boys state, and engineering at UIUC) but they are pretty disjointed.

I lost my wallet and passport like a few months ago in one week on different occasions, and I applied for replacing my passport two or three weeks ago. It might arrive in time, and if not, then I got screwed.

The point is, I applied for a birth certificate through vitalchek (NY state refers me to there). I heard receipt for birth certificate can count as list C (I have home state ID, so list B wouldn't matter). However, on the receipt, it didn't specify whether it's for replacement or not (USCIS clearly states that a receipt showing that a person has applied for an initial birth certificate is unacceptable.)

I will visit social security office near my apartment, and I'm trying to replace it. Hopefully, I can get temporary one, too. Would temp. social security card work?"

This summer, I have an internship across the country (~2,000 miles from home) and despite the fact that I’m super excited for it - it’s at a really great company for the field of study that I’m in, and I think it’ll be good for me to finally have a living-on-my-own experience - I’m also really nervous and afraid of being far away from my family for 11 weeks. My parents and I are really close, and I can tell my mom is afraid of me leaving for a while too, as I’m the baby of the family. May be a bit of empty nest syndrome as I’m the only kid left living at/near home. My brother moved out of the country for a job nearly a year ago and she’s still upset he’s not nearby. 

On that note, I have a few questions:
1) Is it okay to be so nervous or is it silly of me to worry about missing my family so much? I’ll be rooming with another intern, so it’ll be cool to live with someone for the first time. I’m just worried about getting super homesick.
2) For those of you who have relocated for internships, what should I take? They’ll be (partially) subsidizing housing for all out-of-state interns, and the apartments are fully furnished. I still want to be thoughtful about what I’ll actually need to take v.s. what I want to take. Any advice there helps!
3) Any other tips/advice anyone has to give in general regarding the situation is super appreciated. Sorry I’m a baby (lol).

I've just finished University and have some decent qualifications in Computing as well as a decent portfolio of work I've done over my time studying. My qualifications are (sorry if these terms are confusing, I don't really know how these levels translate outside of UK/Scotland): 

HND in Software Development with an A Grade
BSc Honours Degree in Computing (2-1)

Looking at the jobs in my city (not possible to relocate because of personal life issues) it seems like I still barely have any of the requirements any jobs. Not that I expected to have everything right away, but I feel like even graduate/trainee jobs want more of me than I've learned. Part of this is because of the course route I've taken, which isn't traditional 4 years in university. 

I went through 2 years of college for my HND, then did the 3rd and 4th year of the Computing course for my Honours. This may well be the case for everyone, but I feel I don't know anything well enough to call myself a 'specialist'. My course sort of took me across a tonne of languages, environments and concepts without making me feel confident in any of it. I've got good grades on most stuff, and I feel like I have a broad knowledge of subjects because of my course, but I'm very aware that anyone who is specialised in any of the subjects I know will make me look stupid by comparison. 

I suppose my questions are really: Am I undervaluing my knowledge?

Is it frowned upon to use coursework as portfolio pieces?

Should I specialise before having any real experience in a software work environment?

Sorry if this is very text heavy or difficult to read, but just somewhat overwhelmed with trying to get a foot in the door. Applying for internships, trying to perfect my resume, optimising my portfolio. So much to do without being sure I'm doing it correctly. I'm very admittedly not life-smart when it comes to stuff like employment, come from a poorer background so I'm sort've just happy to get anything though I realise I should probably value myself more.

Initially was a CE major in school, had a less than stellar internship experience (did well, just not the best work environment), ended up switching to another engineering degree. Fast forward about 7 years, I have a decent job that is stable and pays well, but I have been thinking more and more that I didn't give CE/CS a fair chance, as I am the IT guru in my group at work and really miss the feeling of creating something new via code. Been trying to get back into programming as a hobby first (~2-3 hours per day) while keeping my full time job, with the intention that I will over time develop my skills and confidence to a point where I can make a career switch. 

TLDR; heres the main question - how would you recommend moving from basics courses/small tasks to larger projects? 

Seems like most people recommend working on projects as a great way to practice and expand knowledge, but I struggle since most of the projects I am interested in doing are overwhelming compared to the tasks I have been doing on edabit,etc.

I also did an internship here as an undergrad and they begged me to come back. It is a startup going through extremely rapid growth (several hundred employees at this point). While working here I've had 2 positive performance reviews coupled with 2 significant raises, so I assumed I was doing well. The most recent raise was about 3 months ago.

Recently, my boss pulled me aside and told me I ""wasn't really doing any engineering"", and that I wasn't working fast enough. He told me that I also need to do more simulation and modeling, testing, high level design, firmware integration, supply chain, take on more leadership of projects, and that I need to volunteer for more tasks at our daily stand-ups.

Basically, I felt like he was vaguely listing several jobs worth of expectations, and as  a young entry level engineer, I'm feeling super overwhelmed. He has scheduled a meeting for Friday (one week after this deluge of criticism) to see what progress I've made in all of these categories.

I get the feeling that there is a case being set up to fire me, but I don't know for sure. I've already started applying to new jobs, but that takes time. Should I consider quitting before I get fired, or would that be a huge red flag for applying anywhere else? Is that better or worse than getting fired?

Bonus info: my stock options begin to vest at the 1 year mark, and that is in 2 weeks. I kind of suspect they're trying to get rid of me before then.

Any advice is welcome, even if it's just to tell me that I'm being overly paranoid/crazy

Is it hard to juggle both? I'm not really worried of the academic rigor, more of how hard it is to do both, and do both well.

Literally any insight, discussion or criticism is welcome, Im just trying to choose the best path for myself.

I'm 30 and with no money in the bank, do u think I can do it?",Deboss_Reddit,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/brcxib/graduated_in_law_with_a_sad_underpayed_job/,"Hello, I write here cause I'd like some guidance. I'm 30 from South-Italy, here I graduated in Law and I'm working part-time since i was 28, for like 550-650 $ less then 5$h/r. I'm doing a practice to become Lawyer in the afternoon wich is not payed. I should do the exam to become lawyer in december. 

But I'm sad. I've realized that I dont like what I'm doing since at least 18 month but for me It's hard to change it cause:

a) My family puts a lot of pressure over the idea that I need to become lawyer cause my grandfather was(!) and cause I'm allready 30y and have invested many years in this field.

b) Having such a small income I dont feel like I have money to try and start something new over;

&amp;#x200B;

But as I was saying I'm unhappy right now. I dont see myself going in a better direction, so researching a possible new career  path, I started some programming course online and with a friend who allready works in the industry I worked on doing my first small project and I liked it

So I started to think that I could try and have some sort of education to pivot my life and so I found a course 2y long ( one studing, one doing an internship) in Madrid, Spain.

Its a course on App Developing for Mobile and Web, the fact is that it's like 7.5k € for year that I dont have, plus I need to move to Madrid (my GF is from there so that may help a bit).

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the school, did the interview and talked with some of the people working there, but now I have to take the decision. It starts in september.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know if it's crazy to think about asking a loan to start a project on a new career at 30y old. I dont know if its crazy to leave what I have to follow a dream of doing a job that I can like more and that I can do around the world.

Ok, maybe I think that it may be worth but I'm so scared about having a debt and changing totaly my career.

What do u redditors think? I ask your guidance"

Is there a specific way to approach a company to ask for an internship? And most importantly where should I be looking?

Acceptance rate for the Class of 2023 was 14% and I’m sure regular decision was slightly lower. What do you guys think my chances are, and what suggestions do you have for improvements I could make in the next few months before I apply?

About Me:
-White male from Oklahoma
-Upper-middle class background
-I attend what has been ranked by some as the best public school in the state (not that Oklahoma has great public schools 😂)
-I currently intend to major in Accounting with a double minor in Finance and International Business

Academics:
-36 ACT(36 all sub-scores, 11 writing), 1530 SAT (800 M, 730 EBRW), 1490 PSAT (740 M, 750 EBRW)
-Will be National Merit Semifinalist come September and most likely Finalist
-I anticipate being an AP Scholar with Distinction once I receive this year’s scores in July
-3.88/4.35 GPA (UW/W)
—Class rank: 5th or 6th out of 90something (don’t have exact numbers sorry)
-AP Tests: 
—10th: Euro (3)
—11th: Chem, APUSH, Calc AB, Lang, Spanish Lang
—12th: Will take Physics I, US Gov, Stat, Lit, Spanish Lit, Psych (wish I could take Micro and Macro, but school doesn’t offer it and independent study has not gone well for me when I’ve done it for other classes in the past)

Employment and volunteer experience:
-Shift Manager at Auntie Anne’s (June 2017-Present)
-Cart Barn at Lincoln Park Golf Course (March 2019-Present)
—Lowkey I only work there so I get free golf
-Approx. 100 hours volunteer experience throughout high school with a bunch of different organizations (wish I had a good amount of hours with one specific organization but nope)

Extracurriculars:
-Golf
—Since 2012
—Started and organized Varsity golf team at my school as it had been discontinued a few years prior (9th-Pres)
—3x Varsity Letter
—4x Athlete of the Week
—2019 4A State Championship Qualifier
—No outstanding tournament results, I’m not one of the best in the state or anything
—Involved in The First Tee (teaching underprivileged kids golf)
-Selected to attend Foundation for Teaching Economics — Economics for Leaders summer program at WashU (July 2019)
-National Honor Society (10th-Pres)
—Elected to office of treasurer for next year
-Academic Bowl (10th)
-Passionate side hobby of meteorology but I hate labs too much to do a STEM major like that
-Fluent in Spanish
-Haven’t started a business or done any cool internships or research projects

Awards n shit:
-AP Scholar w/ Distinction and National Merit (Semi)finalist as already mentioned
-Outstanding Spanish IV Student (11th)
-National Honor Society Treasurer next year (as already mentioned)
-Special Commendation as Student Asst. Golf Coach (10th)

-10x (and counting) Principal’s Honor Roll (3.0+ GPA) (9th-Pres)
-3x Varsity golf letter and 4x athlete of the week (as already mentioned)

Strengths and weaknesses (in my opinion)

Strengths:
-Test scores
-Grades aren’t perfect but they won’t hold me back from acceptance
-Will be attending economics summer program at WashU (demonstrates interest)
-Higher socioeconomic background, as WashU (unfortunately, in my opinion) has a need-based admissions process

Weaknesses:
-Less volunteer hours than many elite school applicants and I’m not committed to or super passionate about any specific organization as many applicants are
-AP scores (I anticipate having an average score of between 3.5 and 4 but I have no clue yet of course, which isn’t terrible but there are a lot of people who are getting all 4s and 5s)
-No SAT Subject Tests (Not required for WashU but they would probably help; I won’t be taking any because I feel like my scores wouldn’t be very good and might detract from my application)
-No super unique extracurriculars that seem to be necessary nowadays to gain entry into elite schools (i.e. starting a business, doing a major-specific internship, doing a research project with some professor)
-Not super involved with my school either (not many volunteer hours with the school itself, not in StuCo or anything, I’m not the president of any clubs)


Thank you guys so much for any feedback you can give, it’s always good to hear an outsider’s perspective because I am obviously biased both towards and against myself (depending on the day 😂). Sorry if this is a lot of reading too, I’m on mobile so it’s hard for me to gauge exactly how much information I put on here.

Edit: Forgot to mention Rec Letters and application essays. My rec letters will probably be good but not spectacular as there are no teachers I’m super close with. Not feeling super confident about my writing skills for application essays but I have a few months to draft and revise them so hopefully that won’t be a weakness.

bre21k,32,2019-05-21,Tips for ICS Students,emerald_jungle,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/bre21k/tips_for_ics_students/,"I've seen a lot of people talking about internships, jobs, not having a social life and getting good grades, or having a social life and failing classes, etc. There's a lot to take in when you first come in to college, so here are a few tips! 

&amp;#x200B;

1. START INTERVIEWING RIGHT NOW. In my freshman year, I went to every single career fair with my resume, and talked to recruiters. Although I may not have had that many skills, it didn't matter. I still got valuable experience - I learned how to talk to interviewers. Why wait until your second, third, or fourth year to learn how to interview? Start your freshman year when the stakes are low! And who knows, there's always a small chance that you may get lucky and snag a great internship your first year! 
2. APPLY EARLY. There's tons of internships that take applications in the fall. Don't wait until winter! Personally, I started applying in September and I didn't stop until December, when I finally secured one. Freshman year - I applied to 37 spots, only got into 4. This year, I applied to about 28, and I got 2. 
3. ACTUALLY STUDY. My internship for this summer, I got it because I actually paid attention and learned in class. Yeah, you can show up and just cram and get that A, but when you actually need to apply those skills, or when you start learning advanced concepts that build upon previous ones, if you have a shaky foundation, you won't do well. 
4. CHECK YOURSELF BEFORE YOU WRECK YOURSELF. Honestly, A+ advice. If you try to do research, 20 units, a sport, a side project, a personal project, etc. etc. all at once, and you can't handle it, you'll fail at them all. But if you maybe drop one or two things and really give 110% to all your projects, you'll get much better results. Would you rather have 6 cakes that are bland and look sloppily put together? Or would you rather have 3 cakes that look and taste amazing? Work smart, not hard. 
5. ASK QUESTIONS / FIND A MENTOR. It's extremely useful to have an older student to talk to. I found a junior who helped answer a lot of basic questions I had, and she helped me figure out what I wanted to do, and she pushed me to work harder because she herself was working so hard. It's invaluable to have someone who's recently been through what you are going through right now. They have advice that will work, because they were literally just in your shoes a year or two ago. 
6. NETWORK. Don't ever think of someone as useless. In high school I was lucky enough to volunteer at a tech company, and my boss didn't seem super useful as a resource. I would always talk to my boss's boss, and I was just polite with my boss, I didn't make too much of an effort to get to know her. But guess what? When it came time for me to get a letter of recommendation, my boss was the one was the one who wrote them, and she went above and beyond - the letter was extremely detailed and perfect in every way. She put in immense time and effort to help me succeed. I got a research position the next year, and the professor actually mentioned my boss, and said that she had written and said great things about me and that was part of the reason they were willing to take on a freshman. There are always people willing to help you, so don't treat them as if they're useless. No one is. 
7. ENJOY COLLEGE. While this seems cliche, it's true. College is a time for exploration. Work hard and set yourself up for the future. But that includes letting yourself explore the world a little. If you fail a test here and there or stressed about something for days to the point where it's affecting your health, it's OKAY to take a break. It's OKAY to ask for help. Because ultimately, this is your life. I'm not saying slack off all the time and say its for ""self-care"", I'm saying work smart and hard for a majority of the time, but don't be afraid to go out and have fun every once in a while. When you look back on your days at college, you should be able to think ""I worked hard and I'm proud of what I accomplished, I don't have any regrets that I slacked off."" as well as ""Wow I had some awesome times at college, I'll never forget them."" 

I hope this helps!"

So my councilor kept up bring up stats and numbers saying that I should “explore” other options. I told him that my EC’s more than make up for my grades, but he said that to even be considered I needed to do better grade wise. So here’s some background information on me. I’m a first gen, low income, Pakistani Male. I live with my single father and my grandma (who’s very sick and with high medical bills). He works as a gas station  employee and I also work there part  time as a janitor, and I also take count of inventory and go out and buy stuff when we need. Note: he doesn’t own the gas station he just works there. I’ve been working there every summer since freshman year and even work after school sometimes to support financially. I also don’t go out on weekends bc I have to look after my grandma. 
Here’s some stats abt me bc apparently numbers mean a lotttt😒. I had a 3.9 freshman year, 4.1 sophomore year, and 4.5 junior year. My SAT is absolutely ass  (1300) bc I took it while I had the flu. I only took it once btw and will take it again in June. A lot of the EC’s I do are related to my major and interests. I’ve been to many Model UN conferences since freshman year (especially college level ones) and have received an award at almost every single conference I’ve attended. I’ve stated an amnesty international club at my school this year and have raised close to a 1000$ for Syrian refugees. I have also volunteered 500+ hours with the a human rights related ngo. I’m also working on a project with a $25,000 budget. I’m one of the ppl that came up with the idea and have been involved throughout the entire process (this is outside of school). It’s an arts based project focused on raising awareness for South Americans who are being oppressed by their governments. Im also in the the coding club and have helped put on Hackathon’s for the past few years. There I handle a $4000 budget for my section of work. I’m also in the Economics club and I have finished top 10 out of 600 people playing the stock market game. I’m also in all the honor societies: (which I don’t care abt and probably won’t mention to colleges.) 
I also play varsity soccer since freshman year. I and play club soccer year round. 
I’m looking to study international relations and/or global health in college. I’m looking at all the best: Columbia, Georgetown, UPenn, etc. and other T-20s. I also have 3 safeties and a couple “mediocre” schools in mind. My councilor told me to only apply to my safeties one or two reach schools, and the rest: “mediocre school. I have no problem in applying to less prestigious school, but I’m not applying based on the names. I’m applying bc of the opportunities, locations (bc I want to do internships while I’m in college) and bc of specific programs. I’ve worked hard my entire academic career, and want to shoot my shot. Ik the process is random, but can my councilor actually stop me from applying to like 20 schools? I don’t mind writing the essays, I’ve got the summer and have already written 7 decent ones.

Edit: all the EC’s I’ve been doing are since freshman year except for: South American Project, Honor societies (math, science-treasurer, history, Spanish, and NHS) and amnesty international

Edit 2: we talked again, and he said he doesn’t want me to be disappointed and it’s ok to shoot my shot and he’ll support me no matter what :  )"
brgsx2,69,2019-05-21,"Got $108,000 Offer 2 Months After Graduating",YttriumSniper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/brgsx2/got_108000_offer_2_months_after_graduating/,"/r/cscareerquestions has been a great resource for me. I would like to contribute back my experience hoping to help someone land their dream job.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my B.A. in computer science. I didn't have any internships or job experience going into my 4th year at uni. I applied to tons of places and got a couple online interviews, but they never turned out. One day I went to a mini career fair (4-5) companies, and talked with a simulation company that uses Unity. I wasn't very excited about it, but it just turned out that my resume had tons of Unity development on it and one of the recruiters was an old classmate. So that got me an interview which consisted of 4 leetcode EASY-MED level problems. I got offered for 24/hr part time, with a contract to go full time when I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at the time of that first interview I was taking a class that focused on solving Competitive Programming Type problems. It was a great experience for preparing for any tech interview. Time pressure, Math &amp; Algo, Data Structure, etc... I would HIGHLY suggest if your uni offers a class like that as an elective, DO take it. Do your research, because I didn't know the class existed until I heard from a friend in a random conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to graduation and I got my full time employment with the simulation company, and then I got a referral from a friend working at Amazon. They have a student program for graduates within a year of graduating. Once I got the referral, I did Leetcode like crazy. I did about 30-50 medium problems and about 5-10 hard problems. Also this next piece of advice/resource I don't see enough on here, and I would say was essential to my interview success. [Pramp.com](https://Pramp.com) I did about 10 mock interviews the week leading up to my Amazon interview. This gave me the confidence to explain my solution to another person while under pressure. And it's free! Check it out if you haven't already. Also because my Amazon interview was all virtual, [Pramp.com](https://Pramp.com) pretty much was the exact experience as my actual interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Amazon's online virtual interview was about 35% behavioral, so I went through their leadership principles and wrote down two experiences for each that demonstrated how I had that principle, and I would just start sharing that in the interview, even if he/she didn't ask about it. I believe you should not be passive, and need to just start talking. I used to just sit back and be silent like my skill would talk for itself, but in interview that does not work.

&amp;#x200B;

The other 65% was technical, it was two Leetcode HARD problems and 1 MED. All questions were in the top 10 of sorted by frequency for Amazon. Which I did not even see before my interview...

brh1nt,3,2019-05-21,New job regret. Where to go from here?,PM_ME_UR_UPTIME,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/brh1nt/new_job_regret_where_to_go_from_here/,"i left a helpdesk job that i worked my way up from L1 to L3 for an internal sysadmin job at a new company. was promised the world and back. paid a whole lot better than what i was making so of course lil ol me accepted ready to hit the ground running.

if its too good to be true, it probably is because 6 months in i am doing stuff i was doing when i was an intern. due to the nature of the place i really can't get into specifically why it sucks other than the work environment and my team where there is no guidance, no mentorship, and no comradery. i feel like i've developed imposter syndrome despite having a couple years experience because there was no training.

i am disappointed. i was ready to learn and soak it all up. i was so excited to get an internal role and was looking forward to getting more involved in infrastructure, but here i am troubleshooting Phyllis from accounting's crusty old computer. nothing against you Phyllis but i was trying to move past this bullshit.

no benefits until a few more weeks meaning i can't event take PTO to interview for another job. not in any financial position to be out of work.

feel like this looks awful on a resume. is this a resume killer? how do i proceed? how would i even begin to explain this? also if anyone else has been in a similar situation please share your experience.

thanks y'all."

I live in India and plan on applying to Europe/US colleges, at the time of choosing my bachelor's degree, i wasnt sure which field to pursue and so i chose to pursue Biotechnology from a good university as the cut-off for CS was way too high(I did not want to take a gap year and wasnt sure about my interest in CS)

That was in 2015, fast forward 4 years and I am graduating this month and want to pursue a master's in CS down the line. 

I pursued CS electives as well as alot of projects during my undergrad including an Internship as a software developer which led to a good job offer as well where I'll be working as a full time Employee from August.

My GPA in biology related subjects is quite low(~2.5)
Whereas in Math and Computer Science related subjects it's around 3.7

My GRE Score is 331

I have taken the basic courses of math, programming, Algorithms design analysis, Data Structures, Database Management Systems, Computer Networking, Intoduction to Robotic Systems, Probability, Computational Biology. All these were University offered electives and I have much better grades in these and was the course topper in ADA and Comp. Bio. 
I also have letters of recommendations from my professors of Computational Biology as well as my thesis  mentor.

I have done a few small projects in front end development and back end development and have a pretty good extra curricular profile(Leadership roles, clubs, had my own start up, etc)

Now I am not sure about pursuing a masters yet. Since I dont have a particular field of interest yet and wanted to work for a couple of years and then maybe apply. I am sure that I do not want to pursue biology ahead and would want to go into a Core CS field.

I wanted to know what are my options, given my low GPA and Non-CS background. Do I even have a chance at any good universities? What should I do if I want to pursue a masters a year or two from now and what would your advice be for me? 

I would be really grateful for some help! Thank you!"

brisg4,5,2019-05-21,How to get over my social anxiety when it is holding me back from finding a job?,crazycraftylady,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/brisg4/how_to_get_over_my_social_anxiety_when_it_is/,"I am 23 years old, in my senior year of college, pursuring a degree in communication with no plan in sight. I am freaking out and I know I'm not having a mid-life crisis but it is definitely a crisis of sorts. Instead of looking forward to graduation, I am dreading it. 

I have debilitating social anxiety and have been unable to find anything to help it. I have tried so many prescriptions and just gave up on finding help because of how disappointing my experience was. I also just don't have a means to get the help I need anymore. 

I am deathly afraid of the thought of interviewing, meeting new people, learning new things in a job, and looking stupid/feeling lost. I know I have to get over it but just the thought of it feels like I am about to die. I can't explain it. 

Although I have pretty bad anxiety, I have always managed to push through it when I **REALLY** **have** to do something. Like I never thought I would ever get my driver's license or even take the driving test but I did when I was 20 and I eventually passed. However, I don't drive anymore. I also managed to get a restarant job and managed to fake it til I made it. I know I can get things done when I **HAVE** to, but it is so difficult for me with this damn social anxiety/phobia. The latest thing I did was get an online tutoring job and I was proud of myself in getting it because it involved a phone interview. I took classes on campus and even though it made me feel sickly anxious and horrible, I did it because I felt I had to.

My bf just landed an internship, and ever since he got it, he has been pushing the idea on me to work at the same company because it would be good experience for me. Honestly, I have no interest in the company, because it is a music company, but it does offer copy editing/copy writing internships. I am too afraid to work there also because of how big it is (15,000 workers). I am wanting to find a remote job for the time being because I feel it's just the only way I can feel comfortable.

Anxiety aside, my dream job would be working as a writer/editor for a magazine or blog of sorts. I just have no idea how to get my foot in the door or how to land a type of job like this when my anxiety holds me back so much.

**TL;DR: Does anyone have any advice in finding a job/what I should be doing in the meantime to manage my anxiety and work my way up into finding a job?**"

brkhfy,1,2019-05-22,What am I doing wrong?,agentdumb-bitch,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/brkhfy/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,"200+ job applications in the past few years and I can't even get an interview. I usually don't even get a formal rejection, just ignored and pushed aside. I call after 2 weeks, usually no answer so I leave a message, or if they do answer it's always 'the hiring manager isn't in right now,but  I'll let them know you called' or whatever. I've had successful friends and family overlook my resume and cover letters many times, and they've only ever made very minor notes or could find nothing at all they would change. They genuinely cant find anything wrong with it. I've applied to a wide variety of jobs, and my only stipulation is I can't do anything too physical because of chronic pain (I don't mention that in applications, of course, I just avoid applying to jobs where I think that would be a problem).

I'm 20M, going into my last year of college, and have a decent amount of unpaid/volunteer work and experience on my resume as well as one work study job (which I only got because the boss had been /begging/ someone to do it for over 2 months and I was the only person who showed any interest). 

This whole situation is taking a serious toll on my mental health. I already have suicidal ideations that are just getting so much worse the longer this goes on. It's so humiliating to watch all your friends get great jobs and internships left and right doing things they actually want to do while your inbox is just filled with auto-rejections from everything from generic retail giants to specific opportunities that I have years of experience and passion backing me up. I can't take it. I want to feel happy for people I care about getting what they wanted, and I do congratulate and support them, but really I just keep getting reminded how much of a failure I am. School is out for the summer now and my 5 closest friends all got jobs/paid internships and I'm stuck at my parents' house with nothing to do. 

I just can't for the life of me figure out what I'm doing wrong and I'm honestly so sick of trying just to be disappointed.



tl;dr 20M, I'm doing everything I've been told is the right way to go about getting a job but it's been years, I've never succeeded, and it's making me suicidal"
brks8a,5,2019-05-22,Things i plan to do for the 9 months before i start uni next year.,Dem_beatz123,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/brks8a/things_i_plan_to_do_for_the_9_months_before_i/,"Hi there, I'm writing this mainly for myself to look at over the next few months but I hope it also inspires some of you to take up some new hobbies or these ones.

Architectural portfolio (what I'll be doing at uni) - I need to produce a portfolio of a few concept pages to show my abilities in drawing, designing the building and page and my process. I plan to use lots of different media like pen, pencil, felt, markers, paint and 3d models to portray these.

Drivers license - I'm currently 19 and in my country I'm classified as a learner driver, i can drive but only with someone supervising me. I plan to get the next stage so I can drive on my own wherever I need to go.

Painting - I'm currently a developing artist, I do it in my spare time as a hobby, and I want to improve every second. Painting has always been a burden, I can draw but I can't paint for s***. But drawing people and figures used to be a fear and im doing pretty well with that. I want to face another artistic fear.

Fitness - I've just left the military and fitness has now become more important than ever to me. I love it, I sometimes crave it, and I sometimes can't get by without it, I want to do some form of exercise every day, whether it's pressups, pullups, going for a run, whatever as long as I'm doing something every day. I'm planning to set up a monthly schedule for myself, this is not a specialised program altho i may switch to this later to gain some muscle, for now I just wanna maintain the fitness I built up over the year.

Learn to fight (boxing/street fighting/martial arts) - ive never had the ability to fight, I tend to try and stay away from them but one day it will bite me and I won't have any way to protect myself or the people around me that I care about. I have a friend who's running boxing lessons for free right now trying to build a name for himself. This is the only connection I have so far, but i will find more.

Internship at an architectural firm - this one is important to me because I want to start gaining the experience I need for the future as an architect. Experience is everything, good marks mean nothing without it.

Personal portfolio/architectural project - I want to do a personal architectural project to regain the knowledge I learnt in high school graphic design, this will prepare me for uni but I also find it really cool.

Finding an art group or joining art classes - art has now become my main hobby, i want to integrate myself into a community full of artists to improve myself, make new friends and surround myself with people I want to be around. This is very important to me and I feel it will make me very happy.

Sell a piece of artwork - I've always wanted to sell some of my work but I feel I'm not good enough yet. I want to show myself it's possible and the feeling you get if you sell your work and get money in return is amazing, especially if you're getting paid to enjoy yourself!

Learn to cook more dishes - I currently know how to cook a few - spaghetti bolagnaise, poached, scrambled eggs or an omelet, various other egg dishes, potato dishes,stir fry - pretty much the basic stuff. I want to get deeper into it and it will also go a long way in improving my diet.

Learn the guitar - I'm artistically driven, I have an interest in all arts, I love listening to music and the guitar, drums and piano have always interested me. Unfortunately drums and pianos are hella expensive... But the guitar is an extremely basic/good to start and very flexible/versatile instrument. This is not an immediate goal, it's a more back of my mind goal.

These are the goals I have made myself. I will be ticking off as I go, even adding goals along the way. Hopefully I will come out an amazing person after this year!"
brkwlt,1,2019-05-22,"Summer Engineering Internships between Bachelor's and Master's, will my options be more limited?",personizzle,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/brkwlt/summer_engineering_internships_between_bachelors/,"At the moment, it's looking like there's a good chance I'll be completing my Bachelor's degree this coming spring, followed by enrolling, most likely at the same school, to pursue a Master's within a sub-discipline of my major. At the time of graduation, the primary black marks on my resume will be being a bit older than normal for this phase of an academic career, so-so GPA (above the magic 3.0, but not by much), and more importantly, complete lack of professional internship experience relevant to my major/desired career path, as the GPA situation was a lot worse in prior years which largely intimidated me out of trying and falling back on guaranteed opportunities below my pay grade. I'm now realizing that was a huge mistake, and really want to get as much internship experience under my belt as possible before properly entering the workforce, as it seems to be pretty much expected at a lot of the places I'd really like to work. 

My question is, how accessible are engineering internships to students who are between degrees? It seems like tons of these positions have language along the lines of ""Must be currently enrolled in a degree program from an accredited college or university"" or specific year requirements in their job descriptions. Can I apply to pretty much any internship looking for undergraduate students, or am I going to be rejected from the get-go at a lot of places? What's my best approach for finding such a thing?"
brky2m,15,2019-05-22,Learning to code for the wrong reason,digihammerguy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/brky2m/learning_to_code_for_the_wrong_reason/,"I recently got a internship as a web developer about a month ago. My job consist of building custom WordPress themes and plugins for a small media agency. As new interns came in they quickly realized I knew a lot about code and came to me for almost everything relating to the job and web development. But just last week as I was sitting at my desk working on a theme I realized..... I really don't like web development. 

I thought I was feeling like this because I was working with WordPress and not using a cool framework like Laravel, Rails, or Django. So I went home to start my own project using php and Laravel. After a few hours it hit me.... I FREAKING HATE WEB DEVELOPMENT....


Sitting there, I started thinking about why the hell did I start learning how to code in the first place?

I remember I always wanted to build dynamic levels in  games.

So then what brought me to pursue a path to become a web developer?

The simple answer is I let the internet and social media dictate what I should do with my life rather than exploring on my own. Everywhere I looked everyone was talking about how easy and SAFE it is to become a Web Developer. Or how stable a web development career is. I figured since it's SAFE and I needed the money, I'll just learn it and move to something else later. But this led to me battling within myself every time it was time to build a site. My friends would be amazed with all of the cool sites I built but all I saw were some stupid web pages that I went through hell to build only to still be left feeling empty inside. 

 I was following the mass and I regret wasting so many years fighting within myself hoping that the better I got the more I would like it. But in reality, the better I got the more I didn't care about developing websites. 

I'm not sure if I'm going to finish out my internship. But one thing is for sure, I'm going to start listening to myself when I comes to following my own path.

brlkvb,5,2019-05-22,Chances For An International Gap Year Student,HTonmoy,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/brlkvb/chances_for_an_international_gap_year_student/," I've taken 2 gap years and I'm going to apply in Fall 2020. I should  mention that I will be needing almost full financial aid and I wish to  study Computer Science/Engineering. This is my profile:  
 

Academic:  
 

1. SAT 1: 1470 (projected)  
 2. SAT 2: Math II - 800, Physics - 780 (Already taken)  
 3. TOEFL: 110+ (projected)  
 4. GPA: We have a really different system in our country, it’d be  tedious to explain the whole process here. I got 5.00 out of 5.00 GPA  but it's calculated differently than it is in the USA.  
 

ECA:  
 

1. Started an online clothing business based on Facebook, with my  sister. It’s going strong with 6 employees and we plan to establish a  physical shop soon.  
 2. Interned at a Group of Industries in the position of Software Developer  
 3. Interned at an IT company in the position of Web Developer  
 These two internships will speak for my gap years.  
 4. Founded Computer Club and English Speaking Club in High School  
 5. Patrol Leader in High School Scouts  
 6. Student Counselor in High School  
 7. Every year, I along with a few of my friends organize  underprivileged/poor kids to teach them about computers and smartphones.  
 8. Every winter, I along with a few of my friends distribute warm cloths, blankets to homeless people.  
 Additionally, a couple minor ECAs.  
 

Recommendation Letters:  
 1. From my counselor who is also my Chemistry teacher  
 2. From my ICT teacher  
 3. From my English teacher  
 I am expecting some excellent letters, I have a very good relationship with them and they like me very much.  
 

Essays:  
 

1. About the business I mentioned earlier  
 2. About a unique scouts camp that I attended in my junior year  
 

As you can see, I have a so so profile and my requirement of financial  aid puts me in a disadvantages position. I have my eyes on the Ivy  League universities as they are usually need-blind but I don't think I  have any chance at those with this profile.

brllks,1,2019-05-22,Red flags on my resume are making it really difficult to find a job.,InanimateCarbonRod01,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/brllks/red_flags_on_my_resume_are_making_it_really/,"So here's some background information on my situation: I've had A LOT of difficulty finding a job since I graduated from college. So much so that after I graduated I was unemployed for a year and a half. I did eventually find something (though it was at a marketing company with a revolving door of employees and no required experience, so I'm not sure they cared either way), but I left that job 3 months ago and now I'm back to not being able to find anything. I'm wondering if having such a long period of time just being blank on my resume (and now having another building up after leaving my old job) is a red flag to employers that I'm too lazy to find work and thus would be too lazy to do any work if they hired me.

Another thing that worries me is the fact that I took 6 years to graduate college. This was because I changed my major after my sophomore year and thus had to stay there for an extra 2 years to complete my new major. But again, I'm worried that employers see on my applications that it took me 6 years to get through college instead of the usual 4 and think it's because I'm unintelligent.

Also, I'm bad at the skill I got my major in (graphic design), and I don't really have any other experience other than the job  at the marketing company (giving cellphones to people with low income) a and a job entering data into spreadsheets. All the graphic design stuff on my resume (including designing stuff for the social services company) is stuff I did in college, and not actual jobs. I just listed it because otherwise I would have nothing to put for design experience. I would like to be able to have a graphic design job, but I've applied for so many entry-level and internship positions for it and gotten nothing at all (it's been nearly 2 years since I had an interview for it) that I'm starting to give up on it. I'm in the process of revising my resume, and I'll probably have one for graphic design jobs and one for everything else.

Anyway, here's the basic text of my resume:

&amp;#x200B;

**PERSONAL SUMMARY:**

I am a very insightful and dedicated person who is easy to work with. I consider myself amicable, versatile, and adaptable. I am also very considerate and enjoy helping people, and tend to place others before myself. If hired, I will be a productive and valuable part of the company.

brlye0,0,2019-05-22,Take my internship offer or relax over the summer? [Junior UG],kfcregular,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/brlye0/take_my_internship_offer_or_relax_over_the_summer/,"I know this will sound really dumb to a lot of people, but I debating whether I should take my web development internship over the summer. I am a junior so it will be my last summer before I graduate and ofc its usually this time that students take internships. I honestly did not expect to get an internship offer this summer. I honestly just interviewed with this company to gain interview experience and I guess they were really desperate for interns since its so close to the summer right now. 

The thing is, I have a lot of friends from my hometown that are going to transferring from cc to their 4yr (and essentially moving) so it will be the last time I am going to spend time with them before they leave. My internship will be in a different city so I won’t be in town the whole summer. 

I understand that taking this internship will give me really good experience (and considering I am not the best of students, it will probably make my resume even better), but I keep thinking how I will have 40+ years of my life to work already. Why not enjoy my youth? Why not enjoy my last summer before graduating with my friends? Why work when I have the rest of my life for that and just enjoy my last summer having fun while it’s social acceptable at my age to do so? 

I understand how privileged I am to have an offer when so many students have trouble finding internships so I do want to sound like I am not grateful for this opportunity. I really am, but I think I’ve grown to value my time with the people I care about a lot more so I have this internal debate. 

Has anyone turned down an internship to enjoy themselves or just decided to enjoy their summer during their ug? Will this hurt me alot in the future? My recruiter give me an offer today so he wants an answer by tomorrow so any quick advice would be appreciated! Thanks!"

&amp;#x200B;

two months ago I signed on to an internship in the summer with a good firm and in a great role (at least for me). Now, sadly, I learned today that due to some special directive I will be forced to write my masters thesis over the summer months. Seeing that it will not be possible for em to complete the internship alongside my masters thesis, I have chosen to renege on the internship opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my question: How do I make this as nice as possible for my employer, so I don't ruin my own reputation. From a legal standpoint I can just quit anytime and there is nothing they can do about it, but I don't want to be remembered as ""that guy"". I am planning to call them tomorrow and explain the situation and maybe recommend one of my peers who is studying with me and who is searching for an internship as a replacement. Do you think this is okay? Will I be able to contact the company again after this or not?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your help and advice."

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently 3 years into a security analyst role at a small community hospital. I have a bachelors in computer science but this job is my first ""IT"" related job besides a summer internship. My job duties vary widely and I cover pretty much everything except for pentesting since we have a small security team. However, most days I'm bored out of my mind. I have stuff to do but it's usually not interesting to me (looking at SIEM logs, reviewing 3rd party questionnaires, attending bullshit meetings, responding to user requests to unblock software, etc..) The only times that I am not bored are when we have a malware incident and I have to do incident response (rare, maybe once a month), when I have to script something out to get a task done, or when I'm trying to solve a problem/troubleshoot something that nobody else can figure out. These times I get excited about work are about once or twice a month. I also enjoy being the go to security guy since a lot of people come to me with security questions. That being said I feel like a glorified sysadmin and feel like I have capped. I'm 3 years into security but I'm the go to guy and I don't know how good that is for career advancement. The pay also isn't great as it's a non-profit in a rural area (I'm about 25k below industry average and the only way I'll be getting a raise is if I get my CISSP.) I have a good relationship with my manager and he is always coming to me with new tasks and asking for advice on things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been considering joining the dev team here. I really enjoyed programming in college, and any time I get to script something I get really invested into it. I would be switching to salary and would have a chance to work from home in about a year. They mainly code in [VB.net](https://VB.net) here with some html/css/C#. I like everyone on the dev team, they are a cool group of guys. However, I have no idea what to expect or if I even will like enterprise development since it's so much different than coding projects in college.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: will making a move to development be career suicide from a security standpoint? I don't hate security, I just don't enjoy it where I'm at. I've tried applying for a ton of jobs but 1. most of them are an hour away and I can't do a commute like that right now and 2. the other ones are work from home and I think the only way I'd get a job like that is to have more experience and a CISSP. Should I just stick it out for a couple more years or make the career switch and take the risk of possibly not liking enterprise dev? Would I still be able to get my CISSP in 2 years if I switch and then maybe find a job elsewhere? I know this is a lot of questions but I'm at a loss of what to do and I don't really have anyone that can give me good advice."

bro9tz,53,2019-05-22,My application Journey - A year in review,ExpensiveTransition,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/bro9tz/my_application_journey_a_year_in_review/,"## Intro

So I finally paid my 2nd deposit and want to write about my year long MBA application journey in that some people might find it useful. 

Before we start, the stats:

* 27 Asian Male (International, Not Chinese)
* GMAT: 700
* Undergrad: Phsyics with good GPA - Ok university for my country
* Work Experience: 5 years (At matriculation) in tier 2 consulting in Asia, Europe, and the US focusing on analytics and insights 
* **Schools:** 
 
1.  LBS (Matriculating) 
1. Haas(Accepted) 
1. Duke (Accepted Half $)
1. Tuck (Invited to interview - Dinged)
1. Yale(Invited to interview - Withdrew)

## Summary of what I'd do differently

* Study for the GMAT super early. Assume you need to retake. The official practice tests are worth there weight in gold so use them sparingly.

* Apply to a range of schools. Admissions is a bit of a black box. Identify some reaches(where you might get in), targets(where you are likely to get in), Safety( where you might get $$).

* Talk to people. Current students are usually happy to talk with you. Bonus if you find someone from a similar background to you

* Think about your goals long and hard. Find a school that aligns with those and who you are as a person. If i'd known I'd be 100% sure on consulting i'd probably apply to kellogg instead of Haas. 

* Split applications across rounds. Essays are tiring as fuck. 



Alright now that thats done let me share my drunken ramblings  on the application process;

##GMAT
 
Gmat is a bitch. Its sucks and its expensive. I only really decided to go to Bschool in January last year (despite thinking about it the year prior). I delayed studying for the GMAT because I thought it would be easy. I've always been good at math (physics undergrad) and consider myself pretty good at comprehending large volumes of text. I was cocky and this was probably my biggest mistake. The GMAT is not like other tests and you need to learn the tricks. I studied studying seriously in April and took the test once in June, once in July, once in August. I was actually writing essays whilst simultaneously studying for it. The best score I got was 700, despite getting 730 and 740 on official practice tests 4 and 6.

**My advice;**    Start studying as early as possible (1 year if possible) . Give yourself time to retake. 

## R1 vs R2

I don't think there is much difference at all here. Apply when you are ready. Although MIT specifically says apply R1. I applied to all schools in R1

## Visit or Don't Visit.

The only school I visited I got dinged from. Make of that what you will. I don't think it has any material impact on admissions other than that it can help you decide where to apply.

## School Selection during application. 

As an international, I pretty much was gunning for T15 or LBS/ INSEAD at a minimum. These are the only schools I considered to apply to. I didn't know where to apply at the start so I went to every information session and made sure to speak to at least 1 current student and 1 alum from each T15 + LBS /INSEAD. This helped shape my view on where to research further. Below Ill give a quick overview of my school choice. 

* HSW  - Nothing needs to be said. Amazing schools but ruled out due to GMAT and work exp. 
* MIT:  I found the admissions director overly arrogant and condescending. Didn't click with any students/alumn but they were nice. Probably wouldn't have gotten in. Chose not to apply.
* Chicago: Spoke to 3 Current students who were all super arrogant and made out as if there time was priceless. Chose not to apply after that
* CBS - Didn't want to be in NYC.
* Kellogg - Liked the students and admin team. Worried about brand value overseas (at the time). Probably should have applied here
* Tuck - Loved the students and alumn. Admissions team was awesome. Good consulting / tech placements .  Tuck was my number 1 but unfortunately was dinged. 
* Haas - Similar to Tuck, got a great vibe from everyone. Like the International business and tech focus and strong brand in Asia.
* Duke - Initially only Applied because it was but later came to love the current students and alumn, team fuqua, solid consulting placements  etc
* Yale - Liked the name and students. Withdrew after interview because I absolutely bombed it and was ashamed.
* LBS - Like London. Strong asia / europe placement. Amazing consulting placement and liked the flexibility of the program
* INSEAD - Also amazing consulting placements but only 10 months. 
* Rest of T15 - Nothing really stood out to me but wish I'd applied to Darden or Ross as well.

 **Advice** Talk to as many current students / alumn as possible. I find each school as a certain 'type' of student that goes there. Find ones that you click with.  Most  current students will be happy to set up a chat. 

Apply to a range of schools ( I didn't). Euro schools are more gmat friendly but generally  require more international work exp / holistic application.

## Interviews

To be perfectly honest I don't think interviews are that important. All were super casual and focussed on getting to know you more. I absolutely killed my tuck interview and was certain I was getting in. I even flew to the US for it. Contrary, I didn't do that well in my Duke interview (didn't click with interviewer that well) but ended up with half scholarship. Not really sure what to make of this. 

**Advice** Know each school really well and why you want to go there eg,  I want to join clubs x,y and z and go to these events. I also want to hold event A. Show passion and why you want to attend each school and that you've done your homework. 

## School Selection - Where to matriculate

After gaining admission to LBS, Haas and Duke I had a pretty tough time on where to go. My goal during application was  consulting in Europe, Asia or ME or tech. After some reflection I decided I wanted to gun for strategy consulting. This led me to rule out Haas (Had I wanted to do tech this would have been a no brainer) . Even though Haas is a fantastic school, I couldn't justify it over half $$ at Duke. 

My final decision came down to Duke vs LBS. Ultimately this choice came down to where I wanted my network to be US vs Global network, Do I want a second internship, and most importantly, could Duke get me into a solid non US role or would I be playing second string to LBS/INSEAD.

Anyway, despite really getting along with Duke students and alum, I decided that LBS was probably a bit better suited to my goals."

I am working on the ""Cracking the coding interview"" book, taking practice problems on Hackerrank and some similar sites, working on coding projects, practicing answers to interview questions, sending out my resume. But between all those things I have to choose how much time to put in each. I see a lot of problems when I do actually go through applications processes, but I don't know which ones to focus on first.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm simply overwhelmed. I am highly motivated, but I am lost because the hiring process for these jobs just seems like a big mess. Does anyone has recommendations? How did you manage to land your first job? (Bonus thank yous if you were out of school for more than a year before you found a job, but actually managed to find one). I have a lot of friends who have had an easier time finding a job than me, and while I am very happy for them, I was one of the better students at my school so it's starting to feel like my academic success was a lie. Why is it that I did so well in classes and exams, and now I can't even pass a coding test? My peers who were C students, did they just get lucky? I recognize that maybe they have something I don't, I just don't know what it is. And I also don't know how long I should keep trying this before I determine that this is not something I am capable of.   


Also... it is weird for me to apply to internships at this point? I have been graduated since 2017. Until August 2018 I was on a gap year and then I decided to not continue to a PhD. So realistically I have been job hunting since last summer, but sadly now my resume looks like I've been job hunting for two years. I am a woman, and sometimes I wonder if people think I had kids or something, but I haven't even done that. I've just been trying to figure out how to get a stable career (and I also was dealing with some personal/family matters in that time). Thanks for any advice."

I’m getting a promotion and starting a new position on Tuesday of next week. I will now be working longer hours each day. Pretty much after work, I go straight home to work on my business (it’s a long day, but I love working on my company). 

Some context about my business — I’m providing people with disabilities an opportunity to earn money by creating art that I print (with my direct to garment printer) on shoes, shirts, and more. Each time someone purchases a product, the artist earns money for it. I am facing the challenge of balancing everything on my own in the company. I also do not have the funds yet to hire people.

I definitely know what I got myself into and love this challenge. I’m not complaining because it’s been a great learning experience. I’d like to hear from you all what strategies you use to balance everything. Any resourceful tips that could make my life easier would be great.

Here’s a quick run through of what I do at a glance: 

I have created a website on Squarespace and now it’s time to move on. I realized it’s not great for E-commerce, so now I’m in the process of building a completely new site on Shopify. On the site, I make artists pages and have to update each page + upload new art that I get sent. Along with that I have been photoshopping the art onto products like shirts, etc to upload onto the website. About a month ago I found Fiverr and it’s been a life saver.

For every order I get, I am fulfilling the printing onto the products. Fulfilling the packaging and shipping as well. There’s plenty of steps that go into the printing process. 

On top of that, I am doing all the marketing on different social media platforms. 

Due to working a full time job and having every single task to do within my company, I’m trying to make the most out of all the hours I have after work. 

All in all, I want to know the following:

-Are any of you going through the challenge of balancing everything by yourself essentially?

-What resources are out there to help me be more productive with my time and potentially with tasks? 

-I know there are some scheduling apps for posts on social media. What apps do you utilize for these? I think this could be super beneficial if I could use one and spend a few hours a week just planning/scheduling the posts.

-I’ve been working on my company for a while now, but only just started selling products a few months back. What tips do you have to someone who is basically beginning?

-How do you manage your stress and stay level headed?

Ask me any questions you’d like. I want to learn what others are doing. Having some people to talk to who are going through similar situations would be awesome. Thanks in advance!"

Recently, I’ve been hired as an intern as data analyst and I’ve got to come up with an etl pipeline from scratch in my very first project. I know it seems like a tall order for such a newbie, but I’m determined to do it anyway.

My main concerns are about the transformation part. We have some CSV files and some other JSON (not really important tbh). Mostly, the data is standardised as usual (client ID, name, etc). I just don’t know what to do there or what to expect, to finally move the output to Redshift and connect that to powerBI for business intelligence.

What should I do? What should I expect from this transformation?

I’m sorry if the questions sound too stupid. I already knew python and SQL, but I’m literally taking my first steps into the world of data and I can’t get me head around this. Since no one else around here knows shit about it, I’ve got no one to ask to - I’ve been literally hired to do research, teach myself to code, learn these stuff and apply it as a result. Cheers"

A startup picked me up a couple of months after and I've been working for them as a full stack dev since then.  The job is remote, part time, and doesn't pay anything close to what I should be making, but it's been a great learning experience.  The team I work with is really cool too.  My CEO is having a difficult time finding the next round of funding so they probably can't afford to keep me on for much longer.  

Prior to the bootcamp, I finished up an AA degree in CIS.  I've applied to university last fall and got accepted into a BS CS program.  But I haven't 100% made up my about committing to another 2-3 years of school.  I put together a short list of pros and cons to help me think better:

Pros:  
- Finally finish school (I'm the only one in my family that doesn't hold a Bachelors degree)  
- Learn all the theory stuff I missed out on  
- Network with people through class / school career fairs  
- Open up more tech career options aside from web development (I've been interested in shifting gears to dev ops/release engineering)  
- Potentially land an internship at a big tech company (bay area based)  

Cons:  
- Stress from school  
- I won't have much spare time  
- Struggle paying bills for the duration of college  
- DEBT  

Honestly, I'm leaning more towards going back to school. I'm 30, so I'll definitely be one of the older students, but I'm not really too worried about that.  What do you guys think? I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Any advice would be very appreciated!

I’m completely lost career-wise and feel pretty much like a failure, and it looks like any professional path I decide upon will be super difficult and frustrating and that I am destined to be unsuccessful because of my life choices so far and because of my general lack of motivation.

I finished law school last December. It should have taken me 5 years to compete my law degree but it took 7 because I dropped out for a year and later when I got back to uni I couldn’t manage the workload and it took me one extra year to finish some courses. I don’t have much work experience either, maybe 2 years total, and it’s mostly crappy internships. During my time at university I was lazy and had quite a few bad grades because I abused pot and preferred to drink and party every night, so I didn’t pursue significant work experiences or academic research programs or anything constructive at all, even though these things were available to me as a law student.

I really feel like I am lagging behind everyone in life. I should have graduated by age 22 but only managed to do so at age 25. I have very little work experience in comparison to my peers and I’ve been out of work for six months now and this is really starting to take it’s toll on my self-esteem.

I’ll be starting a Masters degree in another country (Netherlands) in a few months, but I don’t have a job there yet and I definitely need one to support myself. I am actively looking through recruitment agencies, it’s only been a few weeks though, but no one has replied to my applications and I feel like my resumé is shit because of everything I described above. I feel like no one will hire me for a position that is even remotely related to my legal background, and that I will likely end up with a crappy job, that is, if I’m even able to find a job at all.

I’m single, I’ve been struggling with drug addictions for the past decade, and I’ve always a hard time staying focused and motivated on my goals. But this lack of focus and motivation always improves when I actually have a job, so, I’m in a vicious cycle right now, because my lack of employment severely worsens my general psychological condition, and thus it becomes harder for me to dedicate my time to self-improvement activities, such as studying or volunteer work that could help me land a job. 

I’m considering switching careers, I’ve a little experience with web development, so maybe I’ll take part in a bootcamp and become a front-end developer. I feel like there are way too much Law graduates anyway, and that so many other lawyers are much better qualified than me, so what chance do I have at landing a lawyer job? I don’t even like Law much, tbh. Only went to law school because I come from a family of lawyers and parents talked me into it. 

However, if I do decide to take the leap and change careers, how do I support myself while I train to become a developer? I don’t have the motivation to even apply for jobs anymore and sometimes I doubt that I have what it takes to break into the tech industry. (i.e. I feel that I’m too stupid). Also, I fear that I will always be a second-rate professional in the tech industry because of my stupid law degree and this prospect kills my motivation. 

I’m sorry if it seems like I’m whining, sometimes I think that I’m a privileged brat who lacks work ethics and that all I need is a more down-to-earth perspective, but I’m in a really dark place right now, unemployment has been really hard on me and my search for a job has been so difficult and pointless that I’m left feeling this way. 

On a side note, these are the things I've being doing to cope: I've been on therapy for the past three years, and it did help me (I had an even worse mindset before). I'm physically very active and do sports on a daily basis and exercise helped me A LOT when I first started it. But these copes can only do so much. 

TL; DR: I’m a 26 yo female and still living with my mom. Below average academic performance at Law school, very little work experience, out of work for the last six months, general lack of motivation. Being unemployed makes it even harder for me to stay motivated and actively look for work. Considering a career change to become a web developer instead, but fear that I’m too lazy and stupid and that my previous life choices will always damage my professional outlook, regardless of what career path I decide to follow."

The Coke gig is and will continue to be developing apps to be used in house with PowerApps / Flow / LogicApps in Azure rather than traditional development. 

I’m worried that having only been programming for 9 months I won’t be competitive enough against those who have been coding for longer, even though I’ll be graduating with some experience. I haven’t done any personal projects and don’t have a GitHub. I plan on moving to a more tech oriented city when I graduate but still not sure yet where, and I plan on starting to apply for jobs in August or September. 

How do those of you who suffer from confidence issues push past it to continue to excel? What can I do now better prepare myself?"
brtjk1,20,2019-05-22,At the Lake House,tropical_rabbit,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/brtjk1/at_the_lake_house/,"We went to the lake house for a fun trip to celebrate graduating from college. I was talked into coming here after Jenny broke up with me the day before she and I were supposed to go on our road trip to Florida. Even with all the rain and too cold weather for May in mid-Michigan we had a great time those first two nights. Mostly from the freedom of being done with school and having no commitments to a career, house, or kids...and also from the alcohol. But earlier today the fun stopped.

This morning I awoke with a mild headache next to Phoebe in her bed. She did a wonderful job helping me forget about Jenny last night. I put some clothes on and headed downstairs for breakfast. 

I looked out the window-filled wall and could barely see the lake through the morning fog. Sam was already in the kitchen eating a bowl of Lucky Charms. He looked up and smiled at me. ""Feeling alright this morning? I think we went through half of our beer supply last night.""

""I'm sure I'll be good after breakfast."" I said as I gathered some eggs, cheese, and bacon for breakfast. ""How about you?""

""I've already been for a run around the lake this morning. I’m feeling great. It sounded like you got plenty of exercise last night though."" He said with a wink.

""My bad, I guess the walls are pretty thin here. Probably just a one time thing though.""

""I wouldn't be so sure of that. She's been waiting for you and Jenny to break up since last year.""

“I’d be happy with a few more nights like last night, but we’ll see where it goes.”  I began making a big breakfast for everyone and enjoyed the peace and quiet of the morning.

Todd and Gretchen came down the stairs and entered the kitchen. “Good morning!” I said.

“I’m surprised you’re awake from all that activity last night,” said Gretchen.

“Oh man, you heard us too,” I said lowering my head.  “Well, maybe this nice breakfast will make up for it.”

“Hey, I can deal with that if you cook like this every morning,” said Todd. Gretchen and Todd began setting the table while I finished preparing the breakfast. 

Phoebe came down last. ""Nothing better than the smell of bacon first thing in the morning,"" she said as she walked past me and traced her hand across my lower back.

I dished out food for everyone and we all sat around the table and came up with a plan for the day. We decided on packing lunches and going for a hike through the woods adjacent to the property. There was a house on one side of this property, which was a second home and, like a lot of people, the owners were waiting until Memorial Day weekend to head up north. The other side was many many acres of woods that led into a state park with many more acres of woods.

Everyone went their separate ways to get ready and pack a backpack for the late morning hike. Gretchen and Todd offered to pack lunches for everyone. They had been girlfriend and boyfriend since they met in their first class freshmen year. The rest of us had met at various times during college and became friends.

We all met up on the deck in front of the lake once we were all ready. The fog had mostly disappeared and the temperature felt a little warmer than the 50 degrees on the thermometer. We climbed over the short wooden fence at the end of the property and found a path into the woods.

We chatted about our plans for after graduation as we walked through the evergreens and oak trees. Todd and Gretchen were moving to Chicago together for a job Gretchen had lined up from a past internship. Todd was waiting to hear back from some applications he submitted which resulted in a couple initial phone interviews. They were looking forward to being able to walk home from the bars and told us to come visit anytime once they get settled. Todd looked over at Sam and I and said, ""Maybe I’ll take my time finding a job so you guys can come over and we can play video games and drink all day while Gretchen works.""  This resulted in a playful smack on the arm from Gretchen.

Sam was staying in Michigan to work for his Dad's small business. He said his computer science degree should help get his dad caught up with the current times.

Before Phoebe or I had a chance to talk about our plans, we came across a large pile of small bones and partially eaten squirrel carcasses. ""Ew, that is disgusting,"" said Phoebe, ""what is that from?""

""Birds?"" guessed Todd.

Sam grabbed a large stick and pushed it through the pile. Some of the bones disintegrated and a cloud of dust went into the air. Sam started coughing as he unintentionally breathed in some of the dust. ""I think I have dead animals in my lungs,"" He said through fits of coughing.

The rest of us quickly moved away so we wouldn't have to breathe in the dust cloud too.

""You all right buddy?"" I asked Sam.

He finally stopped coughing, but seemed to struggle to breathe normal again. ""I think so,"" he said, ""but my chest burns like that time I stupidly tried one of Todd’s cigarettes.""

After letting Sam compose himself, we continued on. There was a thin trail of dead animals and bones that continued on the way we were headed; small piles of bones were scattered here and there. We all thought it was odd, but wanted to continue on our hike.

Soon we came to an area of just birch trees. ""They all look dead."" I said and ran over to one with a hearty ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" as I pushed over a small one. It made a satisfying crack as it broke and fell to the ground.

""Hercules, Hercules!"" Shouted Sam while clapping his hands. Then he took a turn trying to push over a thick white birch.

""No way you're getting that one over by yourself, it's way too thick,"" said Todd. He started walking over to help. Sam's hands burst straight through the tree right as Todd got next to him. The rest of the tree started tipping toward them. They quickly tried moving out of the way, but the tree crumbled like it was made of sand. It knocked them to the ground and covered them and the air around us with a fine dust.

We ran over to help them up and tried not to breathe in the dust. Both of them were fine other than a few scrapes from falling on some rocks. 

""I took a mouthful of it."" Sam said as he tried to spit it out. ""It feels all fuzzy in my mouth."" He grabbed his water bottle and gargled it in his throat. 

We all began brushing the dust off our hair and clothes and then tried to help Sam and Todd as they had gotten the worst of it. ""Let's head back and get cleaned up, I don’t like how this feels in my hair. You and Sam look like ghosts with it all over your face.”  They tried to rub it off, but it only served to smear it more across their faces.  

Everyone was in agreement so we began heading back toward our cabin without stopping for lunch. We went past the pile of dead animals again, but it looked much larger than when we first passed by an hour ago. ""That creeps me out,"" Phoebe paused, ""did it get bigger?"". She walked closer to me and leaned in to me.

I put my arm around her waist and gave it a little squeeze. ""Looks like it. Let's get out of here."" 

Our path back must have diverged from the path we took on the way out because we soon came upon a small lake. 

Sam stopped. ""I'm going in,"" he said. ""I've got to get this off me. It itches everywhere, even where it just got on my clothes.""

""That water is going to be freezing!"" said Gretchen. “Why don’t you just wait until we get back?”

""And it is probably full of leeches."" Phoebe added.

Sam ignored them and set his backpack on the ground. He took off his shoes and socks and ran into the lake with the rest of his clothes on.

""He's crazy,"" Phoebe whispered to me. ""He'll freeze on the way back, it's not that warm out and we have about an hour or so to go.""

Sam went all the way under water and seemed to stay there for a long time. I started running toward the lake to help him, but then he lurched out of the water and cautiously looked all around.  He then stared off into the woods.

""Hey Sam, you alright?” I asked. 

He continued to stare for a little while longer and then finally seemed to snap out of it. ""I think it was just the shock of the cold. Let's keep moving,"" he said. 

Gretchen pulled out a blanket from Todd's backpack and wrapped it around Sam. He clutched it tight and then sat down to get his shoes and socks back on.

We were mostly silent the rest of the way back. I kept getting the feeling that someone was watching us. I didn't express this feeling, but I think the others felt the same as I saw them stop and look around at various times on the trip back. Sam was struggling to keep up, but I made sure to check on him every so often to make sure we didn’t lose him.

When we neared the fence to go into our yard, I looked back to check on Sam, but he was gone. I stopped and yelled his name a few times.

""He's in the cabin!"" yelled Todd, who had surged ahead a little while earlier. 

The rest of us ran into the cabin to see Sam wrapped in a towel, his hair still wet. ""What took you guys so long?"" he asked. 

""How the hell did you get back here so fast?"" I asked, my eyes wide. You could barely keep up with us and I saw you way behind me a few minutes ago.

""Very funny,"" laughed Sam, ""you guys all stopped for lunch at the small lake we found, but I wanted to get back and cleaned off so I headed back on my own.""

The rest of us looked at each other and then Todd and Gretchen reached into their backpacks to pull out the lunches they had packed for everyone. They started taking things out and then frantically dumped the backpacks upside down, but no lunches were there. ""No,"" said Gretchen, ""we didn't stop for lunch. What happened to them?""

Todd replied, ""Everything else seems to be there. I think we only went in them for water a few times on the hike. They were zipped up when we got back and there are no holes, they couldn't have fallen out.""

""Okay, stop messing with me,"" Sam said. ""I feel better after my shower, but my mouth and throat still feel weird. I'm not in the mood for a group prank right now. Besides, you guys look like shit covered in all that weird dust."" Before we could respond, he went in his room and closed the door.

No one new what to say at first, then finally Gretchen spoke up, ""Let's all get cleaned off and then we can meet up after we’ve all had a chance to shower and change. Todd and I will take the downstairs bathroom, you two can use the one upstairs.""

I followed Phoebe upstairs and said, ""You can go ahead and go first. I'll wait for Sam to come out of his room and try to figure out what’s going on.""

Phoebe tensed her shoulders and said, ""This is too weird, I don't really want to be alone right now. Besides, I could use a little help making sure I get all this stuff off me."" She grabbed my hand and pulled me into the bathroom with her.

She turned the shower on and we carefully took off our clothes, piling them neatly on the floor to avoid kicking up the dust. She grabbed my hand again and led me into the shower with her. Most of the dust had been on our clothes, but our hair was pretty covered with it. We took turns scrubbing our faces and washing our hair and then she told me to check her body for any more. I inspected her body closely and rubbed my hands across her smooth skin until I came across a rough patch on her lower back. It felt like sandpaper.

""Did you find something?"" she asked.

I looked her over another time and then rubbed the rough patch again. ""Just this one spot,"" I said. I picked at the edge of it. ""Does this hurt?"" She shook her head no. ""Okay, I'm going to try to pull it off."" I pulled at one of the edges and it came off like a band-aid. 

She let out a small yelp. ""Sorry, did that hurt bad?""

""Kind of. It reminded me of my first time waxing my legs.""

I pulled her over toward me out of the water and looked closely at her back. About a hundred tiny drops of blood appeared on her lower back, like when the doctor pokes your finger to get a tiny blood sample.

""What is it?""

""You’re bleeding a bit, it must have dug into your skin. I'll put some antibacterial cream on it when we get out."" 

""Okay, let's get you checked out now."" She said and proceeded to slowly explore my body with her hands. You're all clear...and apparently ready for action.”  She grabbed onto me and started kissing me.  Her tongue felt strangely soft, but I was quickly able to look past that.  

When we were finished, we grabbed our towels and dried off.  I found some antibiotic cream in the cabinet and rubbed it on her back.

A few seconds after I finished, she yelled, “Oh my god, ow, it burns! Get it off, get it off!” She fell to the floor crying. I quickly turned the shower back on and helped her in. I grabbed the soap and scrubbed the cream off as fast as I could.  I helped her get out and dried her off carefully. Her lower back was all red and blisters had already formed. She was still sobbing as I wrapped her in her towel and carried her to her room.  I set her carefully in her bed on her side and told her I’d be back with a cold towel.

A scream brought me down the stairs at a quicker pace. I ran over to the bathroom and knocked on the door. ""What is it?"" I yelled.

Todd opened the door wearing a towel with blood dripping down his face, neck, and arms. Gretchen was standing in the bathtub covering herself with a towel.

""Oh my God, are you all right?"" I asked.

Todd grabbed another towel and started wiping the blood off. ""It looks worse than it feels,"" he said.

""Phoebe was bleeding a bit after I pulled one of those things off her back,"" I said pointing to the pile of moss-like strips on the floor. ""Don't put any antibiotics on it. I put some on Phoebe and it burned really bad.""

""Sorry for the scream, I didn't expect to see that much blood when I pulled open the curtain,"" Gretchen said.

More blood begin to slowly bubble up on the hundreds of tiny holes poked into Todd's body. ""What the hell are those things? It just looked like dust when it covered us. I only had it on my clothes and hair, but it didn't stick to my hair like it did your skin."" I said.

""Gretchen, did you get any on you? You know, I could check you over if you'd like,"" I said trying to lighten the mood. 

""Hey,"" said Todd as he wiped away the blood again, ""there's a fee to see that nice of a show.""

""I'll go grab the first aid kit so you can get bandaged up."" I said. I went to the kitchen and rummaged through the cabinets.  After locating the first aid kit, I quickly ran back over to Todd and Gretchen and gave it to them. ""Remember no antibiotic cream."" Todd gave me a thumbs up and closed the door.

I headed back to the kitchen, grabbed a towel and loaded it with ice from the freezer. There appeared to be a trail of blood on the floor and going up the stairs. I followed the trail upstairs and down the hall. It ended in a good sized puddle outside Sam's door. ""Hey Sam, you alright in there?""

No response. I knocked loudly and raised my voice, ""Sam, are you okay?"" I grabbed the door handle and opened it up. The handle felt wet. I pulled my hand away noticing the blood on it and then burst in to the room, ""Sam!"" I yelled and looked around the room. He wasn't there. The lights were on and the closet was open and empty. Blood was on the sheets. It was on the wall. It was on the furniture. It was even on the ceiling. I walked over to the window and saw that it was locked.

I ran to check on Phoebe. She was asleep in her bed, still covered with her towel. I lifted the towel to check on her back and the blisters had gotten worse. I covered her up with her sheets, kissed her cheek and ran down to get Todd and Gretchen. Todd's arms were wrapped in gauze and his face was covered with big bandages.

""What's going on with Sam?"" asked Todd.

""He's gone. His room is covered in blood, but he's not there.""

Gretchen's eyes went wide, ""Do you think he's okay?"" She asked.

""I don't think so,"" I said, ""that was a lot of blood. We've got to find him quick.""

""I didn't hear him leave the house,"" said Todd.

I told them about the blood trail on the floor and on the stairs leading to his room. We decided to call 911 and then go looking for him. We went to the kitchen where we had all left our phones charging. The chargers and counter were covered with dust, but the phones were gone.

""What the hell is happening?"" Gretchen said. She grabbed on to Todd for comfort.

""I'm going to check on Phoebe. You guys stay together and be careful."" I ran upstairs and into Phoebe's room. She was still sleeping peacefully, her chest slowly rising and falling. I looked around the room and didn't see any blood or signs of danger. 

I found her laptop in her bag and was able to type this up in case anyone has heard of something similar to this dust and whatever it turned into when it got on Phoebe and Todd's skin. I have no idea what happened with Sam, he was so far behind us on the walk back that there is no way that could have been him in the cabin. I'll make sure Phoebe is safe and then I'm going to get Todd and Gretchen and we’ll figure out what to do next."
brtls7,1,2019-05-22,Should I quit my internship and work on myself?,marcu5fen1x,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/brtls7/should_i_quit_my_internship_and_work_on_myself/,"Background :

 I am an undergraduate student who just completed his 3rd out 4 years of college. In the summer break, I decided to join an internship at a startup company. It was extremely hard for me to find an internship as I have had no experience at all and the skills I gained are relatively new. I started out as a .NET developer and freelanced as a full stack developer for a couple of organizations. I then did a lot of data scraping/mining/scripting as it was part of my course and it interested me. I moved on to data science in the starting of this year and picked up ML and DL, in the very short time that I got apart from my course work. I dedicated 2-3 hours to learning data science everyday and just completed the coursera courses and implemented a couple of projects by my own. I must say it interests me. 

Current scenario:

At the end of the semester in May(this month), I had two choices : Either I could continue learning data science and read up books that I have queued in my to-read list or I could join an internship and gain experience to enhance my CV. 

I am not learning anything new at my internship and even if I will, its nothing that I cant learn on my own. But I have to undertake a an internship in my final semester as part of my university course (Jan-June 2020). Considering how hard I tried to score this internship, I feel it would be hard to get another without some prior experience. Even if I don't learn at this company, I will have some experience to add to my profile. This will enable me to apply to universities for post-grad which demand for experience. 

At the same time, I doubt how valuable this experience is? I could probably learn more if I dedicated myself in this summer break and be at a better position to secure a good internship in my final semester. Also, if things don't work out, I could take it slow and take a year's break after graduating to gain some experience before pursuing post-grad. I am anxious as taking it slow might mean burdening my family's finances. In the short future, I don't foresee a financial crisis, but considering my family's past, it might just be around the corner(its complex). So there is an added pressure that I need to become financially stable ASAP. 

I really liked learning new things, freelancing, doing my own projects etc. I feel like that's what I want to do, learn more. I am dissatisfied at this internship as I feel I am not learning enough. I want an objective opinion. What is going to help me more in the future? Should I invest more time in learning or gaining experience?"

(resume inside),proxygodtriple6,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/brtsyc/i_just_graduated_with_an_associates_in_network/,"I know I need to be getting more certs. My degree was focused mostly on cisco routers, switches, and firewalls. I had a computer forensics class, as well as some linux and windows server classes.

Currently, I've been at an internships doing more sys admin level stuff as all of the previous senior people were fired or quit. We had a team of 3 interns at a 18 person msp doing all of the systems maintenance and networking stuff. I think we did a damn good job based on having nothing but google and some vendor support to lean on. 

We had complete access to their vcenter and all networking devices as well as our clients. We monitored backups, solved network issues, implemented a ticketing system, created a network topology (we had 160 vlans on our network), as well as creating new VMs for various purposes. I even got to create an Azure AD sync server for a 2FA soultion for O365.

Sadly, the COO wants more experienced people so the internship is ending. Is there anyway I could better present myself with my current lack of skills on paper?

At this point, it might be too late to get an internship anyway.

I'm looking to return to college for CS. I'm 36 now and am expected to graduate when I'm 40 or 41. Right now I am struggling to find work. I cannot afford to rent my own place let alone put down payment on a house.

Changing circumstances like that make it more difficult to pay your way through college. I live with older family, but I cannot be claimed as a dependent due to my older age. I'll have to find a job that can support myself well enough while also not sacrificing my performance at college.

So I have two questions: Where should I look, especially for older adults that want a job that reflects their experience more? And how do you filter for jobs that can also pay some or all your tuition as reimbursement as long as you work there?

The only programming experience I have is with some odd freelance jobs here and there but it's nothing to write home about since my resume goes ignored when I submit it to larger companies for full-time work. The only people large companies hire, if they have little-to-no experience, are CS grads and students seeking internships.

I have friends that have told me about what their company does for reimbursement, but they're graduates in unrelated majors, and not in companies that hire a lot of software developers.

Edit: Location would also matter because the college I pick will also determine the available jobs I have to choose from."

We live in MN.  

Edit: Looking for steps of recourse/setting ourselves to succeed incase they contend a case for claiming unemployment.  

My boyfriend was just fired from his mental health practitioner job two work days after he told them he was unsure about his ability to complete his internship there (starting next January) due to them not hiring licensed professionals with two years of experience in the last month.  The previous licensed professionals all turned in an official resignation within a couple days of each other about a month ago and had given the company a two month notice prior to turning in their resignations.

He was hired on under the agreement that he was provided a supervisor on site for his internship starting in January.

The company in response to lack of staff was to just load the interns up with sessions instead of replacing qualified therapy providers.  My boyfriend heard the office supervisor complaining about not having any interviews. 

Prior to Monday, my boyfriend hasn’t had any trouble with this company, no other verbal or written warnings.  They really had nothing but praise for him as he is extremely competent and motivated in what he does. 

Yesterday his office supervisor gave him a written warning for smoking an E-cig in his car in the parking lot.  This is against the company policy, but frankly the rule hasn’t been enforced since his employment last January (but suddenly came up as a written warning two business days after he mentions his internship and the next day he is fired). 

The office supervisor who gave him the written warning has been consistently told by another employee when she is going out for a smoke break multiple times a day, and she will stand on the sidewalk of the business and smoke regularly.  One employee also openly keeps her E-cig on her desk which are not allowed on the premises.  My boyfriend only ever used it on the way out or into the parking lot prior and after sessions, and never took a break to go use it (it doesn’t have nicotine, so not much of a needed break).  Breaking a rule is breaking a rule, but I find it odd that out of the three scenarios, my boyfriend was singled out.

He asked these employees if they have had any written warning about smoking, and they said no. This leads us to believe the company was just looking for something to peg him with as to concoct an excuse to fire him, and I’m sure they don’t want to pay unemployment and wanted to skirt out of the internship.  This was our thought yesterday. 

He also asked within the last couple weeks for shorter days as working 9am-8pm days three days out of the week (plus two other days of work) with maybe two unpaid breaks a week tops was getting to be too much of a workload and was bringing paperwork home to finish unpaid.  They gave him permission starting a week ago to end sessions fifteen minutes early as to give him time to finish said paperwork.   His office supervisor also told him he should be clocking out of his work via a phone app prior to getting back to the office after sessions to return the company car, which he refused as that would be unpaid work travel (discussion of two months ago).

He was told they couldn’t provide him a reason for his termination and to contact headquarters six hours away via email to get more detail.  Do we have any recourse?

He put off graduating a year for this opportunity and this just really throws all of the deliberate effort including moving and signing a year long lease into the trash.  

As a tidbit, he was also the only male in the office, and the other smokers and his office supervisor are all female who are close friends, so maybe there is a case for gender discrimination, but I don’t want to get off topic from the obvious here.

Edit: Besides the obvious “file for unemployment”, what steps can we follow if they contend/fight the claim?"

And I am super excited but i'm already feeling like I'm super unqualified for it.  I am currently on my first task and i spent the last two days on this one assignment that needs to be done by tomorrow at the latest.  It's solidworks heavy and I felt pretty confident about my solidworks skills but i'm still learning.  I made a huge stride today with the assignment, but still feel like i'm not carrying my weight.  

Super nervous that I might get cut from the internship if I can't finish this project by tomorrow and super stressed that I'm going to fail my team on this task that'd probably be knocked out in under an hour by any of them.  :/  I ask a lot of questions and I get a lot of answers and they all make sense.  it's just applying it is much tougher than thinking about it.  I really don't want to mess up this opportunity because it's huge and I think the stuff they work on is interesting.

brwk61,3,2019-05-22,When to call it quits,IonedShirt,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/brwk61/when_to_call_it_quits/,"Senior mechanical engineering student here. A little over a year ago (spring 2018) a professor convinced me to do research under him. He had me apply for a tiny undergrad research grant through an official university program. I was accepted. I had dreamed of going to grad school for a long time. Research experience was the only thing lacking in my otherwise decent, if unconventional, academic career, and my adviser's research area was at least superficially interesting (control theory, which I really like). Things were looking good.

Now, a little over one year later, not so much. ""Highlights"" below.

* I burned out this last semester. Hard. Never-mind the details. Suffice to say that life issues finally got to me and by the end of this last semester I simply didn't care about anything and was barely staying out of full-blown depression. It was pretty bad, and I'm not even close to recovered yet (finished finals just shy of two weeks ago).
* I won't blame it completely, but burning out on school was a big contributor to my failing my entire research attempt. Yep. I straight up ended up not submitting any of the final papers required by the undergrad research program for official completion. I also didn't write the conference paper my adviser wanted and subsequently got a talking to. I honestly don't have much of anything at all accomplished IMO. My adviser, for some inexplicable reason, still wants me as a grad student and would like me to work on a journal paper this summer.
* I've kind of started questioning whether I should even go to grad school. I applied to my universities terminal masters program (my average, mid-sized state university doesn't even have engineering PhD programs) and got accepted, almost certainly with full funding. People (family, friends) seem happy for me, but I'm dreading starting. I also learned a few things over this last school year of failed research. One is that research for research sake doesn't cut it for me. My adviser (who would also be my grad adviser currently) does purely theoretical research, he has no lab or anything. I went into engineering because I like building stuff and have decided there is no way I'm going to spend another 2-2.5 years on research that is basically just reading papers on stuff pointlessly esoteric, of marginal use to anyone at all, and with no experimental components. And yes, I have hung out with his current MS students and even went to his last MS student's defense. I know basically the type of project I would be working on. I felt kind of bad, but had to agree with the committee member that asked the defending student what the point of his purely computational project was (he had no convincing answer).
* I at least got a good internship for this summer. It is literally the exact internship I wanted (controls engineering) and I'm actually really enjoying it. It isn't a 'prestigious' company or anything, but I like my coworkers and supervisor and the work. This is making it very hard to want to try and revisit the research I was working on to try and get some sub-par journal paper out of it.

I guess I'm just trying to get some clarity on my path forward. I think I feel like I owe my current adviser because he has been really nice, even with my ultimately very poor showing as a research student. But at the same time, I've fallen to the point where thinking about another 2 years for a MS at this school, under my current adviser, with the same research topic, actively makes my stomach churn. But on the other hand again, I now don't know if I have a chance at a decent grad school elsewhere, with such a huge failure at research on my hands. Additionally, I feel like I would be a huge, ungrateful jerk for pulling out of my university and away from my adviser now. Or maybe I'm just being a slacker and should just suck it up and try to get this journal paper written over the summer and go right into the MS program at my university. Given my current mental state, I feel like I'm setting myself up for even more failure if I try that though. I just feel completely stuck and need to just get away from school for a while.

Sorry if there doesn't seem to be much point to this post. Guess I just had to write something somewhere. If anyone else had a poor experience with their first shot at research, and has some advice, I'd love to hear it."

Email provider he's using (by that I mean gmail/hotmail/etc.) is very uncommon for the country I live in (it's uncommon for the continent I live on to be honest, in my 30 years I haven't met one person who uses that email provider).

I'm 22, 3rd year university working toward a degree in finance/business and a career in data/business/financial analytic . 

I have a credit score (TransUnion) of 724, and here are my finances:

**Income:** 

I can't work a lot of part time job (under 20 a week) and right now I'm full time internship (8 mo) @ annualized salary of $40,000 before tax. I don't pay a lot of tax either due to the outrageously expensive tuition I paid.

**Tuition:**

My family is nice enough to cover my tuition so I don't have to worry about it. TBH I would never be able to afford the international tuition even with the part time, internship and scholarship... 

**Mortgage:**

Biggest Debt is a *mortgage* around 560K. This is under my name but it's kinda my family's investment. They pay it off buy giving me all the money need for payment. 

**Credit Cards/Revolving:**

I have 5 old credit card with credit limits totalled CIBC Classic 4000+ CIBC Dividend 4500+ BMO SPC 3000+ FIDO 500+ Scotiabank 1500 (new from the weekend) = $13,500. best reward is 1% Cash Back on everything. 

Last weekend I got approved for 2 Amex card: Amex Cobalt with 10,000 limit, and Amex Platinum which is a charge card.

I seriously do not need this kind of credit. I spend on average 1000-1500 per mo. excluding any major purchase. I almost never keep balance on credit card as I never want to pay that kinda interest rate. 

I  heard I have to keep my credit card as closing them dings my credit. I will be mainly using the Amex card and Scotiabank Card going forward 

I did forgot to pay twice as well. a few day late but no minimum payment. and one serious offence: a balance on a credit card that's 30 days late - I forgot completely during final season and it was too late when I found out.  Probably dinged my credit big time.

**Open account:**

*Telus*

*Mercedes Benz Financial Services(Closed)* \- actually is a short lease took over of a SMART car of my friend. Ik Ik its a funny car but its actually quite good. Got it for 10 mo with $250 per mo. - really useful since I was commuting at that time.

*Amex Platinum Charge Card*

Hard Inquires 

2 Tims this year, nothing last year, 3 time in 2017

\---

**Last weekend:**

I got Amex Platinum and Cobalt this week. I'm new to ""good"" credit cards, I've been using the 0.5% - 1% for everything Cashback credit card since I had credit card.

The other day I closed my BMO account. the branch at our location sucks so bad, so rude and unhelpful, and their products are not really appealing as well. last week they pissed me off so bad I withdrew all the money to a money order and asked them to closed the account on the spot) 

I opened new banking accounts at Scotiabank on the other side of the street. The nice advisor asked me if I want to get a nice Visa Infinite Passport card, which would be very useful since I do travel both transboarder and international a few times a year. I never thought about it until he mentioned it. But I was not approved for that card and they can only gave me the same Cashback card I've been using.

I went home, did some research and apparently according to TransUnion, my credit thought not good, is not as bad as I thought, I have a 724.

This is not good enough for the big banks in Canada, but is evidently good enough for Amex. I applied and was approved for the Amex Platinum which is very worth it as a travel card especially during first year. and a Amex Cobalt (I do a lot of takeout and dinning out) that have a 10000 limit. (depending on how it goes I might not keep the platinum, but if it's actually might be worth it since I travel quite a bit, mostly transboarder and internationally.

I'm thinking getting the Bonvoy Amex so it would cover Dining - Travel - Hotel all around. Might have to do some return analysis there. But nothing new at lease before the end of the year.   
That's pretty much what happened over the weekend. 

\---

**Say anything :)**

I've never really cared or looked at my credit seriously. I try to remember paying everything. I do not spend more than I have. But I am forgetful and careless so I always cringe when I though of all the time I was late on my payment. I want to start improve my credit (I know what I did over the weekend probably is not helping), I'm looking for some feedback, advice, suggestion on what I can start and stop to do to better my credit. I'm also open to suggestion on a goal I can achieve with my conditions.

Any question I'll try my best to answer.

Man, do I feel spoiled.

First of all, they are paying me $18 an hour and I am expected to work 260 hours total during the summer. That's 4680 dollars total, holy sh*t!

They also provide free lunch with tons of vegetarian options (which is great because I'm a vegetarian).

In the canteen, there are tons of food and snacks. They have bagels and cream cheese, cookies, candies, chips, cold drinks, ice cream, and so much more goodies that I can't even remember. They even served this bomb ass cheese cake the other day. They're always restocking with more food regularly, too.

This internship is so much better the one I had in school. Granted, I was a minor back then, but still, I feel so pampered right now. 

The internship I had at high school was unpaid, they barely had any vegetarian options during company lunches (which, unlike this company, was only once a month or so) and their canteen was pretty bizarre besides some popcorn which they didn't restock once I wolfed down.

Wow, I feel like a king. And I mean, I'm an intern. I'm using open source Software to create applications. There's barely any code involved - I'm using a drag and drop editor online to create apps for this company. I might code a little JavaScript or python, but for the most part, I'm using something similar to Scratch (or snap). And I'm getting paid. And treated like a king. I can't believe it.

I read on my university's subreddit that this one guy (CS major) made $47 /hour as an intern. He was interning away from home and the company paid for his housing (he had his own room and bathroom). The apartment he got normally costs $3000 /month.

bs095a,0,2019-05-23,Accepting a low paying internship after graduation?,newamsterdamer95,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bs095a/accepting_a_low_paying_internship_after_graduation/,"TL;DR: should I accept a low paying summer internship in a field I’m Interested (product management) rather than accepting an OK offer in engineering at a company I’m not super thrilled about? 

I’ll be graduating in about a week with a BS in Computer Science. To give some background, I started my college career studying business because I was interested in Entrepreunership before pivoting to Computer Science and throughout my college career I’ve worked at companies I’ve either started/cofounded. 

Since October of last year I have probably sent out around 200 applications to both Software Engineer and Associate Product Manager roles. 

Ive only heard back for software engineering roles. I’ve landed 2 onsite interviews with the big/well known companies one from which I didn’t get an offer and the other one has been kind of a nightmare (recruiters not responding etc.) 

When I didn’t get any offers as late as April of this year I started looking into internships as a possible backup for the summer while I continue applying. During my college career I didn’t have the opportunity to do any internships because I was working full time on businesses I’ve started/founded.

Long term I’m interested in pursuing PM because I think it fits my varied skill set and interests better than a pure engineering role. One of the companies I applied for a PM internship role sent me an offer for the summer but offered me minimum wage (I’m in New York City) with a super tight turnaround to make a decision (literally 1 day). At first I was excited about this company based on their product, culture and Glassdoor reviews but these two things (lowball offer even for an post grad intern and basically exploding offer) have set off red flags. Anyways, I might also have an offer for a sort of engineering role (official title IT related) at a company I’m not so excited about and I suspect may not have too much mentorship opportunities. The pay is not terrible but the highest for software engineering in NYC (70kish). 

So my question after this winded description is should I accept a lower paying internship in a field I want to eventually pivot to (PM) or should I go the engineering route and then pivot to PM later. I would obviously want to negotiate the salary as much as I can if I go that route but it seems that if their initial offer is minimum wage I won’t get too far. 

Also any thoughts on product managers having to “pay their dues” by doing engineering first?"

I graduated with a bachelor's in CS about 2 weeks ago and I have about 3 years of software development experience working at different internships. I had hard time trying to find full time opportunities, so I accepted an internship at a big financial technology company where I started at last week. Here they said that they will hire me full time if everything with the 2 month internship goes well. Now I like working at this company, im getting to work on an ok project as an intern, the office is really REALLY nice, lots of intelligent people I am working with. 

But yesterday, a company I'd had interviewed for 2 weeks ago reached out to me and gave me a full time offer for about 72k. Now this other company is very small (like 50 employees), they make software for the shipping industry. The company's product decisions are heavily influenced by the developers, it's not a bad place to work, I feel like I'd learn a lot working here. But ideally I'd like to work at my internship as a full-time employee but I highly doubt they'll offer me anything since I've only been here a week.

I am just trying to figure out if I take the full time offer or stick it out with the internship and ""maybe"" get hired in 2 months.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you for reading!!

EDIT: I am being paid at the internship, $23/hr."

Applied like crazy for internships because it’s hard to land one as a freshman. 

Got one through my university and started yesterday. JUST got an email from a tech company that I got theirs as well. Now I don’t know what I should do. 

Internship through my school: data input, not as cs related as I would like, $13/hr and 40hrs/week (required). But is work from home and will be continued throughout this Fall. 

Internship from tech company: more cs related, $18/hr &amp;amp; 40hrs/week. 1.5hr commute both ways. But will help me more major wise. 

Any advice would be much appreciated"

- Am looking into CBS, Yale, Oxford and Cambridge but these are not targets

- I really want to use the MBA to build a solid network and also make new like-minded friends

- Ideally there will be a decent black and LGBT presence at the school



**Questions/Concerns:**
- What are my chances at Kellogg 1 Year? Is that program looked at with prestige?

- What are my chances of getting into Wharton/HBS/Stanford (in that order?)

- Is having 8-9 years of work experience a handicap or advantage?

- Despite the name brand of my first job, I haven’t worked for any recognizable companies or major startups in over 5 years (the agencies I’ve worked with only focus on launching and growing early companies). Is this an issue?

- My current salary is already in the post-MBA grad range so walking away is a huge opportunity cost, but the jobs I want are more prestigious and are in the $200k+ range. Am I better off avoiding the MBA?

- How heavily should I focus on my ethnic background and sexual orientation in my application?

- Should I talk about my experience on the Crew team or was that too long ago to matter?

- Is e-commerce/digital marketing a desired skill set for MBA admissions?"

Now it's my turn to write for you. For context: I am a brazilian gay man, 26 yo, please excuse any grammatical error. I treat this as my suicide letter, as I am not going to write one in RL because I don't feel like I owe anyone any satisfaction, the only one who will not understand is my dog but I can't do anything about that.

I have always studied very hard, top of my class in high school, fluent in english and spanish, entered one of the best colleges in the country and so on. Excuse me if I sound like I am bragging, but I will die on saturday, so let me have this hahaha. I have been in the closet about my homossexuality most of my life. When I was younger, around 12 years old, and realized I was gay I decided that I was never going to have a sexual life as I grew up in a very homophobic environment. I thought ""I will have a good job, a carreer and good friends, I don't need this"". 

Nowadays I see this as the starting point of my depression. Even now that I have come to accept my homossexuality as something natural I still feel ashamed to talk about this with my family. I concentrated entirely on my studies, my only hobby was gaming, but I managed to make some very good friends this way.

After entering college, chemical engineering btw, I got an internship in a factory where I worked long hours while also studying, I was tired all the time, but I liked it, there was no time to be depressed and I was earning good money for a 23 year old student. Hell began when I got a new supervisor that was extremely homophobic. I ended up having to leave my job because I could not handle the abuse. Because of that my internship was cut short and I have this ""stain"" in my curriculum.

I never got any job after that. Brazil entered a very strong recession and no one is hiring, a lot of people are getting fired, thing are really ugly. It's been a year since my graduation and I haven't been able to find a job, hell, I haven't been able to get any interview at all. 

I am in treatment for major depressive disorder and anxiety for some time now. The psychologist, psychiatrist  and med bills are pilling up fast. My mother has lost her job and my father lost most of his earnings due to the economy.

I had one hope. I was studying really hard to get a consultant job at a software company, the only market that wasn't affected that much. This was going to allow me to pay my own bills and I would be able to leave my parent's house (my mother uses all her spare time to make me feel guilty for being gay and unemployed). Yesterday I received the news that I did not get the job.

I will not face an entire life of loneliness and poverty.

Fortunelly this weekend I have the perfect opportunity. My parents will be out of town and my brother will be at his girlfriend's house. I will not disclose the method I have prepared because I am pretty sure it has almost 100% chance to kill me and I know that there are some people that have a chance to live a good life but are experiencing a bad moment, I don't want to be responsible for any more sadness. Goodbye my friends, thanks for the company!"

I liked everything related to operations, and I had a developer background from school. But now I find myself with all the positions being for Seniors, it seems that Juniors don't have that much opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told that DevOps was a field for experienced people, some called me stupid cause I barely had experience with Ops. Now I'm kinda believing what people told me, but my passion is still here, in DevOps. I think that there are ways to learn DevOps practices, and with effort become a good DevOps Engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I don't want to get out of my path, but I'm not gonna lie: it's tough. I did even offer once to be an intern, but got rejected too (I study and practice a lot). So, what are your opinions about a Junior Developer trying to become a DevOps with barely experience in Ops (but willing to learn, and willing to hard work for it)? Is it worth it or not? May I, and people like me, probably find a company that wants to get Junior DevOps Engineer to join their teams?"

Since I got into uni, I figured I could do something that's fun, enjoy myself and possibly meet people that work in the industry.

For 2 years already, I have worked in Node JS, MongoDB along with frameworks such as Vue on personal projects that I have on my github account. I've tried to produce quality code, documenting and keeping my projects as readable as possible.

At the hackathon I mention above, a Node senior noticed my work, and asked me if I'm interested in an internship - ""It's really hard to find inters nowadays that know Node from the get-go. I'm looking for a junior, so if you're interested apply here..."".

The problem is, as I've just gotten into uni, I have no Node certification, or any other certification besides my country's equivalent for A-Levels (which are irrelevant here for employers, since they're so out of touch with the hiring standard). I, however, have 4-5 more serious Node projects where I used different concepts, project architectures, etc. 

My question is, how do I put that in my resume? How do I make sure I can land an interview (where I suppose I will get a chance to show them what I'm capable of) just through the CV?"
bs4v8h,1,2019-05-23,I want to quit my job.. I have no idea how and where to go from here and it gives me anxiety.,needworkadvice123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bs4v8h/i_want_to_quit_my_job_i_have_no_idea_how_and/,"I want to give you some context about me: I had it quite easy for the most part of my life. School: good grades with no real effort (I listened in class, and did the work, but no extra at home. most of the time I didn't do my homework, which sank my grade a bit). Got through college quite same (played LoL most of it instead of studying). Got lucky and landed my first job as I was in college internship month. And worked there since. as Data analyst/entry and QA. As time went on I was considering options, but mostly stayed at the same job because of people. And the company grew from \~10 people to \~150 ATM in 3 years.

Last year there was changes in management and I went away from QA and was left at DA/DE position... Mostly Excel work, analyzing and then entering the data. I get quite good payment for the place I live in and live quite a comfortable life.

Again, last year, I took out mortgage and got myself an apartment to live for me and my girlfriend... (this is important for my decision..)

Well even though we now have a huge office with entertainments, you don't have to sit at computer all day as some robots.. But this job just got me burned out.. I can't force myself to work more than I need to. And even then the job is literally the exact same shit everyday... I just feel like I am standing still and do not learn anything, just not growing as a specialist... Because of this I started spending more and more of my days on Reddit and YouTube. sometimes I can't force myself to do anything productive for days.. Sometimes i would think to myself I want to quit and change the job.. But this is so easy and safe... (especially with 30y mortgage..)

But now for some reason I start to feel even worse. I was almost at the verge of panic attack after I came home today just by thinking how much I hate it that I have to go there everyday (mon-fri)...

And now I mostly just basic worker without real good knowledge as I, for the last 3 years, just stared at the excel screen day by day.. I can't even force myself to do anything at home, as I come back defeated. I just spend time with my girlfriend or watch netflix/play games. I even gave up on my dream to go for software developer job, as (mostly from having it easy all this time) can't force myself to overcome obstacles and learn to code past functions/arrays..

Now I hate my job, have near panic attacks thinking of what will I do if I quit and won't get as lucky? what will I do with the mortgage?

More or less questions are: How do I overcome this anxiety? How should I start learning and preparing for something new? And how for the first time in my life I convince and fight myself from taking the easy route and just staying where I am for another 3 years?

Sorry I'm not a good writer and rambled much of the same things on and on. Just it's first time I'm opening up somewhere so much.. If you want me to edit my post or answer any more questions please ask. I will gladly clarify everything as much as I can..

Our lease was up about a year ago and we switched to month-to-month with the intent to stay until next summer.

My roommate left for the summer for an internship, I'm currently away but will be returning in about a month, maybe more.

Here's my situation and question: We hadn't done dishes for awhile, way longer than I'd like to admit. Anyway, our garbage disposal isn't working and as a result gunk and mold have built up in the sink and there's disgusting black water standing in the sink. I asked him to take a look at it and fix it but I'm worried when he sees how bad off it is he'll change his mind about us staying there. Can he evict us for this? And if he can, what are our options since my roommate is gone all summer and I won't be back for awhile? Could he just remove our stuff if we aren't there if he decides to evict us? 

Also, somewhat off topic: I left my room a complete mess. There's also a rig to take THC dabs and a torch just sitting out. I'm of legal age but the contract says no smoking in the units and he's given us one warning in the past. Let's say he comes to fix the garbage disposal and decides to change the batteries in the fire alarms, comes to my room and sees that, is that grounds for eviction? There are no dabs sitting out but the paraphernalia is just on my desk.

I'm a programmer, so while I'll try to keep this legible, it may slip a bit in places.

Notable Personel &amp; Things

$Me - A lowly intern

$Manager - The guy who gives work to $Me

$Machine1 - a machine in a lab somewhere that does a thing.

$Machine2 - closely related to $Machine1, further processing what it produces.

$BastardSystem - a system that manages basically all the lab inventory and related information.  At one time, long ago, it was purchesed.  Today it is heavily modified &amp; out of date.  I'm told it went down for a few days about a year ago and the vendor just laughed when we asked them for support.

$OutdatedService - the application I am attempting to replace.  Was last updated in 2015 &amp; accounts for approximately 25% of service desk calls.  Closely integrated with $BastardSystem.

The story:

Today $Manager, a fellow intern, and I started mapping out what we needed to do to replace $OutdatedService.  To start, we grabbed the source from BitBucket and started browsing for any relevent information.  Luckily, we found a document on how to install $OutdatedService there, and were able to piece together an idea of where it was running.  Once we had that, $Manager remoted in and started looking at the actual installation.

To our surprise, there were two executables running.  Our repository only contained source code for one.  We then copied the executable off the server and decompiled it.  We browsed through the decompiled files but weren't able to find anything particularly useful.  $Manager was on the verge of dismissing this as unused but we weren't sure what was updating the log file for this executable.

While searching for anything related to this executable, I discovered a second bitbucket repository labeled $OutdatedService (Deprecated) which appeared to contain source code for the executable in question.  We cloned this repository and opened up the code.  Turns out, the majority of the logic was written in a VB project which our .NET decompiler failed to find.

Looking through the source, we discovered that this executable was recieving files from $BastardSystem, parsing them, and inserting the result into an SQL instance.  It also contained thousands of lines of logic for transforming that data.  There were many notable issues with the code, including more than 50 ""TODO"" comments.  How it's managed to struggle through the past 4 years with no updates or maintence I have no idea.

$Manager is not happy, as this discovery has greatly increased the scope of replacing $OutdatedService, which is a prereq for replacing $BastardSystem.

Fun fact about $BastardSystem: one of the files contains a single SQL query which is built in 3,000 lines.  This query is also largely commentless.

To be continued...

PS: Many details have been intentionally left out, but there are certainly some I may be able to add."

I have an IT internship this Summer at a Christian broadcast network in Chicago, I had a few offers somewhere else but this is company that would personally be very exciting to work at, not sure how it's going to look to future employers.

bs9yoz,1,2019-05-23,Reneging Research Internship 1 week before it starts .. help?,phystocs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bs9yoz/reneging_research_internship_1_week_before_it/,"Hey everyone! I'm a freshman, and I switched my major this past semester from physics to CS. I made a post a couple of weeks ago asking if I should drop my particle physics research internship and search for internships in CS.

Most of you guys advised me to just sit tight with the physics internship and do CS internships in my following summers, but i went ahead and applied to a few remaining unfilled internships in my hometown. I actually received some interviews, and I just recently passed an onsite interview for a data science internship. They gave me the offer this morning, but my physics internship starts Monday next week (May 27 - plane tickets and lodging has already been set up). 

This is a very difficult situation, because I did not anticipate receiving an offer this late. I am afraid that it is too good to pass up, though, since it's a well respected company and will improve my coding/CS skills way more than the physics internship. It seems like it will set up me for receiving a great tech offer for next summer way better than the physics internship. However, reneging so late is super shitty and would reflect poorly on me professionally. I am rationalizing this to myself by saying that I don't care to close doors in physics since I won't pursue careers in that field, but I hope this wouldn't come back to bite me in the ass. 

Pay wise, the physics thing pays $5000 for the summer. I would make about $10,000 with the data science internship. But I guess internship money at this stage doesn't matter too much.

Anyway, what would you do?"
bsb823,35,2019-05-23,Plug for my school (Williams),writingpumpkin03,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bsb823/plug_for_my_school_williams/,"This was inspired by the amazing post about Bowdoin made recently :) I think exposing students to the idea of top LACs as an alternative to big universities is a wonderful idea. Idk if calling this a 'plug' is accurate, I really just wanted to write about my honest take on Williams for juniors on A2C trying to make college lists. But I wanted the titles to match soooo here goes. DISCLAIMER: I’m not yet a current student.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a ton of metrics and statistics that I could cite about Williams (or any other college), but in my experience that hasn't been as useful. Rather than talking about endowment or student/teacher ratios as pure statistics, I want to show how those things impact a student's experiences there. Everything I've written below is subjective and curated from my own impressions of the college as well as what I've learned from talking to other students. It's all random, basically just whatever's popped into my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

* There is a **ton** of money floating around on campus. 
   * Not in terms of student body wealth (although there's that, too--saving that for another bullet). I'm talking about funding for student research, events, and other ventures, both big and small. If you want a research position in a lab over the summer, you'll be given one and paid generously. If you want to head down to NYC or east to Boston, the college will give you money for food and transportation. Need a suit for an interview, but it's too expensive? The college will cover it. Your internship doesn't pay enough? The college will make up the difference. All events on campus are dirt cheap and subsidized, or free. Music lessons are free. Heck, if you wanted to protest against the college, they would probably help you fund that too.
* Really similar to the last bullet, but the financial aid will come in clutch if you qualify. It's mainly the free textbooks, lab supplies, and art supplies that stand out. Budgeting for textbooks is such a big source of stress for so many students, and not having to go through that is huge. 
* The campus and facilities are super nice, but the dorms could be better. 
   * For all the money they spend on massive libraries and shiny classrooms and eCo-FrIeNdLy landscaping, they could set aside a little for dorms. They're definitely livable and decently comfortable, but there is also room for improvement. Ditto for the food--edible and fine but nothing special. 
   * But otherwise, it feels like all the buildings are either renovated and brand new even if they haven't touched them in years. They recently dropped 200 mil on a new science center.
* Williams College and Williamstown are one and the same. 
   * Outside of the college campus, you have a street with businesses, some streets where there's off-campus housing as well as resident's homes, and the Williams Inn. That's it. 
   * In terms of restaurants, you have a nice Thai place with bubble tea, an Indian place, a Mediterranean place, an Italian place, and a super bougie coffee shop. Not a ton of variety. 
   * However, you are surrounded by jaw-dropping mountains on all sides, and you're never more than a short walk away from nature. And the valley really *does* sometimes turn purple when the sun sets--not exaggerating! 
* **Academics.**
   * Williams is generally an intense and rigorous place, in a good way. It's nothing like UChicago or Columbia or JHU--there's no stress culture or competitive atmosphere. However, the professors demand very high levels of engagement and performance from students in classes, and it can be a lot of work. You won't be *super-*stressed, but you will feel pressured to do well, and the intensity is not for everyone. 
   * That being said, Williams offers a lot of cool academic opportunities. You have Oxford-style tutorials as well as the Oxford-Exeter exchange program, and you also have Winter Study where you can decompress and take pass/fail classes.
   * There's a lot of flexibility regarding taking classes. The distribution requirements are very loose, and a significant portion of students (40%, maybe?) double major. 
   * The most popular majors at Williams right now are economics, math, and biology (in that order). But apparently that's a bit outdated, as the number of CS majors has skyrocketed, and CS may surpass economics as the most popular major there.
* **Social Life.** As I'm not yet a current student, I can't provide personal anecdotes, but this is basically what I've heard so far:
   * There's a definite social divide between athletes and non-athletes. It can be exaggerated, but it's there. There's no animosity or anything, it's just that athletes spend so much time with their team that they don't hang out with outside groups. It also varies by team--certain sports like track and field are really well-integrated into the student body, while others aren't.
   * Contrary to popular perception, the campus is not really that preppy. There are many wealthy WASPs around, but I saw no one wearing conspicuous brands, and it is highly uncommon and frowned upon to flaunt ones wealth. But as I said before, there are many rich people, and that definitely influences the campus environment. 
   * Despite the small size, there's a lot of variety in the types of students on campus. Athletes, artists, thespians, activists, preprofessional types, intellectuals. You can find your niche.
* Williams generally has great outcomes for students after graduation.
   * Recruiting is really good on campus, especially considering its small size.
   * The alumni network is very engaged and responsive. A current student told me at Previews that if they send out emails to 10 alumni, at least 8 will reply without fail.

I, a CS student, was asking another intern how to fix some network issues. He started using terms I didn't quite understand on a practical level (for example, he was talking about the DNS cache, and while I knew what that was on a theoretical level, I didn't know how to handle those caches on a practical level, including how to clear a cache). The other intern looked at me as if I should've known this stuff and I was really embarrassed afterwards.

Should I have known how to deal with all that stuff? My program is a lot of coding (something I don't do in my job, unfortunately, but it was the best internship I could get) - I didn't learn much of Computer Systems or Networks, at least, not from that practical aspect. I could explain what the DNS is and what the cache is for, but I had no idea how it was managed through a computer.

I suddenly don't feel confident that I can get a job as a software developer, in part, because I'm really winging this job, and in part, because all I can get are IT positions and no software development internships."

I am currently having a really rough time in Physics 101 and am contemplating intentionally failing the class. 

I am currently taking Calculus 3 and Physics 101. 

I spent a lot of time on campus this semester running my club, participating in others as well as Running my own event and helping run another event and running a campaign. 

I have around a 65% in Calc 3 and I have around a 60% in Physics. 

For calculus 3, I know I have a shot at passing, I just have to study more. For Physics, I kinda gave up after spending my spring break studying for a test I ultimately failed catastrophically on. The concepts are very abstract to me and I feel the need to get a tutor to help me out. 

I know if I crank it into high intensity studying, I COULD MAYBE pass physics. But I could also fail it, and fail calc 3 (Since studying time would decrease for calc 3)

Or I could stop studying for phsyics, or not spend as much time on it and go all out for calc 3 to possibly get a B. 

My overall GPA is a 3.23 and Anymore C's will just hurt me when trying to transfer. I already have enough Cs as it is. 

I don't feel comfortable trying to get a C in physics this semester because I know I need a solid foundation for the second and third physics courses (Which I currently lack)

I'm in a dilemna where I see Phsyics 101 as a sunk cost fallacy. 

The drop for a W date has passed. So If I do drop the class,I will get a D or an F. (I can always retake for a chance to get a B or an A)

I currently landed an internship with a startup company so I do have some positives this semester. 

I just bit off a lot of things to do this semester. 

Was wondering what you guys would do if you were in my position? Thanks."

I was recently contacted by a technology startup for the post of Data Engineer. The first telephonic round was conducted 2 days ago with COO of the company. However, the next round is scheduled with the data engineer intern, which was surprising for me. I went through that guy’s profile and found out that he is a 2017 graduate, and is doing some course in data science. 

I have a professional experience of 2 years in software development, and wanted to get into the data engineering field since that area interests me. I also have hands on experience with big data technologies.

I wanted to have some kind of mentorship in my next job since this job (my second job) will likely shape my career the most as an engineer. But I have some doubts about this company. They could have arranged the interview with some experienced person. I think most likely they are building the team from scratch, and that’s why they scheduled the interview with an intern.

I also went through some of the reviews of the company and there are many that said the salary wasn’t paid on time.

I am confused. What should I do?"

I just need to write it all away.,TheNameIsDragon,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/bsei8m/a_year_too_much_i_just_need_to_write_it_all_away/,"I'm in mobile so I'm sorry for formatting in advance. Also sorry for any mistakes, English is my second language.

So a bit over a year ago I feel like my whole life collapsed, and even if I got out of most of it, I'm going through some minor things that woke up the whole drama of the past year.
I've been a difficult sleeper all of my life, I never knew what was wrong with me but I was always tired in the day and awake at night, to the extreme. So I started to go to a special centre where they could study my sleep to find a solution. I'd have to go there once in a while for a talk or a test. Turns out my biological clock is messed up and tells me to go to sleep at 4am and wake up past 10, and I need only 6 to 6.30 hours of sleep, if I sleep more than that I get nightmares. A lot and usually crazy realistic ones too. So I've been given some exercises to reprogram my sleeping schedule in a sense.

So far so good, I finally got an answer to a life long issue, but it wasn't easy to get it fixed. I first went through a break up that messed me up really bad. Next issues started with my family, which still haven't been solves. Long story short, my uncle and aunt have locked themselves into the house and havent left it in a few years now. They have managed to keep this hidden from the family with the excuse of work as well as living in a neighboring country, so visiting them isn't exactly arround the corner. And I'm the only healthy adult in my family (i was 20 at the time, I'm 21 now), so naturally most if not all of that came down on me. And I had no way to say no, as the worries about my uncle almost got my grandmother a heart attack. She's getting older I know, but I'm not ready to lose her yet. 

In the mean time I'm in college and fighting for my education. Due to the sleeping issues I already had to take a half year delay for my own wellbeing, as with the pressure of college and lack of sleep combined at was standing on the doorstep of a big burn out. I had been able to avoid the burn out, luckily, but I didn't quite get the rest I needed with al of this going on.

Then one night I got into a fight with a good friend of mine, I don't even remember what it's about, I think she said something I didn't like and I was hurt. Not too long after the fight I got a text for their partner that my friend had fallen into a coma. Appearantly they have a illness to do with the regulation of temperature in their body, and the stress made her overheat and she suffered some brain damage from it. In the meantime their partner blamed me for it, and soon I blamed myself too. She eventually came by and she suffered some memory loss but the damage wasn't too bad given the circumstances. But still this messed me up to the point of not leaving home for a few weeks. Luckily summer break had started.

At the time I was very budy running an online community for a game, it was my one distraction in this whole mess, but guess what, that collapsed too. I am an artist, so as you might guess, it got taken advantage off. I did some things for free and put together the whole website page for this group. Till this day my name is in every single page of their website, and yet they pretend like I didn't nothing good for them. I ran this 200+ people community practically on my own as the leader claimed the rewards for the work I did, and all I got was harrasment online. Eventually I quit after months of being virtually shat on for an expensive job I did for free as a hobby. This cost me about everyone I had online. Sure I wouldn't put too much faith in online friends, but still, they could have just let it die. I didn't need to get insulted or hurt first... Right? But I guess everyone believes what they hear first, true or not.

Now let's return to the friend who had gotten into a coma earlier, just disappeared one night and returned months later as if nothing happened. And this wouldn't be so worry some if her last message hadn't been that she didn't want to go on anymore. I spent months worrying and even looking up online if someone by her name had died or if I could contact any family member whatsoever. But there was nothing, no one to contact, no one I could reach. Turned out everyone I knew arround her, and her, had taken off to another country. I was glad she's save but from there on I honestly didn't want the contact anymore. Not after she didn't seem to understand at all that I had gotten worried about her and she even cussed me out for it, saying that's my problem.

So things started to look up for a while, I got into a better place and did much healing that half year after the last incident. And recently I even started dating again, which sadly has come with its problems. Not between me and my boyfriend, but me and my friends. Both of my best friends have given me a lot of trouble for it. The first one thought i was going crazy on the dating department because I went on a few dates with another guy a bit earlier that half year (3 months before) and had mentioned liking someone (still in a very low key way) at one point. I was sad they weren't happy for me and told them that I just didn't like their comment. This struck a wrong note and ever since then we have grown appart. He was once my best friend, and I still love him very much, but I just don't know what to do with someone I can no longer be honest with. Its just speculation to be honest but I do feel like his girlfriend not liking me that much may play a role in it too... And my other best friend told me he loved me, and if I wouldn't marry him in a certain time span he'd kill himself. What am I to do with that? How can you claim to love someone and then put something like that on someone? That's not love in my book, that's selfish.

So naturally after that I started to connect with some other people, I've found people who suit me much better. Just a few years older and a bit more mature. People who are warm to be with, but the friendship is still new with many and so I'm careful to really open up.
In the mean time my old friends criticise me for leaving them and getting all these new people and how I'm wrong for doing so, not realising it's only making me feel more betrayed. While at the same time I get rejected every time I ask to hang out as they have others. And this is where I am now, I don't know who to trust anymore or who to rely on in times like these.

Currently I'm in a great internship I have a lot of fun in, but I don't get payed so I'm out of money with no time for a job on the side. I don't know if I can pay for food at the end of this month.
And to come back kn the sleeping, I had it fixed. I had my schedule fixed, and now in 1 week its all gone. A years worth of progress gone with the wind, and I just don't know what im doing it for anymore. And I don't have any friends i can really talk to this about. Yes I have my boyfriend, but I don't want to burden him. He knows about this and we talk about it, but it's just not enough and I needed to just write away.

I don't expect anyone to read this and if you did, you deserve a prize for that! I don't know what but you do. Go and eh... Treat yourself to some icecream, nice weather is coming up.
Thank you, goodbye, whatever it is you say after a bookwork like this."

I was recently contacted by a technology startup for the post of Data Engineer. The first telephonic round was conducted 2 days ago with COO of the company. However, the next round is scheduled with the data engineer intern, which was surprising for me. I went through that guy’s profile and found out that he is a 2017 graduate, and is doing some course in data science, and seemingly doesn’t have any software engineering experience.

I have a professional experience of 2 years in software development, and wanted to get into the data engineering field since that area interests me. I also have hands on experience with big data technologies.

I wanted to have some kind of mentorship in my next job since this job (my second job) will likely shape my career the most as an engineer. But I have some doubts about this company. They could have arranged the interview with some experienced person. I think most likely they are building the team from scratch, and that’s why they scheduled the interview with an intern.

I also went through some of the reviews of the company and there are many that said the salary wasn’t paid on time.

I am confused. What should I do?"

Incident 1:

I have a family doctor that is great but his staff is abysmal. A couple of years back I got an internship at a hospital and Since my medical records were water damaged they wanted me to get a couple of vaccinations just in case. I was one of one hundred who made it, of the one thousand that applied.

 I went to my family doctor for the vaccinations. I went in and requested to get vaccinations. They said no problem and me gave me a date. I have a deadline on the vaccinations which was about a couple weeks out so I was fine with setting an appointment the next week. 
Come by to appointment the doctor comes in and asks what I am there for. I inform him, I was there presumably for vaccinations. He said we would get them ordered. They tell me it will be a little bit and I'll get a call when they arrive.

I wait a week, no response, I go inside. They sent them to the wrong facility. The deadline is steadily approaching, and I tell them I NEED THEM. They said they would overnight it. Wait that overnight come back. No vaccinations. Deadline the next day. Deadline hits, no vacs, get booted. Vacs come in the day after the deadline....

Incident 2:

I got into a really bad car accident a while ago. And recently I went to the doctor to see if I had any physical back problems as my back is now always in moderate pain, and with activity severe.

 I also have pain in my chest ever since the accident. I told them about this, doctor said it's probably just you growing to the chest pain. And with the back pain he sent me to get imaged. I got my back imaged. And they said it would take a week to get the results. I wait longer than a week.

Never get a call. I call them I tell them I recently got imaged and was wondering if my results were in told them my name age and everything to confirm my ID. Put me on hold for an hour then hang up. Call them back tell them it's the same guy, wondering what's wrong with my back, I get told it was just the way that I stand and they hang up. No explanation nothing. 

My back only started hurting after the accident. If it is the way that I stand I would understand if it's something from the accident like a wounded dog shifting it's weight so it doesn't put all it's weight on a hurt paw.  But they said nothing, no real information just the way that i stand. So I haven't really gone to another doctor since I don't have access to change my doctor.

So my question is, do I have any kind of recourse to any of these?"

I'm going to be vague about my details because I don't want reveal where I work and speak negatively about my company.

So I'm 33 year, married man. Graduated in 2014 with a media arts major from a school that was attempting to put together a game dev program at the time. I mentioned my age for two reason. One, I want to start having kids but I can't afford and two, it took me a long time to complete school and now I'm under crushing student debt with a very niche degree.

My senior project is a 2D platformer that I made in Unity, with an anti-bully message because my prof at the time told me that this is my chance to work on my dream project because at no other point in my life will I be able to make the game I really want to work on. I'll come back to why I regret working on my project later. I used visual scripting through Playmaker to script over half the game because I'm not very good at scripting. So as far as being a game designer, I'm better at designing puzzles or levels.

There were no gaming or multimedia jobs where I was living so I moved to a much larger city across the country a year after graduation. Another year later, I finally get hired through a staffing agency to work at a AAA studio as an Administrative Assistant. Everyone has heard of the games that this studio releases, so I was very excited to start here. My primary responsibilities include reception work, order/distributing snacks, groceries, other supplies as well as other administrative tasks.

Back to why I regret making my 2d platformer in Unity. My company works on 3d games that are more action oriented, and my portfolio piece is useless when it comes to convincing my job place to move me up to level design. It doesn't help me in finding a job anywhere else either because not many places work on 2d platformers. Most places that hire want 3d work. So my portfolio is pretty blank.

I've been working this job for 3 years through a staffing agency, hoping it would be a stepping stone to get into their level design team. I've talked with, and made friends with some of the level designers. In my spare time, which is hard to make spare time due to hours/coming home exhausted especially during crunch, I've used the mod tools for one of the previous games (current game has no mod tools) and worked on making some buildings and attempted to start working on some maps. It's still not much though.

Late last year, I applied for our intern program. I got through the first couple of stages, but once I got to the test, which involved drawing a top-down map for a multiplayer shooter and other essay questions, I didn't pass. It had more to do with how my test compared to the other candidates and they explained what I could have improved.

I had a meeting with the team lead for level designers about a month ago to see if there's a possibility to open a temp position so that I can prove I can do the work. He told me that they have zero head count right now. He looked at what I have been working on, and basically he said it's not impressive yet not terrible. Said I need to should him a top down multiplayer shooter map so that I can display what I know about design.

I've been working on this and will be presenting him the map soon, but I'm losing faith that they will hire me since people have been leaving, probably because we're in between games. It doesn't seem like they are opening more positions soon, especially with all the interns that are starting up next week. I'm trying to apply at other places but I just don't have an impressive portfolio.

I don't really know what to do with myself. At this point, I'm starting to give up on my dream to be a game developer. My job can be done by a highschooler and I hate that I'm the ""snack guy"" for my work place for 3 years. I also feel like it's too late for me to do a career change. I thought about changing to physical therapy since this is something I've been researching a lot lately due to my back injury I had a few years ago.  I can't afford to go back to school nor do I have the time to take classes on the side for a certification. I'm just in the awkward position where I feel like I dug myself in this hole, that attempting to get my into this dream of being a game dev, and now I'm unemployable as one or any job that would make descent money.

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE:**

Thanks for all the input. I appreciate how understanding most of you have been. I spoke to my wife this morning and I'm going to talk to some schools and see what does it take for me to get into physical therapy. Like how what degree I would need to get, how many of my credits would transfer over, how much will this cost, etc.

I'm going to start applying for other places. I already submit an application to a smaller gaming/fitness studio that works on games for stationary cycles/treadmills. One of the former QA guys from my workplace currently works there. Says they pay much more, great work environment, and that he'll try to push my application to priority. The position I applied for is an ""environment artist"" but it's their equivalent to a level design. Even if I get this job, I'll still do school part time to get into physical therapy. If I don't get this job, I'll keep applying for other places."

Want to know if I there's anything I can do to get them to reconsider or if its even worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for a position with this company back in November 2018 while I was in my last semester of college and they told me they wouldn't be interviewing for a while. Just a note that this company hires a ton of new graduates. During the interim, I networked with several alumni who work at this company currently during the time in order to prepare and boost my chances of at least getting an interview.

Come May 2019 and they email about wanting to set up an interview, I go in and do an interview with 2 separate people. One asked questions about my technical skills while the other was the generic behavioral questions. I think I did pretty well on conveying my skills since the interviewer seemed to take a lot of notes on specific commands or functions that I know. The other interviewer who focused on behavioral questions had a packet of questions with blank spaces to write stuff down on the right and at most, they probably wrote 3 words down about my response for 20% of the questions they asked me. So I probably failed that part pretty badly.

I send thank you notes after the interview and they get back to me the next day with a rejection letter. The usual ""we have decided to pursue other candidates at this point in time"". I was devastated to say the least. I saw that they had an internship for the same position available as well and that the rejection letter was sent by a recruiter and not an automated system, so I replied and asked if there was any way that I could be considered for the internship. It's been 3 weeks and I haven't heard a peep back and saw that they posted another posting for the exact same position that I got rejected for. I told the alumni that I networked with and they were dissapointed that I didn't get the job and offered their words of support and whatnot. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a company that I really wanted (still want) to work for since it's in an industry that I like and I've heard nothing but good things from people who work there.  I've been working as a temp since I graduated, but the company I'm at doesn't have room to hire me on full time, so I've been heavily searching for a job and this was one of the few interviews I had in over 100 applications. Goddam is it frustrating to finally get through college only to still be stuck going nowhere in life.

Is there anything else I can do or should I just give up on this company/job?"

However, they were very upfront about when they wanted me to start and seemed to be in a rush, texting me things like ""call me ASAP"" and they would keep calling and calling. So, I emailed them my resume and whatever, flash forward a month later, I start getting calls from them again, I am not answering because I may have something else lined up. It is just really weird to me because they said they would to a background check and drug test me, but the way they approach recruiting people is pretty ""sus"" to say the least. I just don't know if they are a scam and if I should avoid them, or if I should keep them as a backup if my other thing doesn't work out. Thanks!

bsi9mr,0,2019-05-24,Vacation time renegotiation,SprocketWhisperer,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/bsi9mr/vacation_time_renegotiation/,"I am hoping someone can lend advice to me. I'm current quite unsatisfied with my present allotment of time off from this job. I'd like to avoid feeling like my only option is to get another job or borrow vacation time.

I was an intern at the company where I presently work at the start of my career. They did not hire me straight out of college, but I ended up getting the position some years later after gaining much experience. I have been here 3 years since returning and I still have the lowest amount of vacation time. I feel this is unfair because I have the experience of an industry veteran (some 5+ years as an engineer).  In total I should have 3rd tier vacation time (about 4 weeks by now and I've only got 2).

My question is whether it would make sense to try and negotiate more time based on my ""service"" which I believe should fairly be from when I started as an intern. This would be in consideration of me even agreeing to come back since the place has really gone to hell, and I have rescued several projects having left a very profitable, highly respected position elsewhere to return to my almar mater. I even proved my worth the first day by helping deliver a product I hadn't touched in years because I still knew what to do when the next senior person had no idea.

Fast forward through a couple of very difficult, seemingly endless, years of product cycle and I have been offered two jobs since I began here and refused both times. I did not seek a counter offer because I'm under the impression that this is bad form. Is there any point in bringing this up now? I don't want to just ask for a counter offer from yet another job offer which could be soon anyway if things keep getting worse here. I also could just borrow vacation time if I really wanted, but it I feel underappreciated and bitter to have less time than junior people with far less experience.

Thanks in advance folks."

bsii2y,2,2019-05-24,I'm healing....I think,Valkyrie7431,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bsii2y/im_healingi_think/,"(English is second language so sorry for grammar) My mental health problems go back all the way to when i was in elementary school. By that time i got diagnosed with autism. Around that time it was also diagnosed that i had dyslexia. The combination of both these made me really insecure about everything. This was also around the time where i started to get bullied heavily ( i was about 11/12 years old ) and what was left of my confidence got basically turned to dust.  My parents were divorced and my mom worked a 12 hour a day job so i didn't want to tell her i was being bullied. 

Until i came home with a black eye and bruises. That is when i told her everything. I'm not sure what she did but the bullying stopped for about a month until it started again but this time more sneaky. The kind of stuff where if the teacher was gone then they would trap you against a wall and call you names and when the teacher returned they acted normal and left you alone. 

Then i went to middle school. I chose a school that none of my old schoolmates went to so i could kind of start over again.  But yet again, bullies. This was also when i had a lot of insecurities cause of puberty and all that so the bullying hit almost twice as hard as in elementary school. At first i tried to ignore them and close myself off to it but it never worked. I started to get depression and cut myself. I was about to reach my breaking point. So when i was walking to my classroom ( I always waited for the teacher to show up until i entered class cause it lessens the chances of me getting a face-full of comments)  and the teacher entered i couldn't take it any more and had a full breakdown. I started crying in front of the whole class and the teacher. The teacher send me to the counselor and she talked to me until the end of the day. I told her everything from the bullies to the signs of depression and everything. She personally made sure that all bullied were spoken to separately and that they were gonna be taken care of. But again. It never truly stopped. 

Now the bullying was only happening outside of school trough social media. By that time i had a YouTube channel so it was easy to get to me. Most of the comments were like ''Go jump in front of a train, i dare you'' and ''Little kid can't even fix her own problems, always getting teachers involved'' I deleted everything shortly after and i'm scared to start anything again. 

I was happy when i went to pick up my diploma at the last day of school. I never had to see any of the bullies again as again i went to a school that none other went to. Now i'm in high school in a class with no bullies at all. I went trough a lot of therapy over the years both for my autism and my depression. I still go to the school counselor once every week on Monday to talk about how last week has been and if i needed to do any school work for that week and when i will do it. Basic stuff. 

I also have to thank a very special person who helped me. When i was at one of my interns, a dog daycare, an older women ( Let's call her Ana ) was the founder of the place and also my mentor for the intern. Ana taught me how to read a dog's behavior and how to talk to the owners when they came to pick the dog up. Ana helped me gain a bit of my confidence back by the time i worked with her. She told me storied of how she did a pilgrimage and walked all the way to   Santiago de Compostela. I was fascinated by her story and she inspired me to follow my own dreams. Ana also taught me simple stuff like how to safely cut an onion and what plants are good combined with others. 

The only part i still worry at is that even now i still suffer from bullied. I have been left with heavy anxiety both in general and social situations and i'm always scared that when i text old friends that i annoy them. I have a friend, if you can still call it that, who i haven't texted in 2 years cause i always think she will get annoyed at me. She was the friend i had since elementary ans she helped me get trough the first set of bullies. 

I'm turning 18 in a month and i'm so not ready for the responsibilities of adulthood. I don't even have a job! I live with my mom who i, since the last years, have had a lot of fights with. I wish i could go to my dad but his girlfriend hates my guts cause my dad loves me more than he loves her. I only see my dad once a week. My sister already lives on her own with her boyfriend but she lived a half hour car drive away from me but she has no room for me. 

I now spend most of my days on games as that is where i can be perfect and where i decide over my own life. Though sometimes i wish i did better things with my childhood. I wish i never stopped my singing lessons. I wish i never stopped writing my own songs. But i know i will never have the confidence to start again. 

Thanks for reading my little life story. Writing this down got me to tear up with all the bad memories and bad decisions i made but thanks anyway."

* Studied in the UK for 4 years and got my MEng from Imperial with a 2:1 in Chem Eng - Oct 2018
* Was unable to find a job in the UK, so came back home to Sri Lanka since my visa expired (international student)
* While I was at home trying to look for ways to apply overseas, I decided to do some things to pass the time like learning new programming languages, did a short 3-month internship because I got pretty bored as well
* Fast forward to now, 24 years old, May 2019, where I'm just stuck and not sure what to do.

Chemical Engineering jobs in Sri Lanka are very, very few in number. And those that do pop up won't take on entry-level students. There's probably 1-2 graduate schemes that I've heard of that run over here as most people get jobs through connections which I don't have. This isn't limited to chemical engineering jobs either because job boards for graduates are almost non-existent here.

A future in Sri Lanka for the kind of jobs I'm looking for (Chem Eng or consultancy) seems very bleak, so I've been trying to look into getting a work visa to either Australia or Canada and perhaps applying directly from there. Are there any other options for me? Feeling pretty lost right now and don't want to waste any more of my time that I'd look back on and regret.

Any advice would be appreciated."

I went in today to interview and figure out days and aside from not getting paid which I knew they want me to go to every school in the town and take inventory of all their computers. 

I have a huge issue with this as I have just recently *yesterday* lost my paying job. They do not offer compensation for the miles in anyway and I'm having an extremely difficult time rationalizing using my savings to go school to school for these people. I can meet with them Tuesday to see if they can compensate me for miles but I'm not counting on it. 

Should I just pass on this internship? I know experience is really important and I don't have many other ways to get that experience but I was under the impression I would be at the school learning something well useful not doing work that should clearly be given to someone who actually gets paid to be there that revolves around a personal expenditure.

I was thinking Tuesday I just let them know I won't be able to drive school to school for them because of my financial situation and leave it at that. Be extremely polite and professional. I don't think an unpaid internship is worth damaging my personal finances and putting miles on my car for which is already in tough shape and might need replacement soon. It wasn't until today I was told I would have to be doing that so it is very out of left field."

bskbcg,1,2019-05-24,Joined a consulting team that immediately lost a contract. How do I put this on my resume?,520ErryDay,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bskbcg/joined_a_consulting_team_that_immediately_lost_a/,"Hi everyone! I'm in a bit of a strange position in my career. Let me briefly explain.

I graduated with a degree in Music Education back in 2015, decided to return to school for Computer Information Science in 2017, got an internship after three semesters last summer, and then accepted a job offer as a business process analyst before completing my second bachelor's. I was at this job for a year when a global consulting company working on a high-profile project in my hometown headhunted me and offered me a better position working on this state contract. I accepted the offer and put in my two weeks.

Well, one week ago, one week after I put in my two weeks, the contract got cancelled by the state (I guess it was pretty controversial. I wasn't totally aware of this and I should've done more research before accepting the position). Some higher-ups at my old company were offended by my decision to leave and even though my old manager and her boss wanted to keep me around and were happy that I wanted to stay, the vice president and executive wouldn't let me retract my resignation. 

So now I am starting the onboarding process for this consulting company, but the team is transitioning off this project in the next 90 days, so I am looking for another job in the area.

I have so much uncertainty and so many questions about how to proceed. I'm not actually tied down to this city, but I would like to stay. How do I include this on my resume while I am looking for jobs in the area? I don't really have any experience with this company, but I want to start my search for a new job now so I'm not left unemployed or forced to move to another state after the 90 days.

Any thoughts or guidance is appreciated. I've never been in a situation like this and I don't want to let this affect the career trajectory that I've been working so hard to earn."
bskjdt,14,2019-05-24,"Is my boss asking me, an intern, for too much?",rbb091020,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bskjdt/is_my_boss_asking_me_an_intern_for_too_much/,"I got an internship at a web application company that does many CRUD apps. When I was interviewed, I was asked about my interests, which include machine learning. I never claimed to be an expert or even good at it. I’m just interested in it, and trying some language processing projects on my own at home. 

For the first week of my internship, all the new interns (6 of us) are trained in JavaScript, C# and asp.net for web applications. This week (second week), I’m assigned to a machine learning project. “Cool!” I thought, they listened to my interests during the interview. Without going into a lot of detail as to keep the company anonymous, basically I need to train a model to detect moving objects from a video stream and count the number of times these moving objects do certain actions. The application is for a research team which is going to send us videos of the objects in action, and we’re supposed to build a website that gives them our findings. 

It sounds really interesting and I’m excited to start, but come to find out I’m the only person in the building with any semblance of python and ML experience. All of the other interns are working on projects with literally dozens of examples, we literally copied and pasted from old code to make new webpages or modals or whatever we needed. They also have the advantage of having multiple lead engineers that they can go to for help. My lead doesn’t really care to help me because my project isn’t imminently due and he has projects that are due soon. He sent me to a sentdex YouTube tutorial to learn. He said he was able to do it after a couple days, but he wants me doing it on the gpu configuration which was wayyyy more difficult to set up. That tutorial is the extent of his ML knowledge. He literally said “I don’t know why I’m on this project.” Essentially, I’m on my own. 

I finally got my model working after three days to detect the images in the tutorial, and my boss came to me this morning and said now he wants me capture not only how many times the objects do the actions, but for how long, what’s their velocity when they move near the other objects, etc. He wants me to make an API for it so we don’t “expose our code.” I’m not even sure he knows I’m following a YouTube tutorial, or that I’m on my own. He keeps saying yeah, “your lead can help you.” Then, he wants me to set up some sort of data consumption model so that when the research team sends in videos, we can charge them based on how much data is consumed. 

I’ve spent three days trying to just configure the gpu to run Tensorflow, which if you’ve tried on a Windows machine is a nightmare. My only resource is YouTube and stackoverflow. Another lead who’s been giving me some help and emotional support said he’s gonna look at Tensorflow this weekend, but that’s the extent of the help I’m probably going to get. 

Am I being asked too much? From my understanding, most of the ML models are done by true experts in the field with masters and Ph.D’s. I have like a year’s max worth of experience in python, and virtually none in ML, zero in object detection.

Is what I’m being asked to do reasonable for an intern?"

You have finished your junior year of high school. You probably finished taking your SAT/ACT, finished AP testing and finally are very close to kicking it back and taking a break from everything. Don't worry, you can stop snoozing your alarm every single morning and sleep in. But hey its the summer before your senior year. You are almost at the finish line. Never fear, you will be fine and next year at this time you'll know where you are going to go but also saying a bittersweet goodbye to your closest mentors and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Juniors you are applying for the class of 2024, I do have some advice for you for your upcoming year. Take a break but start preparing for the marathon that is slowly approaching.

&amp;#x200B;

Searching for a college. Start looking at colleges and create a reasonable list that includes safeties, targets, and reaches. If you don't know where to start, go to websites like Quest bridge (even if you don't qualify) to look at different schools or look at the US ranking website. You probably will see schools that you may have never heard before and might really want to go to. Now, listen I know you probably want to catch up on the TV shows you have put a hold on or even hang out with your friends over the summer or might have summer programs, internships, and jobs. Don't worry. Everyday spend around 10-15 minutes searching for a college and see what you like about it. If you do this for 15 days, you'll know about 15 more schools that you might want to go to. Also, make sure you apply to your state school just in case. You never know what will happen. Even if you hate your state school, have a backup.

&amp;#x200B;

Essays. You might dread this part or love this part. PLEASE START EARLY. I regret not and honestly that cost me a lot towards the end. Read past prompts from the schools you found and start a new note on your phone and think of some ideas. You do not need to write paragraphs maybe just a few sentences or lines. As long as you start and have some ideas jotted down, you won't be freaking out about what you need to write about, rather how you are going to write it. The more time you put into it, the less time you will have to invest later when you are bombarded with AP classes and extracurriculars. Try not to think about being extraordinary, just be you! Also, do not delete schools just because of the essays. For 300 words you are passing on the opportunity of going to an amazing school. Just do it and submit it! In terms of essays, try to spend one day of the weekend writing one or two essays and you will have time to revise. I missed out on 2 of the schools I would have loved going to for the essays. (Applying as a transfer next year !)

&amp;#x200B;

Plan. When senior year begins, it flies. You have so much on your plate, that days fly into weeks and before you know it, its already Nov 1, Nov 15, and Jan 1. Make a plan of your week. Assign days where you will do your apps, homework, extracurriculars. Though you might think it's a lot of work, it takes 5 minutes to write out your weekly plan. It will help you a lot, and I wish I would have done this!

&amp;#x200B;

More tips. Don't compare yourself to your friend that is applying to every single Ivy League school. Everyone is different. We have different brains, personalities, and paths. That is why so many schools exist because they are so many different fits. You never know that the one college that you haven't heard of yet will be the one for you.

\- If you want to ED somewhere, start early and finish early. You want to put your best application in and take your best shot.

\- If you don't get in to your number one choice or your number eighth choice, remember you can always transfer!

\-College is just for the next four years of your life. There will be so much more after college. At this point in your life, it seems like the biggest thing ever but really theres more coming at you.

\-HAVE A GOOD TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy. I was so stressed for college applications and tests, homework and school. Time flies faster than you would have ever thought .Spend time with your friends, family, and teachers. This is the last year where you can sit with your parents and go to school or spend the night out with the friends you have known for so long. Cherish these moments because they will be gone soon. Go out for a drive, spend time with the ones you love, and have a dance party for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck to you and you are going to do great!"

bsozqt,4,2019-05-24,Not sure if committing Medicare fraud.,Throw12341away,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsozqt/not_sure_if_committing_medicare_fraud/,"state: RI

I am a pharmacy student on my rotations (essentially mandatory unpaid internship).  The pharmacist I work for is funded by insurance company ""A"" to work in a primary care clinic to provide pharmacy services. His funding is renewed every year on the basis that he performs a comprehensive medical review (CMR) on 95% of the patients who use insurance company ""A"".  A CMR simply reviews all medications a patient is actually taking and how they are taking them. With the info he gets from a CMR, he must identify medication problems and provides reasonable interventions that will (at least in theory) save the insurance company money in hospital visit costs and other medical expenses down the road.  Insurance company A is primarily funded by Medicare, as it offers a large proportion of the states medicare plans. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is, the pharmacist also registered his pharmacy services at this clinic as a pharmacy on OutcomesMTM. OutcomesMTM identifies  high-risk patients who use a pharmacy (in this case high-risk patients who come to this primary care practice) who may need additional medical monitoring and management. OutcomesMTM is also based around a CMR and includes interventions made for a patient.  For every CMR + intervention submitted for a patient,  OutcomesMTM will bill that patients insurance a percentage of the total estimated cost savings made from the intervention and pay the pharmacist. 

&amp;#x200B;

What Outcomes says about inelligibility: 

        ""Pharmacists cannot bill for an MTM service in the Connect™platform if they have billed for that same cognitive service elsewhere, including but not limited to:
    •CPT codes (e.g. MTM services) 
    •HCPCS codes (e.g. Transitional Care Management, Medicare    Wellness Visits, Diabetes Self-Management Training/Education)
    •Incident to billing
    •Specific contracts with private payers""

I believe the arrangement my pharmacist has with insurance company ""A"" falls under the fourth bullet. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, he still uses OutcomesMTM and has two pharmacies registered for this practice. One pharmacy he uses to file claims for insurance company ""A"", and another he uses to file claims for all other insurance companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what I am afraid is an issue is that when he bills for a patient with insurance company ""A"" on OutcomesMTM for the CMR he completed, OutcomesMTM is then charging insurance company ""A"" for the same service he was paid to complete with his yearly funding.  In essence, his is doing one CMR + intervetion, which he uses towards his 95% quota (what he is paid for in advance) and then takes that same CMR + invervention and bills the same insurance company again through OutcomesMTM. 

&amp;#x200B;

I confronted him about this already. His response was: ""I have a friend who works a \[insurance company ""A""\] who doesn't release the list of individual names who come up when OutcomesMTM bill \[insurance company ""A"".""

&amp;#x200B;

Is this legal? and if not can OutcomesMTM come after him if they discover what he is doing? and could I be held liable if I'm completing CMR's for him and sending them through OutcomesMTM on his behalf?  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Pharmacist performing one service for a patient that he gets paid for in advance by their insurance. He then bills again for the same service for the same patient through another company, that then bills that same insurance company. Also the insurance company is primarily funded through Medicare."

I really want to go to UCF for CS, and I was wondering if having a internship will help. If so where can I find a web developer internship, what should I do? I plan on doing the front-end ( HTML, CSS, JS )."
bsqnog,4,2019-05-25,UFT or UOIT?,sakshi116,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/bsqnog/uft_or_uoit/," 

Ok so i got into the University of Toronto Missisgua for computing science, dual degree with math, and I also got into Ontario Tech University for honours computer science. I heard that the school you go to does not matter. I heard that marks matter the most and you learn the same material at each school. Both programs offer a paid internship, so ill be getting the experience I need. Is this true? Should I go to UOIT, get good grades, and get the experience I need. Or should I go to UFT and get okish grades for the school rep. UFT is one of the top computer science schools. don't you learn the same material everywhere you go? Does the school you go to really matter? Don't marks and experience matter more?"

First time posting on Reddit, I'm usually just a silent lurker. Sorry that this long, I could really use some awesome, blunt opinions (by blunt I don't mean rude :P), and I think someone here can give some pointers.

The Backstory:
Here's my dilemma, I currently work for a nationwide telecommunications company. I'm the rep on the phone you call when your equipment isn't working and I troubleshoot. I want to get into the IT field, so I thought this job would be a good step towards that goal. I spoke to a guy in the IT department and asked his honest opinion if troubleshooting cable boxes would count as IT experience, as expected, his honest answer was no. And I can see why, I'm just sending signals to the box and troubleshooting over the phone, and guiding the customer thru how to solve stuff. I'm not the field technician, so it's not real hands on troubleshooting experience. Also it's a cable box not a computer lol.

The Offer:
Long story short, I had a bad time in college bc of my anxiety so I flunked out of all classes except 1 with a WU. I have a 0.55 gpa and only 3 credits. Only 1 class i passed a rlly easy one too, Sociology at my local community college. I dont have the funds rn to jump back in and my financial aid is put on hold since my gpa is less than a 2.0. So i have to work on an appeal to get it back and explain why i failed my classes lol.
SO, in the meantime I came across a program that offers free tech training, troubleshooting computers, working with code, hardware/software, and I thought, ""hey this is awesome! I can do this while i work on the appeal"", its a tech fundamentals class for 23 weeks, 16 weeks training, and 7 weeks guaranteed paid internship at a company, and it usually turns into a job i heard. (Not banking on it but it would be nice). I applied and got the interview this coming Tuesday, excited but nervous.

The Dilemma:
The program time wont be compatible w my work sched, the times they have is from 9am-1pm or 2pm-6pm, and my work time starts at 1pm. I asked for a sched switch to 3pm but was denied 3x by HR, my supervisor, and manager, until now. I was given the switch (i said for diff reasons), but its only for a month! This class will be for 6months. 

I interviewed at fedex for package handler and another job which i will do in the meantime if the sched switch cant be elongated, but i feel bad if i have to leave my current job. My mom likes me there and my job already has high turnover bc its a call center. So i was thinking if i am accepted to the program, a reason why i dont wanna leave just in case im not, I would take a job that better fits my schedule. The fedex one or another evening position i applied to. But fedex background check might take 2 weeks. My job is rlly tight on sched changes and its funny bc when i applied i was ""guaranteed"" 3-12am but then got 1pm-10pm -.- another employee told me its just to make ppl accept the job.

The Question:
Do i take a chance, do the interview and see if i get it? And if i get it, either bargain to extend the time for 6 mths (highly doubt they will do) or do I go take the other fedex job (i was offered just need background check results), and do that and the program if im accepted?

Im stuck between a rock and a hard place :( any suggestions I'd rlly appreciate!

Thanks Reddit peoples.

&amp;#x200B;

I created a service built off Shopify that delivers groceries from wholesalers (Costco and BJs) to college students. Saves time, money etc. We made an Instagram that has about 90 followers. So much enthusiasm from students when we hand out flyers, or through DMs on Insta or Linkedin. Are the produce prices high? I did a comparison and they weren't. Don't have to carpool, very convenient. Way more people volunteer to do work for free, than actually buy something, which is interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

The site just doesn't feel legit, no matter what I do. Like I wouldn't buy from here. And it's so painful seeing people haul groceries as they walk by the flyers I've left up. The only food delivery service I wasn't reluctant to use was 7eleven's app, maybe it's the color purple.

&amp;#x200B;

I originally saw someone do this at UCLA when I was there, then I called him and he had done it at multiple schools before, and I thought why not my own city. He had 40k in revenue in 2 months, and my home city is way denser.

&amp;#x200B;

**The funnel**

Landing page &gt; Page containing all categories &gt; Category Page &gt; Product Page &gt; Checkout

**Timeline**

* March 23rd: Launched as [fensly.com](https://fensly.com)
   * Created Instagram account and got about 1,000 visitors just off that
   * URL got banned from instagram.
* April 16th: Rename as [Droped.Co](https://Droped.Co) (better related to the service)
   * Redesign site based on feedback from some local tech CMOs. Having CTAs, including promos every other section, ie. how it works -- promo -- example items -- promo, etc. This actually reduced the drop rate from 85% to 64%.
   * Handed out 40 flyers, 28 people viewed the site
   * Stopped updating the IG at all as students left for summer and it had no results (but our best results in terms of traffic). I felt that IG was too in personal enough to develop trust and for someone to not think it's a scam from like India or something.
* May 4th: Left about 400 flyers around campus and hung some up to
   * Leaving 400 flyers led to about 10 visits
   * Hanging up flyers near one area grocery stores led to 10-30 visits a day for two days (until they were removed). The other more expensive grocery store had about 4 visits and was never removed.
* May 17th:
   * Remove all but one promo from the site
      * I just reviewed it and it's actually 80/752 that go from landing page to either the page containing all categories, or directly to a category page. After that those people go to the home page and view other sections
      * I thought it wasn't leading to people going to the next step of the funnel.
      * It made the site look cluttered and the service more complicated as I was trying to remove and create things to giveaway just so I could maintain section &gt; promo &gt; section &gt; promo.
* Going forward
   * Starting an internship in another city in a week. Will pay a friend to do deliveries when the time comes.
   * Will add promo's every other section. Will change free delivery on all orders over $30. Then have a free delivery on all orders for a limited time. This makes free delivery seem like it's worth more and creates urgency.
   * Will rely on stickers around campus to build trust, and IG to gain traffic.
   * Considering changing the domain to [schoolnamecostcodelivery.com](https://schoolnamedeliveryservice.com) and leaving stickers with just that all over campus."
bsthw6,7,2019-05-25,MIS student here. I want to GTFO of my country. What is the way to go?,fut-13,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bsthw6/mis_student_here_i_want_to_gtfo_of_my_country/,"Hello /r/ITCareerQuestions,

I'm a Management of Information Systems undergrad at a private university in Egypt. My degree is accreddited.

I want to GTFO  of my country after I graduate. Problem is I have zero experience meaning my chances are slim to none. I plan on doing a summer internship next year to get some experience.

I am here to ask how I could increase my almost non-existant chances of being hired abroad? I legit don't care where I end up, as long as I'm out of here. (I've already lived abroad in many different countries growing up  so culture shock and all that won't be a problem.)

Anyways, I went on stackoverflow and looked for jobs that sponsor visas for junior level people. Most of the jobs were front-end/backend/fullstack.

However, I've been reading on this sub that having AWS knowledge &amp; certs is a highly demanded skill..

There's also the master's route, but my parents said they wont be providing me any money after my bachelor's. So I'd need to somehow get a full-scholarship from a university abroad, which is near impossible in my case since my GPA is only 3.4. (Does anyone know any master's programs that provide full tuition for accepted students?).

**TLDR: What should I learn, practice, master, and showcase to increase my chances of getting a job abroad?**

A. Learn front-end

B. Learn AWS and obtain certs

C. Do something else?

Edit: Are there any countries out there lacking IT professionals and are willing to hire foreigners with minimial to no experience?"

I've  taken 2 gap years and I'm going to apply for Fall 2020. I should mention that I will be needing almost full financial aid and I wish to study Computer Science/Engineering. This is my profile:

Academic:

1. SAT 1: 1470 (projected)
2. SAT 2: Math II - 800, Physics - 780 (Already taken)
3. TOEFL: 110+ (projected)
4. GPA:  We have a really different system in our country, it’d be tedious to explain the whole process here. I got 5.00 out of 5.00 GPA  but it's calculated differently than it is in the USA.

ECA:

1. Started  an online clothing business based on Facebook, with my sister. It’s  going strong with 6 employees and we plan to establish a physical shop soon.
2. Interned at a Group of Industries in the position of Software Developer
3. Interned at an IT company in the position of Web Developer  
These two internships will speak for my gap years.
4. Founded Computer Club and English Speaking Club in High School
5. Patrol Leader in High School Scouts
6. Student Counselor in High School
7. Every year, I along with a few of my friends organize underprivileged/poor kids to teach them about computers and smartphones.
8. Every winter, I along with a few of my friends distribute warm cloths, blankets to homeless people.  
Additionally, a couple minor ECAs.

Recommendation Letters:

1. From my counselor who is also my Chemistry teacher
2. From my ICT teacher
3. From my English teacher  
I am expecting some excellent letters, I have a very good relationship with them and they like me very much.

Essays:

1. About the business I mentioned earlier
2. About a unique scouts camp that I attended in my junior year

As  you can see, I have a so so profile and my requirement of financial aid puts me in a disadvantages position. I have my eyes on the Ivy League universities as they are usually need-blind but I don't think I  have much chance at those with this profile.

My peers also advised me to look out for LACs as they usually give out aids to international students.

How much weight does the school I attend for a CS degree carry?,OllivanderAU,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bsupz5/im_leaving_medicine_next_week_and_looking_to/,"So I'm currently a physician assistant student considering withdrawing from my program for various reasons. I will thankfully have no debt. My plan is to pursue a second bachelor's degree in computer science. My first bachelor's degree was in finance with a heavy amount of pre-med prereqs thrown in. I currently have around 180-190 total credit hours. I could go to the small state school I got my first bachelor's degree from and only have to take 59 credit hours (including hours for an internship) to earn a degree in computer science. This is an appealing route for several reasons. Those being I could work part-time while attending courses, I could heavily mitigate the cost and possibly not have to take out any loans by working part-time, it's fairly inexpensive in comparison to all online programs (both BS and MS), it has a small student-to-faculty ratio, I would have no cost of living because it would be taken care of, and I know the majority of the courses would be taught by professors that are ""easier"" than some larger programs/universities. I include this because it would mean I wouldn't struggle as much in some of the difficult math courses, and the whole point is to get to the finish line and obtain the degree so that I can use it. The drawbacks of taking this route are obvious. It being a smaller program means it has a smaller footprint and network to land me a solid job out of school. That means more leg work on my end. Secondly I'm worried about the lower prestige the degree will carry if I ever decide to apply to a bigger company. It being from some no-name state school in the Southeast may hurt me in the longrun. Do the drawbacks of having a smaller network/footprint and less prestige outweigh all the benefits here?

&amp;#x200B;

The alternative is to go to a larger, more well-connected program to pursue a second bachelor's. The downside of this route is cost of tuition, having to take out loans, having to pay for cost of living, more rigorous courses that may attempt to weed me out, not having a small student-to-faculty ratio, and it would be a lot more difficult to graduate in 2 years since it's more competitive to get the courses you want each semester (ie: registration priority). The upsides of this route are prestige, great network and connections, good job placements, good internships.

&amp;#x200B;

From strictly a being in school standpoint, I feel as though the smaller state school will provide an easier time navigating through school and earning the degree while keeping costs down. However, when I start looking for internships and jobs I'll have to do a lot more leg work myself to make things happen. I don't know how much the degree will matter after I land my first job though. The larger school will definitely be able to land me very good interviews with larger companies, provided I can get through the schooling.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice anyone can provide me with would be greatly appreciated! I'm in a really bad place at the moment feeling like everything I've worked for over the last 7 years has been such a waste, but I'm trying to stay focused and look forward. I'm trying to keep the ball rolling and make a quick pivot so I don't lose more time than I've already lost. For reference I'm 27 years old."

So I just finished my second year of uni and am beginning my prep for the upcoming grad application cycles.

My current situation is,

Sprint internship (Will be started in jan 2020 not in time for application cycle/ Moved summer one due to personal reasons)

Work experience from 2016

400 leetcodes solved + CTCI/ADM (mostly medium)

blue on codeforces (Only done it for a little while)

On track for 1st at non prestigious uni

1st round code jam 2017

1st round facebook hacker cup 2017

Have a referral at FB 

Bunch of personal projects

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is I have no internship or top uni on cv, I dont want to lose my only referral chance if I am unlikely to get an interview with them.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is try try and place well in code jam/ hacker cup 2019 and use them to get interviews, I made it to the first round last year and would have competed again in it this year if circumstances had let me.

&amp;#x200B;

If that fails then I take a job at a midsize company (Manager at upcoming internship told me its 100% certain return offer provided I dont burn down the company) and then stay 2-3 months before using my referrals in 2020 summer with a bit of experience and some more programming comps to get interviews then.

&amp;#x200B;

Or

&amp;#x200B;

I can apply to the big techs this cycle with the referrals and hope they interview me but risk losing them for future.

Guess what?",eatmenlikeair,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/bsvrq2/when_i_attempted_suicide_at_13_i_promised_myself/,"I attempted suicide at 13 and began the journey of emotional instability and depression. I jumped off a 4 story building before starting undergrad at 17. I broke my legs and started the first couple of month in a wheelchair. It took me 5 years to finish undergrad at a school where I lost more friends then I manage to keep. I miscarried a child by a boy who was a complete asshole. I forced myself to stay single for 3 years since the miscarriage. I ended up meeting a guy who ended up being addicted to pills, gaslighting me that he wasn’t seeing someone else, and convinced me that we’ll eventually be together after we broke up for a year.


After years of self deprecating behaviors, I managed to convince myself I didn’t deserve good things. I am a cancer survivor and I believed that I internalized the idea as a child. I felt guilty for being one of the few who survived. 

It was the fall of 2015, I was single for almost 6 months. I managed to cope by drinking everyday. 

I wanted to commit suicide by using the money I had saved up from a retail job to buy a one way ticket to San Francisco. I wanted to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. It was about 2am and I was strolling through the internet. I paused and asked for the Universe for a sign, and I came across the quote by Neil Simon that changed the trajectory of my life. 

It says: 

“Don't listen to those who say, you are taking too big a chance. Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine floor, and it would surely be rubbed out by today. Most important, don't listen when the little voice of fear inside you rears its ugly head and says ""They are all smarter than you out there. They're more talented, they're taller, blonder, prettier, luckier, and they have connections."" I firmly believe that if you follow a path that interests you, not to the exclusion of love, sensitivity, and cooperation with others, but with the strength of conviction that you can move others by your own efforts, and do not make success or failure the criteria by which you live, the chances are you'll be a person worthy of your own respects”

I cried so much that night. 

The following Monday morning, I got up, took my medication, and went to my favorite coffee shop when it opened. I began the process of applying to my dream schools that I told myself when I was younger that I would never get in. 

Fast forward 3 years later: I got into every grad school program I applied. I began graduate work in 2016. I graduated in 2018. I lived in Southern California for almost 7 months for an internship. I traveled to the middle east and Asia. I’ve met some of the most amazing friends I could ever ask for. I also found a love interest as well, but I am waiting the right time to tell him how I feel. 


Long story short: Please don’t ever give up. Never in a million years, I would see myself doing what I love, and also having this amazing support around me. I’ve lost people on the way, but I manage to be thankful for everyone who ended up staying. Everyone has a unique “lightbulb” moment. For me, it was a Neil Simon quote. 

There were times that I absolutely believed I couldn’t make it. I  believed it was impossible task and I was thinking too big. Perhaps those “thinking  big” thoughts were the healthier side of my brain saying, “You are capable of it. Please don’t do hurt yourself. i believe in you. Even if you fail, you’ll get back up, and try again”.

So when I celebrate my 33rd birthday in August in 2025, I am going to go to Golden Gate Bridge and just walk across it. I’ll visualize that scared, depressed, 13 year old version of myself and I’ll hug her and  say that everything is okay. You are safe now. 

Thank you so much for reading this.

Edit: Hello everyone! Thank you for your words of encouragement. I just came back from hanging out with a best friend and was shocked at the amount of support. Please seek help if you’re struggling. I can say it confidently because I am a licensed therapist and my own experience dealing with my own demons. I understand the warning signs and when you’ve hit the all time low from both a clinical standpoint and a personal one. There a couple of things I want to change about vulnerability and mental health. I wish we can make vulnerability viral. I wish we can talk about it honestly. I’ve worked with victims from Sandy Hook and kids who’ve struggled with sexual assault in NYC. The most common theme is being scared of vulnerability and being judged for it. We need to talk about mental health seriously. Pass your vulnerability and love to another person. 💗"

- B.Sc. in Business from top European school, with relatively good GPA (~3.4)
- 760 GMAT (50Q, 44V)
- 3 years at MBB consultancy with &gt;50% of projects abroad
- Several extracurricular leadership positions during school, but almost none after school
- LoRs from Partner and Project Leader at my company
- Several internships at top consultancy, investment bank, startup
- Post MBA goal is transition into analytical role in digital platform company

I‘m thinking about applying to Berkeley, Sloan and Columbia. My current view is that Harvard, Stanford, Wharton might be too much of a stretch. What do you think? Is it worth a shot?"

I brought it up to 3.3996, and if it's not what they need, do you think they'll rescind the offer? I turned down all my other offers my the time I signed."

In about a year and half, I’ll be graduating with a bachelors degree in computer science and minor in mathematics completely debt free.

&amp;#x200B;

 

My goal is to move to Chicago (I have a great group of friends there) or Denver. I’m leaning towards working in machine learning/deep learning as an engineer/programmer as I have an interest in advanced mathematics OR I’ll look at some SWE jobs for Python/Java. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not considering a masters/graduate school immediately after college but I may go back in the future if an employer paid for it or I had enough money to go back to school. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What are things I can do to maximize my chances of getting a great job? I’ve interned as NASA so far and my goal next summer is to intern at a Big N like Google. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So far these are the things I’ve been doing to try and get ahead of most college grads as I know I’m going to need to do more than most college grads at my school is not prestigious or known for CS and I know that school alone is not going to teach me enough. 

* taking MOOC’s from schools like Stanford 
* Working on personal coding projects to put on my resume and GitHub portfolio 
* Getting involved with open source to put on my resume 
* Coding a personal website that has my resume and work on it 
* Grinding leetcode for the inevitable coding interview when I start applying to jobs after college 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What are things I can do to maximize my chances of getting an awesome and high paying job after college even though I'm attending a no-name university?



Edit; Ton of awesome replies thanks everyone that’s shared their advice and opinions. Seems like I need to spend less time doing open source and creating a website and get more on my leetcode grind. If anyone has specific leetcode tips or any other advice I really appreciate it!"

So I'm going to have a lot of time to work, I'm wondering if I should attempt to find a full time job and try to sneak in without having my degree yet, or if I should look for a fall internship. I've basically got until the end of July to try to figure this out before my lease is up.

I am CS student in Canada who got a unique opportunity to study abroad in Denmark for a few months in 2020. I was hoping I would be able to network a bit in Denmark and Sweden and maybe be able to apply for a few internship positions, that I would be able to leverage when I eventually apply for a permanent position within the EU.

What I was wondering is that since I am a non-EU citizen, I am aware of the hiring laws within the EU that state that there must be a search first for an EU citizen to fill the position first. Ideally I would like to land a position in Sweden however are market trends in the EU more in favour of the job seeker? Or is there a lot of competition for iOS positions.

Failing that I would also love to work in Front-End, I know the 3 main techs + React so I think I'd be alright even if I had to learn Angular or Vue.

Thanks again, this sub has been really helpful"

I started CC in 2015 but...I had an unexpected death (malpractice) and then that internally killed me, was hospitalized, nearly had a mental breakdown due to stress, lost my grandfather, got in a bad car wreck, and etc...long story short my college life has been horrible. I am getting ready to transfer soon. Yay!!!! However, I was suppose to graduate last year along with my friends. Some of my friends took 8-9 years (for various reasons) to graduate and they're the sweetest people I know. However, for me. I have an opportunity to intern with NASA but I am not sure if I should go for it or not because it would hold be back a bit (maybe a semester or so). I would be about 25-26 when I graduate so it would have taken me about 7-8 years I think to finish school. I feel ashamed and unmotivated. I feel embarrassed and like a failure. My friends are already married and have jobs. I can't even get a guy to like me or my crush might not like me back let alone get married. My aunt in a different country keeps putting me down, yelling me, comparing me (she keeps saying how people my age she knows have already graduate from top schools), and etc.. She told me to just change my major and pick something easy so I can get my degree already. Granted I have a harder major than my friends (I'm Computer Engineering) and they're like advertising, public relations, communications, liberal arts, and stuff. The only thing that I am proud of is that I am not in debt because I pay for school all by myself and I have to work to pay my own bills. I have been working since I finished high school so I have more job experience than my friends. In my mind I'm like ""what if employers look down on me? what if I can't find a job? what if the guy I like won't date me because I don't have my degree? what will I do with my future? is this worth it? I feel ""too old to be in college"" if you will. Has anybody gone through the same thing? Any tips or advice? Does it get better? How much will it hurt me? Have you been through something similar?

bsypjr,0,2019-05-25,Rough Start On Software Engineer Path?,Valcruex,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bsypjr/rough_start_on_software_engineer_path/,"I've been applying for full-time positions since September, and getting rejections left and right since. Honestly, I was doing pretty bad in my first few interviews, but eventually got better and began doing pretty well (at least I thought it was, even made it far in the process for some of them). I was foolish, and didn't try for any internships until my senior year, and had a TA position at school and a local webdev internship at a small local firm. I have just graduated and during the final month of my undergrad, I finally received a software engineer position offer, but from an IT consulting firm (a WITCH company).  The pay would be about 60k, with lots of relocation, and barely any career progression in the company (based on reviews). The pay is not as much as I was hoping for but I accepted for now since it's all I have.

&amp;#x200B;

What I feel might have been damaging during my job applications, is that I spread myself very thin in my undergrad studies, from web development, very basic data visualizations, game development, etc. without taking a full dive into any of them. Since I honestly do not have that much experience with actually creating or working on software products, would this be a good stepping stone? and would it be worth it to stay with this company for a year or two to get more experience, or would my time be better spent continuing the job search and working on personal projects in the meantime?

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, my concern is that this would be a rough start to my software development career and affect future opportunities, and I'm not sure if being patient and continuing to apply for other jobs instead would be better or not."
bsyt0t,131,2019-05-25,1 year long job hunting with a happy ending =),rivereto,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bsyt0t/1_year_long_job_hunting_with_a_happy_ending/,"Hey!

I  see many of you desperate because you are hunting for a job for a few  months and thinks that you'll never get anything good! Well, I\`m here to  tell my story that has a tragic beginning but a happy ending!

&amp;#x200B;

A  little bit on my background: I am a latin american woman (so definitely  a minority) and English is not my native language, and I only started  to learn English when I was 15 and still today I don't feel 100%  comfortable with it. I got my CS degree from an average school last year  March and I have research experience (1 year) within a laboratory in my  University and an internship at a well known company that I got through  Outreachy program (program designed for including minorities in tech,  see details here: [https://www.outreachy.org/](https://www.outreachy.org/)).

&amp;#x200B;

I  thought that because of my experience, I would get a job ""just like  that"" after school. I started to apply to everywhere, but I get none  response, I don't know how many applications I've sent out that  time  but for sure it was 3 digits or close to that - which shows that it  isn't true that you as a minority can get any interview/job just because  tech companies want to increase diversity.

&amp;#x200B;

Last  year\`s may, I saw a post on some forum for women in tech, a RedHat  recruiter saying that she was willing to help some people to fix their  CV's for free (as a way to give back to community what she got), I  messaged her and I scheduled a skype call with her, she gave me A LOT of  usefull feedback. I put some feedback into practice and I got two  interviews with no name companies, but none of them were succesful.

&amp;#x200B;

A  few weeks later I saw that Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Tech  had a scholarship application open for Women of Color to go there for  free! I applied and I got selected! I was so excited to go to the Career  Fair! I got even more excited when I got an invitation to go to a  Google private event. Maybe one mistake that I did at the fair was to  focus too much on Google, but work for a bigN company was my dream, and  Google even more! I got the opportunity to talk with many Googlers (who I  still have contact) and they gave me a lot of feedback on interviewing,  I learned a lot from those conversations!  I got an interview with  Google and moved on to on-site round, but unfortunatly I was rejected  (they said that they will interview me again in 18 months, we'll see).

&amp;#x200B;

After Google's rejection (in November), I paused applications because I got  really sick! The problem was serious (it was an hormonal problem, not  related to job search or unemployment) but fortunately the medicins  needed were not expensive. In February I was feeling already again, and  started to send out CV\`s to many places (not as many as before, because I  also learned to better filter my options), I got 5 interviews this time  and 2 offers! One from an Startup, and the second one from Amazon, I  accepted Amazon\`s offer! I'm really happy because I'm going to Amazon!  Unfortunatly, I also only discovered about this sub on February, but I  get really happy when I read happy stories here! So I hope mine's will  inspire someone!

&amp;#x200B;

And  I must say that every step in this process was important, I somehow  grow as a human during this time! I\`m so grateful for every person who  crossed my way during this time! My main lesson is try to learn from  others, even more if you are a minority in tech! And you can see how  those platforms for minority in Tech works in practice. To remain  competitive during this unemployed time, I contributed a lot on Open  Source (my github follower\`s busted) and took EdX classes on  probability.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I won't give more details on myself, such as where I'm going to work (which campus) or where I'm from, since I think I exposed myself a lot already! So please don't ask for that kind of information."
bsz7rm,2,2019-05-25,Maybe my experience with timing will help someone who feels discouraged waiting for their big break despite persistence (very long),Polkadot_moon,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/bsz7rm/maybe_my_experience_with_timing_will_help_someone/,"I started my teaching program back in 2008 at the very beginning of the recession. At that time, the prospects for teachers looked great. I got accepted into a rigorous teaching program that prided itself on a 95% employment rate (meaning 95% of their graduates had a teaching job within a year). I worked hard and interned in a large district near my house. 

Even with my passion, I definitely did not start out as ""a natural."" My first internship was wonderful, but my second was rough. The evaluator from my college observed me and told me that I scored the lowest of everyone in my cohort on my evaluation and questioned me on whether I really wanted to be a teacher. I ended up completing my student teaching with my first placement mentor, and it went very well and I got good recommendations. My three years interning did not pay off though, because despite great references from within the district, they screened all candidates in a 10 minute interview with a random principal, and they decided if you were eligible to be in the candidate pool or not. The principal who interviewed me and I did not vibe well, so I wasn't eligible to even be considered by other principals for jobs at the 31 other schools. This was in 2011 during the height of the recession, so districts were laying off left and right. Districts who were hiring usually only considered experienced candidates or their own interns. I bawled all afternoon. 

All summer I made job hunting my full time job. I looked up jobs, applied, worked on my resume and cover letter, practiced interview questions, researched how to be a better candidate, and researched other districts for several hours a day, nearly every day. I got called for several interviews but they were all a No. Even with the recession, the 19 other people in my cohort all had jobs come September, and I realized I was that 5% exception in my program's employment rate.

I substitute taught the next school year, and hit job hunting hard again the following spring and summer. I got even more interviews, but again they were all a No. One in particular was a 1st grade position at a school an hour away in a slightly rural valley. Everything there felt right, from the office staff, principal, to the other teachers. When I got that no, I thought I could easily move on since it would have been a long commute, but that one hit my heart particularly hard. I also had given up asking for feedback after interviews, because the principals seemed to either ignore me or give a generic, ""someone else was a better fit, good luck"" type of response. My mom encouraged me to at least try asking for feedback on this one, because if it meant that much to me, what have I got to lose? Wouldn't you know that that principal ended up talking to me for a good 20 minutes giving me specific feedback, and an explanation of why it is such a hard market for new teachers in this current economy. He assured me he didn't see any red flags in me as a candidate, but the candidate they chose was a good fit for the team and had a bit more experience than me. He then casually mentioned that they had an opening for a part time reading assistant that paid $12/hr, but understood if I wasn't interested since I was overqualified. I met with the reading teacher and began that following Monday. Everyone knew I had been a candidate for the 1st grade job, but working with teachers wasn't awkward, even when I was in the 1st grade classrooms. 

At the end of the school year, we knew the school wouldn't have any openings. However, my principal helped me with my application materials and interview preparation. He went above and beyond and I was extremely grateful for his mentorship and guidance. I ended up being hired, but it was an awful fit. The principal was nice in the interview, but as a boss she was rude, condescending, and critical, which was especially tough as a first year teacher. At one she threatened to blackmail me by saying if I didn't get a behavioral student under control without ""bothering other staff, it would reflect on my evaluation and a first year teacher with a bad evaluation has almost no chance of getting a job anywhere within the state."" She also told me that she could see potential in me as an assistant but a teacher. Fortunately, contracts had not been signed yet and I was able to resign in the fall with no broken contract or other penalties against me. I talked about the situation with my former principal, and he had assured me that this resignation would not prevent me from employment in the future if I explained it right, which he helped me do. I ended up subbing for the remainder of that year, and got hired as an assistant teacher at a brand new private school for the following year. They ended up not having the enrollment to afford to open in the fall though so that job fell through. I texted the reading teacher I had worked with previously and told her what happened. She told me the lady who had replaced me had just resigned that day for a job closer to home, and she and my principal hired me back as a reading assistant. 

After 21 No's, an awful work environment resulting in a resignation, and a job falling through, I took what my college evaluator and the nasty principal told me to heart and settled into my reading assistant job. I loved the environment and people I worked with, and gave up on searching for a classroom teacher job. I told the teacher I worked with that I would be okay if I never had my own classroom, and didn't plan to pursue it. I did leave it open and said, ""I mean, never say never. But I don't plan to pursue it so the perfect opportunity would have to fall in my lap.""

It was the third year in my assistant job a few days before the first day of school. We were reviewing the schedule when a 1st grade teacher asked if they could see me in the office. I was perplexed as I walked with her down to the office, then my principal invited me into his office where the two 1st grade teachers sat and closed his door. He told me just yesterday they had enough new 1st graders enroll to open up another class. It was Friday before Labor Day and school started on Tuesday. They were offering me a job to teach 1st grade. I had long given up dream and was not at all in the mindset. I said yes hesitantly, only because I worried that I would always wonder what would have happened if I turned it down. My first year was hard, and I had 2 students on IEPs and several others with learning or emotional behavioral concerns. I cried every night after school but I had the support. The reading teacher told me to be prepared to fall in love, but I assured her I would be done after this year. By spring, she ended up being right and I ended up loving my job. I had no idea how something so exhausting could also be so fulfilling. 

My principal ended up taking a job at the district level at the end of the year. On the last day of school I caught him alone in the hallway and thanked him for his support and everything he did for me the past few years. He started to tear up and told me that he has seen so much growth in me over the years, and that I had definitely found my life's calling. Through tears I thanked him for helping me find it.

Flash forward to present day and I am finishing up teaching my third year of 1st grade at that school. I have made incredibly great friends who were there for me during my divorce and the death of my dogs. I still see my old principal as I have been pursuing some leadership opportunities within the district, and I am fortunate enough to have had another great principal replace him at school. I am on track to finish my Masters in December, and as hard as my job is I wouldn't trade it for the world. And the candidate who ended up being hired instead of me 7 years ago? She teaches 1st grade across the hall from me and we are very close coworkers.

Timing is definitely a thing and I truly believe what's meant for you will always find a way. Sometimes you are told to give up and lose all confidence in yourself, but as hard as it is, have faith and patience that it will work out for you one day, one way or another."

I really am intrigued by the knowledge that I would gain through working with this company, and it sucks a little bit to know that the senior engineer potentially would have hired me, but I just applied too late.

This summer is my only shot at becoming involved with this company in particular because of location/time constraints that I have as a college student. I would 100% be willing to intern for free (I applied for a paid opportunity) or participate only part-time. Is it worth following up and expressing my genuine interest in the company/asking if there's any other way that I could become involved? Should I mention that I would be willing to work for free?

I am here to ask how I could increase my almost non-existant chances of being hired abroad? I legit don't care where I end up, as long as I'm out of here. (I've already lived abroad in many different countries growing up so culture shock and all that won't be a problem.)

Anyways, I went on stackoverflow and looked for jobs that sponsor visas for junior level people. Most of the jobs were front-end/backend/fullstack.

However, I've been reading on this sub that having AWS knowledge &amp; certs is a highly demanded skill..

There's also the master's route, but my parents said they wont be providing me any money after my bachelor's. So I'd need to somehow get a full-scholarship from a university abroad, which is near impossible in my case since my GPA is only 3.4. (Does anyone know any master's programs that provide full tuition for accepted students?).

**TLDR: What should I learn, practice, master, and showcase to increase my chances of getting a job abroad?**

A. Learn front-end

B. Learn AWS and obtain certs

C. Do something else?

Edit: Are there any countries out there lacking IT professionals and are willing to hire foreigners with minimial to no experience?"

bt1ilm,20,2019-05-25,"Graduation at 35+ in STEM, no prior experience. Tough career prospects at that age?",455buick,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/bt1ilm/graduation_at_35_in_stem_no_prior_experience/,"  

At the age of 32, I’ve been thinking of returning to school.  I have a useless community college AA. I’m leaning towards doing computer engineering. I’ll be starting over essentially (maybe 2 or 3 of my older courses would be transferable).

My main concerns are related to doing this in a timely manner and balancing the workload (I’ve not been in a classroom in 12 years). I plan to start this summer with a pre-calc class—I wouldn’t be able to place into calculus 1; calculus 1 and physics 1 are pre-requisites for basically everything else that I need to take. I estimate that this will take at least 3.5 years as I plan to attend during summer as well.

I will probably be close to 36 or even 37 by the time I graduate. By that time, my only work experience will be 17 years of personal finance, so it’s basically irrelevant. I now have my own contracting business so I can easily scale back my hours to where I can do part-time, while still earning some money. Some of the advanced math classes worry me, but I think I can do it.

Most of the admissions people and advising people tell me not to worry about it, but they aren’t exactly tuned in to local hiring practices. It is commonly said that “it’s never too late to go back to school”. It’s one thing for people in their 30s and 40s to go back and get an MBA or MS and continue working in an existing field, or at least bring relevant experience with them. That’s more of a “continuing education” case versus “obtaining education for the first time” case. I will be entering an entry-level job market and competing with people who are 22 years old. While I will have the latitude to reduce my working hours, it would be difficult for me to do an internship or participate in extra-curricular activities that appear to be highly important. Should this be a real concern?  Thanks"

I have completed the requirements for my major and I'm now fully qualified (excessively qualified) to enter the professional world in my area of focus.

&amp;#x200B;

However... I have not completed all of the liberal arts requirements that the school insists that we cover during our time here. These are basically ""normal"" college classes such as lectures and seminars.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not graduating due to these overhanging credits. Initially, my course plan was thrown off balance by my beginning, and then dropping a double major, which I spent a year in. This typically has you on a 5-year graduation plan. As I only spent a year, I actually managed to cover all of my extra studio credits... but not my liberal arts.

&amp;#x200B;

Your senior year is dedicated to your thesis. Especially in my major. In fact, this is pretty much the most important project that you will do in this school (***especially within my major***). In fact, your thesis year is SO crucial, within my major, that they advise EVERYONE to petition for an exception to the academic policy and request permission to only take 9 credits as it can be an extreme hindrance to combine the thesis studio course with... literally anything else. In fact, the thesis studio is worth 9 course credits, when a normal class or any other studio is only worth 3... the only reason it isn't worth 12 credits is because that would be them *admitting* that you should spend ALL of your time on this work and *only* this work... but you should.

&amp;#x200B;

So in short, I'm behind on this liberal credits due to this double major that I briefly tried to pursue. I am also behind because I WAS JUST DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD. It explains EVERYTHING that I have struggled with in my life and it's such a damn shame that this was figured out so late. Partly due to the fact that I'm a female and we don't bounce off the walls as many of the male variety do. Unfortunately, I was also only diagnosed this semester, so I was not only behind on my liberal arts *credits* but I was also behind on my actual thesis *project* which spans the entirety of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

I wound up enrolling in one liberal arts course about poetry which seemed doable, but midway through the semester, **it. was. not. doable.** I was about to fail my thesis (and subsequently either ruin my future career or future finances having to retake it). I SIMPLY COULD NOT SPEND MY TIME ON POETRY OVER THIS WORK. This was about the time that I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on medication.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke with my liberal arts professor, and she was familiar with the heavy workload that my major involves. We kind of spoke about my not aiming for a high grade but simply to pass, which is all that I really needed. It got to the point where I was just going to have to submit the rest of the work after my thesis deadline... which would have happened had I not found out that my mother has cancer, immediately after my show. ***\*\*\*FULL DISCLAIMER- My mother is OK and will be OK! Thankfully this is a cancer that only has to be watched and will not require any kind of intervention for possibly years, but this was not apparent to me, or my family and I was depressed for a solid week after turning my thesis in... also due to absolute and pure exhaustion\*\*\****

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, **I was unable to even submit the work late.** I emailed her and explained the whole situation, she has basically refused to accept any of my work late. She will not be offering me an incomplete. All I need is a GRADE. I just need the credit. I don't care what that grade SAYS. Apparently, I have missed more than half of the classes (which I actually don't think is true and SOMETHING has to have been mismarked). I have also failed to turn in most of the work, which is true, but she did acknowledge that the work that I DID turn in was phenomenal.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I even do at this point? I am SO exasperated. I am 23. I have completed all of the work in my major. I have had jobs. I have had internships with high profile companies. I am also set to leave the country to kind of just go ahead and start my life even though I am not leaving with a degree at this moment. Fortunately, you don't really need a degree in my field. I will also be getting my degree later, probably by next spring, through taking online courses and submitting the credits as transfer credits. However, **this one class is what is screwing me over, financially, and academically. I am already taking a leave of absence, petitioning to take an extra course online as they typically only allow 4 and I need FIVE.

I am *exhausted.* I don't want to come back to this. If anything I need a MASSIVE break from academia or *some* kind of exception. To offer further perspective, this school requires that students take 6 *more* classes than *any* Ivy League school, they are looking to reduce this number within the next 5 years.

My degree is about the only thing I can put on my resume and thinking about the job search is making my depression worse.

i am 19, just finished my first year of uni. i crushed it, had the best time. whatever. i’m quite accomplished, i have had some decent jobs but i HATE where i’m working now it makes me want to KILL MYSELF (sorry TW). I am very outgoing and charming and have a huge personality too big for a small town typa ting. BUT i also go to university here during the year. 

but i just got my DREAM internship at this multi billion dollar company DOWN TOWN IN A BIG CITY. just 3h away from home. in this beautiful huge building, doing marketing and graphic design stuff, like shit i am GOOD at and don’t get bored at. 

it’s only for part of the summer, like 2 months, and i NEED to go i will never forgive myself if i don’t. 

but two issues

1.  like i’m kinda broke, like i can make it work and actually profit at the end of the day by at least 3,000$ for myself for school after 2 months of work (my school is paid for by my grandparents... i know im a privileged bitch) 

2. the biggest issue. my mom is like super fucking angry and devastated almost. she was yelling at me today how im gunna end up with no money in the city and how im gunna call her needing money and she’s not gunna give me any etc. but guys its making me SO sad to see her like this. like i’m a rule follower but if my mom doesn’t agree i’ll usually convince her but unfortunately i can’t convince her of this. 
i am very upset i hate to see her like this it really makes me cry. here are some of the things she has said: 

“You treat us like we’re expendable, you never come to see us when you’re in school. You will have lots of time to build your portfolio in your life.  Plus who cares? Who said you are planning on law school. Focus on that. a professional carrier.”

“I’m starting to feel like you hate being here.  Or don’t want to be with us. It’s breaking my heart”


like GUYS. if i don’t take this job i will never forgive myself! but my mom IS generally a very rational and intelligent person! and this is hurting me so much guys what the fuck do i do and what the hell should i say to her?"

bt5abx,2,2019-05-26,Thinking of switching from Java dev to Big Data. Should I?,elaiass,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bt5abx/thinking_of_switching_from_java_dev_to_big_data/," 

Hi everyone!

I'm currently doing the 4th year of CS BA and working my first job as Java developer (almost 5 months).

The  project I'm in is almost 6 years old. My day-to-day tasks are bug fix  and adding new stuff. But it's usually not something serious: it could  be add a new if-condition, refactor DB table, remove some code etc.

Unfortunately  I realised that probably this isn't my thing: I'm not interested in  learning new things like during the weekend, sometimes I write shitty  code, sometimes it's stupid copy-paste where I can copy-paste something  old and not refactor it at all. Also I do tasks quite slowly sometimes  and my colleagues are kinda pressing me for that thinking I'm doing  nothing but I'm trying my best!

Also  my mind is all about patterns: I'm good at solving tasks I've solved  before but if it's same task but with a little different wording I may  not recognize I should solve it the same way.

And  recently I started thinking of moving myself into another field which  is Big Data. I think I'm especially interested in becoming a Data  Analyst. **BUT**

1. I'm not the best-best with maths, especially abstract ones. Though I'm kinda ok when there're numbers :D
2. It's  kinda of hard with Big Data jobs in my region, especially Junior ones.  So I'd either have to move to another one or move to another country  (European preferrably). And this current job gives quite good money  which I'd lose if I switch. Just like kiind of stability with Java dev  job ads.
3. I'd  have to self-educate with coursera/udemy/whatever which basically would  be everything I have in my background since there're no internships  (see 2). Also may need to hire a tutor to help with maths but only if I  have enough money because sometimes I may not understand things myself  and need help.
4. Looks  like I don't have much of analytical/critical thinking. Also I have  sometimes weak attention (like may not notice some mistake).

bt5cyo,0,2019-05-26,Thinking of switching from Java dev to Big Data but not sure my mind is good for it,elaiass,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bt5cyo/thinking_of_switching_from_java_dev_to_big_data/," 

Hi everyone!

I'm currently doing the 4th year of CS BA and working my first job as Java developer (almost 5 months).

The  project I'm in is almost 6 years old. My day-to-day tasks are bug fix  and adding new stuff. But it's usually not something serious: it could  be add a new if-condition, refactor DB table, remove some code etc.

Unfortunately  I realised that probably this isn't my thing: I'm not interested in  learning new things like during the weekend, sometimes I write shitty  code, sometimes it's stupid copy-paste where I can copy-paste something  old and not refactor it at all. Also I do tasks quite slowly sometimes  and my colleagues are kinda pressing me for that thinking I'm doing  nothing but I'm trying my best!

Also  my mind is all about patterns: I'm good at solving tasks I've solved  before but if it's same task but with a little different wording I may  not recognize I should solve it the same way.

And  recently I started thinking of moving myself into another field which  is Big Data. I think I'm especially interested in becoming a Data  Analyst. **BUT**

1. I'm not the best-best with maths, especially abstract ones. Though I'm kinda ok when there're numbers :D
2. It's  kinda of hard with Big Data jobs in my region, especially Junior ones.  So I'd either have to move to another one or move to another country  (European preferrably). And this current job gives quite good money  which I'd lose if I switch. Just like kiind of stability with Java dev  job ads.
3. I'd  have to self-educate with coursera/udemy/whatever which basically would  be everything I have in my background since there're no internships  (see 2). Also may need to hire a tutor to help with maths but only if I  have enough money because sometimes I may not understand things myself  and need help.
4. Looks  like I don't have much of analytical/critical thinking. Also I have  sometimes weak attention (like may not notice some mistake).
5. My  soft-skills aren't the best :( Also I prefer reading info rather than  listening and get tired and bored of boring conversations easily (and  don't like talking lots myself). Aaaand sometimes I easily give up when  there're difficulties so it takes me some time to cool down and try  again. So I have a rather ""fixed"" mindset.

I aim to get into SWE jobs from, well, mostly BIG N. I applied for MS in ECE at CMU and got admitted for Spring 2020 intake. I'll be joining as an international student.
My interests are in computer science, so I wet my hands in many CS fields. My undergrad projects are in computer vision and deep learning. I have no real work experience, and I did the deep learning project under the guidance of a professor from another university (didn't get paid too.). That's pretty much my work experience.
I chose CMU ECE because it allows me to take CS courses from the best in the world, and also my chances of getting into CS department was really slim (especially as an electrical engineering undergrad).
Looking at the first destinations of ECE grads, many seem to get into Big N as SWEs. And this reinforced my beliefs of getting into Big N. 
I decided I'll do leetcode for the 6 months that's left in this year as it'll really help me get through technical interviews. But, as I was going through this subreditt for a while, many seemed to recommend internships as a way of improving one's chances of getting good jobs. The problem with this for me is that, I get let down for most software engg internships that I apply to, with most of them outright rejecting me without even a phone screen. I suppose this is due to my electrical engineering background. 

This is the way things are right now, and given that there's huge debt involved in pursuing a masters degree, will I be able to make it after my MS? And what can I possibly do now to improve my chances of pulling this off?"

bt8t2j,1,2019-05-26,BSOD issues. Multiple different Stop Codes. Happens at random times. I've tried everything!,NeonUFO,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/bt8t2j/bsod_issues_multiple_different_stop_codes_happens/,"My gaming computer keeps getting BSOD and I dont know why. Stop codes include  
SYSTEM\_SERVICE\_EXCEPTION

\-IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL

\-DRIVER\_IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL

\-KMODE\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED

\-KERNEL\_SECURITY\_CHECK\_FAILURE

\-PFN\_LIST\_CORRUPT

I've gotten a couple more as well, I just forgot to take a picture of them with my phone. Anyways

These BSODs are random. They come at random times, mainly when im starting up my computer after it being locked. It has happened a couple times when it was awake and running for a couple hours too, but thats rare. I can't really seem to ""trigger"" them either. 

Interesting note here too: I can almost tell when its about to crash. Usually when I boot up the computer and run discord,  the discord app turns the background grey colour and it stays that way, and after about ten seconds, the computer completely crashes and restarts. Now one time, when this was happening, I actually tried to restart my computer from the start menu but the computer didnt crash after a few seconds interestingly enough. I closed discord and reopened it and everything was fine. This was very strange to me.

Now, I've gotten these BSODs before, they've been happening for about 2 years now, but they hardly ever happen and they only come in ""waves"" almost. Sometimes i have a few clean months, and other times, my computer crashes 6 times in a row in a single day. 

I've upgraded my PC since they first started happening but nothing's changed. I've gotten new RAM (8gb DDR3 -&gt; 16gb DDR4), a new CPU (Intel i5-4590 -&gt; Ryzen 2700x), GPU (Nvidia 750Ti -&gt; Nvidia 970), motherboard and a primary SSD since these BSODs first began. I've also backed up and wiped my SSD clean and reinstalled the operating system (windows 10) yet it still happens on occasion. I use Windows 10 pro, and I use my work's Windows 10 Pro key since I work as an IT intern. I install Windows 10 Pro on every computer at my job, so I highly doubt the OS is corrupt in any way.

I've tried looking at softwares that check if drivers are corrupt or out of date and they say everything is fine. I've checked my GPU's drivers and they;re up to date. I cant seem to find the issue for 2 years now.

Can someone try and figure out the problem because I've been lost"

btc2kd,119,2019-05-26,Public Service Announcement for recent graduates,HandsomePete,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/btc2kd/public_service_announcement_for_recent_graduates/,"I suppose this is a somewhat meta post, but I just wanted to actively do an outreach post to recent graduates (high school, college, etc.) who stop by this sub-reddit and are posting looking for advice or are just lurking and reading comments to help themselves find a path. 

Obviously, it's that time of year where there are a lot of people graduating from some sort of educational institution and are feeling very lost, confused, apprehensive, depressed, defeated, unsure, or even angry. Maybe it's because plans have fallen through (e.g., you were passed over for an internship that would've gotten your foot in the door of your preferred path, you can't seem to land a job that you want, etc.), or maybe you discovered that you don't really want to follow the path your education was leading you, maybe life just got in the way due to an unforeseen circumstance or something happened that's beyond your control. 

Regardless of how you got to landing on this sub-reddit, what you feel is valid and true to you. It's incredibly frustrating, to say the least, to have invested money, time, and other life experiences only to end up being ambivalent or floundering. I think a lot of us have been there ourselves, I know I have and I'm sure I'll feel that way again in the future. 

And that's the thing, as dismaying as it may sound, is that life is unpredictable no matter how much effort a person attempts to normalize it. One discovery for me was that I got stuck on my feelings and it was hindering me from actually solving my problems because I wasn't focused on what was causing what I was feeling, I was only focused on mitigating the feeling. I'm **not** saying to completely discount your feelings, but rather, to ensure that your feelings are not completely dominating your decision-making. Being able to reconcile what you feel and what you think (i.e. feelings and facts) is a balanced and leveled approach that I would really recommend.

I also had convinced myself that whatever lame-ass job I was doing or whatever educational program I was doing was something I'd be stuck with for the rest of my life. But I've quickly found out that is not the case. Perhaps one of the most valuable things you can do for yourself is 1. realizing that you are typically in control of your path and 2. you aren't stuck forever in what you're doing or where you're going.

Your field of study, your degree, the school you went to, your place of work is not solely who you are. **You are not your job.**  Those are small facets of who you are and how much weight or importance you place on them to structure your identity is all on you. But let me tell you, I've got friends and family who have nothing else in their lives but their jobs. 

I have an aunt who effectively started the Human Resources department in a small technology company back in the 1970s. This company grew enormously and is an international behemoth. She dedicated her life to her career - traveling all over the world every week, growing her department, moving up in the ranks, etc. She's put off retirement once or twice because she has no friends outside of work, no hobbies, no kids, no pets. Just a now-retired husband who likes to golf and is very introverted. They're wealthy, but I know she's struggling now because she positioned her job to be her life. She has no idea what to do with herself and she's miserable because she put all of herself into her job.

So, what am I saying here? I'm saying that a path isn't permanent and that a singular path can lead to dissatisfaction. I'm not saying to never choose a path, but what I am  saying is that it's okay, or perhaps even recommended, to feel uncomfortable and scared to follow different paths in life. No one knows the future and everyone faces the unknown.

Finding a path, whether it's career, education, or other interests is important, but it's not the end-all-be-all. 

A few other observations I've seen on this sub-reddit is that people are often stuck in a paradox of choice or an **[analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)**. I have a friend who had a real difficult time in his life after high school because of analysis paralysis. Eventually, it became an excuse for him not to move on with his life - he worked a labor intensive, low paying job he absolutely hated, but it took him YEARS to quit because he was so scared of choosing a path - he was afraid of choosing the wrong path. It ended up being a very difficult lesson for him and he's told me he regretted staying at his job for as long as he did. Myself and other mutual friends even offered to cover his living expenses and let him move in until he found another job - that's how miserable he was, but analysis paralysis was overwhelming him to the point where he preferred to be miserable than to make the best choice he could to move on. 

Another observation I see from other posters on this sub-reddit is being subjected to the **[sunk-cost fallacy](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/)**, which basically says: ""Individuals commit the sunk cost fallacy when they continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort) (Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985). This fallacy, which is related to loss aversion and status quo bias, can also be viewed as bias resulting from an ongoing commitment."" 

I see people trapped in this fallacy both on this sub-reddit and in real life. I'm not implying or saying that on a whim, if you don't like something or are uncomfortable that you just abruptly quit or leave or stop whatever it is that you're doing. Rather, it's a tool that helps you recognize that at a certain point of inputting time, money, or effort, what you're doing isn't worth it, even if you've put in lots of time, money, or effort. It's REALLY DIFFICULT to objectively see that. 

In fact, both analysis paralysis and sunk-cost fallacy are difficult to realize and measure, but I think knowing that these concepts exist is a really good first step. Coming to this sub-reddit, chatting with people you probably don't know is very helpful when trying to get a more objective feedback. But one thing I should stress is that the help you receive is only as good as how honest you are with yourself and with others when you're seeking advice. Otherwise, you're just perpetuating a soothing lie or you're hearing what you just want to hear. Sometimes, the truth just really sucks and is terrible. I know it's been for me.


Finally, I know I've been envious of people, peers, friends, and family who seem to have easily just known what they want to do in their lives and just do it. They make it seem so effortless and easy; they seem so satisfied that it makes me want to puke sometimes. But how they really feel and how they got there is truly unbeknownst to me. Or to you. This is still an ongoing lesson for me, but learning to not to make assumptions about other people, to not think what I think others are thinking, and to not idealize their seemingly perfect situations has been invaluable for me. I really just wanted to share that. A lot of people really do put on fronts or only share the good stuff on their social media and it can make me feel like worthless crap. But, there's always a story behind it and there's always some bit of truth that isn't apparent. One of my favorites songs by Built to Spill, ""Carry The Zero"", has this lyric: 

""...and you're so 
occupied with what other persons are 
occupied with
and vice versa""

We gotta stop comparing ourselves to others. Nothing good comes from it. 

I guess the last thing I want to say is that this sub-reddit has been enormously helpful to me personally and I feel a debt of gratitude, which is why I like to actively respond to people and why I wanted to post this long post. I hope any of this has been somewhat helpful, especially to recent graduates. I can't say that I know what exactly each one of you is going through, but I can say that I've been down similar paths and have probably felt similar to you and wanted to reassure you that although life can be tough, you can make it work for you."

I just finished my first year as an intended computer science major at a top-tier CS school.

Im doing whatever jobs I can, from dogwalking to warehouse work, and Im about to be homeless. Im just praying for a big break on Youtube but I still only have less than 50 views per vid on average. 

Im doing gaming, should I branch out into other popular topics? I don’t have the equipment for face cam. Im trying to get into popular games like Minecraft but for whatever reason my computer lags even after updating Java and downloading Optifine (plus Optifine isn’t updated to the latest version of minecraft so my game crashed when I tried). Im really trying whatever I can with my nonexistent budget, and I’ve made my graphics pretty, made my own cute outro song, I post my links to related subreddits that will allow it. It’s my dream to do this for a living. Should I invest into advertising? I don’t know what to do. 

I have a bachelor’s in psychology and returning to school is no longer an option for me at this time since I really need FT work to support myself and couldn’t handle both, also no financial aid for school because Im young enough that the FAFSA doesn’t consider me in need because my dad makes too much (the one about to kick me out to make room for his new family). Something I could do with my degree is be a victim’s advocate in the criminal justice field, but I haven’t been able to break into that despite my willingness to. 

I got the only job I could on short notice which was working as a stocker in a store near my house, but I make literally just enough to cover my expenses (including rent my dad charges me and student loans) IF I manage to get more hours out of them. I’ve tried to get any FT job I can in the area to no luck. I don’t know why I can’t get hired I’m a great candidate with years of customer service experience, speak 3 languages, have a college education, and super hardworking and reliable. 

I’m a good writer and decent painter, I’ve started trying to sell paintings on the side as well. Im not good enough in my other 2 languages to be a professional translator, just good enough to work with people who speak that language. I can work my way up at the store I’m at currently but they won’t pay that much and it will take at least a few months to prove myself, which is time I don’t have. 

I’m really good with animals and have a zoo near my house I could work at but I wouldn’t be able to work with the animals without a husbandry degree or an unpaid internship for a year (which requires as many hours as a PT job). They don’t have an Education department, which is definitely what I would excel at besides husbandry. My ideal career besides youtuber is zoo keeper then curator if I was able to get a promotion. 

I would like to move away from my current city and have considered just up and leaving and living in my car till I get settled someplace else, or teaching English in Korea (but for the latter idk how paying my student debt from the US would work without money for a while during the move). But also living in my car is a problem because my back already hurts very easily after a couple of car accidents that also happened to me this year (this year fucking sucks for me alright). Oh and despite me loving nature I get rashes from being out in the sun for too long especially in the heat which is most of the year here in the American south. Idk why Ive already seen a Dr and they gave me steroid cream that didn’t help. 

I’m reaching out to everyone I can network with to try and get a job that way, especially for criminal justice. If you’d like to support my YT channel it has the same name as my account here, I’m the one with pink hair. But I appreciate any advice thank you for reading"

Also what are some good Graduate Schools for Master's in Computer Science? I know most Graduate School are Research-focused which I am not interested in.

Edit1: It seems that what I'm looking for is a Master's in Computer Science (MCS), which is more industry focused, and not a Master's in Science (MS), which is more research-focused.

Edit3: I have internship experiences, in fact I am doing one right now. Also my school is not a particularly “bad” school, it’s a top 20 National University. The computer Science program here is just not well known and does not attract a lot of companies."

Yesterday, an acquaintance from high school messaged me saying he was in town and wanted to meet up - a guy I've had ok conversations with, but I still wouldn't classify him as a friend, we didn't keep in touch at all after HS. I was bored at home last night and there was a ball game in the city so I said yes, sure. We met at around 9pm and I thought it was going to be silent and awkward, since we didn't have much in common/to talk about. 

But BOY was i wrong! He said stuff like:

\- what's your favourite sex position?

\- how many men did you fck since we last saw each other?

\- how was sex with x?? and y?? and z?? oh z told me about all the stuff you guys did

\- you have the most beautiful eyes. they're like the window to your soul

\- (pushed my hair back) you have the silkiest smooth hair

\- which guy wouldn't want to have sex with you? you're hot as fuck!

\- (incessantly tries to force me to go to a dispensary and smoke a joint with him)

\- he kept forcing me to sit very close to him by moving towards me every time i moved away

\- he forced me to stay out until about 2am, and then insisted on walking me home, after which he tried to convince me to let him come into my house for about HALF AN HOUR! it was just so difficult to get away from him and i've never felt preyed on like that in my own city!

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind my body language was showing that i was extremely uncomfortable, to the point that two girls from a group nearby came and asked whether i was okay.

FYI i'm not attracted to this guy at ALL! I would say that I'm used to getting male attention, but not from people this forward! (I hope this isn't politically incorrect but idgaf at this point: chubby sweaty guys are FAR from my type)

Now, he's forcing me to meet again and he's saying that he'll show up and my building/work if I don't go out with him.

Should I message him and tell him that I'm uncomfortable? Should I just block him everywhere? (He's doing an internship in my city so he's gonna be here a couple months)

I'm scared that if i message him he might get violent or physically try to harm me"
bti1qr,4,2019-05-27,How do I transition to a 40 hour work week?,Rare_Dark,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bti1qr/how_do_i_transition_to_a_40_hour_work_week/,"I'm so used to how university is structured. You go to class, go to office hours and study anytime that you want to. So the minimum that I would have to attend is 15 hours of class and I can study anytime. This would allow me to take a nap whenever I chose to or decide to pull all nighters and sleep throughout the  next day.

The thing about university are homework, projects and tests. Some weeks I could have little to no assignments and literally just go to class. Before the deadline of a major project, I would then wake up at 9am and keep on the coding project until 10pm.

Tests are Quizzes usually followed the same format. I would always worry about what was on the test and whether or not I would fail it or if the curve was enough. This type of thinking kept me up at night and wasn't healthy.

Fast Forward to my Internship.  I currently do not have any summer classes but I do have an internship. Waking up at the same time has been good so far and I have been making it to work on time, but I still feel that I am in the school mentality. Everyday, after work, I always worry about whats going to happen at work. I know that there is nothing to worry about, but I can't ignore this feeling of uncertainty that I was conditioned from school.

After 40 hours, I realize that there isn't much time in the day, so I should spend it on relaxing but I end up fixating on the next day. For example, on Friday, I was asked to learn .Net, so I spent all of Friday and Saturday  looking up hours of tutorials to learn this framework.

I really want to keep work within 40 hours but I can't shake off the feeling that something like a random quiz or exam will pop up at my internship even I know that there isn't one.

Has anyone felt this way before?"

Just wanted to hear some views / encouragement /advice for this poor soul who got rejected twice (2017 intake &amp; this year's intake) even after taking a gap year (of two years) working in a bank.

Here's a little about my academic background:

I graduated from TP in 2017 with cGPA 3.36 (yes i know it's bad). I applied for NTU, NUS, SMU, SIT (can't remember what my choices were then) and all of them were rejection letters, w/o any interview.

Hence, I took a gap year (2years) in a bank with internal audit with rotations to pick up different skills - business management, internal auditing, data analytics.

I thought that having relevant experiences and contributions would aid my application, hence, I applied for this years intake through DA to NTU, NUS, SMU into my preferred choices of 1. Analytics, 2. Info Sys, 3. Comp Sci.

An overview of my portfolio:

* internship at GIC while i was in TP (built dashboard for management), current apprenticeship in audit (support senior auditors for their audit tests, automation using SQL, python, Tableau)
* Some certification (CISI: Intro to investment, IIA: Intro to audit, Coursera: Data Science)
* 2 recognition awards received by management while i was working in internal audit
* organised volunteering events at work
* had awesome bosses who wrote an amazing referral letters (internship &amp; current)
* Uni Prep Programme (Eng &amp; Math) that i took while i was in TP
* those bursary / edusave awards i received while i was in TP

I thought having this portfolio would at least land me to an interview, but sadly it didn't happen. No phone calls, only the typical ""I am sorry to inform ..."" / ""We wish you all the best in your future endeavors"". I felt that it was really unfair; as I didn't have a chance to prove myself, and it saddens me to not know the reason why I got rejected.

I know I have alternatives:

* part-time degrees (I didn't know that there's an application period so i missed it for this year, will plan to take it next year),
* I did thought of overseas, but personal circumstances I can't
* tried the gap year method but wasn't in my favour ( ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯)
* find a new job (my contract with the bank is ending)

If there's any kind souls out there who knows of any alternatives / advice to help me out I am eternally grateful! :)

Cheers!"
btiore,1,2019-05-27,hate myself but whats new ( a cliche),lynlyn2000,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/btiore/hate_myself_but_whats_new_a_cliche/,"Hello, I am new to this whole reddit thing so please be patient with me. My story is similar to a lot of the people in this community, except I have no reason to be acting up the way I am. 

Growing up, I was the only child to two hardworking immigrant parents (a healthcare business exec and an computer engineer). Everything I am is thanks to them. I lived in a safe predominantly white suburb where I attended an academy for high school that had me take college classes at a junior college for the duration of high school. At my school by most people's definition I was popular. I was class president for three years, vp of the honor society, and the president of two other major on campus organizations. I maintained a 4.4 for most of high school and graduated with two associate degrees in Behavioral Science and Mathematics/Life Science. I enjoyed the dozens of extracurricular opportunities that my community had to offer.

After graduation, I spent my summer after high school in the most cliche way possible. Beach trips, parties, bonfires, shopping sprees, concerts, and boba runs. I went everywhere and spent most of my time driving around with friends in my Lexus IS250 (bought for me on my 17th birthday from my parents). To top it off, my parents paid for a trip for me to Asia. I travelled alone to the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Korea to eventually meet up with friends and do whatever we wanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

From these two paragraphs, you probably think I am an arrogant, ungrateful piece of plop. Which you are not wrong. After high school and summer ended, I did not realize the depth of some underlying internal struggles, and how they would only consume me when I began to live away from home at a 4 year university. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to begin, the university I currently attend was not my first choice during my college application days in high school, rather it was my last choice. Coming from an application based high school where every student was expected to be of high caliber and high achieving, I was constantly pressured by both school staff and my parents to be exceptional. For the most part I was until I started taking upper division calculous coursework. After struggling for a semester and barely passing, I entered the final course of the sequence and utterly failed. The rest of that year I lacked motivation and ended up barely passing most of my other classes. By the end of the year, I was rejected from universities I believed were below my standards and had nothing left to commit to expect the uni I go to now. When I first started out here, I had a stick up my ass. Despite barely passing my junior and senior years, I had a complex that I was better than everyone else at this school because it was initially my ""safety"". I couldn't make friends and did not really talk to other people who lived in my hall. I had no choice but to enroll in harder classes because I had finished my lower division coursework while in high school. I was alone and struggled in my classes, still lacking the motivation that I lost in high school. However, uni is different. It is harder to catch up once you're behind. I began failing my uni courses starting my second quarter and now my gpa is trash and I still have not done anything about it. I still have so much I want to accomplish academically and professionally later in life (specifically medical school, one of my interests that I explored via internships in high school). However, despite having such high aspirations, I lack any motivation and drive to get myself out of this rut. My parents learned about my grades and talked to me about it. I came clean about my struggles and they have been nothing but supportive however I still feel like trash. 

&amp;#x200B;

What all this has been trying to get at is, I suck. I have had a great life, full of opportunity and rich experiences and I do not deserve any of it. I can't get out of my current mentality and I have no one to talk to so I came here. Sorry if you read all of this and were disappointed. I don't know how to get better so you know how it be, I don't know if I will be around to post again but thanks for reading."

btjzer,1,2019-05-27,What should I do next year?,apost54,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/btjzer/what_should_i_do_next_year/,"WARNING: LONG POST

So...my GPA was bad during high school. About a 3.6 W. I got rejected at all my reach schools. First semester of senior year it was even worse: a 2.1 UW in dual-enrollment. Second semester I improved and got a 3.4, so I have a 2.8 cumulative. I got a 34 ACT which was average - above average at all the schools I applied to, but applying RD and requesting financial aid at schools with my parents making six figures each did not help me.

Regardless, I committed to the University of Alabama on a scholarship, and although I am grateful for the opportunity, I am not sure that committing was the best choice. The fancy honors colleges and dorms are nice, but the course catalog there looks like the one at my community college. I have struggled for a very long time in trying to find classes that would help me be engaged in my education, and I have repeatedly failed at that. I usually walk into class, screw around in a lecture, get an A/B on the exam, and the grade in the class is determined by how much of the pointless busy work I am willing to put up with. 

Anyway... my goal is to go to a school where I can take interesting classes with interesting students. Penn has a class called Existential Despair. Brown has a class called Intro to Pain and Suffering. I want to take courses like that, and not generic courses with the same five authors covered repeatedly. If I go to a school where I get a high GPA, extracurricular and leadership opportunities, internships and job offers, a social circle, and life experience, I will most likely be wholly unsatisfied with my college experience, since the entire point of going to college for me is to push myself intellectually.

This is complicated by the fact that the CC I attended is *notorious* for sending kids to those schools. I would need a 3.5 to graduate with honors from their program, but they send kids to Yale, Columbia, Penn, Cornell, NYU, Wesleyan, Amherst, Stanford, Brown, top publics like Michigan, UVA, UNC, and Berkeley, and other noteworthy schools every single year. So I would be giving that opportunity up if I left.

Alternatively, I could take a gap year. This would only happen if I had a specific schedule set up during the aforementioned timeframe, but I would hopefully do research/work/play sports (recently picked up baseball again lmao)/explore academic interests/volunteer/spend time with my family before my brother transfers and my parents move. I could also retake the ACT for a 35/36 to help offset my low GPA, and possibly ask my guidance counselor to say I would’ve been in the top 10% of my class had I stayed at my school senior year, but those are entirely different things to consider.

I really want to go to a school where I will be pushed. Heck, I wrote thirty papers this semester (is that a lot? Apparently it is... I didn’t think so.) and I’m still pining for more intense academics. My parents have recently received raises in their jobs as well, so if my brother sticks to his word and transfers to a school like Baruch/Rutgers and gets scholarship $, I could possibly be able to afford sticker price at a top school for the last 1.5-2 years. My parents assured me that it will not burden their retirement, so I believe that it wouldn’t be out of the question for me to pull something like that.

Anyway... what seems like a good option?

1. Go to Bama and get involved —&gt; stick it out/transfer if I don’t like it

2. Stay at CC the extra year, retake classes, try to transfer into a top institution

3. Gap year &amp; reapplying - submit better applications with a more thorough explanation of why my academic performance suffered (ADHD killed my GPA lol) and apply ED instead of RD to my top choices.

For those of you who don’t remember, Toon town was where Mickey and Minnie lived in the park and had everything that you would imagine would be in a real neighborhood a real neighborhood a cartoon would live in. There were houses kitchens, bedrooms, kids could even go in and microwave stuff on a little cartoon microwave. Donald Duck had a little houseboat that you inside. Goofy had his roller coaster. There was a lot of cool stuff. And although it was for kids I actually really liked it. I mean where else in the world could you go to step inside a real cartoon village. That was all until I started working the night shift there. What in the day time seemed be cute and silly quickly became very creepy when the sun went down and the guests left the park. 

I worked in custodial so I was one of the last people to go through the parks at night and unfortunately I usually had to go in alone. So one night when I was doing my rounds and emptying trash cans. I walked straight through toon town to try to get to Tomorrowland and back to the front of the park. I was finishing a ten hour day and was definitely ready to get out so I was walking pretty fast.  

Normally all of the little houses would be dark and the sound effects and stuff would be turned off. Not tonight though, I went back there and all of the lights and effects were still going strong throughout the entire area. I was dumbfounded, this was a serious departure from protocol. So, I had to tell someone about it and people were seriously going to get in trouble. I continued walking and pulled out my radio but as soon as I did… everything shut off. I then heard shuffling in the distance and thought I saw a tail go into some bushes over near the train station. I figured it was probably some racoon or something, the area back there is totally surrounded by national forests and animals turn up all the time. So I pretty much forgot about it and went about the rest of my night.

During my shift the next morning though I heard some very disturbing news about that area. A rat was found gutted and smeared all over Minnies House floor. The official story was that it was killed by an opossum or two but the amount of carnage involved seemed suspicious to me.

Anyways, it was business as usual of course. The amount of situations that could happen at this park before there is any change in operation is truly astounding. That was until later on in the early evening I saw a batch of police men and security officers crowded around main street strategizing something. For that amount of them to be all gathered in one place meant something definitely must have happened. I found one of my leaders standing on the sidewalk staring over at the group and asked her what had happened. She said she wasn’t sure but heard something about a baby going missing. I had never heard about anything like that happening at these parks so that really freaked me out. 

By the time I did my sweep later that night it was about 2 in the morning. I did all of my normal tasks but I was certainly dreading getting to Toon Town. I was still kind of shook up by the events from the night before, even though I knew they were honestly pretty much normal. So by the time I got to the area I was relieved to see that the lights and sound effects were not on. 

I approached an empty trash can in front of Minnie’s house and noticed through the window that the cartoon refrigerator was still open. I figured one of the crazy interns must have forgot to shut the door when they closed down the park for the night. So I walked inside the house and went to the kitchen to close it but when I tried to push it shut it didn’t close all the way. Fear suddenly surged through my veins. I automatically knew something was wrong. Then I slowly opened the refrigerator door and witnessed to my horror a baby inside, lifeless and cold. 

In a panic I radioed my supervisor and told him what happened. He told me to get outside of the house immediately and that police were on their way. Then a number of boxes and items got knocked down in one of the rooms behind me and somebody ran out the door. Too terrified to move I stood there and watched as a manlike thing with a tail skittered past the window.

I immediately went outside the house desperate to see what it was but it was gone. Then a few moments later the police arrived and after looking around for a few minutes grabbed me to ask some questions. As we were walking away I saw something standing in the front of the little kids coaster. I could barely make it out because it was mostly standing in the shadows but it appeared to have a hideous protruding snout. Like a human who had surgically altered his face to look more like a cartoon.

I yelled for the police to turn around but when they looked over it was already gone. Probably out into the woods right behind the ride. After my story police did a thorough search of the park and woods but turned up with nothing. Considering that the sighting of this bizarre cartoon man could only be verified by me it wasn’t taken very seriously. The baby’s tragic passing which was determined to be from suffocation was essentially blamed on the parents they said the parents weren’t looking and the baby probably climbed in the refrigerator on its own. 

Regardless of how everything turned out I’ll always know what really happened to him and lets just say anytime I’m in that area I always have my eyes peeled, for the cartoon man."

btnuh2,1,2019-05-27,Less than 6 months to prepare for the upcoming job hunting season. What skills should I polish?,bringyourstrange,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/btnuh2/less_than_6_months_to_prepare_for_the_upcoming/,"**Background:** I come from a top 100 U.S school, but still, nearly nobody out of Midwest heard its name. Up till now, I have 3 internship experiences (previous two are at small, regional company and startup, currently intern at a well-known research center). I will graduate with a DS degree in Spring 2020, even though if I have a good job offer in Fall 2019, I can graduate early too. I have never had any interviews with big companies in tech like FAANG or so due to the nature of my poor network and maybe I don't have enough experiences.

**Outlook:** I want to join the 2020 job hunting with full preparation. I found my weakness of not practicing enough for technical interviews and not enough projects to show while looking for an internship this summer. Even though I was fortunate to end up at an okay place, I need to improve my technical skills. I look forward to finding a job in either tech or consulting firm. I have some projects about Machine Learning and Deep Learning in my portfolio an am planning to take some coursera course this summer to sharpen my skills in these fields too. I use Python and R, some SQL.

Note: I am not a US citizen.

**Questions:**

1. Is Leetcode a good platform to practice for DS interviews? If not, can you give me some other suggestions?
2. I know it is hard, but how can I improve my resume to get interviews with big companies like FAANG? If you are a recruiter or a data scientist working at those companies (with a B.A), do you have any advice for me?
3. I am also looking at some consulting firms, as I have at least 1 semester at school, is there any specific course that if I take, it would benefit my chance to get interviews from them?

Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions. Any advice is highly appreciated."

I've tried to make things better even with my social anxiety issues considered. I changed my major from something probably easier to get into as I was a nursing major at the very beginning but I was scared away by some things about it. I recently graduated with a B.S in Network Administration and Information Security. I'm currently looking for a job but I'm having some trouble. I've had two interviews so far one seemed to go kind of bad because I'm not good at explaining IT just yet but the other I did much better in. I felt like I would have gotten the job because everyone seemed to like me there but they handed out a rejection letter.

I think I aroused suspicion when I omitted my second internship which I feel did not go well and I did plenty of stupid things there and even lost my temper once because I couldn't get into something to help someone and they were waiting for me.  I also had to lean on my supervisor for everything. Now I'm getting mixed advice on whether to include it or exclude it from my resume. On top of that I didn't go to a company party where the interns were supposed to show up because I was stupid and thought it wasn't required for me to go. They won't even give me reference as they don't respond when I ask.

Now I'm working at target as a cart attendant. I'm embarrassed when people I know come in and see me doing that when they work real jobs like being a teacher, nurse, or something better. Breaking my back and biceps pushing carts uphill for only 13.5 hours a week which is all they give me making $400 a month tops and I have student loans starting in less than six months. IT job market is some what hot at this time of year but I'm afraid I won't find a decent paying job 30,000-40,000k by the time it goes cold again say in September. Now I'm studying so I can get better at it and refine my knowledge and what I already know but I feel so behind I don't want to wait another year to get a job. I'm living with my parents and feel totally ashamed when everyone is out dong great things I'm stuck."
btol50,6,2019-05-27,Should I listen to my mother?,BrentleTheGentle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/btol50/should_i_listen_to_my_mother/,"Hey, so I just talked to my mother about my internship. The due date to turn in a paper is tomorrow, and my mother is arguing against it. You see, I have this monthly pay from social security due to my autism, which is important to note that it hardly even affects me anymore. From joining this internship, supposedly, that number is supposed to drop hard. And knowing how money goes around in this household, she might have to work another job. She says she uses my money to only pay for the mortgage on the house and phone bills and all other things (which is all things I use, just to clarify). But on the other hand, I need those community service hours if I want to get into a college, especially now that I forgot about the options I had during my Senior year. My school year is almost up, and I'll be a Junior next year, which means colleges are going to look at my grades and overall dedication. I've got some big plans in the future, and frankly I don't mind eating cheap stuff as long as I can start stepping towards those plans. And frankly, this is more than just wages or colleges I'm concerned about. The biggest thing I want...

&amp;#x200B;

Is to have more freedom. My mom would *never* allow me outside without some sort of supervision. She'd let me out with my friends, but that took a metric ton of talking and compromise. Now, outside all on my own, just walking around with nothing but my phone and maybe a bit of cash? She'd go absolutely *apeshit.* And to her credit, I was an absolute bastard child in my younger years (which may be due to all the childhood trauma but that's something for another day), and I think every other week I'd run out of the house just to grab their attention. But I've grown since then. I've grown but I was treated the same since I was nine years old up until around half a year ago when I actually started doing stuff against my mother's wishes. Up until half a year ago, she'd pick my own clothes for me, made me do whatever sort of chores, this and that, and I never spoke up for any of it, because whenever I did, she'd usually shut it down with something like 'I am your mother' or 'It's for your own good!'. Fucking hell, I just turned 16 and she's still pinning me down to pop pimples for no apparent reason than for satisfaction. Before she'd tell me some lies on like how if she doesn't do it, it'll turn out like those 40 year old fossil blackheads you'd see on youtube at 3 AM in the morning even though you're clearly disgusted by it. Or something about how 'beauty hurts' or some shit like that, but now she isn't even hiding it. How long did she lie about that shit now, 3 years? 3 fucking years of begging my mother to stop, and even when I'm sweating and crying she'd keep going for another 10 minutes, pin my head against a light so bright that it'd burn my eyes just so she could get a clear view of my forehead? And then after those three years, I'm left with a partially numb face and an obsession over my own pimples as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I couldn't even hang out with my friends after fucking 4 PM just cause my mother wouldn't immediately be there to pick me up because of a nightly job she had. Hell I remember when I actually went with my friends for the first time, when I departed from my tournament. It was cold and windy. The lights were still leftover from Christmas, and the cars were passing by from my school. It was a beautiful night, one filled with calming lights from the posts and falling snowflakes from above. And as I walked, and looked back at my school, and around me, I realized how free I was at that moment. I could just go anywhere at that moment and explore for myself. I realized how much control my mother had in my life, and why this is all happening to me. Because she thinks she knows what's best for me, for myself. She thinks she's entitled to my own being just because she cared for me and made me. I know she loves me, and I know she's doing what she believes is best for me, but I'm pissed. I want to be my own self damn it, she never taught me how to do anything, I had to learn it all my god damn self. When I asked 'why couldn't I pop my own pimples myself', she just shrugs it off and says 'don't grow any pimples'. When I asked her why she kept on going after I said it hurt, and how I actually shed tears, she just started laughing. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Laughing.* She laughed whenever I complained about something, either that or she got defensive and brought up the 'I am your mother' excuse. She laughed when I cried, she laughed when I burned my feet at the beach, tearing out the pieces of grass in pain. Does she really love me? Does she really love me or does she just use me? No, of course she loves me,she started crying one time and hugged me. She takes my birthday seriously, a time to celebrate. In fact, that might be the problem. She cares too much. Or is she caring but just doesn't know how to care?

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck. Fucking hell. I'm sorry for typing all this out. This was supposed to be a post for advice, but I went on a rant instead. I'll sum it all up.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr: My mom says I shouldn't take the internship because it'll make my social security income drop. In addition, from what I know, my family is reliant on my social security and if I were to take it up, my mother might have to work two jobs again. But at the same time, I want to be my own person with my own cash that I can spend on my own things. What do I do?**"
btovrh,3,2019-05-27,Working at early startup while doing my own side gig,soforchunet,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/btovrh/working_at_early_startup_while_doing_my_own_side/,"I recently left a cushy corporate job as a dev to work for an early stage startup. I got lucky, I didn’t have to take a pay cut. My goals at this job were to bank money, and learn how SaaS sales work. I’m doing good at both goals.

However, I made the mistake of not realizing how crazy the hours are. I’m secretly thinking my CEO is regretting hiring me because I move too slow and have “only” been putting in the 8-6:30 hours. 

I was put in charge of a large feature we want to launch end of this summer. Problem is, none of the previous code I’m supposed to build on top of is tested very well. I can scramble and put the feature together (which I’ve been doing the last few days) but since we’re in the healthcare domain, I’d rather slow down and make sure I cover all my edge cases and test well... 

CEO thinks I should of had this feature out in 1 week... it took me a week just to wrap my head around the code to start working out what to do. CEO has me on daily progress updates and they’re seriously stressing me out. As a senior/lead dev, I'm used to having much more autonomy, and the ability to decide what's important, and how to prioritize my time. I'm not getting any of that here. I supposed I should have asked about that prior to joining..

Also, there’s no other senior dev to lean on, he was ran out of the company after 8 months due to burn out. The other senior dev is on an extended vacation because he was also thinking of leaving.. everyone else is a junior and/or intern.

Any thoughts on how I should navigate this? I need to keep making a paycheck before I can leave for my own gig. ($16k of my $75k goal)

Options are to go look for a more relaxed job or to start doing the bare minimum until I get fired. Or totally go all in and give up more of my nights/weekends but stop all work on my own gig. I have learnt a lot about sales and marketing, and I’d love to continue soaking up that knowledge.

Also, I’ve only been at the company for 4 weeks so going this hard this early has been a surprise for me. Were my expectations just wrong from the start? Am I the issue?"

&amp;#x200B;

So I just recently graduated from college in Computer Science with some prior pretty good internship experience in field. I even had a few great interviews but failed them (atleast I know my weak-points, which is socializing).

Now there's a startup that I really wanna join (been around for 4 years only), and I learned how direct job application email is better than just regular applying-on-job-board. And so I gave it a shot for the first time (just sent an email about 2 hours ago). It was to a manager in the area where they had the job posting. I think I wrote the email quite well, included how I saw some recent talks they had and how I like their product, and then a summary of part of my experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few questions bugging me:

* What if the manager is on vacation and never sees my email in time?
* Due to above point, should I also apply to regular job-board anyway? Even though I have already sent the email.
* Would it help if I try to cold-connect to some employees on LinkedIn (we dont really have any common connections)? What if I try to cold-connect with that manager?
* How do I make sure I sent the email to right person?
* Should I also send my email again to a recruiter despite sending it already to the manager?

&amp;#x200B;

Really new to this socializing and connecting thing, and boy its so darn hard. You don't have to answer my every question; I would really appreciate any insights.

PS: I am pretty good software developer with some good projects and a nice all-round stack, which also involves DevOps tools."
btp5s3,2,2019-05-27,Offered a retention bonus the day before I was going to put in my two weeks. How should I handle this?,TheInternetShill,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/btp5s3/offered_a_retention_bonus_the_day_before_i_was/,"I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice tomorrow, but last week, my boss brought me in to talk about my work and recognized that it was really busy for everyone. Then I mentioned that I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice next week. He was caught off guard and he mentioned that he came in planning on offering me a two-year retention bonus.

Details:

**Me**

* Living in NYC

* Graduated in 2017 with a 3.6 from an Ivy League studying Econ and Math

* A couple of alright internships during college, and this is my first job out of college (been here a year and a half)

**Job**

* In compensation consulting

* Salary: **$75k/yr**

* Target bonus: **$7.5k**

* Mentioned retention bonus: **$40k over two years**

* Was told at my annual review that I would be up for a promotion at my next annual review (going off of my $10k raise at the 1-year mark, I'm guessing I would be making around $90k/yr salary if I get the promotion)

* They said they would be willing to work with me to get me to stay on, even for like 6 months - they offered to **pay my annual bonus if I stayed until the end of November**

**My plans**

Ultimately, I am passionate about machine learning (but I don't have much experience in it). I want to eventually **start my own business or at least work as a freelancer**, and I think my best shot toward that is through learning programming and data science.

I used to have time to learn on my free time, but lately (the last few months), I've essentially been working all of my free time (averaging **9AM - 9PM almost all weekdays and usually a day on the weekend**), so I've been too burned out to pursue any of my passions (or even think clearly in a focused manner enough to apply for jobs).

I was planning on putting in my two weeks, moving into a cheaper apartment, and living off of savings for a couple of months while I learned to enjoy life again, and take the time to apply to the jobs that would truly fit with how I want to live my life (or do a data science bootcamp).

**Why I feel stuck**

So, this sort of offer threw me for a loop. I'm fine with staying another 6 months to ease the transition, but I'm unsure what to ask for.

* I feel like **I can't ask for better working hours**, since in a client facing role, that's largely not up to us. All of my coworkers are also working the same hours.
* I feel like **I can't ask for them to subsidize my education**, since I don't plan on staying there long enough for their investment in my education to pay off.
* I feel like **I can't ask for a short-term retention bonus** because they already suggested me receiving my annual bonus in the end of November, but idk if that's enough for me.

To add to this, I also just heard back from a recruiter for a FAANG company that they're still reviewing my excel test that I sent in, so I'm still in the running for that. (I had assumed after not hearing from them for a couple of weeks, that I was definitely out of the running, but they just said they've been very busy). This also makes me feel I can't commit to anything with the company I'm at because I would definitely end up going to this job if I was offered a position. 

Any advice on what I should do and how I should handle this conversation tomorrow?"

Hi everyone!

I'm currently doing the 4th year of CS BA and working my first job as Java developer (almost 5 months).

The  project I'm in is almost 6 years old. My day-to-day tasks are bug fix  and adding new stuff. But it's usually not something serious: it could  be add a new if-condition, refactor DB table, remove some code etc.

Unfortunately  I realised that probably this isn't my thing: I'm not interested in  learning new things like during the weekend, sometimes I write shitty  code, sometimes it's stupid copy-paste where I can copy-paste something  old and not refactor it at all. Also I do tasks quite slowly sometimes  and my colleagues are kinda pressing me for that thinking I'm doing  nothing but I'm trying my best!

Also  my mind is all about patterns: I'm good at solving tasks I've solved  before but if it's same task but with a little different wording I may  not recognize I should solve it the same way.

And  recently I started thinking of moving myself into another field which  is Big Data. I think I'm especially interested in becoming a Data  Analyst. **BUT**

1. I'm not the best-best with maths, especially abstract ones. Though I'm kinda ok when there're numbers :D
2. It's  kinda of hard with Big Data jobs in my region, especially Junior ones.  So I'd either have to move to another one or move to another country  (European preferrably). And this current job gives quite good money  which I'd lose if I switch. Just like kiind of stability with Java dev  job ads.
3. I'd  have to self-educate with coursera/udemy/whatever which basically would  be everything I have in my background since there're no internships  (see 2). Also may need to hire a tutor to help with maths but only if I  have enough money because sometimes I may not understand things myself  and need help.
4. Looks  like I don't have much of analytical/critical thinking. Also I have  sometimes weak attention (like may not notice some mistake).
5. My  soft-skills aren't the best :( Also I prefer reading info rather than  listening and get tired and bored of boring conversations easily (and  don't like talking lots myself). Aaaand sometimes I easily give up when  there're difficulties so it takes me some time to cool down and try  again. So I have a rather ""fixed"" mindset.

Also  I plan to do master's degree in CS so in order to study BD I'd have to  leave the current job since I come home absolutely tired and have only  weekends to do things. But since MA also has homework to do there'd be  no time for BD left.

So  I wanted to know your opinion if I should go to the other field or no?  It seems interesting to me that you can answer lots of questions using  same data, it seems like solving puzzles to me. But on the other hand  I'm afraid my mind is not the best for this type of tasks (see the  points like maths). So I'm struggling since it's such a huge risk.  But  I'm also afraid that I'm doing more or less ok just on this job and if I  get another one as dev where I have to implement new things it'll be  hard for me cause sometimes I can't think of all the possibilities in  the future to design something well of apply the best practices."

This is in TIFU but it’s got a lot of background to it.

For a while I’ve been incredibly close friends (family friends) with this girl, let’s call her Mary. Mary and I have always hit it off, and she was one of the few people I always trusted. She was like a sister to me more than anything else. We talk quite a bit when we have classes together, and we’ll occasionally text. We’d banter the fuck out of each other and we had a wonderful chemistry together. Last year I asked her to junior prom and we went together and it was great! So this year I asked her to prom and that’s when everything started falling apart.

I asked her to prom in the middle of March as colleges were announcing decisions. And suddenly we were texting 24/7, bonding over our mutual rejections and Ls. We were texting during class, after school, during clubs, in the middle of the night, literally every time. And more importantly, we were legitimately bonding. She started talking to me a lot more in class and I felt us getting even closer. I could never tell if I had feelings for her, but suddenly I felt those feelings becoming prominent because it started to look like it was mutual. This lasted for a month or so.

After a ton of deliberation I decided to ask her out on a date. I couldn’t outright explain that I had feelings because again, we’re both teenagers and family friends and that wouldn’t fly over well in our famfriend group. It was just a date, and judging from how close we were, I figured she’d agree, and we would have a good time and see where things went from there. She politely declined, saying that at this point in her life, dating and relationships and just nowhere on her radar. And suddenly my self-confidence plummeted and my already existing depression was seriously exacerbated. I felt like I wasn’t good enough. We both promised each other that nothing about our friendship would change, and we continued texting that day like normal.

The next day, senior internships started and our texting slowed down like crazy virtually overnight. We went from texting close to 24/7 to having a few sparse texts spread out through the day, and it drove me crazy. I had felt a true connection with this girl through our conversations and I thought she felt the same way, so it hurt that she could just slow down the texting the way she did. She insisted she was just busy, and I had no reason not to believe her because we had full trust in each other. But I’d have mood swing episodes of paranoia where I’d convince myself she had somehow become repulsed. Combined with my poor mental state and the fact that I had come to fruition with my true feelings for her, I became scared that I was going to lose her by doing something stupid. By acting pushy and desperate. And that was the beginning of that self-fulfilling prophecy.

I went crazy that our communication had slowed down. And I started acting stupid with her. Whenever she wouldn’t respond to a text or a snap I’d be pushy and text her again. I just began getting so caught up in my feelings that I felt like I began driving her away by being annoying. It was a vicious cycle because I’d act out in my depressive episodes and later feel like I made things worse in our relationship, which would further plunge me down the rabbit hole. I wanted so bad to tell her how I really felt about her, but I couldn’t. Because it wasn’t a crush. I’ve had crushes in the past, I know what it feels like. This wasn’t that, because it felt like love. And telling her that would’ve ended everything, especially as high schoolers. I just wanted to relive the attention she was giving me during our conversations because I missed it. I just wanted that connection back. She was legitimately busy, but my constant attempts to reconnect made me look incredibly pushy and clingy. I knew it was happening too and I needed to stop, but when the night rolled around and I was alone with my thoughts, my emotions would always take over and I’d succumb. It’s pathetic. Meanwhile I started to feel like more and more like she never even considered me as close a friend as I considered her, even though it’s probably untrue. The paranoia was debilitating our relationship because at every point I was trying to force interactions and get close to her.

One thing you should know about me is that I’m very direct and honest with people. So I’d often ask Mary if I was getting to be too much, and she’d always tell me everything was cool. In the past whenever I’d have a conflict with her, we’d always talk everything out honestly, so there was no reason for me not to believe she was lying to me whenever she’d tell me everything was cool. And I kept acting pushy and clingy because she kept telling me everything was fine.

Prom rolls around and we’re taking a TON of pictures together and having a great time. I’m excited because I’ve been wanting to ask her to a slow dance for a long time, and this is finally my chance. The first slow dance, I asked and she responded with kind of an aloof “i suck at slow dancing” while walking away with her friends and kind of laughing, so I figured she didn’t think I was being serious (I feel like I should reiterate, we banter each other a lot so this would not have been out of character). I figured I didn’t ask her formally or properly, so after a while I take her outside and privately explain to her that I was being serious. I tel her I wanted to ask her last year too, to which she tells me she wasn’t comfortable slowdancing with guys in general. In some miscommunication in the moment, I thought she meant she wasn’t comfortable LAST YEAR. So, stupidly, I asked her if she’d be comfortable if another slowdance comes up, and she looked at me and said sure. Another slowdance didn’t come up. I realized how weird everything was getting and I apologized to her. We talked everything out when we got home and she explained that she felt pretty uncomfortable in the scenario and she couldn’t say no, so I explained the miscommunication and we both agreed everything was cool after that.

The next day I was looking at the prom pictures and I was super excited. There were so great many pictures of us together that I couldn’t wait to share with her. When Mary posted her prom pics on Instagram though she didn’t put any couples pics of us. And I got really upset. I messaged her about it and things started to escalate.

She finally broke and told me that our relationship as friends started off great but then I started becoming way too pushy. She brought up the constant messaging when she wouldn’t respond and the the slowdancing incident as examples. This felt especially weird since I specifically trying talking things out after each incident and she would always tell me everything was cool. Even at the beginning of our conversation about the Instagram post, she insisted she wasn’t mad and that she would tell me if something was the matter. In the first block text she sent, she told me to back off or she’d stop trying to maintain our friendship.

We had a few blocktexts exchanged. I told her I was glad she was being so honest because this is the kind of conflict I wanted to avoid whenever I’d ask her if everything was cool between us. I told her I felt like I needed some space too. She told me that she would cut me off it she had to and that if I continued to just stress her out in the future she wouldn’t hesitate. In one blocktext back I told her that she didn’t have to brandish cutting me off since I’m trying to talk things out. Her final block text was her basically telling me that she can’t handle more of this conversation and that she’s going to start being “mean” if it doesn’t stop. She ended it by saying we both need space and that she’s sorry that it’s come to this, but that she’s not cutting me off, just creating some space. 

I need advice here. There was a point where I felt like she may have felt something back, but that ship has long sailed and I have no one to blame but myself. How do I salvage the relationship I once had with her? How do I get that close friendship back? It really kills me that she was so ready to threaten cutting me off altogether. Especially because of my feelings for her. I managed to screw everything up and it’s pulled me even further down the depression hole because once again, I feel completely alone in the world.

Advice?,redditburner69420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/btq700/i_keep_screwing_up_with_one_of_my_closest_friends/,"(17 M) I want to explain my situation because at this point I feel like the support of a congregation of strangers is all I have. I need advice.

For a while I’ve been incredibly close friends (family friends) with this girl, let’s call her Mary. Mary and I have always hit it off, and she was one of the few people I always trusted. She was like a sister to me more than anything else. We talk quite a bit when we have classes together, and we’ll occasionally text. We’d banter the fuck out of each other and we had a wonderful chemistry together. Last year I asked her to junior prom and we went together and it was great! So this year I asked her to prom and that’s when everything started falling apart.

I asked her to prom in the middle of March as colleges were announcing decisions. And suddenly we were texting 24/7, bonding over our mutual rejections and Ls. We were texting during class, after school, during clubs, in the middle of the night, literally every time. And more importantly, we were legitimately bonding. She started talking to me a lot more in class and I felt us getting even closer. I could never tell if I had feelings for her, but suddenly I felt those feelings becoming prominent because it started to look like it was mutual. This lasted for a month or so.

Especially because of my feelings for her. I managed to screw everything up and it’s pulled me even further down the depression hole because once again, I feel completely alone in the world. 

She recently removed me from her private snap story which seems more like a cutting off move than a space move. Whenever we’re in the same room we keep glancing at each other and will occasionally make touch and go awkward eye contact. I don’t know at this point if she hates me or is just hurt about the whole situation as well.

btqbh1,0,2019-05-27,I need some advice on applying for a master's program.,StardustOctopus,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/btqbh1/i_need_some_advice_on_applying_for_a_masters/,"Hello everyone, thank you for taking your time to help me with this, it truly means a lot, sorry if I sound misinformed in any way, that is why I am writing this post haha.

A bit of background: I am a Brazilian student majoring in biology here in Brazil. I dream of pursuing a higher education in Canada and would like to know the best way to pave my path towards this goal.

Over this summer, I will be working in Canada as an intern for a research internship program, I am really excited for this and I know many of my questions will also be answered by the people I work with there, but I still wanted to ask for help here to better prepare. The program I am taking part during this summer also offers good opportunities to then get a scholarship for a master's degree, and that would be absolutely fantastic.

So, here is the deal, I want to apply for a graduate program in Canada, specifically I am thinking about applying for the University of British Columbia. From what I saw in their website, they accept applications from July until December, and their programs usually start in September.

I have the option to finish my major by the end of this year, it will be tough due to the months I will be away in Canada but I think I can manage. HOWEVER, I could also choose to delay my major by one semester, so as to have more opportunities to do things such as raise my grades, take part in more activities and internships and overall improve my CV.
I also got a really good internship opportunity waiting for me here in Brazil after I get back from Canada and this internship although I CAN ""quit"" in December, usually would last until july 2020.

I have very limited knowledge on how graduate programs work abroad, in this case specifically in Canada, and so I have some questions I would like to ask:

- Am I able to apply this year, even before I graduate, for a program that starts in September of 2020? Even if I would only finish my major around july 2020? What if I finish it in December 2019?

- Should I delay my major by one semester? I think I already have a reasonably good CV and my grades are good enough to get in the programs I want, but once I finish my undergrad I understand it gets significantly harder to improve my curriculum further. Since it will be really tough to  finish it this year ( I didn't fail in any classes, but I am doing some extra classes to get two diplomas, one for teaching degree and one for bacharelate), I was thinking of taking things a bit more slowly and improving my chances by getting a better CV.

- Still on this topic, do Canadian universities  think badly of undergrads who delay their majors?

-  What are some tips on what to do to get better chances of being accepted for a Master's program? Should I contact any of the professors responsible for the program i want?

-  Finally I would just like to ask for any advice you guys can give me about applying for a Master's abroad, specifically in Canada or the US.  Any tips would be useful since I need to understand how these things work over there better.

TL;DR: Am Brazilian, want to apply for master's degree in Canada, need some tips about how to get better chances of being accepted and if I should delay my major to have more time to improve my CV."
btqc8e,0,2019-05-27,December Graduate here with a lot of questions,Kcin14,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/btqc8e/december_graduate_here_with_a_lot_of_questions/,"So, I'm graduating this December after going to Community College doing about 75 credits and then doing 3 semesters at a 4-year school to earn my BS in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I've so far been very interested in the fields of Machine Learning and Robotics and have taken electives in both subject areas and excelled. As a result, I'm currently employed this summer on a research project involving machine learning with one of the professors from those courses. However, I've never interned at a tech company (though I did hold retail positions while at community college). Right now, my GPA is very high and I'm considering going for a masters starting in Fall 2020 to dive deeper into the aforementioned subject areas. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, as this is a very interesting time for me I naturally have a lot of questions as to the best way to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, should I get my masters? I would do this in 1 school year full time.

Secondly, is it bad that I have a research position but no internships and will this affect my employability? (assuming no masters)

Thirdly, if I do go to grad school should I seek out a full-time position for January 2020 or should I go for an internship?

Fourthly, what should I be doing right now to best prepare myself for the outside world? At this point, I've finished most of my CS next semester I'm just finishing up some humanities courses and just have an independent study involving (you guessed it) robotics and machine learning as well as a class on databases. So, I've finished all of my core studies (Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.)

Finally, how hard is it to get a job using machine learning straight out of college in general? Furthermore, if I filter this down to the Albany, NY area which I'm currently in does it become near impossible?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping that those of you that have gone through this or something similar already can shed some light on their experiences and how best to navigate this. Thanks!"

Pretty much how it is on collegeboard standardized testing stuff. Also first-gen. Income is upper-middle class.

Location: In-state.

Intended Major: Computer Science

Academics: GPA: 3.84 (UW, School doesn't do weighted stuff), 4.10 UC GPA Looking at a 4 for AP Chem exam, possibly a 5. 1410 SAT, but I took that last summer and this summer I'm retaking and if my practice tests mean anything, I should be getting somewhere in the mid 1500s.

Extracurriculars: Service with rotary club, paid internship in the summer to work with some engineers and other stuff (I'll be working in accordance with those handling the U.S Open for golf), will be taking a week's trip to Peru in the summer with the Rotary Club to build wheelchairs for disabled children, Varsity Water Polo (junior year and upcoming senior year, most likely will be captain of team), varsity swimming and diving Freshman and Sophmore year [didn't do Junior year] (There wasn't a JV swimming and diving though? Scored points for both teams either way), ""Ambassador"" (aka high ranking) in a business club at my school that hasn't anything too notable but we have gotten a multimillionaire to speak, as well as people at a private bank who manage over 500 million a year.

Schools: All the UCs, though I mainly care about **Cal, UCLA, UCSD.** Not sure how good the programs are at the other ones, but these are the top level ones as far as I know for CS (With Cal being at the pinnacle with the great privates). Some other schools: **SCU, USC, Cal Poly SLO, UT Austin, other schools with good CS programs (because honestly I'm not sure where to look anymore and I'm sure im skipping out on great schools).**

Questions: I have no coding experience at all. How much will this hurt me? I plan on taking Harvard CS50x over the summer to start learning. I'll be taking AB Calc next year, that should look pretty good since CS and math are very intertwined, right? Also, what other schools should I look at for CS and for applying in general?

Last question: I'm not the best in stats obviously, but as far as I can tell they're not so bad that they can't be overcome with a good essay and good ECs. That said, I don't think my ECs are very good at all, at least not when compared to most of the students that seem to really be applying to these good CS programs and good schools. They have nonprofits, national to international awards, and an ungodly amount of other things that seems impossible to have and fit even into a schedule that normally allows lots of time. How can I compete? What can I do for ECs in this last remaining summer? I need some direction is all I'm asking.

Thank you so much for looking over my stuff, guys. I really, really appreciate it.

EDIT: Also FWIW I'm in the school band and was first chair for Alto Sax last year (Couldn't get it freshman year since teacher basically gave it to the senior and didn't allow for any sort of challenges), switched to Tenor since I had been playing Alto for about 6 years and I'm second chair (but also the only other player). Also I wrote descriptions for a company's product. It's an olive oil company that has gotten gold NYIOOC awards and the descriptions, while obviously not the product, are shipped with every single unit they sell so it's sort of significant to the company? Not much but might help a bit."

I'm trying to start preparing for applying to full-time jobs, and I can't really decide if I want to go more down the embedded or pure software path. I live in Seattle, so software is more prevalent here (and higher paying). However, there are still a decent amount of well-paying embedded software jobs as well. 

In school, I really enjoyed my FPGA/Embedded courses. I also really liked my Data Structures and Algorithms class, and my favorite programming language is Java. The projects I made in my embedded systems course (a Bluetooth controlled RC car), have been way cooler than the CS courses. Favorite HDL is SystemVerilog. I hate circuits (like digital tho), I know for sure I want a coding job. Which is more enjoyable in the real world? Making devices like heartbeat monitors, electric toothbrushes, sound more exciting than making stuff for AWS. But it pays less than software jobs here at the Big 4. I'm also scared that if I enter embedded, I can't go back up the stack. 

My past internships have nothing to do with either. I didn't find my love for coding until recently. I had one internship doing analog circuit design with Altium (hated it), and another doing MATLAB/Simulink development for an aerospace company. 

I might also consider adding in FPGA work to the mix. Can any EEs who were debating between software and embedded/FPGA give me any advice?"

Then, I go to LinkedIn and I see some of my connections liking other people's post saying how they were excited to start their software engineering internship at 'X' company (X company being the ones saying they are not hiring software interns at the conference). This bugs me, since I go to a no name school and I try to go to these conferences to actually have a chance at these technology companies. Can somebody give insight on this please?"
btuhvv,10,2019-05-27,[WA] Landlord over-booked bedrooms in shared (illegal) house,Particular_Two,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btuhvv/wa_landlord_overbooked_bedrooms_in_shared_illegal/,"Hello r/legaladvice! This is my first post on Reddit so please bear with me, and apologies for the length, it's an unusual situation. TL;DR at the bottom.

I had an internship last summer, and leased a room in a 5-bedroom house in Bellevue, WA whose other bedrooms were rented separately. I stayed 4 months and saw a variety of tenants come and go, but I never had a problem with any of them. Overall, it was a good summer; the house had a good location and price. In January, when I decided to return next summer for another internship, I contacted the landlord to reserve the house for myself and 4 other intern friends. The landlord agreed, and we signed 5 separate leases for 5 separate bedrooms in the house.

My friends and I have slightly different internship dates. Mine are from May 1st to August 31st, 2 of my friends are from May 12th to August 4th, and 2 of my friends are from May 26th to August 10th. Our leases had our individual dates on them, so some of us pay 4 months' rent and some of us pay 3 months' rent. Rent is all-inclusive, including WiFi, utilities, and furniture.

A few days before arriving, I emailed the landlord that I'd be moving in later this week, asking general stuff about keys, WiFi, etc. He responded that there were some changes and he would send me the information later. I did not hear from him the following day, so the day after that I sent a follow-up email.

He responded that someone else was living in the bedroom I was in the year prior, but that I could take it when I arrived since I have ""first right"" to it, and the current tenant is expected to move out later in May. This was concerning to hear, since I had specifically asked before signing the lease that the house would be for just my friends and me, and that the other bedrooms would not be rented out while we stayed there. However, I figured the current tenant would move out before my friends arrived, so I just decided to wait until then to have the room I wanted (it was important for me to have this room since it has a door to the fenced-in backyard for my dog) and then move in, rather than kicking the current tenant out of the room for a week or two.

However, when I arrived, I found out there were 3 other tenants at the property. I moved into the last available bedroom and sent him an email asking what was going on, and asking for confirmation that two of the tenants were moving out before my friends arrived the following weekend. He did not respond, so I called him the next day and he verbally confirmed that while the other tenants would be moving out on different dates, all of them will be gone by the time my friends move in and we would have the house to ourselves. I was a bit annoyed, since he had agreed in email to not rent the house out to others, but it wasn't in the lease and wasn't that big of a deal so I just let it go. Also, he repeatedly asked me not to mention the situation to the other tenants, because he ""doesn't want them asking questions like 'when is \[next tenant\] moving in', 'can I stay longer', etc,"" which I thought was weird but usually kept to myself anyway so I just went along with it.

However, the next week, only one of the tenants moved out. Then, the landlord had a moving company come in and move a bunch of old furniture out of a room that was being used for storage and put in a bed and dresser. It was obvious he was converting it into a bedroom for one of my friends to live in, so I called him and he confirmed. I asked if I could move into it instead (since it has a door to the front yard which would make it easier to let my dog into the backyard), and he happily agreed. It was only after I moved my stuff into the room did I discover why he was so happy -- the bedroom did not have a closet, the door to the outside did not have a key (but did lock from the inside), and there was a large hole in the ceiling that opened up to the attic. (The smoke detector was also disabled and in the dresser drawer; when I put it back on the ceiling, it went off every couple hours -- but only in that room. My guess is dust falling from the ceiling hole was setting it off.) But I decided to take the hit, since I figured I'd be moving into my preferred room in a couple weeks.

My two friends moved in fine, and for the first week, all was well. One of the other roommates moved out the first week. But then I started getting suspicious when the other 2 tenants never mentioned their plans to move out, not even in passing. After a while, I confirmed with them that they had not been given a move-out date. At the same time, I found out that they were paying about $350/month less than my friends and I were, and they said they were not on leases.

This is when I realized something was wrong. We had 5 people living in a 5-bedroom house, my 2 friends were set to move in in a week, and the other 2 tenants had no plans to move out. I called the landlord again, and he explained his version of the story.

Apparently, the 2 current tenants had signed on separately in December for set-term leases. After the leases expired, they turned into month-to-month tenants. He told me that he could not legally ask them to leave without cause. He also pointedly asked me if I had any trouble with the tenants, and gave me examples like smoking, being loud, etc, but I told the truth and said that I did not have a problem with them. (I think he was hoping I'd say something so he could use that as reason to evict them.) I believed him at first, but after looking up the law, it seems to me that he would be able to end the lease without cause, if he gave enough notice^(\[1\]). Either he genuinely does not know this, or he purposely continued their tenancy in order to get more money. So, he told me we would have to share the house until they moved out on their own accord.

He offered two solutions to the problem:

1. Convert a 7th room into a bedroom. (The said room is half the size of a normal bedroom, does not have a doorknob on the door, does not have a closet, and would have a twin bed when the lease specifically says queen.)
2. Have my 4th friend move into a bedroom in one of the nearby properties he managed. (Which is obviously not ideal, as we had planned to live together, share groceries &amp; meals, etc.)

I asked him if it was possible to move the current tenants into the other property, rather than my friend. He said he would ask them.

Later, we found out that one of the current 2 roommates is moving out mid-June. They had been planning it on their own, and had not told the landlord until just recently (so it couldn't have been in his plans). So, rather than ask the other roommate to move into the other property, the landlord converted the small room into a very undesirable bedroom and told us it was only temporary, and the person who sleeps there will move into the other roommate's room once they move out. We're still unhappy with this result, since we are paying a few hundred dollars more than the other 2 tenants, and are stuck with 2 very undesirable bedrooms, plus the other tenant is going to be there the whole summer, when we had planned to have it just be my 4 friends and me. (This is an issue because one of my friends has diagnosed social anxiety and has difficulty living with strangers. Also, it means 6/7 people are sharing 2 bathrooms.)

Currently, 3 of my friends are moved in, with the last friend arriving in 2 days. He is the one who would be forced to use the small bedroom for a few weeks before moving into a decent one mid-June. That means he would spend 20% of his lease in a half-bedroom, and the landlord has not offered any financial compensation for the trouble.

While researching our legal rights on this, we found out that the home classifies as a single-family dwelling^(\[2\]), and that it is actually illegal to rent it out to more than 4 unrelated people on separate leases for separate bedrooms (becoming a ""boarding house"" with a limit of 4 occupants)^(\[3\]). More than that, it is not in a district that allows rooming houses, and thus it is illegal to rent out the house on leases other than for full occupancy.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Landlord booked 7 people in a 5-bedroom house by converting two small rooms into makeshift bedrooms, despite promising me and my friends that we would have the place to ourselves. It is also illegal for him to rent out individual bedrooms in the house, period.

&amp;#x200B;

We're now a bit torn on what to do. We know we have some legal rights, since the house situation being provided is not what was agreed to on the lease, and the house is actually being rented illegally. However, we're not sure exactly how we can leverage this. So this brings me to my questions:

1. How would we go about telling the landlord that what he is doing is illegal without coming across as extorting him?
2. Is it realistic to receive reduced rent, since our living situation is significantly worse than what we had agreed to?
3. What are our options if the landlord outright refuses to do anything to mitigate the issue?

Ideally, I'd like to find a job for myself prior to graduation, which is in 2 months. I've been working on portfolio/github projects, and I'm happy with what I've got so far, but I've been building an app for my internship to be used internally. It's using a backend technology(Rails), which my other apps do not have. I think it would be nice to be able to show the WIP of the app we're working on if I'm asked about listing Rails as one of my skills in my resume, but is it frowned upon to show projects that you've been working on for internship?

btuzv0,1,2019-05-27,Should I confess?,DumpsterDumbster,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/btuzv0/should_i_confess/,"Hi all,

I've had this friend for almost over tow years. We've chatted everyday and, from my perspective, we have a beautiful friendship and appreciate her a lot. I really like her and have developed feelings for her; I love her. I've dropped some hints to her, but I'm not sure if she picked up on them and I think I've been picking up mixed signals, so I don't know. She has said that she likes me, but I'm not sure if she feels the same way. I've felt like this for quite some time and haven't told her directly. I guess I've waited too long because I'm afraid of losing her, but I understand that if I wait any longer I may lose her anyway.

Now, here's the problem: over the past months we've gotten closer, and I've almost told her but then I just tell her ""I forgot what I was going to say"". I was planning on telling her next time I see her, but she will be leaving soon for a ten-week long internship this summer and now I'm not sure if it's a good idea to tell her. I also don't know if it's a good idea to tell her in person since I don't want her to feel pressured or uncomfortable, which I think she will.

I can't make up my mind. I'm not even sure if I'm doing this right. For what I know, I may have spooked her away a long time ago. I know that I'm creep, so that's a possibility.

What do I do? What would you do?

Edit:

I know love may sound like a strong word, but love comes in different shapes, colors, taste, and smells. Even if she doesn't feel the same way or if our friendship drifts away, I would still love her regardless."

I’m junior at a state school and I am a computer science major. This summer I have not applied for internships and would really like to use this time to level up in programming.  
  
This semester that just ended, has been a real struggle, we had c++ projects and I struggled really bad. Not only am I bad at programming but my base(data structures) is extremely weak. Next semester I have a class that uses Java and honestly I forgot most of my java and I really need to work on my programming skills.

btv5ta,3,2019-05-27,I'm so scared,ramcc,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/btv5ta/im_so_scared/,"I just wanted to say some things. I don't know if anything I say will resonate with anyone- I think I made a post on here or a similar subreddit long ago, definitely deleted now, and not much of anything happened but I'm at a point where I don't know what else to do so I figured I'd just put some words out into the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so fucking scared. I never thought I would make it this far. I didn't think I would make it through college. I have a very clear memory of walking out of the dining hall one day freshman year and staring at the side of a building for a few seconds with the very clear thought of ""I'm going to die here. This is where my life is going to end."" That didn't happen. I bought rope and practiced tying a noose but I never went through with it. I graduated college a week ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated college a week ago. No one has texted me since then. It was such an underwhelming experience. I didn't ""find my people"". I clearly didn't make any lasting relationships. I was extremely depressed when I arrived and because of that I feel like I missed out on the first year experience of making friends, joining groups, establishing yourself. The middle two years were a little bit better but not great. 

&amp;#x200B;

This past year was rough. I had an internship away from campus last summer where I felt like things were finally starting to make sense. I made friends. I liked the work I was doing. I had a relationship that made me feel like maybe I wasn't too broken to be with anyone and that made me finally feel like I had a home in him, if that makes any sense. But I still had so much anxiety and worries and shit going on in my head and one night I got way too drunk by myself- I have very little memory of what I said or did, but my relationship ended after that and I just generally fell into a deep dark pit again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got back for senior year and trudged through. I really didn't know if I was going to graduate. I made it through first semester, somehow. This last semester I only managed to complete two of the three classes I was taking- barely enough to graduate, having to drop one of my majors. I did it, but I don't feel any sense of accomplishment. Graduation day I went to the ceremonies by myself and went home and cried. I didn't take pictures with friends. I didn't really feel anything other than deep emptiness. I'm not traveling or doing anything exciting before I start work because I don't have anyone to do anything with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a brief thing with a guy at the very end of the semester. It was someone I'd vaguely known for a while. It was mostly hooking up, but it was fun. We both ended up having jobs in the same city and said we'd keep talking and maybe keep hanging out once we were both there. But I somehow managed to overthink and fuck it up. I feel like I can't have a simple, normal, human relationship anymore without fucking it up.

&amp;#x200B;

I got really drunk last night. Vodka. By myself- I'm staying with my mom who lives alone and was sleeping. I was pretty far gone. I texted the boy because we'd been talking and I have no idea what I said because I apparently deleted the conversation, but he asked me today what happened and told me he wants to be there for me but needs things to be ""simple"". Which is very super fair and I'm not upset with him at all. It's more just highlighting to me how incredibly broken I am. I'll never be simple. I could have had a nice, normal friendship/relationship/who knows what with an interesting person that I liked but from the very first second I was overthinking it. Worrying. Worried about the end. That's how it was with my relationship over the summer as well. Maybe I'm just too far gone in general. I don't know how to have friends or relationships or just function like it seems everyone else does so naturally. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want someone, more than anything. That feels so dangerous and stupid to say but it's the truth. I want someone to want me and love me and care about me. In a relationship, but I also just want friends. I made one really good friend last summer, one that made me feel like that was what I'd been missing for so long. I lost touch with her, obviously, because I'm a fucking mess and stopped texting her back. I'm just so scared to talk to people, anyone at all. It's like I don't even know how anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I know now is supposed to be a fresh start- I graduated, I have a job lined up, I'm moving to a new city. But college was supposed to be a fresh start too and that went fucking terribly. It was just so fucking lonely and I don't understand how I'm supposed to have hope that this next part of life will be any different.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me wishes I could hit fast forward and get to a part where I'm okay because now is admittedly a weird time, in between graduation and starting work. I have nothing to distract me and I'm spiraling, I think. But first of all I've felt this way for a while and it's a shitty way to live life, not even wanting to experiencing it, just wanting to get through it. I've had so many weekends in the last year where I literally just overdosed on sleeping pills and slept the entire time because I couldn't stand being awake. And second of all, I don't know if i'm ever going to be okay. I don't know if there's anything good or worth waiting for. I've been this way for so long. And it gets really hard to keep believing things will be okay when I don't even remember what it feels like to be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night when I was wasted I remember laying in bed, barely able to hold my head up, and having an image of dragging a knife across my throat. I thought maybe it'd be easier when drunk, maybe it would hurt less. I prayed to god, whispered over and over again something about just letting me fucking die, about not waking up, and just letting me be done. That didn't happen. I don't know if I'm strong enough to actually make a plan and do it but I wish that I was. I am so goddamn tired.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to say. If you read all this, thank you and please comment something. Anything. Tell me how your day went, whatever. I'm feeling pathetic and lonely and I'd really appreciate it."
btvk3e,3,2019-05-28,What is advisable for Tier - 3 college students: Top notch jobs or excellent grad schools?,ReimerTiemann,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/btvk3e/what_is_advisable_for_tier_3_college_students_top/,"I (19) just finished high school with abysmal grades ( 77% ) due to lack of guidance and me just being lazy all the time. I completely agree that it was my mistake to not study hard and now I am willing to work as hard as it is required to get my life back on track.  


I am joining a Tier-2/ Tier-3 university this August and am going to major in Computer Science. I read online that one of the most efficient ways to get a job at the ""big 4"" is to perform extremely well in online programming competitions and in order to get into an excellent grad school, grades, internships, letters of recommendations, research, GMAT-GRE, etc all come into play. So I am just confused as to what should I focus my energy on.

&amp;#x200B;

In the long run, I probably see myself working as an engineer in the US/India in a great company. I'm also somewhat interested in an MBA. I am NOT interested in Academia.

Question: Should I ( Or any other Tier-3 student ) focus on getting a job at a top-notch company ( Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc ) or focus on getting into an excellent grad school after undergrad?"

$1500, USA.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\* 

 Specs and battery life. I'm a computer science and math student, and a gamer, so I'd like good specs to play games, and decent battery life (at least when not gaming) so I can take it to class, the library, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*

 I don't need it to be ultralight, but I will be carrying it around all day every day with me for the next year or so until I graduate. I think my current laptop is about 5.5lbs and it's not too bad, but I wouldn't want to go a lot heavier.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\*

 Windows is perfect for out of the box, but I'll be dual-booting Ubuntu on it.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\* 

 15.6""

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\* 

 Mainly this computer is for gaming, and I generally like to play fps/esports titles, so CS:GO, Fortnite, Apex Legends, but I also really like AAA games and RPG's like Fallout and Skyrim. In terms of programming and school work I run programs like PyCharm, IntelliJ, Matlab, and some of that stuff, especially when running scripts/programs can get pretty computationally expensive. I also like to mess around in Unity on occasion. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\* 

 Please see the games I listed above. For shooters and FPS games I'd like to average as close to 144fps as possible, and I'm willing to turn down settings for that. For AAA games I'd like to play at high settings at 60fps or better if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\* 

 Reliable build quality is a must. I'm leaving to travel on the other side of the planet for an internship in 3 weeks, so I can't have it breaking on me. I also need it to be available to buy ASAP. My current laptop (4-5 year old HP Pavilion budget laptop) is dying on me and I need to replace it before it totally dies, and like I said I'm leaving in about 3 weeks and I'll be gone for about 3 months so I need to get it before I leave (the sooner the better). Also I'd prefer if it either comes with a big SSD, or is easy to upgrade to a big SSD. A big problem I have right now is slow reads/writes with programming work on an old HDD. Also I'd really prefer if the laptop could run relatively quietly, at least when not gaming (e.g. when in class).

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\*

 I was originally looking at the new Acer Predator Helios 300 with the 1660ti since it sits well below my max budget and I could use some of the extra money to get another 1TB NVME drive and still have money leftover, but it's not released yet and I'm not sure how long my current laptop will keep running, or if the Helios will be released before I leave. I was also looking at the HP Omen 15 with the 2070 (I think MaxQ) since that sat right at about $1500, but I heard the fans are insanely loud which is a bit of a turnoff. There was also an MSI laptop (I think the GE63 or GL63) that had 2060's and 256GB SSD's + 1TB HDD's, but I heard they're harder to upgrade, and a 1TB SSD would be sweet. Sorry for the lengthy post, but I've never spent this much money on a computer before, or really anything, so I'm trying to make the most informed decision possible. Thanks in advance for all of your help."

btweja,12,2019-05-28,How important is my first job out of university to the rest of my CS career?,bingobango1223,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/btweja/how_important_is_my_first_job_out_of_university/,"Some background: 

I've just graduated with a CS degree from a semi-prestigious university and I got on the job search train a bit late (started searching about a month ago), meaning I've likely screwed myself out of opportunities at a lot of good companies like Google, Facebook, etc. that tend to hire more during the school year for new grads. My job search hasn't been completely fruitless, but it has been quite slow. I've gotten to various stages at interviews at 3 very good companies, however I've been rejected from one of these 3 and I'm concerned I'll be rejected for the other 2. The catch is this: I also have a return offer for a company I did an internship at. I don't mind working there, but the company isn't well known, some of the tech I would be using isn't widely used, and it pays slightly below market rate (which is already significantly lower than US market rate as it's in Canada). 

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is then this: I feel like the first developer job I get after university will function as a stepping stone for the rest of my career, and thus I should spend more time searching even if I don't pass my current interviews, to focus on getting the best new grad job possible. Unfortunately I'll be living off of very little savings if I can't find a job within a month or 2, so I'm tempted to accept this return offer anyway if I don't pass the 2 interviews I currently have going.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be wiser to tough it out and go for a job that I really feel like will help me move forward in my career, or to settle for a worse job for a year or 2 and search for a great job while I'm there?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, since I feel it's relevant: I'm not really certain how strong my resume is, but it is apparently good enough to get interviews at one of the big 5 so I figure it can't be too bad."

Then when I looked for a FAANG job, they recommended I do LeetCode problems, and guess what, it helped :)

&amp;#x200B;

This forum is filled with more trolls claiming it's toxic than actual trolls. Yes, it's an echo chamber, but there's a lot of good advice. I am posting this because of the recent lashing out at the subreddit. It's not perfect, but it really did help me, and I'm sure others, so thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I mention FAANG twice in this post to point out my only gripe with this sub :)"

btxnl9,3,2019-05-28,Internships vs Freelance for a Software Developer in the making,dillonj898,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/btxnl9/internships_vs_freelance_for_a_software_developer/,"First I should say that I’m a IT major (Junior) and I focus on Software Development. I would like my career to to be centered in analytics, whether that be business, financial, or healthcare.

So I’m in a bit of a predicament right now. I’m not very confident in my ability to find an internship. This is because my grades aren’t great (I know that’s not a priority for all companies but it’s still a weakness), and I feel I’m still light on my portfolio. I get that the point of an internship is to get experience but I feel like I don’t bring enough to the table to begin with. Most of my applications are pending right now so I’m not sure if I will eat my words or not.

Now I started freelancing around this past October. For me, this was difficult to do during the school year but now with summer I know I can home in on that much more and really zoom in on it.  Currently I’m only on Upwork but I plan to expand my range to other platforms as well.

Now of course I could do both at the same time, but it’s the internship that I’m concerned about. Maybe it is less difficult to land that kind of job than I believe in my head, but I’m thinking that the worst-case scenario will happen and I’ll have no internship. And regardless of whatever happens, I’ll be working on side-projects, whether it’s for my own portfolio or getting paid for it.

My real question is this: if I went down this summer and worked freelance only (of course working projects relevant to the type of jobs I want to do), would freelance experience be considered just as acceptable as internships by employers?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saving some money and I want to go to college, and I want to make the proper decision on which field to pursue.I like computers, mainly the hardware part, I like to take them apart and repair/clean/assemble them.  I like fantasy and video games, I have drawing talent and I'm somewhat of a nerd, I like science, I can watch youtube videos on astronomy, rocket launches, robots and stuff all day and I get chills every time.

&amp;#x200B;

My idea was to go and study computer-science to become a software/hardware engineer.

And MAYBE, STUDYING HARD and with HARD WORK, after many internships, I MIGHT end up working for a big company like Blizzard on anything that has to do with graphics/animation.

Or at an automotive company, like Ford and help design car parts.And who knows, MAYBE one day, after YEARS of hard work, I can end up working on something space-related, like designing satellite parts or rocket parts.

bu02h9,1,2019-05-28,How did my emails leak?,Atyri,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/bu02h9/how_did_my_emails_leak/,"So I am the admin at a small-ish company (About 80 users) and we use Office 365 for email and basically everything, True Cloud model. We have recently had some issues with CEO fraud emails with generic gmail accounts getting through our spam filters and through our ATP anti-spoof policies so I set up an Exchange rule to block any emails that claim to come from ""CEOFirstName CEOLastName"" even if they are not spoofing the email address. This worked great and I had the resulting emails sent to me just so I could verify that the CEO isn't using a default Gmail account for some unknown reason.  


This morning that policy was triggered again and I got a bunch of emails from a generic gmail with the name field to claim to be the CEO. The weird part was that one of these emails was sent to an employee that just started last week. Now I know there are tools out there to pull emails when given a domain, but I checked a few they only had a handful of company emails, and only one or two of them were on the list of emails that this spoof was sent to. The list of users includes a couple directors, three finance people, one consultant, and one intern. The intern is the one that concerns me the most. Certainly the CEO has emailed him recently, does this hacker somehow have access to my CEO's account and can see the people he emails the most?  


CEO has a strong password and MFA enforced so I don't think that his account is compromised, but I just wanted to hear from fellow Sysadmins to see if you guys have any tools or insights for tracking this down.

Second semester hits and I lose interest and can’t even read the textbook without day dreaming off and then having to go a page back. I just end up dropping all my courses and watching anime all semester. Next semester I do the same thing. Setting me a year back.


Winter semester and I’m tAking courses I should have done a year ago. My room mates got internships at companies already but I can’t since I’m so behind. I finally got diagnosed near the end of the 2nd year winter semester

So I recently graduated college. Long story short, I majored in humanities/social sciences bc I thought I wanted to work in government and later realized that I really do not. All of my internships during school have been in gov so it's been pretty difficult to find a business-y job. After graduating (I graduated a semester early, so December 2018), I did an internship at a startup in a sales/biz development role while taking a data analytics class.

During this time, I realized I enjoy analytics and would like to do something like marketing strategy and analytics at some point. I managed to get an internship in that through convincing another startup I could learn everything I needed to. I was pretty excited about it. Today, I got a job offer for a junior BI role at a mid sized tech company (not extremely well known but no nobody either). They want a decision by EOD today. Anyway, my question is do I do the internship which is closer to my desired role or the job cause ya know it's a job.

I feel like the pragmatic thing is the job but I'm afraid I won't be able to make the jump from BI to marketing at a startup (which is what I really want) later on.

Sorry that was so long and thanks for the help!"

bu1vth,15,2019-05-28,Subject 7: Owl and Monarch,apeshitcantankerous,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bu1vth/subject_7_owl_and_monarch/,"Eye contact. To some, engaging in direct eye contact with strangers elicits a sense of dreadful anxiety. Many have a propensity for avoiding it altogether - whether they do so by staring at the ceiling, or by eyeing the irregularities between the coatings of paint on the walls, or, even, by observing the dips, dikes, and scars in the landscapes of their own palms - it is generally safe to say that people find many alternatives preferable to simply looking into another’s eyes, reserving the intimacy of such a personal exchange for all but the most familiar company. I, however, am one of the exceptions. As an ophthalmologist, I have spent the better half of my lifetime studying, diagnosing, and treating visual disorders to the point where I can attribute the world around me to the visage upon visage that it cultivates - and, more specifically, the eyes that reflect it. I have stared into countless pairs of them in my career - some beady, some dull, some large and excitable - some tired and reddened, some fresh and clear, and some caught somewhere in between. An innumerable measure of irises with them, too - several hundred firecrackers in hues of hazel, a few thousand greens putting the spring-fed pastures of my home town to shame, a couple tens of thousands of stormy skies ordained with brilliant sapphire, and nothing short of hundreds of thousands of oaken corridors stretching as far as to prompt even the most observient and calculated individuals to question whether they are staring into the eyes of a beast, or the heart of the forest.

Even with my expertise, and my academic fervor in my pursuit of giving the gift of sight to those who lack its blessings, one case never fails to creep its way from the deepest annals of my memory. One pair of eyes where the adjective “piercing” would serve as a synonym to “paralyzing” rather than a token of mere flattery. Nothing has ever served to make me question my world further than the pair I encountered on March 4, 1984. The day before was a pleasant day at my humble little office in Eminence, MO. You see, Shannon County wasn't known for its population density, or for its architecture. It wasn't known for its innovations, or its artistry, or its alumni. In fact, it wasn't known for much of anything out-of-state. It had crackling gravel roads set upon the grounds of peaceful woodlands, a myriad of cranky boomers, and god-fearing townsfolk, stray beagles at the ready, eager to find a night’s stay among town samaritans, riverside cabins constructed 1 story too tall, and rows of beaten down trucks haphazardly scattered about fields of swaying cornstalks. 

It had what you'd expect from any backwater town, minus anything with any semblance to hostility. In fact - contrary to how many outsiders would take it at face value today - its hospitality had a way of roping you in. The town and its geological location were so alluring that my home practice regularly attracted the business of families from 5 counties adjacent, in all cardinal directions. I was more reputable in southern Missouri than even the most well-known national institutes to spread to our population centers, and it was simply on the account that I was not afraid to perform laser refractive eye surgery at a time where the practice was in its infancy. You could say I was ahead of the competition - in research, and in developing my technique - that, and I offered its benefits for a fraction of the costs that were being put forward on public television. Perhaps you could chock it up to “redneck” ingenuity - after all, I had lived and breathed the region long enough. In any case, one individual in particular took a rare interest in my services - a Mister J.T. Holthaus. 

In the morning, at around 2:30 AM, March 3rd - the day prior, if I recall correctly - Mr. Holthaus called my residence landline to beat the backlog of appointment requests. I understood it, after all, a practice from home with such high demand meant I needed to schedule some for the next year, and with springtime making for new cases of eye infections and resultant impairments, it was no surprise that I received a call so early in the morning. More off putting was the fact that he had reached the number of my upstairs residency, a closely guarded secret, as, if it had been otherwise, I would never have slept a wink in my time upholding my practice. 

A light breeze met my flannel leggings, snaking below the fabric and drawing out the goosebumps on my lower legs. I clapped my calves together once, twice. I stared out my bedroom window. It was cracked, ever-so slightly. I started fiddling with the cable of my home phone, phone clutched firmly in my hand opposite, as the stars ducked into the trees, disappearing into that characteristic country night. An unnerving darkness, and the soft creak of the planks at my bedside was accompanied, hauntingly, by the airy whistle of the morning breeze - perhaps my eyes had needed more time to adjust. I dismissed the fettering anxiety, the cacophonous din of crickets snapping me back to reality and to the task at hand. I held my pendant close, that of a monarch butterfly, and it brought me a feeling of comfortable familiarity. It always did. Upon questioning him on how he found my personal home number, the gravelly, ancient voice on the line politely replied that he received the number from “a friend in town” and that he, ”didn't mean scare”. 

Entertaining the concept, and not wishing to turn away new clients, I listened to what he had to say. “Well, thing is, I'm really not feeling all too well, Dr. Woods. My eyes aren't what they used to be. I've got seasonal allergies, hell, I've known that much for a long time - but I also know they shouldn't be getting this bad in the course of only a few weeks. I'm barely fit to operate a buzzsaw, anymore. Damn near lost a digit yesterday afternoon tryin’.” He went on to request that I attend to his “ailment” as soon as possible. Come to think of it, his breathing sounded a tad more frantic when I prefaced my next statement with, “I appreciate your interest, but…” but, going on, after a brief pause, I simply stated that, ”You have my deepest apologies, sir, the simple state of things is that I'm booked up until March 5th of next year. By your urgency, I can tell that you are in need of assistance, so I will defer you to a friend of mine upstate. I know he'll do what he can to get you back in business.” 

“I can't do that, Doc. I don't have a fortune to spend, my son can't drive me that far, and those sorts aren't gonna help me for cheap. I ain't lookin’ for surgery or anything, honest. Allergies just don’t do that to me! I really just need you to see what I see. Miss, my family physician's out for a week and his nurse can't tell a stethoscope from a telescope, or a horoscope, for that matter.” He chuckled lightly, a brisk but stifled hiccup of nervousness in his voice. I buckled under pressure, even if only for my weakness concerning my natural inclination to help the elderly. I finally gave in. “I'll take you in tomorrow at 7 AM, and I'll see what I can do, alright? Just don't let anyone else know I did this, or I will have stuck my neck out only to get my head cut off.”, I barked, trying to bite back against more caustic remarks. He thanked me, thanked me twice over, and I went back to my daily business - or lack thereof. I closed my office on weekends. 

Industrial white tiling, chilling marble flooring with a blinding sheen, and the oppressive tension brought about from the all-too pristine fluorescence of a clinic, these elements always crept into my daydreams ever since I opened Woods Ophthalmology one year ago. For some reason, I could never bear the concept of working for an actual institution - my home practice was one constructed not only from ambition, but from necessity… a need never to subject myself to a hopeless labyrinth such as that of a state hospital or government-funded laboratory. The mere idea never failed to put a pit in my stomach, and, because it was beginning to do so, I spent some time watching the sunrise from my porch. Blazing oranges and swirling indigo on the horizon always helped me wipe the daydreams from my imagination. Seeing the butterflies fly out and about was one of my favorite things to do when my mind wandered elsewhere. I spent nothing more than a 10 and a couple of dimes at the local diner. Come to think of it, I never did. I wasn't particularly hungry, rather, I decided to study some previous diagnoses and to double-check my work. Brushing up on seasonal infections could never hurt. 

It was only a matter of time, however, before a curiosity washed over me. Jonathan Taylor Holthaus - I muttered to myself, fingering through a coffee-stained phone book at my bedside. It felt heavier with every flip of the page as I looked for JT's workplace. Jon T. Fitzgerald, general labor, Junior's Hardware… Jonathan Taylor-Rossieu, tradesman at the Apple Barrel … J.T. Holmes, timber, Holmes &amp; Company. Nothing. Next thing I knew, I was asleep.

A few hours later, I was jolted awake by a breeze. I sat in much the same way that I did upon receiving my patient’s call, glaring through the window into tenebrous woodland when it dove and perched itself upon my windowsill. Startled at first, I leapt from my mattress, taking a step back to observe the perpetrator. Downy in the shade of sawdust, and feathers that could be likened to the color of the rich, haughty bark of an Elm tree - they were singed on the edges, not unlike hundreds of microfibrils of smoldering incense branching out into ashen leaflets. 

I sighed. “An owl.”, I thought. I observed it, expecting to see it with wings outstretched in only a matter of seconds, to see it take its leave after any number of field mice it could find before making its way back to its nest. The flow of time, however, had an odd way of playing tricks on me. What was I doing? I had been observing its back for minutes. A couple of minutes became a few, and a few became several. The scene began to widen and flicker in front of me, and total, suffocating silence followed - an omission of all that was natural. The trees were silent. The crickets, absent. The grass, the bushes - dead still. Not a creak from the floorboards, not a buzz from my nightstand lamp. Then… then, the window grew closer. I didn't want to give this invader an opening, I had to run... overcome by an overpowering vertigo, I fled for my bathroom, slamming the door behind me and locking it with enough torsion to split a screw in half. 

My peripheral kept widening, my head felt as if it was about to roll off of my neck and into my tub where I made a crash landing, narrowly avoiding a drop onto the concrete gray tiling at the base of the caldera. The pounding in my head, the turbulence that clashed with my most basic motor functions… thump, thump, thump, slowly, ever so slowly, it ceased… a sudden limberness found its way through my body, I came to realize that I hadn't gotten the light switch, and, finally recapturing my former balance, I lifted myself out of the tub and onto the floor, standing upright. I didn't need light. In fact, it astonished me how clearly I could see everything in front of me. Toothbrush accompanied by a tube of toothpaste, adjacent, cherry floss. Electric razor, no worse for wear. A bar of soap, a diagram of a Pipevine Swallowtail plastered to the wall adjacent. A towelette set about the corner of the sink, folded at the corners, and, the mirror atop the cabinet. My pupils finally met my face, but the eyes that greeted me were not my own. 

To my horror, alien eyes - much too large for my own skull - engulfed the complete diameter of my orbital cavities. I stared on, deadlocked, mouth agape as I panted for breath. Cast forth from the membranous spheres was a dull, malevolent amber - or, was it white? It cascaded the edges of my bathroom mirror, refracting just enough light for me to catch a glimpse at the gnarled claws usurping my hands’ natural form... my fingers, of which had been so disgracefully malformed with bony protrusions on each end of my knuckles, were twisted and stretched into feral talons. I clutched the edge of the sink with bone-crushing force, petrified by the transformation taking place before my eyes - the owl's eyes. Downy began to erupt from every pore on my forearm, breasts, and neck, the feeling of hundreds of needles being threaded from under and out of my skin, breaching the surface in a way to inflict as much pain as possible. Raptor-like feathers sprawled from the goosebumps on my spine, ordained with the very same intricacies I saw on those of my intruder. Scrambling about, I made for the door, desperately fiddling with the handle before electing to tear it down with my talons. Blood seeped from my claws, my button-up was torn to shreds from seam to seam by the protrusions from my spine and shoulders, but I could not handle my own sickening image any longer. The pain was unbearable. 

The door, torn down the middle to the threshold, teetered precariously as I stumbled forth, fleeing down the stairs. Click-clap, click-clap, click-clap. The patter of my feet, my second pair of talons, made equilibrium all the more difficult to maintain as I sunk my claws into the railing at my sides. I slipped, hitting the floor with an unnatural, sickening *crunch*. My bones, brittle and hollow, struggled to maintain their integrity. Where I could once see everything, I could now, in the downstairs parlor, see nothing. The eyes… my chest, my arms… my body clicked and snapped back to normal as quickly as it had transformed. A cold tinge seeped from the parlor windows, some open, some closed - but the light, it was blue. Where it had all had been black and white in the moments where I met my nemesis in the mirror, colors began to emerge once more from my environment. Powerless to move, grounded in a fetal position, and still in wrenching pain, I turned my head further. In the living room, atop a chair, was the silhouette of a man. 

It faced the windows, unflinching. Wind came spiralling in from those in the kitchen, drafting into the living room, the zephyr whipping his hair as he sat motionless. Barely visible in the morning light, the pin of my living room vitrola came to life. It plummeted onto a record, singing a discordant tune that crescendoed into a skull-splintering melody, broken and rushed. My ears were met with an innumerable, insidious army of violas, trumpets, oboes and keys, a countless collective of flutes, drums, cellos, and clarinets. The man’s head followed suit, turning with the hand of the curtain-cloaked grandfather clock… and it kept turning, and turning, and turning. Click after crack after sickening crunch followed as the tension on his cervical vertebrae surpassed every limit set by the natural capacities of human physiology - yet, somehow, his neck maintained enough functional integrity to pivot even further. His head went full circle, over and over again, matching the tempo of the orchestral disaster.

I looked on, lurching forward in agony before finding myself frozen in prone, eyes still set upon the horrific spectacle taking place before me. Gregorian chanting sent vibrations through the glass of every window, pummeling them to their breaking points. Glass flew in every direction, thrown and strewn about as far as I could see. The melody shrieked before scratching to an end, and the air that sliced through my hair and between my tattered nightwear turned absolutely frigid. The burn of the cold exceeded the pain in my chest, arms, and legs, sending a surge of chills through me. I convulsed savagely, my exhales turning into a crystalline mist on my cheeks… I had to keep fighting. Although every fiber of my being fought to stand, or to bolt, or to grab the closest thing I could find, my body was unresponsive. The man's neck jolted to a halt, head left lolling back and forth from the momentum, in direct parallel to the pendulum of the grandfather clock. Its jaw creaked open, a wheeze echoed through its gut and out of its mouth. Was he dead? Was it dead? Could I crawl away before… 

The figure projected its arm forward and onto the tablecloth, head jerking back into place to face me. The wind had retreated, the record had stopped, yet, the cold remained. The face in the dark finally opened its eyes. Black coals embedded in coarse, bubbling amber scorched through me, almost as if they were concentric organisms, independent from the shambling horror of a humanoid before me. Its eyes… they were so massive, so dreadfully animalistic. I cried out, louder than I ever had in my life, and my call elicited a response I could never have anticipated. Rather than slicing into me with the talons I saw it raise in the moonlight, it arose from the chair, darting onto the table, pacing in a couple of circles before positioning itself on all fours. The figure's movements were those of a mannequin, jerky and unpredictable - yet, so birdlike, and calculated. 

Its joints crackled and popped at every motion it made, the sound of splintering wood resonating through the parlor as it anchored itself. I wanted so desperately to attempt once more, to try my luck and to scramble away in those moments, but I knew the futility of it all… and a blazing hatred spilled from the delicate cauldron of my psyche. Mustering all of the strength that the rest of my body had denied, I directed it instead into my voice. Where I could only whimper before, I now screamed in full, unrelenting retaliation of the creature's presence. “What… what the fuck are you doing to me?! What do you want?!”

The creature's eyes did not blink, nor twitch, nor quiver. They simply kept digging into my face, clawing through my paltry defenses of false courage. When the silence between us felt like it would suck my remaining life force with it into the void of its dilated pupils, it spoke, slowly and concisely. A smooth voice, one of cavernous and callous sanctimony - a childish tone of condescension, flowed from its mouth like liquid arsenic on molasses... “Have you forgotten about us, Annalee? Or, should we call you... Mrs. Woods?”. 

It sounded all too human to match the monstrosity slouched in front of me, its talons tensing and fingers fiddling as it propped its arms upon its knees. Its jaw did not so much as shift a micrometer, rather, its mouth hung open as it spoke, its hideous, contorted expression now faintly discernible in the dark of night. I could not formulate a response, for its appearance was too jarring to put away from my mind. It had closed lips, and a complexion devoid of life. The feathers and the downy that I felt stab through my pores were now erect from its back, torso, and forearms, like the spines of a porcupine. Annalee? I struggled to speak, warm blood still seeping from the cuts on my wrists and knees. I clutched my chest, propping my elbow against the hardwood. “My name… isn't Annalee.” The creature cocked its head to the side, before its disembodied voice rippled through the parlor. “Oh, but it is, Annalee. They made you forget, you wanted to forget, so they made you forget… but we… could never forget those eyes.” It knew me? They knew me? Who the hell was Annalee? What did “they” make me forget..? I projected my voice once more, shivering where I laid. I grew restless, and hopeless. “Please, just leave me alone! I don't know what you are, I don't know what you want!” It seemed to pause, processing my statement before dispensing a response as calm and as cold… as cream… leaning further in with every syllable. 

“It has been a year since your past was reconstructed in front of you, to your liking. It is so natural that you chose to step in the shoes of an aspiring ophthalmologist... so natural, considering your talents… we… just wanted you to see… what we see. They will try to find us, Annalee. They will try to find and exterminate us, but - this will be worth it.” 

A tsunami of emotions overtook me - I was livid, I was horrified, I was grieving, I was celebrating, my inner animal went amock - and from the fury of the sea, a slurry of memories bubbled forward in a frothy, scalding wave. Vault doors, bulletproof glass, and titanium panelling… half a mile of supercomputers, 850 square feet of chemical compounds, and surveillance vans with as many graphic illustrations of butterflies on them as there were stars in the sky, engines fluttering. I remembered the scent of innumerable bags of exotic coffee, set about meticulously for every day of the week - alluring, relaxing. I worked as a lead researcher in the “Visions” department of MONARCH, an elaborate front for charity. Even then, it had countless parent and sister companies - to this day, I cannot assign any given function to a single one, but I knew my own, and I was happy with it.

I dabbled with my colleagues in experiments involving the senses - in reconfiguring human DNA on-site and synthesizing it with that of woodland creatures. The idea was to start small until we could expand our work into the more fascinating “hybrids”, so to speak... the grey squirrel, subject 4, was a profound failure. An unintelligent creature with no astounding abilities or positive qualities to think of. It refused any of the foods we offered it, succumbing to its own immune system. It is unclear whether an allergic reaction or dehydration brought it to its final fit of mania, although, my money is on both. It frothed at the mouth and clawed at the walls of its containment unit, bleeding and broken until total exsanguination. The red fox, subject 5, was a failure in its own rights. Feral, uncontrollable, albeit more intelligent than its preceding subject. A severe deformity of the jaw and neck, however, prevented the creature from feeding properly - ultimately leading to its demise. The corpse harbored a unusual new strain of rabies, leading to its subsequent cremation. Its cell was soon quarantined thereafter. The black-capped chickadee - subject 2 - was preposterous in concept, and it went about as well as one would expect. It could not fly, nor eat. It could not communicate effectively. It chirped mindlessly, caving in its own skull from butting heads with its reflection one too many times during one of our attempts to establish communication with it. Its self-inflicted injuries reduced the creature to a vegetative state. It was terminated formally and repurposed for the sustenance of the other specimens. We tried everything, and live human subjects were a commodity we could not afford to put to waste. We had all but given up hope, ready to put our clipboards aside for the month - until, finally, a success.

The great horned owl. Magnificent and terrible. Capable of flight. Able to mimic any voice that it hears, recruiting them for its vocal armory. Capacity for complicated emotions, such as envy, and love. Handsome, some would even say beautiful, were it not for its eyes. It was intelligent beyond measure. Superhuman physical capabilities, talons able to employ impossible tensile strength, and, in one of our tests, imprinting upon a concrete rebar. The ability to warp reality, to create auditory, visual, and even tangible hallucinations, and able to transmogrify small living creatures within arms reach into any manner or species of owl of its choosing. It would deploy and manipulate these animals into performing its tasks for it, easily acing every manner of test we would put forward. It would go by “we”, despite being one entity. It never spoke malevolently, not at first. It spoke to us, shockingly, as friends. Moreover, it spoke to me. It loved to speak to me. It loved to speak to me so much that it proposed its love to me. It would call me mother, and to it, I was just that. I could not reciprocate it, any of it. It was fascinating, the pinnacle of my work, but never could I stomach returning the gesture. I rejected its love, and it grew impatient. It grew to resent its mother for her negligence. Nonetheless, it kept smiling. Always asking how my coffee tasted, always complimenting my appearance, or inquiring as to my whereabouts every night after I'd leave. 

It was only a matter of time before my husband had disappeared during his shift at the lab. None of his interns and colleagues were any the wiser to his whereabouts, all presuming that he had left early to type his reports at home. No log of entry to any of the cells written, no unusual activity or mismatched consumption of electricity anywhere in the facility. When my group and I made our way to the owl's pen the next morning, our eyes went wide. A collection of owl pellets littered the ground in a circular configuration. Subject 2's half-digested remains served as the foundational adhesive for an unholy shrine. An assortment of pulverized bones, shredded organs, and decaying sinews were intertwined and rearranged into a hideous nest. The smell slammed through the facility's coffee-scented aura like a sledgehammer on a vase. I nearly wretched as the subject sat proudly in its nest, caressing a desecrated, broken skull with its claws. It tapped on the skull, staring directly into the one-way window. Directly into me. 

Its disembodied voice boomed through the portal. “He never saw you like we did, mother… Anna… lee…” Its voice trailed off. Tears streamed down my face… my husband was in there. He knew what we created shook me to the core. He knew it had an obsession with me, and he knew he had to take action. He did not log his entrance, he took care not to redirect enough power to signal an unauthorized interaction with a specimen. I observed the nocturnal unit's surveillance tapes in horror. The subject loved me so much, and held an envy so fervent that, when my husband entered to terminate it, even with all the precautions he took to ensure his safety and to put the subject at a disadvantage, it managed to do something ingenious. Ingenious, and terrible. 

Its abilities managed to warp the room, despite the deployment of nullifying agents prior. We came to the conclusion that it manipulated the air input, using the recreational devices in its exhibit to block the ports. It created the image of me, rending it to shreds in front of my husband before being “restrained” by the containment unit's graphene snares - something that would have activated assuming the protocol had functioned, but, again, an illusory object. My husband charged forth in a devastated rage, syringe of S17-ANTIMACHUS in-hand. The imprinted illusion of the subject being subsequently ensnared and incapacitated was all too real to my husband. The subject, finding its perfect window of opportunity, crushed his skull in its talons, tore his jugular apart, and painted the titanium-enforced one-way glass with his blood, not unlike cranberry preserve getting splattered onto canvas. The camera preserved the footage in gut-wrenching detail, despite its limitations. The subject feasted on his remains before erecting its monument to me. 

The nest, the skull, its eyes and smile gleaming with pride as coagulated blood seeped from its teeth. The bones crunched like brittle mulch beneath its feet as it stepped forward, cocking its head. It was too much for me to bear. My cheeks glistening with tears, my mouth was quivering. I bolted from the laboratory, planting my head in my hands. I collapsed. I fingered the pendant on my neck, sobbing. Every emotion I had encapsulated in the delicate, orderly flasks of my psyche had come spilling out. The composure that I held in performing the atrocities behind our job descriptions, the clever, cool, and collected facade - the disguise sewed upon the pathetic, quotidian employment of numerous antidepressants and stress management practices -  it was finally broken… irreparably. I weeped, and cursed my vile, volatile ambitions... In a hushed, fractured voice, I apologized to him. I told him, wherever he was now, that I loved him. I denied his death, I reprocessed the events leading up to the moment that we found him again, and again. My final whisper in that facility was one of remorse. “Our sins have finally caught up to us, love. What have I done...” 

The organization saw this incident, and they were intent on moving forward by plastering over the fissure in its foundations. I begged to leave, to be given a new life, and, given my service record, MONARCH was eager to provide. Annalee R. Hale, colleague and widow to Thomas A. Hale, was dead, hence, Penelope S. Woods was born. Credentials, identity, and hobbies - down to my favorite hairstyles, colors, and my 16th birthday - were all elaborately fabricated, and a new home, one cleverly crafted to keep me close to the foundation… but now, Subject 7 was sitting in front of me. It came for revenge, no doubt. I was paralyzed and left to my own thoughts until my mind emerged from its newfound pool of hideous truths. I returned to the present, fully, and in insurmountable agony as the final blow had landed upon my chest. It had been speaking in the voice of my husband all along. I pleaded for it to kill me, to soak the floorboards in my blood so that I could escape from the horrors I left behind. 

Its expression finally changed. It showed its teeth, bearing a gleaming replica of that signature, bloodlusted grin it wore back in the lab. “We only came to kill Penelope.” It eyed my pendant, amused with the wicked irony of it all - pondering over my request, perhaps even tempted to divide my body down to its choicest meats in its imagination - before it continued. Its final words to me were the words of my vengeful sons. “Annalee, you've seen what we see. You've felt in brief moments the pain we have felt for our entire lives… but you will not be provided with the luxury of death, not from us. We will live on in your nightmares. We will live on through every breath that you take, and we will be there when you draw your last… smiling…” I can no longer piece together the memories between that moment and the moment I found myself in a hospital upstate with numerous inexplicable contusions, broken bones, and ruptured organs… but I spent a month bedridden, and several more in recovery. The truth regarding my husband's death, and my role in MONARCH, weighs heavy on my soul. 

I was not lying, in the beginning… I truly have spent so much of my life rebuilding Penelope Woods, so much of my life helping people so that I may reclaim what I have left of my humanity. MONARCH's surveillance is relentless, so, I still live here - in the halls of my home practice - and am destined to do so for the remainder of my years. Since the day that I returned home, 30 some odd years ago, I've torn every single butterfly from my walls, my tables, my wardrobe, and my desks. Every single keepsake and centerpiece that reminds me of my past life is done for. I keep my pendant in a lockbox somewhere down the river, somewhere I cannot find it. I've long since grown older, and my hands aren't nearly as steady as they used to be. I can no longer hold my journal without tremors resonating through my hands. I write all of this now, because I have begun to hear my husband once more. His voice… so smooth, so calm. Upon the one (and only) instance that I informed them of the voices that I would hear at my bedside, the doctors told me that I was suffering from dementia. Absolutely preposterous. I was as lucid then as I am now. My writings should be more than enough evidence of that. 

Come to think of it, I recall Dr. Brown wearing the pin of a Green Hairstreak on the right lapel of his jacket. Him, and his nurse. Those damn things alway stick out like sore thumbs, but I do my best to entertain his check-ups and play dumb. I always receive my prescriptions at their specified pharmacy, but I know better than to take them. I've gotten good at faking the tests, and I know better than to answer honestly. I also know that Subject 7 will come back for me one day, and the sooner, the better. For decades, I've kept a deadly article of contraband neatly packaged and refrigerated, and the foundation was left none the wiser to its disappearance - a handy little reserve of S17-ANTIMACHUS. I've kept a close eye on the missing persons boards across the district for a long time now, and one would have to be a fool to ignore the similarities between so many of the disappearances in this stretch of the Ozarks. I'm no fool. I'm retiring soon from my practice, and I have a few more friends and family members to my name than those that I had in the beginning. The Woods family is as close as a group can get without sharing the same blood, and I have faith that if I can't execute it - my sons will."
bu1xln,8,2019-05-28,Security Career Outlook - Help,Ducks27,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bu1xln/security_career_outlook_help/,"I need to start this post with quick recap of my (25M) IT career. I started as an intern at the company I’m currently with a couple of years ago and had no IT background whatsoever, but the company gave me a chance. Now, the company, at the time, had 2 guys working in IT - an old sysadmin working everything, including security, on his own and a new hire, close to my age, working some help desk. 

I was hired on full-time after 3 months of interning at a pretty great starting salary for someone with no IT experience, and I was quickly thrown into a help desk/sysadmin role. After about 6 months, the aforementioned new hire moved on, and the IT department was just myself and the old sysadmin. Busting my butt, with no help from the old sysadmin, I was able to implement many new changes to the system, including updating our entire ecosystem to Windows 10, encrypting all Windows 10 machines via BitLocker, moving to Office 365, etc. Trial by fire has been my motto. Obviously having to learn most everything on my own, Now, at 2 years in, I'm pretty much the IT group lead on our corporate environment because the old sysadmin has moved on, and I'm the senior member of the IT crew now (added on a few more folks with more specific roles now - cloud, network, help desk, etc.). 

About 6 months ago, I began to feel a little burned out. Feeling stagnant in my position with the company as there wasn't really a mentor at the company to help me see a path forward, working 60+ hour weeks, and feeling as if I had to clean up after my colleagues constantly, I began job-searching. I received an offer from a very large organization offering me about $10k more than what I was making at my current company but working in a secure area doing some pretty monotonous tasks. I took that offer back to my company with caveats, and they asked what it would take for me to stay. I, of course, low-balled myself, and said $15k more than I was making currently, and they said ""done."" So, I'm now working on a special project for the company handling NIST compliance with a security-related role incoming after compliance controls are in place. 

After all of that, I'm in a position where I'm handling a lot of policy and paperwork for cybersecurity, but I'd love to be able to get on the more technical side of things. With the security-related role, mentioned above, I'd be doing a lot of system auditing and control implementation, which is okay, but I feel would get sort of monotonous as well. My current job ecosystem is mainly software development or cybersecurity on the policy side with some jobs more on the technical side of security. Currently, I have a Security+ and was looking at CASP next, but I'm also open to going back to school and getting an MS. 

I guess my big question is this: What are some more technical security roles I could learn material on my own for, what should I focus on primarily to really turn myself into a security SME, and how far-fetched are all of my hopes here? 

I use some basic security tools to get more information on threats that occur with the occasional spear-phishing attempts or malware that slips through our Office 365 ATP solution, I have some basic web development skills, know a decent bit of C, a bit of scripting (python, powershell, etc.) for office tasks, and some Linux knowledge. I've done plenty of research on my own for answers to this question, I promise, but none of the answers seem to be very relevant. The idea of moving into digital forensics and/or working on IoT for infrastructure security has really intrigued me and has motivated me to really try to kick ass in my current position to learn all I can to get started in my auditing position.  

Thanks in advance for any help, advice, even constructive criticism you can provide. 

TL;DR: Started as an intern, now feeling stuck after moving into more of a policy-related security position. Asking for advice on next moves."
bu2man,3,2019-05-28,a sticky major question,clithub,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/bu2man/a_sticky_major_question/,"Hi! I was admitted to UCI pretty promptly -- a day after I applied via the UC App. But I realized I may have not been admitted to the correct major and I'm not sure if I should bring this up to admissions. 

I was studying Computer Science / Symbolic Systems at Stanford until September 2018 before my admission offer. I was offered CS at other schools in April 2019, but I accepted my offer at UCI pretty fast - I wanted to be closer to my parents' home. 

I'm assuming that my counselor changed my major to Social Sciences to get me into the school faster. I see that there is an option in the portal to change the major but I'm nervous it may jeopardize my admission. 

I probably won't get into CS at UCI at this point, but I'm open to Data Science or Cognitive Science or even double majoring if needed. 

I'm currently a full-time software engineer in San Francisco with 5 software internships and have no interest in the major I was selected in... not sure if that would help aid my case."
bu2nl9,39,2019-05-28,Presentations at my company are brutal,ED-2O9,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bu2nl9/presentations_at_my_company_are_brutal/,"My team and I had a tight deadline to meet and the sounds of construction floating through the office from the break area did nothing to ease my stress. It was my own fault I supposed, I had chosen to sit far away from my team, close to the break area in the hopes of getting some work done between distractions. I had been steadfastly ignoring my email and messaging apps all morning and no one had managed to physically find me yet. I stubbornly decided it would take more than a bit of noise to drive me from such an ideal hiding place.

The construction sounds stopped and I looked up in interest as a group of my colleagues excitedly rolled a large black metal frame past me towards our biggest meeting room.

“Hey guys, what’s going on with that thing?” I called out to them.

“It’s for the big meeting today!” the lead roller replied happily as though that explained everything. Confused, I stared after them as they continued on their way. I wasn’t aware there was a meeting of any magnitude today, let alone one that would require such a massive prop. Still, I thought to myself, I hadn’t checked my email since I arrived so it was most likely a last minute thing. Shrugging, I continued with my work.

Soon, people started heading in the direction of the large meeting room and the hubbub of conversation began rising in volume, distracting me once more from my work. I grumpily decided that such a big gathering was probably important enough for me to take a break and put my laptop aside to make an appearance at the meeting. The large black frame had been placed on the low stage at the end of the room. Groups of my colleagues were gathered around it talking amongst themselves, glancing at it occasionally with excitement on their faces. I approached the nearest group to find out what was so exciting when a hush descended over the room. Following the turning heads I saw our CEO Carla had made her way to the front and stepped up onto the stage.

“Hello everyone. We all know why we’re here so let’s skip the usual preamble and get on with it!” Carla enthused at the audience, receiving a few whoops in response. She tilted her head to one side and with a proud look on her face said “Jill, get up here!”.

The crowd clapped and cheered and I half heartedly joined in, unsure why we were clapping, as our intern Jill made her way through the gathering, her diminutive stature lost in a gauntlet of shoulder pats and handshakes. Sheepishly, she stepped onto the stage and stood in the centre of the black frame, her face bright red from the attention.

“Tim” Carla called to our resident handyman “can you get her ready please?”

Tim nodded from the front of the crowd. He walked onto the stage and positioned himself behind the awkwardly smiling intern. Pulling a long rope from his side he slung it over one of the horizontal bars on the frame and made a knot, placing it gently over Jill’s head. I watched on in shocked disbelief as Tim threw the rope into the audience where it was passed along until it’s entire length was held by a number of eager volunteers who pulled it taught against the frame.

This couldn’t be what it looked like, I thought, surely it was some sort of exercise I hadn’t been clued in on. As I tried to make sense of the situation, Carla turned to Jill and asked “Are you ready, hun?”

Jill stuck up two thumbs and replied “Sure am!” with an embarrassed smile.

“You got this Jill!” someone shouted from the audience, prompting the rest of the gathering to shout encouragement as well. Carla moved into the crowd and took hold of the rope close to the stage. “OK people, let’s do this thing!” she called through the hubbub.

A cheer went up and those holding the rope began to pull. I saw the noose tighten around Jill’s neck and her excited grin changed into a twitching grimace, the corners of her mouth rapidly rising and falling as though she was trying to smile through the pain. The crowd heaved on the rope, jerking her head upwards as her feet left the stage. The muscles in her neck bulged and she let out a strangled moan, snapping me out of my disbelief.

“What the hell are you doing?” I shouted as I pushed into the exuberant mass, prompting calls of “Excuse me, I was standing there” and “Rude” from colleagues I’d barreled through in my haste to reach the rope pullers. I made it to the closest hangman and tried to snatch the rope out of his hands. “Extra points for enthusiasm, but you’ll get your turn later” he laughed, turning his back on me.

On stage Jill had started to struggle against the rope. Her feet kicked out haphazardly and her stiff arms spasmed at her side as she swung to and fro. The last of the air escaped from her strained lips in a low groan and her face began to swell, her eyeballs pushing out of their lids as her pale skin faded to blue. I roared in frustration and tried to push my way through the audience, but to no avail. In every direction towards Jill my colleagues pushed me back, laughing and apologizing as though I had accidentally bumped them.

“Betty, it’s time!” Carla yelled from the front. Our elderly receptionist moved out of the crowd and gingerly stepped onto the stage brandishing a fully extended utility knife in her hands. She doddered up to Jill and grabbed a handful of her blouse. With a grunt of exertion she tore the loose blouse open at Jill’s belly, sending small white buttons flying off in all directions.

“Right then my dear” Betty crooned, raising the utility knife and plunging it into the soft white flesh of Jill’s exposed stomach. Grabbing the knife in both hands Betty dragged it down, sawing through Jill’s belly button with a sound like tearing fabric and splashing dark red blood across the stage. Jill began to convulse and a sense of unreality descended on me as my mind rejected the scene in front of me. Sweet old Betty gutting the office baby Jill as she was hung from the neck at a company meeting? This could not be happening.

Shock overtook me fully when Betty began hacking a horizontal line through the centre of her previous cut, leaving a gaping red cross carved into Jill’s stomach. Her bulging eyes rolled back in her head and foam appeared at the corners of her mouth as her entrails slowly slopped to the floor from between the messy triangles of loose flesh. The crowd cheered as Betty picked up a greasy purple rope of intestinal tract and tossed it into the audience, splattering blood and ichor over the front row who laughed and joked like this was an everyday occurrence for them.

As with the rope the intestine was passed through the crowd and pulled taut until they were dragging the bloody organ fresh from the messy wound in the hanging girl’s torso. With a final violent tug the last of Jill’s intestinal tract splashed out, dragging a host of other unrecognisable organs with it. Jill stopped her spasming and swung gently until the audience dropped the rope and she thudded to the sticky crimson floor, the impact causing organs and blood to splash out around her in an uneven nimbus of visceral remains. I felt the telltale static of unconsciousness approaching and the room began to spin as gorge rose in my throat.

I squeezed my eyes closed tightly and began taking deep breaths as a bloody Carla called “Let’s hear it for Jill!” from the front and the audience exploded into a cacophony of clapping, whoops, and whistles. The intestines were thrown in the air, showering the audience in body fluids until they landed in the crowd with a wet slap.

“Alright everyone, time for a quick break before the next presentation. Meet back here in five” said Carla as the applause died down and the crowd slowly separated into small groups who chatted and joked, completely oblivious to the body of their former colleague spread across the meeting room in front of them.

I stood there shaking and alone as my colleagues milled about around me, unable to believe what I had just witnessed. Five minutes ago my biggest worry had been meeting a deadline, now I wasn’t sure if I would even leave the building alive. I physically jumped when someone tapped me on the shoulder, spinning in the air and backing away from a blood splattered Carla.

“Hey, hun. Didn’t mean to surprise you” she laughed, brushing a lock of hair sticky with bodily fluids from her face “You look a little green around the gills. Are you still going to be OK to present next?”

“Present next?” I stared dumbly at her.

“Yeah, you got the email, right? We’re doing the presentations in alphabetical order.”

“Alphabetical order.” I repeated flatly, unable to form a more coherent response.

“Jeez, you’re not doing so well are you? Why don’t you go grab a glass of water and have a little sit down. I’ll call you up when it’s time.”

With that, she gently patted my arm and turned to talk to another group of people, splashing gore around her heels as she kicked the loose intestine on the floor. Seeing the intestine bounce along the meeting room floor brought me back to reality and I almost sprinted for the office door. I hammered the button to open it but it wouldn’t budge. As I frantically pushed on it I heard Carla calling from the meeting room “OK folks, that’s five. Time for the next presentation to start so if you could gather back in the main meeting room please”

Panicking I abandoned the door and paced manically through the office looking for a decent hiding place when I spotted the server room door. Praying to whatever god would hear my call that this wasn’t one of the few times someone had remembered to lock it I tried the handle and to my relief the door swung inwards, the reassuring hum of cooling fans beckoning me inside. Slamming the door behind me I turned the lock and started pulling server racks against it. As I moved the contents of the room against the door I heard the lock click as someone unlocked it from the other side and Carla called through the door “We know you’re in there hun. I understand you’re not feeling too well but this presentation is mandatory” as though she were a teacher talking to a petulant child who refused to come out of the bathroom. “Yeah don’t be a spoilsport!” shouted someone else “We’re all getting up there!” chimed in another. A huge thud echoed through the room and the pile of server hardware shuddered as something was slammed into the door.

I can hear them out there, still chiding me as though I’m being unreasonable and occasionally ramming the server room door with something heavy. There’s no other way out of here and I’m not sure how long my makeshift barrier will hold. I can see another utility knife next to some old boxes in the corner but there’s no way I can fight them all off. Still, better a quick death than what they have planned for me. I just hope I bleed out before they make it through the door.

I will probably be studying abroad freshman year, but from what I hear most people don’t get internships their freshman year.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a first year CS student and I pretty much applied to this company for an Software Dev internship. Sadly got declined but they offered a QA internship position instead.  Should I take it or look for another dev internship? My fear is that it's pretty much summer now and most internship positions are already filled so It might be hard to find a suitable one.

I definitely want to work as a developer in the future but maybe the QA internship would be good to at least get an insight into how the software industry works and have something to put into my resume in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

PS! Next summer I won't be able to take an internship due to going out of the country"

I know this wont be the best place for me to post this but I really need some advice. 

I just finished my sophomore year of high school.  I am working towards my network and security + certs. I am already A+ certified. The issue is that many tech companies can be reluctant to hire people my age (I'm 20). Now, Im sure for some of you this hasn't been the case but I've always been told that I should wait to find a job in the tech industry starting my junior year of college for an internship. I do have a job as an IT help desk assistant at school which I really enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue for me is that retail stores don't take much interest in me. I have experience in volunteer work as well, extra circulars in school, a leadership position on campus and other past jobs. I'm thinking that some of these employers at retail stores assume that since Im in a ""nerdy"" major, that I have no social skills or that I will leave the company once a better opportunity arises. 

I am wondering, how many of you majoring in computer science, cyber security etc.. had problems finding a summer job like in retail, fast food etc that pay min wage?"

If you have 6 four month coop work terms, that would mean that that is 2 years that you are not in school taking courses, etc. I know that technically you could still be learning in the workplace but I don't think it would be as effective as if you were taking courses. Thus, wouldn't a regular cs student who just does internships over the summer and  focuses on school throughout the 4 years  know more and be generally more knowledgeable? Also if you wanted to do a joint honours or a double major would the regular program be a better option?"

bu4los,1,2019-05-28,Best way to share an o365 Access Database,jammerk,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/bu4los/best_way_to_share_an_o365_access_database/,"Good afternoon. I hope this post is allowed - take down if not. I am not a sysadmin by any means, but need advice in setting up a database for a small company. More specifically, how to store the back-end of a split database online.

Here is the situation:

I just started my summer internship at a small real estate business. They want me to aggregate all of their excel spreadsheets into one clean database. I've decided to use MS Access as it is already being paid for, and I think it is the most friendly to non-technical people who will have to update database records after I'm gone (I will be able to manage and set up forms and such for them to use). Since multiple users will be reading/writing the database simultaneously, I have opted for a split database (front and back-end) with the back-end (w/ tables and data) stored in the cloud and the front-end (w/ forms &amp; apps) stored locally on everybody's individual machine.

What I don't know, however, is the best way to share the back-end database among all the users in the company. Users will need to access data from **(a)** the office (different computers), **(b)** home, **(c)** abroad (business trips worldwide).

I have included various concepts I have found online below and my qualms about them:

1. **SharePoint**: It sounds nice, but people argue it is way overpriced. I only need something to store the back-end database online so that everybody can modify it individually on their own computers. I do enjoy the concept of web forms and reports running in the browser window.
2. **Remote-Desktop Connection**: I figure if I follow this route, I won't need to split the database and instead host everything on a desktop pc at the office and connect remotely. My issues with this are having users connected simultaneously (wouldn't only a single user be able to read/write the database at once?) and connectivity/ease of use (wouldn't it become annoying/slow/cumbersome to have to wait for each individual keystroke to register?)
3. **mySQL server:** My main issue here is I would have to deal with the learning curve of mySQL (which is not a big issue - I can do it.) However, as many of the staff are not incredibly technical it may be more of an issue once I finish my internship. Additionally, I was concerned about data availability and ensuring that when a user completes a form on the local front-end database that we can see that updated on the back-end instantaneously. I was also worried that the data could get corrupted if multiple people are reading/writing simultaneously.
4. **Network Attached Storage:** As there is not a tremendous amount of data (certainly less than 2gb), I was thinking about storing the database on a small flash drive and plugging it into the router. Would you be able to connect to the NAS if you aren't on the same LAN? Would there be any issues with multiple users reading/writing at the same time?
5. **OneDrive/Google Drive/Box:** Our company already uses box so this would make them happy if we could store the back-end here. I am concerned though as I am almost certain the database would get corrupted if we have multiple read/writes at the same time.

Please let me know which option you think would be the best for hosting the back-end! Ideally want the cheapest option.

Ready to answer more clarifying questions. I'm not super comfortable with system administration yet but doing my best for this internship. Sorry for if its clunky/confusing/long. Thank you in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Should be no more than 10 people who will need access. Changes will likely be made once or twice a day. Just spoke with my boss, he is okay with only one user writing at once - but ideally multiple will still need to read at once. Leaning towards hosting the database on a workstation at the office and having employees connect via RDP to the workstation in order to read/write."

Hi all,

I just finished up my 3rd year of CS and was not able to lock down an internship for this summer. This is most likely because I had a stressful spring semester and i was a bit late to applying for them. Anyways, I have one more summer left before I graduate and would like some advice on how to get an internship in my situation.

I expect my GPA to be around a 3.0 (probably a 2.85-2.90 if Im being honest) and I havent had any professional experience to speak of. Whenever I apply for internships or interview, the company seems to expect, or act surprised at the fact that I have not had a professional job yet. This always bothered me because I'm not quite sure how they can expect a 20 year old college student to have already had 2 jobs! After all, thats what the internship is for, isnt it?

Anyhow, I've been on plenty of interviews, I've done well in my CS classes, I have a good number of skills and tools under my belt, and yet here I am working in a kitchen after my junior year. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation, I would more than appreciate some wisdom.

Thanks Everybody!"

However, most of those recruiters worked for consulting agencies, and doing a consulting job is a nono for me. 

I'm currently not actively looking as I'm still doing my internship abroad, but according to some recruiters, they are already recruiting juniors for the coming Fall. I quite like the idea of having the recruiter contact me instead of me applying, so I might reconsider putting my resume online. But on the other hand, I also don't want to get spammed by consulting offers. Should I mention on my resume that I am specifically not looking to engage in any consulting job ? Would this limit my chances with other job offers ?"

Now I was originally being interviewed for a graduate position but I ended up failing to get this, the day i received confirmation i had failed, I got a telephone call offering me another role. I was sent over the job advert (being advertised internally) and it was for a c#/asp .net MVC role. 2 things i have never used, touched or got close to learning. Now i have some Java experience (very minor) from Uni, however I was pretty bad at this and preferred the web development side of things, using Node. (still not very good at this/barely a junior).

Now they wanted me because I have actually had some experience compared to the other graduates, a) working has a chef for 8 years, b) I've had 2 internships over the summer with a web development company and non technical company (doing up their website etc). I'm really shitting it over the fact they somehow think I'm used to C# development, I never had this on my CV and it never came up in any interviews but still it worries me they think with the internships I'm more experience than I am.

I'm nervous as hell, would it be an idea to contact my team lead on linkedIn to ask what he expects me to know?, i've spoken to him before to ask what training stuff they use but that was a good month ago.  Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with the ever increasing load of anxiety that's building up?"
bu5qkp,0,2019-05-28,"3 weeks into programming internship, I'm feeling overwhelmed. Need some guidance.",dirtyashtray,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bu5qkp/3_weeks_into_programming_internship_im_feeling/,"After I ditched my old career, it took me 5 months to finally get an internship in programming. Packed with some experience from previously failed tech interviews, I've finally made it. The interview itself was easy enough for me to pass. (some very general concepts about programming (C), and what some code snippets would print).

&amp;#x200B;

Other than high school(10 years ago)I have no computer science background, except what I've self-taught myself after quitting my old job. I did C++ in HS, but I wouldn't give a damn about it back then. Got myself an Arduino, and made 2 little projects which also helped in the interview process.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 3 weeks into the internship, with other 4 people. These gals have just graduated uni with a degree in CS. Of course they're miles ahead of me. The trainer assigned us with solving some C problems in a given time, after teaching some basics of Linux and working in bash. (I have never touched these before the start of internship, but I can handle that now)

&amp;#x200B;

I might be able to do some cool stuff as a hobby with an Arduino, but given an array to do sorting stuff with, I'm dead. 

I have C syntax issues, I see pointers where I have no idea why they're used in that particular case. 

Structs with linked list, nada.  I don't know much about data structures.

Numeral systems, multiple base conversion based on the user input. I needed a lot of help to get that finished and I still didn't quite fully understand as to why it works.  The trainer seems like a cool guy, he knows I have no professional or educational background in anything related to programming, but I feel like I should work harder. This internship might turn into a full time job months later and I don't want to fail and start the job hunt all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

So my main problem is I have gaps in my C knowledge. The internship process is fast, and I find it difficult to keep up with the others. I need to start (almost) from scratch, relearn some fundamentals, especially: pointers , structs, functions, etc. 

I still don't get what pass by value/by reference is, what arguments are in main function like argc,  \* argv, and many other things.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any books, online crash courses with examples, ""explain me the C language like I'm 5"", or something the like, which would help me fill the gaps in my knowledge? Just to take me to a semi-decent level.

I've namely been looking at two: Online Master's in Computer Science, and Online Master's in Analytics, both from Georgia Tech.

Will it hurt my career to obtain my master's degree so soon after getting my BS? Would it be a red flag to potential future employers?

I am in a very good position financially and may be in a position with a company (on third internship with them, will most likely receive a full-time offer) to have them pay for it (their assistance amount would cover either degree in its entirety). Of course this means I would be obligated to work at this company for some years after obtaining the degree (though I'm not sure I want that - different story for a different time, and I could always cover the degree cost myself, both of these are insanely cheap).

Obviously I have yet to make a decision on which program to go with, and will be looking at other school's/degrees for that matter - so if any advice is specific to this aspect of the decision, feel free to lay it on.

Appreciate any feedback!

Edit: Felt necessary to make clear that if I choose to obtain my MS, I will do so part time while working full time. I do not plan on delaying my entrance into industry (though I probably won't be entering a tech company), so it's more of a ""do I get it over with now or later"" sort of question. Not working isn't an option for me, I'd go stir crazy."

I am going into my final year of studies at university for software engineering. I feel as though I have a good grasp on development as a whole and I enjoy coding projects. I was planning on getting an internship this summer but after applying to 60+ places this spring I had no luck getting one. So now I need a back up plan. I was considering classes but I have limited options to only the second half semester. I want a part-time job in the meantime but one that could benefit my future rather than another temporary job that has no benefit to me in the long run.

What do?"

bu9esr,1,2019-05-28,Internships vs Freelance for a Software Developer in the making,dillonj898,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bu9esr/internships_vs_freelance_for_a_software_developer/,"First I should say that I’m a IT major (Junior going to be a Senior) and I focus on Software Development. I would like my career to to be centered in analytics, whether that be business, financial, or healthcare.

So I’m in a bit of a predicament right now. I’m not very confident in my ability to find an internship. This is because my grades aren’t great (I know that’s not a priority for all companies but it’s still a weakness), and I feel I’m still light on my portfolio. I get that the point of an internship is to get experience but I feel like I don’t bring enough to the table to begin with. Most of my applications are pending right now so I’m not sure if I will eat my words or not.

Now I started freelancing around this past October. For me, this was difficult to do during the school year but now with summer I know I can home in on that much more and really zoom in on it. Currently I’m only on Upwork but I plan to expand my range to other platforms as well.

Now of course I could do both at the same time, but it’s the internship that I’m concerned about. Maybe it is less difficult to land that kind of job than I believe in my head, but I’m thinking that the worst-case scenario will happen and I’ll have no internship. And regardless of whatever happens, I’ll be working on side-projects, whether it’s for my own portfolio or getting paid for it.

My real question is this: if I went down this summer and worked freelance only (of course working projects relevant to the type of jobs I want to do), would freelance experience be considered just as acceptable as internships by employers?"
bu9ggq,18,2019-05-28,Where do I even start with leetcode?,GinjaTurtles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bu9ggq/where_do_i_even_start_with_leetcode/,"Last December I received a coding challenge from google for a possible internship. I absolutely bombed the coding challenge because I had never touched leetcode. 


This summer I have a great amount of free time and I plan on thoroughly studying so when December of this year comes around I can hopefully ace the google interview. 


Where do I even start with leetcode? There’s so many questions and I see a lot of other sites also recommended like interview cake and firecode. 


My plan of study this summer is to do the following: 
- Start with firecode.io and interview cake -&gt; review both of these


-  Do leetcode easy’s until I can knock out solutions in 25 mins and feel comfortable


- then CTCI and LC mediums until I can knock out solutions in 25-30 mins and feel comfortable 


- then do a little of EPI and a few leetcode hards 



Solving strategy: 
1. Pick a question.
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes.
3. Allocate the first 5 minutes to understand the problem and ask/answer clarifying questions to yourself.
4. Spend the next 20 minutes solving the problem 
5. Spend the next 10 minutes studying the solution.
6. Stop. Even if you’re in the middle of something important like trying to understand the solution. Do not spend more than 30–35 minutes per question.
7. Record activity in excel document recording how much time I spent on it 
8. Revisit the question and attempt solve again next week/next session 
9. Just don't copy and paste the answer (or even go back and forth looking at it and typing it).  Come back to the problem later on the next day once you have ""forgotten"" the answer (at least the line by line), but still remember the answer's ""concept"" or ""trick"", and then try to fill out the answer.



What can I do to maximize my chances of performing well on the coding challenge and technical interview?"

bua24y,92,2019-05-29,Guide to consulting in Australia,Interested2ndParty,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/bua24y/guide_to_consulting_in_australia/,"Hi all, I've been here for a while on one account or another. Having recently started at a top-tier consulting firm in Australia, and knowing how little good info there is online, I thought that I'd do a quick rundown on how consulting recruitment works in Australia. 

# MBB

Firstly, recruiting for MBB is very different in Australia compared to elsewhere. The top consultancies don't actually offer internships in general, so the major pipeline is grad recruitment that begins at the start of your final year. There's exceptions to this, most notably being the various scholarships on offer which function as an alternative recruitment stream. If you're interested in getting into MBB, definitely apply for any of these that you're eligible for as it's standard practice to take in approx. as many through this channel as they do for grad. The scholarship applications are open to penultimate students in the second half of the first semester. If you receive a grad offer as a penultimate student you'll be able to push it back to whenever is convenient. 

&amp;#x200B;

The interview style is very similar to everywhere else in the world so the standard advice applies for doing well in those. One thing which to me stood out (maybe just for my firm) though was that they definitely have a large emphasis on 'non-traditional' candidates. Med students, eng students, and law students placed extremely well. If you're a commerce student looking to get into MBB, definitely consider doing a double degree or taking steps otherwise to differentiate yourself. By the final round, the students who came across as being too gung-ho consulting were largely eliminated already. My advice would also be to not learn any frameworks and instead from the start practice by creating your own problem trees. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since they don't offer internships, the companies you should be looking to intern at are the other consultancies (see below, preference to tier-2) and investment banks. A significant number of the yearly intake at MBB have had internships at banks or are lateraling from a bank as an analyst/associate. It's pretty common to see banking analysts go into consulting after a year or two on the job, alongside other recent graduates who have been working in generalist roles in government (ex. PM&amp;C) or in engineering or law. 

&amp;#x200B;

Networking doesn't play a big role at all in recruiting for MBB (in my experience at least). It's good to come in with a solid understanding of the industry and what makes the company different, but don't stress about trying to get referrals (although referrals do exist). 

# Other consultancies

Other firms which are strong in Australia include LEK, ATK, Strat&amp;, Accenture, Oliver Wyman, alongside the Big 4. Each of these offer internship programs which make up the bulk of their recruitment. The Big 4 typically do their internship recruitment very early on (first couple weeks of sem1 penultimate) so make sure you don't miss these, although they open up another round later on in the year for consulting as well. ATK, Strat&amp; and Accenture offer winter internships which also open early so definitely apply to these too. LEK, Oliver Wyman and Big 4 only do summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

The type of candidate who succeeds in these is more of the standard consulting jet that MBB doesn't bring in as much. Being involved in consulting clubs on campus gives you a huge edge for these. If you're out of state, the firms will fly you in to interview and to work over the summer. There's still a lot of prestige in these companies and it's not at all uncommon to lateral between firms at the higher levels. In addition, you can be rejected from these companies and still get an offer from MBB. I've heard of instances where applicants were rejected without interview from Accenture and still were able to receive an offer from an MBB. 

&amp;#x200B;

If people have any questions about recruitment or the direction the industry is going in Australia I'm happy to try answering them."
bua3yk,5,2019-05-29,Is this unpaid internship legal? -New Jersey,strikeout1066,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bua3yk/is_this_unpaid_internship_legal_new_jersey/,"I'm a (21+) college student pursuing a degree in a computer related field. Over the summer I decided to try to get an internship to see which field I want to focus on once I graduate. I have excellent grades and am involved on campus and hoped to receive a paid internship. Unfortunately out of all the applications I sent out I only was given an interview for an unpaid internship at a local business. (Keeping it vague for anonymity).  


I got the internship and started. Here's where I think things are getting a little fishy. My main duties of this internship are to do everything an employee does, except handle the payments and waivers. On the side I do projects related to my field. These projects are done outside of the ""work"" (free labor) that I would be doing. I have no problem doing these side projects, and I have no problem working the floor. What I do have a problem with is being unpaid for doing the same tasks as a regular employee on top of these side projects.  


I looked into the laws in New Jersey about how there is certain criteria that must be met in order to qualify as an official unpaid internship. I feel like the one benefitting from the unpaid work is the employer, and not me. I am a hard worker and do not want to pour in hours of work into this internship if I should be legally compensated for it.  


Any advice is really appreciated. If you need anymore information let me know (my first post here).

We knew that this planned startup of ours would likely take years to take off (if at all), and all agreed to develop our career aspirations first, and work on our startup on the side. As a fresh graduate with previous internship and research experience, would it be beneficial for me to mention my startup, or would potential employers see our startup as a potential risk? I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea that I will abandon their company anytime soon in order to continue my pursuit in this startup, since the startup is essentially a long term goal with no guarantee that it will take off. However developing the startup did force me to learn new skill sets and experience development from a different angle, which is something that I want to highlight."

Anyway im a 20 year old dude im a college student and basically i applied for a course that compresses 2 years into one year and it was fine but the internship rejected me but i was accepted in the theoretical part... which means i had to do a lot of hardwork and less freetime which is fine 

&amp;#x200B;

but its also the bad college organization that made my life suffer... put me into 2 classes instead of one and also wanting me to fail as in delaying my assignments giving me too much (ik its a hard class but they give other people more time while i had to do everything)  I cant go one day without thinking about what my assignments are or to do homework. I cant go to the gym.. cant socialise and cant live IDK how my classmates are doing it but i cant enjoy life because homework etc.. cant chase my dreams because homework.. cant go to parties in fact my friends start to stop inviting me because the answer is often when i try to do sompthing other than homework i feel an alert that i must make my homework everytime i cant go for my drivers liencence and i cant do anything i want i feel terrible and i always study a lot  from early in the morring to late i sleep barrly but i was motivated to do it i often eat unhealty and drink a lot of energy to do all the works

It was fine until march...i had a lot of warnings i fail and i also had it too busy at my internship so i coudnt do my internship assignments but i just feel shit i had too much and so much hw that i fell asleep in the lessons because of work i got no support no oversight and i am always tired,,, i also start to isolate myself because i had too much to do and my friends started to worry about me... while i always use the tape recording of ""im busy beep"""" but they begin to notice the cracks in my since my personality changed 180 from outgoing to stressful and sad

&amp;#x200B;

May was the worst month of 2019 i was almost put back in the normal course and i cried mid the conversation then i went on vacation for 2 weeks to Egypt meeting with family but because of my depression i fucked there up with family then i returned at a even worse state before the vacation  I was a member of a discord support group but even they get tired of me and my college rants

&amp;#x200B;

On June 7 i have a conversation with my teacher about progress and i fear that i will be degraded i meanwhile worked twice as hard to still convince her I applyed for a new college and i hope i will start a new life but that depends on her but to no avill  Also **its not the studying** itself that killing me but the fact that the college administration is so broken that they put me in 2 classes for no fucking reason the eternal forums i must fill in like im a IRS bureaucrat that dosent add up to what ive learned and also the fact that college takes until 7PM killed my entire bloomer personality... now replaced with cynicism and complete suicidal feelings  

&amp;#x200B;

College took a lot of time from me... causing me to fail to develop as a person due to no  new experiences  


&amp;#x200B;

I already prepared my suicide i know where i will do it.... how i will do it... I have a legacy contact and even a pre recorded suicide meassage consist of why i commited suicide  this to prevent unessersary suffering

However, I hit a few problems with the approaches I have tried with the problem.

1. I was going through the Tesseract documentation and I am unable to find anything related to it despite the fact I found people claiming it has a capability to detect tables in a document. Their method is apparently based on this [paper](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub35652) so it is likely that it is there , so if anyone can point  me in the right direction, it would be great.
2. Another way I thought was edge detection but that just finds the edges of everything in the document, so that was probably never going to work anyway.
3. I found a research paper here [https://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk/members/projects/conference/Table-Detection-in-Document-Images-using-Foreground-and-Background-Features.pdf](https://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk/members/projects/conference/Table-Detection-in-Document-Images-using-Foreground-and-Background-Features.pdf) that required me train the model myself. In this, I am requires preprocessing in the form of highlighting alphabets in one color and numbers in another. After that step, I know how to do what is to be done, but I am unsure on how to do it myself.
4. How do I correct false positives if I am using Google Vision API to detect text? It is fairly accurate but it doesn't do too well if I am not using a sparse document. I thought of using non max suppression, but then it made the results worse ( it may be a bug,so I am still fixing it )

If anyone knows any particular API's that work, could you share them with me?"
bubpv4,1,2019-05-29,17M- i like stories,ThorMagurowitz,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/bubpv4/17m_i_like_stories/,"I think I might just say all the things I like doing and then ask a question. If you know the answers to the question, or just wanna give general advice, please write :)

I like programming. As I've been learning Python on the side it's become one of my main hobbies. I like both the technical side of ""there's a problem, find the problem, fix it with logic and guided trial and error"" and of course the creative side, where for whatever you're coding, you have an end vision, and you can use your expertise to make your project exactly like that end vision.

I like filmmaking. I considered filmmaking for a while but I dropped the dream about a year ago cause I never actually got around to making something. I've been making a music video as part of my Creative Media coursework though, and jeez is it fun. I like so much that as a medium, there are 10000 different variables that can all be toyed around with to get the final project according to the vision you want. As opposed to, you know, something like writing in which the only variable is what word to use next. 

Writing also attracts me. Last summer I did an internship at my dad's ad firm and tried out some copywriting (ad writing) and that was really fun. I liked playing around with the words and thoughts. I also liked the idea of this being a skill I could freelance with. They said I had promise.

Also anthropology. When I was a tween, what got me into studying human systems and their histories and workings was strategy games. Like Civ 5 and Crusader Kings 2, where you could observe how a society develops given different factors. I also got interested in linguistics when I learned Icelandic and Urdu had the same common ancestor- Proto-Indo-European. That kind of connection is crazy to me. No one else seems to geek out about that fact but me, btw. Frustrating. Either way, I was thinking of applying for an anthropology degree at Uni. You know what, I think I like it for the same reason I like filmmaking and writing. I like stories. And characters. The human race is its own story.

Is there something that combines all of these pursuits?"

My  IGETC is completely finished and I’d have to take about the same number of courses to graduate in two years. I’m having difficulty in deciding between schools before the SIR deadline with all schools essentially neck and neck. As of now here are my pros and cons for each school, my main goal is to get into medical school:




UCI:


Pros- FA covers the cost of attendance &amp; I currently have an internship at UCI Medical Center doing cancer research (which I could use for course credit), would also be able to continue my volunteering position at one of the local hospitals, more or less relaxed nature 


Cons- I would be commuting 30-45 minutes daily (I would much rather be dorming as I’ve been living in orange the majority of my life)




UCSD:


Pros- Would be dorming, located near multiple hospitals so attaining a volunteer position and research on campus would not be too much of an issue (I hope)


Cons- FA would not cover the total cost of attendance (would have to pay roughly 7500 out of pocket per year, however, working over the summer should cover half of the years tuition), socially dead (?), cutthroat academics nature (?)




UCSB:


Pros- Would be dorming, big on research and hopefully would not be too big of an issue to gain a position, FA covers cost of attendance (albeit I will be receiving 3000 in work study), relaxed nature, social scene


Cons- not many hospitals near the campus (volunteering would be more difficult I’m assuming), not as strong in the sciences as the other two schools (?)




Other things I’m considering:
1. Will medical school care about where I attended my undergrad?
2. Can anyone confirm or deny the academic nature/competitiveness at these schools?
3. How difficult is it to attain research positions at UCSD and UCSB?
4. Anyone regret their decision to attend one of these UCs?
5. Are there any important topics that I have not thought about?




I’ve been swaying between schools for the past month (while also browsing reddit for some help) and I’m not any closer to deciding where I’d like to go next year. I’d greatly appreciate it if you guys could give me some insight as to how I could make this final decision. :)"

I am a Senior graduating in the fall with a double major in electrical and computer engineering. I was drawn to engineering because I love to create things and learn new things. Honestly I have loved school and all the classes I have taken.
3 weeks ago I started as an embedded systems intern for a Fortune 500 company. The job pays very well and I was super excited because this company works on some pretty crazy things. After just 3 weeks, I am not sure if I can do this anymore. I go to work for 9 hours and not one person wants to have a conversation. These people literally are just decaying in there cubicles. I sit here and do almost nothing all day long. Really the only thing I do, is ask what I can be doing. From what I can tell no one really does anything for most the day.
I want more out of my career. I love talking to people and socializing. I want to be successful and I will not settle for a job making only 70k and absolutely hate the job. For those of you who love your job, what do you do? Where do you think I would like to be? I was thinking a start up would be fun. I’ve done sales as my side job for the last few years and enjoyed it, so it could be fun to be around those kind of guys. What advice would you give to a 22 year old who is about to graduate?

Edit: To clarify, I am okay with working in a cubicle, it’s just the environment here that is bad. I would love a little bit more of a upbeat environment."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a math major at a well-respected university (UT Austin) and I'm currently under a huge dilemma. Before I chose math I was an engineering major at a community college, and after going through the course work, I realized engineering was too tough for me after a slew of bad grades. But after spending a year at my current university, I realized that I feel more interested in engineering and that I am more passionate and curious about it. Back at CC I feel that I just didn't know which discipline to study later on at a university, and I am now finding most of the concepts in the math major as trivial and useless unless you want to pursue research or work in academia. 

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest concern is about whether I should continue with the math major and go to graduate school for engineering, or transfer to a different university in Texas for engineering. I have already applied for an internal transfer (change of major) at UT Austin for engineering, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get in. However, after doing research on reddit and many other forums it seems that a math bachelor's --&gt; engineering graduate school is starting to seem like a path that is not viable these days. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really anxious because I'm going into my 4th year of college (did 2 at a CC, just finished 1 year at UT Austin) and if I choose to attend another university for engineering I would spend at least 2.5 years catching up on course work and potentially lose some credit hours + money is tight. I also don't have any research experience or internships (but I'm hoping to get some next summer) so graduate school might seem a little reach for me since I would not be a very competitive applicant.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that many others are going through the same dilemma, but any insight would be appreciated, thank you."
buh8h9,5,2019-05-29,Need advice from those who've left CS,churning_medic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/buh8h9/need_advice_from_those_whove_left_cs/,"I'm a 27yr old currently working as a firmware engineer on Long Island NY. I loved it in school and graduated with a near perfect GPA, but after hitting industry I learned to absolutely hate it. I'm about 4 years into it and I'm looking for a change. Unfortunately as someone who does firmware, my experience is in mostly C and I have little to no web-dev experience. Due in part to my total lack of interest in the field and the unwillingness of my company to let me expand beyond my role, I'm getting extremely rusty. I cannot continue down this path and I'm looking for options. After taking a sabbatical between jobs in 2017 (Australia and NZ for two months) I've been bitten by the travel bug so ideally I'd like to work in something remote or at least work towards that. As someone who craves innovation and new ideas, it's no wonder why I would rather slam my finger in a car door a million times than walk into the office  (accidentally did that last weekend lol... my finger is YUUUGEEE). Fintech has kind of become a low-key interest of mine as I dive deeper into the world of credit cards and award travel (/r/churning/) but I'm not a believer in crypto yet; blockchain, yes, but not crypto. As someone who used to take animation classes as a kid, UX/UI design also seems like a viable option. 

I currently almost debt free (never had a student loan and I have just one more car payment left) and I'm an aggressive saver... (about $40k in my portfolio and another $45k in savings). I was trying to save up for a downpayment, but at this point I think I need to re-tool and invest in myself.

One of my biggest issues at the moment is that I have zero energy when I get home to want to write more code and study for something that I've convinced myself that I hate to the point where I've turned down interview requests from Amazon, Google, and Tesla multiple times. Part of that is I just don't want to get sucked into working for a big company; I've been there, done that already (on job #4 already, including my internship at Texas Instruments, the ""big company""). I've always had a bit of an entrepreneurial spirit to me; I'm always at Startup Weekend events; used to spend time at maker-spaces until my interest in embedded died completely; and you can almost always find me listening to a Tim Ferris, Mixergy, Lewis Howes, or Chris Guillebaau podcasts/audiobooks. I basically never pay attention to social media, TV/print media, or pop-culture... I couldn't even begin to tell you what Game of Thrones is even about if I'm being honest. I'm just so hyper-focused right now on getting out of this rut that I'm basically in fight-or-flight mode if I'm not on vacation (went to Austin this past weekend so I was able to be a little more ""in the moment."").

Just to clarify ahead of time, yes I do suffer from depression and have tried a number of different treatment options (talk-therapy, medication, and TMS therapy). The TMS was by-far the most successful, but didn't get me totally there. I started seeing a new social worker a little over a month ago, she's very unorthodox, but I'm making huge strides with her. I also also started using CBD oil which I'm mostly taking to supplement my epilepsy medication; not a druggie and never even smoked weed, but it's FDA cleared for epilepsy so worth a shot). My epilepsy is literally the only thing keeping me at my job at the moment. Without health insurance to cover the meds I'm basically down shit's creek at $2000+/month for the stuff after manufacturer's and GoodRx coupons. 

For the time-being I'd like to stay in/around NY as my boyfriend lives in Brooklyn and is finishing up school.

With all that said, I'm thinking of a few options. I think at the end of the day I want to be an entrepreneur, but I need to expose my mind to new ideas and I can't do that by doing the same thing every day.

* Try my hardest to learn something on my own time and peruse a career in that while I stay where I am. I don't think I'll be very successful at this because the last thing I want to do after spending all day coding is coding more, at least in this current frame of mind.  

* Leave the job and learn on my own while working at Costco, Starbucks, Home Depot, or similar to maintain health insurance.

* Work at Costco while attending a coding bootcamp to re-tool myself in webdev, UI/UX, data, etc.

* Leave SWE all together and maybe go into IT. But I'm not sure what options exist that allow me to work remote and what other qualifications I'd need. If it's anything like what the IT department does at my current job, I can't imagine remote work ever happening; too much hardware to maintain. I imagine I'd also need to get more qualifications and go back to school for this, so I may still need that Costco job in the meantime. I tend to be very skilled at things like this, I've got basically zero fear of disassembling a laptop/phone and replacing parts, did it last night; finding my way around technology has always come natural to me even before school which is part of why I went into CE in the first place, so maybe IT is an option. 

* Go back to school and get my MBA (either at Costco or in my current role); since I ultimately want to be an entrepreneur, I figure this could be a way to go. I realize that a lot of MBA programs are total BS and mostly for networking purposes, but I don't see how an established company is going to let me into the business side of things without one. I feel super trapped in the CS/CE side of things. I'm so sick of people telling me that I can do anything with a STEM/Engineering degree; when I ask them ""oh yeah, like what?"" nothing comes to mind.

* I got my real estate license before starting this current job. I was about to go full-throttle into it when I was nabbed by a recruiter for this current job. I figured I'd give embedded one last go so I did. I figured it'd take me at least 90-days for a house to close before making any money in RE. I was trying to at least do RE part-time but it never happened. So I could explore going back to it.

* Try to find something where my current skills might be useful that doesn't require me to code. I recently got interviewed for a position as a ""Technical Account Manager"" which seemed interesting. Not what I'd want to do for the rest of my life, but definitely different and allows me to detox from SWE while opening my mind to new ideas. So I'm thinking about more positions like that. Business analyst or consultant also seem like possible options, but with everything seemingly geared towards web, ML and AI these days, I don't see very many opportunities in embedded for this.

Apologies for the rant, but I'm trying to get everything out there on paper/screen before I ask for alternative/additional options. Given everything I've mentioned above, does anybody else have any suggestions or advice for me? Thanks. Feel free to ask questions below and/or PM me.

buhhyp,1,2019-05-29,Am I Doing Something Wrong? (Need Advice),fantaisiae,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/buhhyp/am_i_doing_something_wrong_need_advice/,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to read. I'm sorry it's kind of long and/or spotty but I want to give as much info as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I have finished school (undergrad) in August of 2018 in STEM. Since then, I have been trying to get my career kickstarted by searching for a variety of entry-level positions which I feel work well with my degree. It was slow at first; I was not really getting many interviews for the positions that I wanted, and when I did they were for jobs not really tuned to my major. From August to maybe November of 2018, I was applying to approximately 7 positions a day (more or less), so I had applied to hundreds by the end of that period.

&amp;#x200B;

During school, I had two paid part-time positions/internships that were directly related to my desired career path and are a good testament to my ability to perform the job functions of those I am applying to (especially research positions). Even then, I realized that I did not really have much to show for my résumé so I had an HR rep from a local university look it over at some point in late October/early November and she told me there was nothing wrong with it and I am clearly qualified for the work I'm looking for. She even went out of her way to give my résumé to professionals in her network at said university to try to get me work. The only proposal she received was an unpaid internship, which was incredibly upsetting, but it was with a really prestigious individual in the field so I told myself at least to go for it and get the experience under my belt while I wait.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that ended up being miserable at the end of it because of work drama and other things, and the offer I ended up receiving was to work in the call center of the office even though the internship (which was 5 months long, I ended in April) was exclusively research work. I decided to reject the offer because I felt I was capable of more than that, and they definitely knew that I had a desire to start my career in research and quite frankly I felt disrespected (that's my own thing though, and I don't mean to disrespect call center reps or anything of the sort). They gave it to me because I'm ""good with talking on the phone"" but still, I want something related to my degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, during the time I was doing the internship and even up until now, I have gone to maybe 10 interviews; more often than not, the interviewers laud me during the interviews, saying things like ""you're clearly qualified"" and ""you should consider yourself a finalist"" (for those that required multiple interviews). At one point, a recruiter for a top hospital had fast-tracked me into multiple interviews in different departments at the request of my interviewers because they ""see me to be a good fit at 'x' department."" However, time and time again I get ghosted by these recruiters/interviewers and I'm quite tired of reaching out to them, because I feel that if they truly wanted me I would hear from them sooner than later. I will say I believe I am a great interviewer and I have never been self-conscious about my ability to speak, and I feel these anecdotes prove that.

&amp;#x200B;

So what am I doing wrong? I am on my 8th month of unemployment and it is getting quite frustrating to see that other people are successful and I have yet to be, to be bugged about it by parents, and to hear these people who interview me tell me all these good things about my qualifications and ghost me at the end of it. I've been thinking the only thing I can do is go back to school but I don't feel like I should send myself deeper in debt (which I have yet been able to start paying off) if my undergrad degree is doing nothing for me as if the grad degree is guaranteed to. Maybe I should pay someone to review my résumé, since perhaps the HR rep's opinion might not be sufficient enough? The only thing I have going for me is my part-time work (which I love) but it's not *that* related to my major. 

&amp;#x200B;

Help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks."

I do not have experience besides a small unpaid internship. 

I've interviewed with a few studios(mostly Indie) but I feel that they are underpaying for the amount of work they require me to do. ex: last indie company that interviewed me has a VR project in where I'll be the only programmer with two other artist making an entire game using Unity and they were paying 25$/hr.

Should I just lower my expectations in the pay? I'm only hearing from the indie companies so I'm starting to get a bit concerned about it. I live in MTL also so taxes are 15%.

bujc87,1,2019-05-29,Management or Technical Path. Stuck in Desktop Support with minimal networking opportunities or mentors.,DentureBrothers,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bujc87/management_or_technical_path_stuck_in_desktop/,"After some recent internal staff shifts my manager has acknowledged my stagnation and wants to help me out in matching me up with a mentor or providing training. **Looking for suggestions given my own interests and current skills.**


Background:
I do not have an IT degree, I have an Arts Degree.
3 Years Intern / Work Study at my colleges IT department, quickly became trusted and gained FTE over the summers doing more complicated tasks and additional systems access. Graduated and immediately hopped into...


All Mac MSP... 2 Years Phone Support and 1 Year Junior Sysadmin experience (The MSP, had 2 retail locations, 60 staff, 40 Small/Med Business clients, 5-6k end users) Worked out of the Mac AD equivalent (Open Directory), managed prosumer firewalls. Managed camera, backups, and voip phone systems for larger clients Left for...


2 years Desktop Support at a university, helped them launch a walkup help desk (as the sole staffer) Got bored pretty quickly plenty of time to self teach or read, or just be on reddit =/ Was only helping 10-15 people a day with simple tasks.


Reconnected with my MSP manager. Hired at Fortune 50 company as part of re-envisioned (very Apple like) Walk Up Help Desk for internal staff. 4 years ago it was 7 of us helping maybe 400 people a week at 2 locations on campus. I now manage one of the 5 locations (Title is Technical Analyst 2, but also ""Lead"") with about 1500 people weekly (and a &lt;humble brag&gt; 25% survey response rate and 92 NPS score).


Managing or ""Lead""ing that location is primarily administrative, and less technical than the path I became interested in while at the MSP. I tend to the display technology (standard issue stuff for employees to test or look at), order and stock adapters and cables for our vending machine, head off smaller staff and client escalations. Put out small fires (why has this ticket sat for a week) etc. 


The recent staff shifts opened the possibility to lead one of the other 5 locations. I’m at one of the nicer, newer locations, but its also the least trafficked in addition to being the most disconnected from other IT staff. I see the same 5 IT staff daily, while 2 of the other Walk Up locations share floors with hundreds of IT staff. So networking is difficult outside of being present at as many social and holiday events as possible. People literally don’t know who I am even if my manager sings my praises to other managers or higher ups.


A candidate for that location has been selected... So it looks like I’m sticking around the less trafficked location, but my manager had a very open conversation acknowledging that they know I feel disconnected and unable to network or grow my career. So now I’m looking for suggestions for Mentoring or Training. Im on a campus with 9000k people…. So I’m sure I can find someone to rub shoulders with.


Im not in any way burned out by day to day end user support. Face to face support is significantly easier than the phone support days. I also enjoy talking to people and helping them out. I’ve worked in plenty of other customer service roles prior to and concurrent with these IT positions. I waited tables for 6 years and I’m currently the Asst. General Manager at a nationally recognized Haunted House where I directly oversee 30-40 staff and assist the full 400 person staff indirectly. 


Shadowing under the Technical Analyst 3 guys doing all the higher level Active Directory Work is off the Table. They have 2 people under them already that just started. I could go under the wing of our Mac Systems Admin, but I’d rather not limit myself back to a Mac specific career path. 


Im also beating myself up over all this because I can’t decide what path **I want to go down**. I enjoy working with people and enjoy face to face interaction… But I also enjoy learning more technical things and the challenges. Learning about Firewall stuff in 2012 was a blast.


(Edit) After another Talk today with my manager suggested taking my employers up on their education Reimbursement plan and considering a BS in Management Information Systems. They feel thats a nice middle ground between “working with people and technical things”"
bujnjb,1,2019-05-29,How to follow up with a recruiter who says they want to keep in contact?,ACGingiroo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bujnjb/how_to_follow_up_with_a_recruiter_who_says_they/,"Hi all,

I had a phone interview for a really cool summer internship (at my dream company!) several months ago with a recruiter of the department the intern would be working in. I had a great conversation with the recruiter that lasted ~45 minutes, and afterward, she let me know that it would take a week or so to get back to me about second round interviews.

A week goes by, and she informs me by email that the internship has been canceled for the summer. However, she said that I stood out as a candidate, that she would love to keep in contact, and that they might be offering the same internship in the fall.

This all happened in mid-March. I sent a thoughtful email back to her about how grateful I was for her time and that I'd like to take her out to lunch, but since then I haven't said anything because I didn't feel like there was anything else left to say, plus I was finishing up my degree.

Having recently graduated, I wanted to rekindle that connection and let her know that I am still interested in the company without seeming pushy/annoying/needy. I sent her a nice email last week explaining that I graduated and moved back home (to where the company is), and I asked her if she was available for coffee the next week (I gave her days and times as well). I also asked if she knew whether or not the company would have an internship for the fall. 

Here's the thing: she hasn't responded to me, and I'm not sure if I should send a follow-up email or not. I understand she's very busy, but she did say that she wanted to keep in contact with me... so I'm not sure what to do. I'm thinking of following up with her about a coffee date again and make it clear that if she's too busy we don't have to meet up. But I don't want to push away this valuable connection by being too pushy and annoying.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Should I follow up with a second email? If I should, what can I write to make sure it doesn't sound too pushy or needy?"
bujq6f,1459,2019-05-29,"I’m a doctor. I just moved into a new town, and their hospital is a little—strange.",eggiestnerd,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bujq6f/im_a_doctor_i_just_moved_into_a_new_town_and/,"I recently moved to this city on the east coast of the US called Cedarville. I’m typing this because I honest to god have no idea what’s going on. Let me tell the story. 

After years of living in quite a boring suburban area, I thought moving to a city would be a nice change of scenery. After all, I enjoy being on the move and having a lot to do, and I’ve always found cities being able to satisfy the constant need for stimulation. 

When I was house-hunting, I found the perfect apartment. Perfectly in my price range and everything. I didn’t know where I expected it to be, but Cedarville was never anywhere close to being on my list of guesses. 

First of all, I’d never even heard of the place, so I decided to drive there to look around before placing a bid on the apartment.
I was not expecting a huge metropolitan area.
It was at least the size of Philadelphia, if not larger, which was a little bit confusing considering I have never heard of it before today. I have never seen it mentioned on a map, and when you search it on google earth to find satellite pictures, nothing comes up, which is puzzling considering the size of the area. 

So, after visiting, I decided that it was pretty nice and I placed my bid.
A week later I got a phone call saying that I got the apartment! 

I was eager to move in, but the one thing that still bothered me was work. I was three years out of medical school, having completed my internship for general surgery and diagnosis at a hospital in my old city, I was now free to practice on my own. After doing some research, I found that the Cedarville General Hospital was looking for staff, and I decided to apply. 

Here’s when things started to get what-the-actual-fuck weird. 

The hospital, to start, is the only healthcare building in the entire city. No specialist offices, no private practices, no clinics. Just the hospital. 
Secondly, it is the dead center of the city. Like, the geographic center of the map. It’s not the largest building, but it’s definitely not the smallest. It’s a beautiful building, modern architecture and such, so it’s not too old, which makes me wonder how the fuck it was the dead center of the city. 
The hospital layout is divided into wings named after the cardinal directions— north, south, east, and west. Not that weird, right? Well, turns out none of the wings correspond to the actual directions that they’re placed in. The north wing is on the south side of the building, the west on the east, and vice versa. Probably the result of some poor old sap’s shitty planning, but who the fuck knows anymore? 

My interview was also quite— different. The hospital’s director just hired me. I didn’t have to give him my resume, I didn’t have to answer questions about myself, and quite possibly the weirdest part was that I never gave him a transcript of my job history and education, and somehow he had it. He had a copy of my degree and my medical license, despite me never giving him one. Freaky shit, but I was just relieved that I got the job. 
The kinds of questions he asked gave me the creeps too. I mentioned beforehand that he didn’t ask me things about myself. They were stuff like, “have you ever been in a government position,” or “if your spouse and your best friend were drowning, who would you save?” Basically, not normal job interview questions to say the least. 
This guy seemed normal, but I swear to god during our meeting, his eyes disappeared for a split second. 

During my first few weeks, I was also introduced to some—strange employee rituals. 

Firstly, at exactly 12:00 noon every day, a tone would play over the intercom and about half of the doctors and nurses would mindlessly walk to the fifth floor and scream. Just endlessly scream, for five minutes straight. This was called “scream time,” and it was voluntary. There were also some weird rules about “scream time.” 
1.) you must be on the fifth floor to participate.
If you’re not already, drop what you’re doing and go. No one cares if you’re in the middle of open heart surgery. Go. 
2.) if participating, you must scream for exactly five minutes. Any less, you’re fired. Any more, you’re fired. 
That’s it. I never participated in scream time, but some of my co-workers did. They never remember participating when asked about it. 

If you’re going to have coffee, you must finish it. Not too weird, probably just to cut down on waste. But the thing that makes me question it is that if they really wanted to cut down on waste, they’d have the same rule for the cafeteria. They didn’t. It was just for coffee. 

Another rule was that you had to carry a pen, and you only got one. Not two, not zero. It was a company supplied pen. You must have at least one pen on your person at all times, unless performing surgery. Kind of annoying and weird, but not really a problem for me. 

Other than those few what-the-fuck things, the rest of the employee code of conduct was normal, as it would be at any other medical facility. 

The floors and rooms occasionally change locations. The other day I was called to the north wing OR on the fourth floor. The elevator took me to the sixth floor, in the west wing. The room was there, labeled as being in the north wing on the fourth floor. The cafeteria changes it’s location from day to day. The ER is never in the same wing as it was the day before. No one can ever find the third floor’s east wing, despite it showing up on the maps and the custodian insisting that he just cleaned it. The bathrooms only show up when you need them, and then disappear after. I still don’t have an explanation for this. 

Some of the floors of Cedarville General also have their weird quirks. Floor 7 has three elevators instead of two like the rest. No one knows where the third one leads, and no one had ever tried using it. On floor 8, which no one uses, you can wander around in the dark while faint carnival music plays throughout the whole south wing, perpetually. No one knows where it comes from, or why it’s there. There is no electricity on floor 8. There are no lightbulbs on floor 8, only windows. Floor 6 changes color every day. One day the walls are blue, the next day they’re yellow. Floor 4 is missing. It looks like it’s there from the outside, but there’s no way to access it, which could explain why I was transported to the sixth floor when I tried to go there. Patients on floor 5 somehow end up lost. When you look for them, they appear directly behind you and ask what you’re looking for. 

The people that work here and get treated here are equally weird as well.

I once saw my co-worker tuck a rogue tentacle into his sleeve, and then look around to make sure no one saw. I saw. I know your secret, Mark. 

There are these three old ladies that come in together once every week for dialysis. I’ve never treated them myself, but I have taken their vitals before. 
They are identical triplets. Their charts say they were born in 1906, and how identical triplets as much as survived in 1906 is beyond me. Also, due to some insanely unlucky genetic anomaly, none of them have eyes. 
They do however have one prosthetic, that they pass around from day to day. Every time they come in, a different one has the eye. I’ve seen them arguing over it before. I don’t know why. 

Occasionally I’ll see a person who looks exactly like me at the end of one of the corridors. However I can only see them in my peripheral vision. If I turn to look, they disappear. 

We once had a patient come into the ER with appendicitis. We rush him into the OR for an emergency appendectomy, knock him out, the usual. All of a sudden, about 20 minutes in, he starts screaming. 
The brain activity monitors still showed that he was unconscious. The heart monitor showed us a resting heart beat. He was out. There was no explanation for why he was screaming, and it continued until we were finished. He woke up we and interrogated him about it, asking if he possibly felt anything. He said no. 

I had a little girl and her mother come in for routine vaccinations. She was sat on the table and her mom was in a chair in the corner. The door of the room was closed. I took her vitals and such, then I turned around to prepare the injections, and upon turning back around, the mother and the girl were gone. They disappeared into thin air. I whipped back around to look at the girl’s chart, and it too was gone. I checked the system for her name, and it said she doesn’t exist. She wasn’t dead, there was just no result.

Possibly the weirdest case yet was just the other day, we had a ten year old boy come in with a severely broken arm. When I say severe, I mean completely obliterated. He was probably going to have to have it amputated. It was flopping all over the place, with the bones pounded into sawdust. He had got it caught underneath a boulder while hiking and needed to be flown in. 
Anyway, we were just finishing up imaging of the arm and processing the gruesome x-rays, when I turn around and see the kid using his phone. Playing a game. With his broken arm, that had somehow miraculously healed itself. We asked him a few questions. He said he felt fine. We showed him the x-ray images and told him what was going on. He simply said, “that’s not my arm,” and went back to his game. Then he passed out. We took his vitals, and his heart rate was dropping quickly. After multiple resuscitation attempts, we declared him dead. 
I went to inform the parents, when I was stopped mid sentence by something tugging on my sleeve. It was the kid. The kid who I just pronounced dead, stood behind me asking, “what are we talking about? I’m right here!”

Aside from the occasional weird case, the rest are pretty normal. 

Now here’s the part that freaks me out the most. 
Yesterday I was paged to the ER. I went the normal way to get there, but I didn’t end up there. The damn place probably moved again for all I know, but usually I end up there anyway. Anyway, the area I was in was unfamiliar. You’d think after working here for a few weeks I’d have seen everything, but alas. I looked around, and found that the corridor I was in was labeled “Southwest wing.” 
This struck my interest, because I have reviewed all the maps and floor plans of this godforsaken place, and I’ve never seen a Southwest Wing mentioned. 
I was in an area of the hospital that didn’t exist. 

I wandered on for a while, exploring the newly found area, when my gut suddenly dropped with the worst feeling ever. I got the chills, and my spine tingled. I knew I shouldn’t be here. 

All of the rooms in the Southwest wing had heavy duty locks.
I decided to poke around. 
Walking further on, I passed a room that had the door open, and I peeked in, making sure I wouldn’t be noticed. What I saw was the most disturbing image I’ve ever seen.
It was a human, or what looked to be one, but it was just a torso with arms. Think arms for legs, and one for the head, on top of the existing set of arms. 
I gasped, and the thing noticed and scuttled towards the door.

I bolted down the hallway as I heard the door slam. 
I looked over my shoulder and I was relieved to be alone. 

As I wandered around trying to retrace my steps and find the way I came in, the hallways kept rearranging so I could never find the same place twice. As the corridors stretched onward, a foul smell started emanating from all around. It smelled like necrotic skin, but worse. I gagged, then fished around my pocket for the surgical mask I stuffed in there earlier and put it on in a feeble attempt to block out the smell. 

As I turned the corner, I saw double doors that opened into what looked to be a huge operating room. I saw three of what I assumed to be humans in hazmat suits wheeling a gurney into that room. 
One glanced in my direction, and I quickly ducked around the corner to avoid being seen.

I didn’t see what they had on that gurney, and I didn’t really want to, so I ran. 

I ran until I eventually ended up near the ER, where I was supposed to be a half hour ago. 

My co-worker, Mark, saw me out of breath.

“What happened to you?” He asked with a laugh. 

I couldn’t find any words. 

“Sorry I’m late.” I said. 

“What do you mean?” He looked puzzled. 

“I got lost.” 

He looked at me with a confused expression and pointed at the clock on the wall. It was still 1:30.
I could have sworn I was in the “Southwest wing” for at least 30 minutes. It should be 2:00.

I don’t know what the fuck is going on in Cedarville General.




Author’s Note: Due to request, I am going to continue to document my experiences while working at Cedarville General. Wish me luck!

She went to college in the same city I did and the conversation was very informal and all about interests outside of school, we talked about how my home town is a nicer city to be in for the long-term etc. She touched on my experience (one non-prestigious finance internship and a research asst. position for my school’s Econ department). Turns out she was also a researcher back in the day and she liked that about me and asked questions. I talked about the culture at her company being one of my main motivators for being there etc. We acknowledged my lack of experience doing actual (or at least meaningful) financial analysis but I showed her which certificate programs I’m doing this summer to complement my education (excel, accounting, financial modeling, etc) and she said she likes me being proactive about that gap in knowledge. She also liked that I was president of my school’s finance club for a year and she asked some questions about that.

TL;DR She told me she has a good feeling about me and looks forward to meeting me at the panel interview in about a week (the rest of her team will be there too).

I know this is where things get technical real fast and I’m currently re-reading the most recent version of Vault Guide to Finance Interviews and looking at videos on youtube but was wondering if someone in this community was willing to share experiences, tips, etc.

bukl9s,1,2019-05-29,Received an email from headhunting firm - what to do?,sccoutthrowawaa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bukl9s/received_an_email_from_headhunting_firm_what_to_do/,"The email is marked as confidential so I'm making a throwaway just to be sure.

&amp;#x200B;

My background - I'm an 18 year old high school senior from eastern Europe, and I've committed a lot of free time to teaching myself programming and CS on my own. The learning infrastructure in high schools here is seriously underdeveloped and I've only had Google to teach me how to do stuff starting from day 1. I'm graduating in not even a month and I've decided to study CS in my country. So, for a few years already I've been actively committing my works to GitHub publicly, with multiple 100+ commits projects and one that goes above 1k commits, in hopes it will be useful later.

Now, it seems a headhunting company has likely stumbled upon me as I've received an email talking about how they recruit top-notch developers for companies that need them. The email is worded as if I were some sort of professional coder with a college degree, and all the positions they offer at different companies require a few years of experience. I've checked their information in outside sources, including national registries, and they appear to be a perfectly legitimate company with the proper businesses registered. They don't seem to have much information on me at all, which makes it seem fishy.

I've got no idea about how business in CS works and what the chance of this being legit is or not, however I wasn't really gonna turn them down or ignore them outright, but rather write up a honest email shortly explaining who I am and what my level of experience is, and ask if they perhaps can offer some sort of internship or sponsorship for me as a part time thing during college or even this summer when I'll be completely free, but I'm not sure if that's a wise decision at all as a part of me still has trouble believing I've received something like this. I'm definitely not understating my programming abilities, but it seems all too early and sudden, like it came out of nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I thinking right here? What's the most appropriate course of action to pursue this further?"

   * I was (and still am) extremely concerned that nobody from my school is trying to officially address this, so I talked to administration and the school board, and I was able to found our school's first mental health week
   * We brought in psychiatrists to speak, made dress-up days for awareness, posted social media campaigns, and hosted daily activities at lunch
* **Bringing back Career Fair**
   * Also through class president, I am actively working on bringing back Career Fair, an event our school used to have a long time ago.
   * I am personally calling employers from around the city to visit our new career fair next year sometime in October
* **Youth Representative for Food Allergies at the Youth Advisory Council (YAC) at Nemours** (3 years)
   * I have food allergies to dairy, walnuts, pecans, and shellfish and environmental allergies to dust mites, cats, dogs, mold, and tree pollen.
   * I was chosen by my doctors and nurses to represent the 8th floor (allergy department) at Nemour's Youth Advisory Council
   * We work with Nemour's admin and head doctors on future plans and procedures for Nemours
* **Internship at my local city's Aviation Authority!**
   * I was accepted in an engineering internship at my local airport (JAX). It's definitely not a super large airport, but I am so excited and can't wait!!
   * I am super passionate about commercial aviation, and I was super happy to get a job inside the field!
* **Coupon Book Selling Business**
   * After my parents required me to pay 100% for a school trip to Washington DC, I raised all $1500 needed through selling coupon books to Winn-Dixie.
   * Realizing the profitability of these books, I purchased more and continued to sell them by walking door to door in my neighborhood. I made over $4000!
   * Sadly I don't do this anymore because the coupon book distributor stopped producing the book I sold :(
* **DCCPTA Student Leadership Academy**
   * I was one of three students selected at large from my school to represent by our principle
* **Self Studied AP Physics 1**
   * My school's scheduling didn't place me in AP Physics and my appeal wasn't approved, so my testing coordinator allowed me to self-study and take the AP Physics 1 exam instead
   * Because I did this, the scheduling team is placing me in Physics C next year
* **Mu Alpha Theta** (2 years)
   * I have competed in math competitions around the state such as MAO Regionals and AMC
* **Science Honor Society** (2 years)
   * At meetings, I got to listen to local speakers in STEM from my city which is awesome!
* **Homecoming Court Nomination**
   * I was one of the four nominations for hoco prince, but I didn't win lmao
* **Patient at Southern California Food Allergy Institute's TIP Program**
   * This isn't really a traditional EC, but its a huge part of my life that I feel like I have to mention somehow
   * After being accepted from a waitlist and receiving a grant, I now receive treatment for my food allergies in Long Beach, California at the Southern California Food Allergy Institute through the TIP Program. The end goal of these trips and appointments is that I will be cured of my allergies!!
   * [TIP](https://socalfoodallergy.org/our-program/) is pioneering allergy research and this type of treatment is still in its earliest stages (it's not FDA approved yet)
   * Because of my treatments, there's been a lot of ramifications. For example, my attendance senior year is going to drop significantly since I have to fly out to California every 6 weeks and they only schedule appointments during weekdays. I also can't afford other things like XC camp this summer now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be shocked if anyone's made it this far, but thank you so much if you have! Despite putting in a lot of effort over the years, I'm not sure how competitive I really am, so I don't know where to set the bar for myself. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"

My mind reeled at a horror I wish was unnameable, but it had one name I knew of.  I wish I could call it the Devil, Satan, Lucifer, or any number of other theological and mythical figures.  A known enemy would  have brought me the comfort that an omnipotent loving force opposed it  and would not let it engage in absolute genocide.  I wish I had these  things, but they were not there.  The Dark Man doesn't want the souls of  man.  He does not lord over a fiery pit punishing sinners and the wicked, there is no line dividing the sinners from the saved.  He wants death, all-encompassing with no room for salvation, no room for life either on this world or in the next.  Before him, all would perish.

&amp;#x200B;

The dream had fundamentally changed me.  My  internal walls of self-delusion lay tattered, strewn about my mental  landscape like the ruins of an ancient city that had succumbed to  siege.  I do not know how many days I spent locked in my home, all the lights turned on, every corner lit, every shadow extinguished.  I do not know how long it took for the shaking to stop, for the imminent sense of dread to abate.  Time had distorted, a mutable concept for which I had lost any point of reference to guide me.

My mind reeled at a horror I wish was unnamable, but it had one name I knew of.  I wish I could call it the Devil, Satan, Lucifer, or any number of other theological and mythical figures.  A known enemy would  have brought me the comfort that an omnipotent loving force opposed it  and would not let it engage in absolute genocide.  I wish I had these  things, but they were not there.  The Dark Man doesn't want the souls of  man.  He does not lord over a fiery pit punishing sinners and the wicked, there is no line dividing the sinners from the saved.  He wants death, all-encompassing with no room for salvation, no room for life either on this world or in the next.  Before him, all would perish.

I desperately wanted to warn the families of Burkowski's victims, however the means to do so  escaped me.  Do I call the police?  And tell them what?  A dream told  me that these people were in grave danger?  Do I tell the families the  same thing?  No one would believe me, not until the killing started.  At  that point all eyes would be turned on me, a distraction allowing murderers to act with impunity.  I was powerless.

At some point in my fear driven, insomnia induced paranoia I remembered the Dark Man's words, words which spoke of two kinds that might oppose him.  The Half-Breed and the Judged Ones.  It allowed me a momentary hope, the idea that there were those who might stand against him, that he is not the God he thinks he is.  Maybe the universe is not so bleak.

Over the  course of my temporary insanity I owned my transgressions.  While death  was on my mind, this was not the selfish act of a man trying to get  into Heaven and avert punishment.  It was simply acknowledging and taking responsibility for a lifetime as a sub-human, borderline sociopathic piece of shit.

I penned a letter to the parents of Tommy Harris, an apology which I recognize is utterly meaningless in the face of their loss.  I have not sent it.  I don't know if I ever will.  In  truth I don't know if such a letter might only serve to reawaken old  wounds and reverse whatever healing the Harris' might have been able to  gain.  Maybe one day, should I survive long enough, I will find the courage to send them that letter.  Until that time I will keep it on me.

The courage to brave the world beyond my front door eventually returned to me, and I left those safe walls with a single purpose.  Refusing to be outside longer than necessary, I walked into my law firm and handed in my resignation.  A good two minutes of looking at my office brought me to the realization that  there wasn't a damn thing I wanted to take with me.  Well, almost  nothing.  I grabbed a red stapler and walked out of the office for the  last time.  I could read the faces of the other partners, paralegals and  interns clearly.  They collectively  thought I had lost my mind.  A part of that sentiment is true, though  the part I had lost should never have existed in the first place.  No worthwhile human being should have that level of empathic disconnect nor talent for self-deception.

I'm sure my former coworkers will find their pursuit of wealth over the well-being  of others to be a lucrative one.  I just have to wonder if they will  think it was worth it when the bill comes due.  From my perspective, it  wasn't worth it at all.

\#

Seeking out my car in the underground parking structure, I allowed myself a sense of satisfaction and happiness.  I was free of the life that brought me into this nightmare. Fluorescent lighting did little to illuminate the carpark; the dull bluish light's only saving grace was allowing individuals to locate their vehicles.  BMWs, Rolls, Mercedes, Benz, the odd Porche and Ferrari spoke of the wealth contained in the floors above me.  Wealth garnered from the misery of victims, wealth obtained from the unjust attempting to avoid the consequences of their actions.

Approaching my car, the laughter  of a child stopped me in my tracks.  Adrenaline froze my legs and a  chill borne of cold sweat wracked my body.  Looking into the shadows between the two cars across from my parking space I saw him.  Wearing a dirt-covered little-man suit, patches of his blond hair and scalp missing, Tommy Harris stood staring at me.  This was no apparition.

""You shouldn't have said no.""  His voice was high, and his taunting cadence that of a tattle-tail snitching to a teacher.  He took an uneven step forward into the light, staccato movement as though walking was a new thing for him.  I  could see the embalming had been sub-standard.  It had only been a few  weeks, but black and purple spots of rot had formed on his head and  hands.  The skin was split on his cheek revealing blackened, tiny musculature.  He stunk of Formaldehyde and decay.  Lolling his little head back and forth, I could see the large black stitches used to re-attach the boy's head to his torso.  With each swing of his head, the stitches stretched and skin separated, accentuating the plane of dismemberment.  I felt sick, my stomach yearning to exorcise its contents.

I watched terror stricken as the boy coughed, a sick black ooze spewing forth from his decaying mouth.  His little body heaved and convulsed; dropping to his knees a horrifying, unidentifiable screech exploded from him.  I desperately wanted to run, to find a safe space to lock myself away in.  Instincts failing me, my legs refused to budge.  I could only watch as his lips withdrew over his nose, a grotesque fleshy tearing as acoustic accompaniment, revealing slick black beneath.  The sound of tearing flesh, breaking bones and an intermittent bronchial coughing heralded the erasure of Tommy Harris' corpse, and the emergence of something unnamed and wholly unnatural.  His little-man suit exploded under pressure, the girth of the bloated horror a stress too much for the delicate stitching.

What stood before me had a body resembling a cross between a toad and large dog.  Hairless, black and glistening with thick slime, each of its four double jointed legs terminated in three toed talons.  Protruding from its back, two large appendages reminiscent of chitin encased spider legs tipped with blades of what looked to be bone, hungrily twitched.  Its featureless, lipless head ended in a blunt snout lined with large sharp teeth.  One thing was clear, this abomination existed to kill and nothing else.

The incessant hits of adrenaline tunneled my vision, I was on the verge of unconsciousness.  As I stood frozen, the horror set before me dimmed to a black, fuzzy blur.  The blurred form lunged forward.  I felt the heavy impact on my chest, a sense of falling.  Focus returned when my back connected with the concrete ground.  All I saw was a gaping, tooth filled maw; black drool stained my shirt.  The sound of tearing flesh and crunching bone accompanied searing pain in my left shoulder.  I looked to see one of the creature's bone blades embedded between my shoulder and chest.  Through the pain I could feel a sideways pressure.  The nightmare toad was trying to rip my arm from my body. 

Through  the pain and fear I accepted my death.  Being torn limb from limb by  the remnants of Tommy Harris seemed oddly like poetic justice, and I was  tired of the nightmarish  reality Martin Burkowski had dragged me into.  The hell-spawn roared in  my face, black saliva and putrid breath exploding over me.  Opening its  dagger-lined jaws, it poised to strike.  A high-pitched scream stopped the death-dealer in its tracks.  My body lurched as it pulled the bony scythe from my shoulder.  It looked to the source of the sound, as did I.

What stood not twenty feet away was like an H.R. Giger painting come to life.  A biomechanical Grim Reaper, the figure's flesh covered in what appeared to be bone, pneumatic hosing and metal.  Its countenance that of a jawless skull, air hoses extending out from under the cheekbones, sweeping back over its shoulders.  A tattered grey cloak engulfed the right side of the Reaper with only a large scythe protruding; its shaft appeared to be a series of interlocked femurs, the blade blue-black iron.

I felt the Tommy Abomination's weight shift on my body, rear talons digging into my abdomen preparing to lunge.  The Reaper's movement was so swift my eyes could not track it.  In an instant the slime covered beast was on its back to my side, front legs severed.  The thing howled in pain, black goo oozed and spit from the stumps where its legs had been.  The  biomechanical Reaper stood above the abomination, pining it down with a  bone-armored foot.  Scythe raised for the killing blow, I heard a  woman's voice come from the Reaper's terrifying visage.

""Sleep now, Tommy,"" sorrow and compassion infused the voice, ""He'll use you no more.""  The curved blade struck hard, cleaving the slime-covered thing's head in two. 

The hellish creature dissolved in less than a second, leaving behind only a puddle of fetid black ichor.  Turning to me, the Reaper knelt down.  I could feel my life slipping away, blood cascading from the gaping hole between my shoulder and rib-cage.

""What--,"" pain and blood loss had robbed my voice of strength.  ""What are you?""  I watched, fearful as it brought one of its bone covered hands towards my wound.  A mouth-like orifice opened in its palm, squirming tendrils slithered from the opening reaching towards my injury.

""Well that's rude,"" her voice saturated with offense.  ""I'm a who, not a what.""  The skull visage split on the center axis, peeling back to reveal the face of a pretty, twenty-something woman.  Deep brown hair, brown eyes and a dark olive complexion, she regarded me with disdain.

""Fine.""  I coughed, the metallic taste of blood filled my mouth, ""Who are you?""  She brought her hand to my wound.  My body convulsed, wracked in agony as the probing tendrils entered the gaping hole, the sensation that of squirming worms writhing inside me.

""Who I am doesn't matter,"" she clipped, sneering.  ""Personally, I'd rather leave you here to bleed to death.""  She knew exactly who I was.  ""I'm not allowed to, even for a shitbag like you.""

""You should.""  I didn't hesitate.  I was done. I wanted no more of this weird hell.  ""Leave me to die, please.""  She seemed genuinely surprised at my request.

""Oh, you're not getting off that easy,"" she smirked.  In my hazy, shocked state I swore I heard an underlying note of sadism in her voice, ""Your penance has just begun.""

I cried out in pain as the Reaper's tendrils began executing their purpose.  Without the benefit of anesthesia I felt the worm-like appendage's every move as they grabbed onto my ragged flesh and began to repair the wound.  I had never known one could identify their own inner anatomy by prodding pain.  I felt ligaments reattached, veins and arteries sealed, muscle fibers stitched back together.  A body-wracking cough convulsed through me as the healing tendrils sealed a laceration to my lung. Between the pain and blood loss I felt both alert and woozy at the same time.

""If you won't tell me your name,"" words slurring, I meekly looked to my savior.  Curiosity overcame my pain and fatigue, ""Just tell me which one you are.""  She regarded me with astonishing  confusion.  Considering the situation, I figured the context would have  been clear.  A wave of pain overtook me as the repair tentacles  withdrew from my wound.  I was no longer bleeding out, though a gaping  hole did remain.  ""You are one of the Judged Ones, aren't you?""

I could not tell if the inscrutable expression the Grey Reaper regarded me with was one of surprise or disgust.  In my self-imprisonment I had scoured the internet, trying to find any information on the Judged Ones and Half-Breeds.   Expectedly, just searching ""Judged Ones"" returned mostly religious  sites and weird cults, conversely searching ""Half-Breed"" returned  so many science fiction and genetic testing sites the search term was  rendered useless.  When I searched ""Dark Man"" with ""Judged Ones"",  however, I got a worthwhile hit.  One that I had written off due to its  impossible nature and that it was on a conspiracy website.  Reports of  inhuman creatures saving the lives of people who had been targeted by the Dark Man like me, fantastical transformations and traumatic horrors.  It all sounded like something out of a comic book.  As it turns out, even conspiracy theorists can get it right sometimes.

""Forget you ever heard  that name,"" she demanded.  Taking to her feet, the rest of the Judged  One's biomechanical armor seemed to be absorbed by a normal human body.   What was revealed to me was a woman dressed in the trappings one would expect an FBI Agent to don.  Looking around, clearly assessing the current surroundings, she pulled an earpiece from her lapel, fitted it into her ear.  ""Handler,"" her voice held the authority of the government agent she looked like, ""Non-combatants are four-o-four, send an ambulance.  Target is alive and stable, but there's no way in hell I'm gonna put the bastard back together.""  Her words came with rapid-fire sneers launched in my direction.

I wanted to say something, thank her, beg for her forgiveness.  I felt cold, fearful, and slipping towards unconsciousness.  My fear was not borne of the possibility of death, I had whole-heartedly accepted death, welcoming the cold embrace that would end my suffering.  My fear was of an unknown future.  I heard her voice as my vision darkened.

""I worked at the County Coroner's office the day Burkowski's victims arrived,"" her voice was ethereal to me, like a distant dream.  ""We were tasked with putting the bodies of thirty-nine  children back together.  I walked into the examination room to see the  rotting head of a five-year-old girl staring at me.  I quit on the spot.""  My mind entrenched in the haze of fading consciousness, I had a hard time understanding her words, ""By the time I left the building I had become what I am now.""

As the last of my consciousness faded into the welcoming darkness, I heard her one last time.

""Forget about us, forget about the Dark Man.  Tell no one about this.  Use your talents to help those deserving, and one day you may find absolution.""

Absolution is a wonderful fairytale.  The problem is, for the people whose actions have garnered egregious consequences those who can provide the forgiveness required are all too often beyond our reach.  The dead cannot forgive the living.

\#

I woke in a hospital bed to the incessant, annoying beeps of a heart monitor.  The gaping hole in my shoulder had been stitched up, painkillers granting me the euphoria of floating on a cloud.  Even in my opioid-altered  state, the Judged One's last words rang in my ears.  I borrowed an iPad  to do some web surfing and found her.  The woman who saved my life held  a life of tragedy,  a life littered with the corpses of her own family violently ripped  from this world.  It's no wonder she had wound up a Coroner, or that she  had found her limit in Burkowski's wake.  I cannot in good conscious  reveal her identity, she suffers enough without the public seeking her out.  Having found one answer, I returned the tablet and waited to be discharged.

It was dark when the Lyft driver delivered me to my home.  Winding my way from the wood paneled lobby to the front door of my condo, my mind was a blank.  Try as I might, thoughts would not coalesce.  The start of each train of thought disappeared into oblivion, leaving no trace of its passing.  Walking into my home I stood in place for a moment, noticing for the first time how barren and cold it was.  Glass, wood and metal furniture,  framed articles from trade magazines that had featured me and some  sparse childhood photographs.  Nothing really personal, no pictures of  friends or family, no items of interests or hobbies.  I found myself feeling like a stranger in my own home.  I was vacant, numb.  The only real feeling came from the occasional twinge of pain when I moved, jostling my left arm that was nestled in a sling.

Moving from the small hallway marking the entrance  to my home I noticed the dining room light was on.  A spike of  adrenaline hit me, followed by a sharp twinge of pain from my injury.   The stitched-up hole didn't like the increase in blood pressure.  I tried to move quietly, failed miserably as my own considerable weight caused the floorboards to creek under pressure.  Slowly I made my way towards the light.

""Good, you're home,"" a cheerful mid-tone female voice called to me from the dining room.   ""I have a proposition for you.""  I rounded the corner to see a young  woman, not more than twenty-years-old, seated cross-legged on my steel dining room table eating a sandwich.  She held her hand up as she chewed, gulped, ""I hope you don't mind I raided your fridge.  You want one?""

I stood there slack-jawed and speechless.  The young woman was pale, her jet-black hair swept from high cut at the back down to sharp points just below her jawline with purple Betty Page bangs.   Thick eyeliner, black lipstick and a swirling, claw-like pattern  extending below her left eye reminded me that I hadn't actually seen a  Goth in person since High School.  Black corset, black knee-high skirt and knee-high buckle down combat boots completed her visage.  Taking her in, it would have been easy to miss it; bright emerald green, her eyes almost stopped my heart.  A kind, benevolent gaze, curious and searching like that of a cat.  Like a cat, her pupils were vertical.  Had I not seen the expansion and contraction of the quizzical light-detectors as she looked me up and down, I would have thought she was wearing theatrical contact lenses.

""You're  healing up nicely,"" she nodded as if answering a question in her own  mind, smiling comfortingly at me.  All my fear, all my anxiety and  trepidation seemed to vanish in this girl's presence.

""They--,"" I stuttered, an unfamiliar feeling of intimacy permeating the room, ""They said it'll take a couple weeks before I can use my arm again.""  She let out a little chuckle.

""That's not what I'm talking about.""  She was amused by my ignorance.   A blink of her eyelids and her pupils were the expected round shape of a  normal human being.  She finished off her sandwich, smirked and leapt off the table to stand before me, her grace that of an angel.

""Who--""

""Who am I?""  She leaned forward, winked at me, ""Call me Raven.""

""Seems a little stereotypical,"" the words escaped before my mental filter could stop them.  She let out an explosive laugh.

""Yeah, I suppose it is.  A friend gave me the name long ago,"" Raven's tone seemed somber, the tone of someone wistfully recalling a lost loved one.

""What are you?""

""Well that's rude,"" indignance washed over her face.  I remembered the Judged One had responded the same.

""I'm—I'm sorry.""

""No worries,""  her upbeat manner led me to believe her indignance was feigned for her  own amusement.  She clearly wasn't one of the Judged Ones, which only  left one option.

""You're one of the Half-Breed.""  She gagged at the name, sneered and looked to be truly insulted this time.

""Never use that term again,"" I felt her demand came with a lethal penalty for violation.  ""Only that Dark fucker calls us that.""

""I didn't know--"" Raven poked me in the chest, an odd smile of expectation crossing her beatific face.

""Come fight with me.""

""What?""  I was dumbfounded.  I can't walk up a single flight of stairs without getting winded, fighting was not in my repertoire.

""Well, not so much fight,"" she took a step back, tilting her head.  ""You see, you're actually a rare kind of person.  You've literally  pulled yourself back from the brink of oblivion and in spite of having  been a selfish, inhuman prick you managed to deny him.""  I only  understood the part referencing the Dark Man.

""Okay,"" I felt hesitant.  Once again, I felt the urge to run away and hide in a closet until the world came to an end.  It was curiosity that kept me in place this time.  ""The Judged One I spoke to said I should just forget--"" Raven sneered at the mention; apparently the Judged Ones and whatever Raven is are not on good terms.

""Those half-ass twits don't know what they're doing,"" I could feel the disdain in her voice.  ""They shouldn't exist.""

""I don't understand.""

""Then  come with me.  Your talents, both that force of personality you've got  locked up in that head of yours and your legal expertise can be put to good use.""  Raven began walking towards the door.  My mind reeled.  If  I stayed I could start my own firm, one to help victims, one to bring a  positive change into the world.  If I went with this paranormal uber-goth, on the other hand...

""I don't know,"" I wore my indecisiveness on my sleeve, ""I could do a lot of good--""

""Do you think he'll stop?""  Her voice was hard, battle worn.  It was clear I was not the first she had this conversation with.  Raven turned to me, her face no longer that comforting countenance.  She was showing me what lay beneath her mask of upbeat congeniality, a warrior.  ""One attempt on your life and you think it's over?""

""Well, I hadn't thought it--""

""Through?  No, you haven't.  You're marked, William.  He will not stop until you are dead.  We can protect you, and we could use your help in turn.  We can give you something no one else can.""

""What is that?""  I could feel anxiety strangling my heart, trapped.  If I stay, my time on this Earth is borrowed.  One day, a week, maybe a month before I'm staring into another toothy grin promising death.  If I go there's no guarantee that I could be protected at all times; my chances to survive long enough to do something of worth, on the other hand, goes up exponentially.

""With us, you can atone.""  She knew what I wanted.  She knew what I needed.  Turning back towards the door, her final words to me still ring in my ears.   ""There will be no absolution for you or anyone else, but you can work  towards forgiving yourself.  That is the best any of us can hope for.""

""Wait, I need to know--""

""You have 'till dawn to make your decision."" Raven stood at the door, ""Come with me and everything you want to know will be revealed.  And don't worry about the families of Burkowski's victims, we've got them covered.""  Smiling she turned and, like some ghostly apparition, walked through the closed door.

I stood silently staring at the door, paralyzed by questions, by the sheer magnitude of my own ignorance.  In the end, move forward or die was the real choice laid before me.

\#

I have not been able to sleep and my time has run short.  Out the window I can see the burgeoning dawn, the deep blue black of the western sky transitioning into the Sun's heralding violet in the east.  My choice is made.  

There is nothing I own that I will take with me, no mementos of a life that should never have been.  Who I was should not have existed.  I will move into a future where I might be able to help those who need it; a future where I might slow  the whirlwind of death that is poised to strike at this world.  I don't  fully understand what is happening, I have yet to know the complete  truth, but I do know that someone must stand between life and death.  If  I can be a part of that, I need to be.  Not only for my own  selfish need to atone, I need to stop the Burkowski's of the future.   To stop the army of killers the Dark Man seeks to create.  I don't know  how I will do any of this, or if it's even possible, I do know I will not be alone.  There are others out there, possessed  of incredible power and fortitude.  I can face the horror with them.   My life of solitude, my life of selfish indulgence is over.

I may not survive the course of penance I have chosen to walk.  If I don't I only hope I was able to do some good.  I hope I will come close to balancing the scales.

There are no friends or family that will come looking for me, and I have burned the professional  contacts I had.  If you're reading this, it is likely that you and I  have never met.  I have one last selfish request to make of you.  Send  this document out to the masses; News Organizations, Magazines, Blogs.  There is a war going on right under all our noses.  It  is only a matter of time before this war spills out of the shadows and  every man, woman and child becomes a soldier.  The people need to be  warned.  The people need to be ready.

Whoever you are, send no one to look for me.

bun2u5,4,2019-05-29,Internship Confusion,caneton_blue,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/bun2u5/internship_confusion/,"Hello, so I recently applied to an internship and I got the position I wanted. I start on the 9th of June.

As the date is approaching, I saw a position for an internship at a different company being offered and I applied.

I have not heard from this new one, but I'm nervous that they will contact me late and I won't be able to interview or take the offer. 

I don't know what to do, I don't how to tell the other company that I'm looking at somewhere else. I'm super scared of disappointing anyone and myself.

I also can't do both because I need a summer job. 

Any ideas or suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"
buntp0,0,2019-05-29,Thoughts on Le Wagon Coding Boot Camp? Advice for self taught programmer?,rippedstallion,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/buntp0/thoughts_on_le_wagon_coding_boot_camp_advice_for/,"I'm currently at a crossroads where i have to make the right move, i have a choice between using my knowledge from books and the Udemy course i just finished (Zero to Mastery) which teaches html, css, javascript/ecmascript, Git, React &amp; node.js. I feel it explains and teaches these very well and his students have gone on to work in places as high as Google &amp; Amazon but now i'm finishing my final project (React/node.js Facial Recognition App) i don't feel very confident as a developer. I'v made some pretty nice sites, some css animations &amp; 2 React apps but i just don't feel i'm good enough yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have the option to pay £6.5k + train fares and attend Le Wagon which is a very highly rated boot camp and has some impressive looking demos of what their students made online but they teach html, css, javascript &amp; Ruby on Rails which i'm told by all sides is outdated and has no jobs which looking around London i see is true, they also don't post their employment rates or have job guarantees like FlatIronSchool who charge much more, teach the same languages but their students projects posted don't look particularly good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking around now there aren't many jobs in London that aren't asking for 3+ years experience along with languages i don't know and was told we're outdated like PHP &amp; Angular so i'm a bit frustrated i'v spent so much time on this and seem to hit a dead end, i really need to make the right move or i'm in a bad position. My choices are Boot camp or try internships and see what i can learn while i study more course like the follow up of Junior to Senior &amp; advanced JavaScript but i'm making a big career change from IT (systems engineer lvl.2) and i'm now feeling a bit of panic that it won't work out looking at my options and the job market. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm naturally more of a creative brain and i strive in writing, ideas, creating &amp; problem solving but i'd say i'm weaker towards Maths which might sound stupid but generally my brain doesn't remember every Maths equation/formula which i'd imagine is a problem for coding but i'v found it's much easier to remember especially on repetition especially since it's a bit of a hybrid with language/syntax and specialized knowledge in the form of tags, elements, attributes, so i'm a bit scared at the moment i might not be cut out for software development with it being a highly mathematical/logical pathway... I know it sounds like rambling but any help, insight or advice on this would be very appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr - I'm deciding whether or not it's the right move to go to boot camp and get professional training or to continue self study."
buo7ft,1,2019-05-29,I’m at a point where I can’t wait for one of two things to happen: either my mom dies or I die. And I feel like a complete asshole.,ikkyx,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/buo7ft/im_at_a_point_where_i_cant_wait_for_one_of_two/,"Hey guys, 
So I just graduated college, but I’m going back to school for one more year (for a variety of reasons: need more time away from home, some shit that happened with a frat that honestly has made me do some soul searching and realized I’m not ready for the ‘real world’- maybe this is just an excuse I made so I don’t have to graduate just yet, having more freedom, exploring a field that I’ve always been interested in but never got into it cause people convinced me it doesn’t make money. All in all, selfish reasons.) At school I’m pretty happy, I decide what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.  No one breathing down my back, no one shouting at me, no one making me feel like I’m in a jail. At home, however, everything’s different. I live with my mom, sister and grandma. I have another sister but she moved out. I hate the sister that lives with my mom, but she’s bearable. 
On the other hand, however, I hate my mom and grandma. Now don’t get me wrong, I love my mom. My dads never been a real part of my life so she’s had to sacrifice a lot, and I know that. But at the same time all that sacrificing has made her into a bitter, close minded person. The only the that matters to her is money- and rightfully so, that’s the only the she could’ve relied on for the past thirty years, but sometimes she takes it overboard. She once got mad at me for tipping the pizza guy $1. She doesn’t understand the world is changing and refuses to believe the fact that she can be in the wrong sometimes. I know I’m talking shit about my mom, but I honesty feel like the things I’ve written on here is an understatement. My grandma is sweet sometimes, but you can tell she’s obviously biased and is preferential towards my uncle. 

So now that I’ve described the environment at home, I’ll tell you guys how I feel. When I’m at home, I feel like a shell of myself. I feel unhappy, trapped, and hopeless to put it into a few words. I try my best to please my mom so she doesn’t have one of her episodic outbursts, but I feel it’s never enough. She actually just had one of those outbursts, shouting at my grandma and I for the most trivial thing that just spiraled out of control. She screamed at the top of her lungs at us and even threw a butcher knife at the table. 
To be fair, I’ve been an absolute slob the last two years (aside from an unpaid internship, my last part time job was during my sophomore year of college). I get that she’s worried about me and concerned that I might turn out like my dad, but just because she doesn’t see me applying for jobs every minute doesn’t mean I just sit on my ass and do nothing. I’ve been applying for stuff and I do feel like shit myself when I do nothing at home- she just doesn’t see this. Some of you may say a resolution would be to sit down and talk at her, but whenever I do talk to her about things she doesn’t agree with, she responds with “okay whoever” “‘I don’t care” “mhmm yeah I’m always wrong”. It’s come to a point where I can’t talk to her about the simplest things if she’s in the wrong. 

I’m currently dating a girl I met in school, and she makes me happy. She makes me forget all the bullshit in my life. I told my mom about her because I like to let my mom know about what’s going on in my life. My mom’s first response was “I don’t like her break up with her”. Constantly talking down on my girlfriend “she’s fat” “she’s not a good student” etc. The reason my mom doesn’t like her is because I’m from an Asian household and my girlfriend is Colombian- my mom doesn’t want me to date anyone with a “darker skin color” than me. She doesn’t even like the fact that I’m friends with people of color. 

I used to think my mom was so uptight and hard to deal with because she was juggling work and taking care of the three of us. I used to think she wanted the best for us. Im starting to think she’s only concerned with the fact that her kids do exactly what she wants. 

Now this brings me to the dilemma I’m currently facing. The future currently consists of this:
1 more year at university away from home 
5 years of living at home in the city 

The reason for five years is because I made a deal with my mom that I’d live with her for five years if she got me a car. At the time I thought it was a good idea- I can save some money and take care of her while I live at home. As more time passes though, I’m starting to regret that deal. I dread the day when I have to live at home permanently. I can barely take three months of living here during school breaks, how can I take five years? Should I move out after I finish school? Should I be selfish and try to live my life? If I do that, I can’t even begin to imagine how mad my mom will get at me. At the end of the day, even if she’s hard to deal with, she is still my mom and I still do love her. But I genuinely do not know what to do. I pretty much have no savings and am financially dependent on her. Can I even move out? 

What do you guys think I should do? Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

Tldr: family at home makes me a depressed and different person, but I have obligations and a duty as a son to live with my mom after graduation. Should I move out?"
buofny,1,2019-05-29,So I ended up quitting my job today,acidglitter,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/buofny/so_i_ended_up_quitting_my_job_today/,"So I wanted to get some opinions on my situation. Basically I’ve been working as a graphic design intern at a franchise t-shirt shop, I recently converted to full time after I graduated with my BS a few weeks ago. I have a lot of anxiety and this job has caused a lot of that in the past 4 months. I went from $10 an hr to a little over $11 (22,800K/yr). Personally I think I’ve been a good employee, I’ve opened the store countless times for the owner of the store (my boss) because he’s constantly late. I ended up getting a job offer yesterday that pays 35,000K a year with benefits, paid leave, etc. Unfortunately they need me to start on Monday or they’ll have to look for a new candidate and I really need the money and benefits so I couldn’t refuse. This morning after my boss had me open, he ended up being 20+ min late and said it was cause he was listening to the radio. I ended up letting him know about the job opportunity and that I couldn’t refuse but that I’d finish off the rest of the days that I was scheduled for this week. He seemed pretty shocked about it and I let him know that I understood it was unprofessional and that I just really couldn’t refuse the offer. He was pretty upset about me not doing a 2 weeks notice but after he calmed down a bit he asked if I knew anyone that could replace me. I told him about my sister whose been thinking about getting an internship and is studying the same thing as me. He also decided that I needed to work more then 40 hrs that week because I was resigning. He started asking me a bunch of questions and basically sarcastically asked if she was as responsible as I was or if she would end up pregnant or something. I was pretty shocked by that and said that she wouldn’t end up pregnant and then he asked if I was pregnant and then started laughing about it. I really didn’t have anything to say after that I’m not the type to talk back or anything so I just let it be and wanted to see how the rest of the day would play out. Mind you he’s always making jokes like this, and has even made me cry before because I was asking him for help with something while he was training my coworker. He has apologized afterwards but he’s always continued to do it. He’s told us about private information about other coworkers and is always gossiping about the franchise, other stores, etc. The rest of the day basically consisted of him making comments about me leaving them in front of all my coworkers and even in front of the customer. The first few times I tried not to let it get to me but after a while I was really starting to feel uncomfortable and came to the decision that I didn’t want to finish out the rest of the week for my own sanity. I ended up texting him and apologized but that I couldn’t keep working in that environment, that I’m sorry for putting everyone in a stressful situation, and I would drop off my keys and uniforms at the store in the morning. He ended up calling me and leaving me a voicemail apologizing for humiliating me and making me feel uncomfortable but that he needed to talk to me about tomorrow morning. I haven’t called him back and I really don’t want to. What do you all think about the situation?"

I've taken 2 gap years and I'm going to apply for Fall 2020. I should mention that I will be needing almost full financial aid/scholarship and I wish to study Computer Science/Engineering. This is my profile:

Academic:

1. SAT 1: 1500 (projected)
2. SAT 2: Math II - 800, Physics - 780 (Already taken)
3. TOEFL: 110+ (projected)
4. GPA: We have a really different  system in our country, it’d be tedious to explain the whole process here. I got 5.00 out of 5.00 GPA(average of 89/100) but it's calculated differently than it is in the USA.

ECA:

1. Started an online clothing business based on Facebook, with my sister. It’s going strong with 6 employees and we plan to establish a physical shop soon.
2. Worked full-time post-grad at a Group of Industries in the position of Lead Software Manager.
3. Interned at an IT company in the position of Web Developer during high school.

These two internships will speak for my gap years.

1. Worked alongside a University Professor of Genetic Engineering, developed a software related to his research. (Got a rec. letter from him)
2. Founded Computer Club and English Speaking Club in High School
3. Patrol Leader in High School Scouts
4. Student Counselor in High School
5. Every year, I along with a few of my friends organize underprivileged/poor kids to teach them about computers and smartphones.
6. Every winter, I along with a few of my friends distribute warm cloths, blankets to homeless people. Additionally, a couple minor ECAs.

I know I have poor ECs and this is mostly because of the education system in our country, we don't get to do much outside studying during our school years. This sounds like an excuse, but it really isn't. My counselor will mention this in his letter.

Recommendation Letters:

1. From my counselor who is also my Chemistry teacher
2. From my ICT teacher
3. From my English teacher 

I am expecting some excellent letters, I have a very good relationship with  them and they like me very much.

Essays:

1. About the business I mentioned earlier
2. About a unique scouts camp that I attended in my junior year, an embarassing incident of bullying and sexual harassment occurred and I took a leading role in standing against it and came to some realization about justice and fairness in the world. (Sounds cheesy and cliche, I know, but I couldn't find a better way to describe it here)  

As you can see, I have a so so profile and my requirement of financial aid puts me in a disadvantageous position. I had my eyes on the Ivy League universities as they are usually need-blind but I don't think I have any chance at those with this profile.

My peers also advised me to look out for LACs as they usually give out aids to international students.

  

I welcome any suggestion I receive from you and I'd really appreciate if you're fully honest, don't worry about discouraging or offending me. :)"

If I will work in the field of data science, I most likely will not be able to get adequate work in the field of chemical engineering (if I will want to return to the chemical engineering field). This is a tough choice. I’m not so much chasing after money as constant work and a good balance between work and personal life.

As I know trends are rapidly changing in IT. Who knows maybe within 5 or 10 years data science career will cease to exist and machine learning trend will disappear.  I can't say the same about chemical engineering (it looks more constant). 

After an internship in chemical engineering, I realized that I didn't like working at a factory. Also I don't want to live in remote areas. I have noticed that there are not so many jobs for chemical engineers. Are there jobs for chemical engineers in the office? What do they do?

I like machine learning and data analysis, but I'm afraid of missing life in the technology race.

6. Every winter, I along with a few of my friends distribute warm cloths, blankets to homeless people. Additionally, a couple minor ECAs.

I know I have poor ECs and this is mostly because of the education system in our country, we don't get to do much outside studying during our school years. This sounds like an excuse, but it really isn't. My counselor will mention this in his letter.

Recommendation Letters:

1. From my counselor who is also my Chemistry teacher
2. From my ICT teacher
3. From my English teacher 

I am expecting some excellent letters, I have a very good relationship with  them and they like me very much.

Essays:

1. About the business I mentioned earlier
2. About a unique scouts camp that I attended in my junior year, an embarassing incident of bullying and sexual harassment occurred and I took a leading role in standing against it and came to some realization about justice and fairness in the world. (Sounds cheesy and cliche, I know, but I couldn't find a better way to describe it here)  

As you can see, I have a so so profile and my requirement of financial aid puts me in a disadvantageous position. I had my eyes on the Ivy League universities as they are usually need-blind but I don't think I have any chance at those with this profile.

My peers also advised me to look out for LACs as they usually give out aids to international students.

  

I welcome any suggestion I receive from you and I'd really appreciate if you're fully honest, don't worry about discouraging or offending me. :)"

busoq1,0,2019-05-30,Can I create a macro/program that navigates a webpage and downloads a spreadsheet?,sirbrachthepale,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/busoq1/can_i_create_a_macroprogram_that_navigates_a/,"Hey everyone,

At my internship I have a handful of tasks, one of which is to prepare a spreadsheet in a particular format by adapting one I pull from a company portal site.

Normally I have to click on the type of query I want, type a range of dates and which project I’m accessing, and hit enter. At this point, a customizable spreadsheet appears with rows and columns depending on what pieces of information you’re interested in. You can drag and drop rows and columns on and off the spreadsheet. Normally I drag four query rows off and then add two rows. Then I would click the “export to excel 2000” button and make sure to save as an excel file rather than a webpage.

I have to do this multiple times a month, and it takes a while because the site is slow. It’d be real convenient for myself (and would probably make me beloved by company managers everywhere in the company who are forced to use this obnoxious system) if I could automate this process. I’m not a CS whiz, so Please bear with me. My questions are as follows:

-This is a company site. Would trying to access data in an automated fashion make it look like someone was trying to steal proprietary data?

-This May be a sort of application/website combo. It seems to be run through a different application than explorer- some company portal that I had to get special permission to access. Does that make this harder?

-Is there some way to program the location of my data entry and geography of my mouse clicks/drags/drops such that a program/macro navigates the webpage as I would in person, or will need a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of the site to do this?


Thanks so much for your advice in advance!"
buu0ab,3,2019-05-30,IBM or Startup?,StrawberryMarmalade,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/buu0ab/ibm_or_startup/,"Hey all, I was fortunate enough to get internship offers at both an IBM and a startup. I need to come to a decision soon, and I was wondering if you guys had any input on which one you would choose.

&amp;#x200B;

The IBM internship is for 2 months, and the startup one is for 6. The startup pays more. The startup is also at an earlier stage (seed/maybe series A funding?). I would be doing React at both, but the startup has &lt;10 employees.

&amp;#x200B;

For IBM, I would be in the Watson/Cloud department.

I'm not sure which one would lead to more personal growth. On one hand, there's an exciting startup opportunity close to home, on the other, I may get more mentoring at IBM and tackle real world problems at scale. While I do worry that 2 months may be too short, I also worry that having a nameless company on my resume for 6 months would really make it stand out to recruiters.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, would you delay your graduation a few months for an internship at a startup such as this? Or would you rather wait for an offer from a better company (unicorn, big4, etc,.)"

I only applied to one job during the academic year(as a study break) not thinking much about it. I ended up getting the interview and got the job which pays pretty impressively. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the problem: 

&amp;#x200B;

This is an 8 month IT internship, and it is boring as hell. I am not challenged mentally at all. I am not learning anything at all. And someday I am not doing anything at all. My tasks are super basic such as imaging a new laptop or even just setting up a computer for a new hire(plugging in wires). I took the job because it is at a very reputable company here in Canada and they are paying me $4600/month. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did register in an online course and am actively working on it on the days I have nothing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just worried that by having an IT position on my resume if I kind of set myself myself back in getting a development/management position coming out side of graduation, as this is my main goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly moving forward what everyone recommend? Suck it up and complete the work term? Or...

I'm looking for advice and recommendations on how to go about learning the basics (and possibly more) of the design of mechanical HVAC systems.

I worked for 2 years at an Arch/Engineering firm as an intern and learned a ton! But as an intern, I did little to no actual design work.  I did a lot more BIM work in CAD/Revit.

Since then, for just over the last year, I've been working as an MEP estimator for a construction management company.  Again, I've learned a ton! Not just about the construction process and value analysis, but also about both the mechanical and electrical systems through handling a ton of different projects.  

I'm now a year away from getting my PE license and I've been thinking about trying to get into design.  My concern is that, looking for design work as a PE, I'm afraid I'm almost misleading potential employers since, in reality, I've done little to no design work.  And also I just want to be of some use immediately after being hired.  So what are some ways I can go about learning design?"

I am a recently-graduated high school student who is currently taking comm. college classes on Linux and am planning to earn my AAS in cybersecurity before transferring to university to get my Bachelors. I have limited experience with cybersecurity and am planning to re-take my first certification exam, the Security+ exam, as I failed it the first time through. I do a lot of self-learning but am currently debating between pursuing my Security+ certification again or instead going for my CCENT, followed by my CCNA and then re-taking my Security+ exam.

&amp;#x200B;

I love learning on my own and I want to gain as much knowledge about various topics in this field as possible. That being said, here are my questions:

1. What would be the best progression of certifications, given my background and failed attempts at the Security+? Do I have the right idea in terms of certifications to get? I've been told that the CCENT is the best to go for in terms of starter certs but I'd really like some other input before I commit to studying.
2. I'm currently looking towards breaking into the field maybe in a help-desk role and then going for a Sec. Analyst position at some point (after schooling, of course). Is there any material I could use to self-learn in order to gain a grasp on I.T. fundamentals and perhaps what I would be looking at doing in a help-desk role?
3. Would any of you recommend internships? I'm currently taking community college courses and working part-time, but maybe getting some actual hands-on experience could help. On that note, are there any security blogs/social media accounts I could follow to really start to understand how exactly to break into this field?  


I know there were a lot of questions here, but I figured I'd pose them because with 270 people interested in cybersecurity, at least one of them is bound to have some of the answers to the questions I have.

So I’ve taken several college courses in C++ already and I want to start doing my own independent projects (aside from the CS lab programs assigned by college professors) so I have something to show to future interviewers when I try and go for an internship. I’ve always wanted to work for a game company (like Riot Games, Blizzard, etc) as a game developer or software engineer. Note that the only C++ projects I’ve done so far are the ones assigned by the professor in class, we’ve only ever had to code programs where we are manipulating data in some way using algorithms and data structures, then displaying things using the console. So I’ve never had experience with actually making a “visual” program using a window that didn’t involve printing to console. I’ve dabbled in 3D modeling using Blender, have some pretty decent experience in working in C++, and want to get some projects under my belt.

So my question for y’all is, what are some projects I can make that would be impressive to show off in a portfolio? I’ve heard of using Unreal Engine 4, SFML, OpenGL, which one of these should I focus on using? Should I be using either? Pros and cons? Is learning either of them more transferable of a skill than the other? What are some projects that would be best for me to do given what I’ve said about my interests and background? Any additional recommended resources?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Unknown to me, I was brought on to a non-software team to do some software work for them. Essentially, they are treating me more like a contractor than an intern, and this means that on my team I have the most software experience, and therefore none of the guidence an internship usually implies. They have me assigned to a migration project, ~10000 lines of code that needs to be made functional (it was converted from another language using an automated tool, so it needs major refactoring), and it has me pretty concerned. I consider myself a very competent programmer and an independent worker, but working with what is not only legacy code, but code that was written by software is somewhat of a worst case scenario. Some (~20%) of the code was also not fully translated, and is in an old language that I have never heard of before. The project has no documentation to look through, and my boss seems unfamiliar with the software. Since this is my first internship, I'm not sure how I should feel or how common this kind of thing is. I do think that with some self-training I should be able to tackle it, but it is a daunting task and it does feel like I'm being unfairly setup to fail. Since my bosses are not programmers, I think they underestimate the complexity of the task, as to my knowledge these kind of things are usually given to a team of experienced developers, not a summer intern. I'm not sure what I should do, although I do think it's probably a good idea to get in touch with some SWEs within the company, I'm looking for any guidance at all on how to deal with this."

buy4lh,1,2019-05-30,Am I making a mistake skipping out on an internship for entry-level food service?,jadenthesatanist,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/buy4lh/am_i_making_a_mistake_skipping_out_on_an/,"I’m not sure how I want to format this post, so I’m just gonna roll with it as I go. TL;DR at the bottom, this is gonna be a bit long. 

To start, about two months ago there was a job fair at my university offering various internships and employment opportunities. To skip the details, basically all of the employers told me that they aren’t giving out internships to non-graduating seniors (I’m finishing my junior year), which was already pretty stupid considering the fair was open to all sophomores and upperclassmen. 

I heard back from three employers, two of which were pyramid schemes (paging r/antiMLM), so I obviously didn’t take those. The last internship was a door-to-door summer sales gig paying $14/hour plus bonuses. I accepted the offer for this internship, went through the process of the background check and drug test, the whole shebang. 

After the drug test, I heard nothing. The company sent out numerous emails throughout the initial employment process, but never updated me with a rough schedule or even an email officially welcoming me aboard. As such, I messaged my potential new boss about a week ago and asked if there was a rough schedule yet detailing my starting date(s). I was provided information regarding next Monday and Tuesday and nothing else. Turns out, the Tuesday shift is in a suburb roughly 40 minutes by car from where I live, which is a serious problem as my only method of transportation is the bus, and there are zero buses running to that suburb. I’m not paying $50 to Uber each way, so I asked my employer what I should do. He suggested I talk to one of the other interns on my starting day Monday and try to carpool. This is issue number one. 

I made it rather clear that my only method of transportation is via bus when I applied, and the office itself is already a 45 minute bus ride away, excluding the extra distance for this Tuesday shift. I don’t like the idea of depending on a random intern that I met the day before the applicable carpool shift to get me to my second-ever shift at my new internship. Who even knows if these interns live anywhere near me given how large the metro area is, I don’t trust that they’ll actually get me there on time. I was never told of this onboarding shift before I applied. 

Issue number two is that I asked clarifying questions to see how many times such a carpool situation would have to occur and what these dates could potentially be. I received a rather vague response stating that there would be occasional off-site shifts. Again, I was never told of these before I initially applied. No further information was provided, so I have no idea when these will happen and as such I cannot plan for them in advance. I don’t like this. 

The final issue is generally the nature of the internship. A couple of months ago, I was very focused on the idea of an internship and just wanted *something* so that my resume would consist of more than just entry-level jobs. But now that I’ve been stewing over it for a couple of weeks, door-to-door sales really does not sound appealing. For one thing, it gets very hot and humid here and I have no idea how shifts work around the summer weather; I’m not trudging around in 95F heat with humidity on top of it for four hours with no breaks. For another, half of my shift will likely consist in doors getting slammed in my face and that sounds like bad vibes. I’m also unsure of how many days I can take off, and I have multiple pre-paid events planned throughout the summer. Lastly, I don’t like the idea of taking a company vehicle out to rotating suburbs with no way to, for example, go home early if sick and having no bus route to rely on from such a suburb. 

If you’ve made it this far, here’s the question: first, am I being unreasonable and expecting too much from my new employer? Second, if I go work an entry-level job again making (hopefully) $13/hour (but maybe closer to $12 plus additional tips), is that a sufficient trade-off in place of $14/hour with bonuses given my qualms with the internship? Lastly, am I a dickhead for wasting the company’s time and money with the drug test, background check, etc.? 

TL;DR: Internship has many downsides that I didn’t know/think about when applying, but pays well. Entry-level jobs are convenient location-wise and schedule-wise, but pay less. Am I a dick for wasting the company’s time? Am I making up false red-flags? Am I screwed on paying for rent/school with entry-level vs this internship?

Thank you for bearing with me!

Edit: Another, probably better, question: am I further a dickhead for ditching the internship like three days before it’s supposed to start?"

I am currently attending a university and entering my junior year in cs. I am at a point where I feel like I have gained a lot of knowledge in the foundations of programming to the point where I have started learning javascript. I've always really been into web development and I am hoping to make it my career. The only problem is that in the degree I won't be taking any classes involving web development which is why I have resorted to trying to learn it on my own. My parents are pushing me to find an internship this summer but it feels like that time has passed for me and I also feel like I don't have the experience for the work environment that I want to enter. I have made about 15 calls to local companies that design websites for small businesses hoping that this could stimulate my learning as well as provide a great point on my resume. I usually tell them that working for free would be fine as I am just trying to gain a feel for what the job entails but I also understand that it takes time and resources to train someone that doesn't have a lot of knowledge in web development. I really feel like this is a pivotal time in my career as people around me within my major are interns at larger companies and I am starting to feel like I'm getting left behind. If anyone has had a similar situation or just has advice for entering a career path they are welcome to respond! Thank you!"

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently graduated this past May with a B.B.A in CIS from a smaller college of around 2200 students.

&amp;#x200B;

During my senior semester, I have been working for the university's IT department as a Computer Technician, which consists of 7 people running the entire campus computer systems. Before that, I was working as an IT Consultant intern at a local City Hall.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I was told that there were no full-time opportunities available at the time. Additionally, I am still listed as a student worker working 28 hours a week and making minimum wage (Yeah, that was just me ranting at this point.)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, after starting the job hunting process last week, I just landed an interview from the most prominent college in the state for an IT Technician IV position. However, this is my first real interview, and I am not sure what to expect.

&amp;#x200B;

Any interview tips or advice will be much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

I didn't go through a technical interview but my resume was pretty decent, because I pulled in high grades and have some decent projects. At this point I've taken up to data structures / algorithms, but I'm completely unfamiliar with backend work, which is what I'll most likely be doing. I've picked up some textbooks and have been trying to learn as much as I can, but since my internship starts pretty soon I feel woefully unprepared. I'm afraid of ""wasting"" the summer since I know so little, especially in relation to all the other interns who are older. It's also a paid opportunity and I definitely want to be as helpful as possible to the company, but at this moment I just feel so lost and scared and dumb. Does anyone have any advice on what to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Some random questions that I have (I'm sorry if some of them don't make sense and I'd be happy to clarify):

\- How much time does it take to pick up other programming languages, assuming you're already pretty fluent in one of them? 

\- During lunch do employees tend to all eat together or separately at their desk? 

\-  Are interns expected to do extra studying outside of work (e.g. at night, like homework)?

\- How much of industry is ""theory"" (i.e. math) as opposed to just coding?"

Sorry for the long post and let me know if this is not the right place to post this and I'll delete it.

I got a masters degree around 3 years ago and I started hunting for data analyst/ business intelligence roles after that. It took me around 8 months for me to land this current job.

A lot of interviews I had were just initial HR screening calls which ended with 'I'm forwarding your resume to the manager' and then they went nowhere. Some of them went to the call with the manager and the questions were never very technical, just a discussion on my past job experience, internship and the projects I did during my masters. I wouldn't say they were blown away by me but it never felt like the conversation wasn't going anywhere, I always answered almost all of their questions and felt like I gave a good explanation of the projects I did.

I even went to the final round of interviews with about 4 companies. One was entirely my fault where the interviewer kept increasing the complexity of the questions (SQL) and I failed to answer them after a while. But the other interviews went OK afaik but then again, no offer.

After about 6 months of this, I was referred by an acquaintance to a company. Also, another friend of mine was being interviewed by a company and they found another job and referred me to the manager. I reached the final on-site stage of both companies in a week's gap. Second company gave me an offer and I asked my acquaintance at the first company and he said they like me a lot and are in the process of giving me an offer but will take about a month or so for it to be coming my way. I took the other offer and I'm working here since then.

I like my current job a lot and have been getting great reviews from my managers but I just want to see what's out there again. Just trying to figure out why it took me so long last time. I really can't think what I did different the last two interviews. 

I'm brushing up my technical skills and will definitely work harder this time so I can avoid failing because of that. But, any advice on what I might be doing wrong when it's just a project/past experience discussion with the manager and I'm failing at that stage? Anyway to practice to get better at telling my story?

I would greatly appreciate any other advice too because I see comments about how it shouldn't take you so much time/ so many interviews to land an offer. 

Thanks!"

I don’t know how else to explain it so I’ll just list them here. I’m a rising senior
Stats: SAT 1530 GPA 3.8 UW (only from one year in high school) 
4 AP’s (BC calc, chem, English Lang, apush)

EC’s
-Varsity Swimming
Won states this year, all American, captain next year
-Club Swimming
Year round, national level competition
-Two internships this summer
One at a research institute at the largest clinic in my area more geared towards med stuff
One at an engineering plant which is more focused on my planned major
-Some community service with the swimming organization in my area
-Foreign Exchange
This was a trip I took about a year and a half ago. I went to school in South America for about 2 months but it wasn’t with my high school because at the time I was still homeschooled (could anyone tell me
If this counts and how to describe it)
-JV Cross Country
-Math Club 

That’s all I have right now. I was homeschooled up until my junior year of high school so unfortunately I didn’t have a college advisor to tell me how important it was that I worked on my EC’s early. However, a lot of the schools I’m looking at are DIII swim teams that are T20’s and I am in the top 3 in all of them in my best event. Swimming took up a huge part of my time and the past 3 summers I’ve taken accelerated science courses to get ahead. I’m worried that the EC’s I have aren’t going to be enough for these competitive schools. Any advice for me going into this summer?

How bad did I fuck up, how bad of an impression is this?",assbaring69,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bv057n/tifu_by_unintentionallymistakenly_putting_in_too/,"Last week was my first at an internship. I am a complete first-time intern—no prior experience working in a full-time workplace setting. During orientation, I vaguely remember hearing something about “recording all the hours you spend at work” (which, in hindsight, may have been misheard or misunderstood). I took it too literally: I thought it meant that as long as you weren’t being unproductive during those hours, you can put down the entire time you were at work, from entering through the door to leaving. I thought about the sketchy optics of it—it did kind of make me look like I was trying to leech the company for more money—so I asked my manager about overtime pay. She gave a rather vague answer which I (mistakenly) took to mean “interns don’t get paid overtime”. Thinking I got all the details I needed, I didn’t pursue it any further. “I’ll just put in 10.5 hours today [I did stay for 10.5 hours my first day doing some training stuff—wasn’t sitting there wasting time], and since I don’t get paid the 2.5 hours of overtime anyway, it won’t give off the impression that I’m ripping off the company”, I thought. What’s more, the intern sitting next to me (though in a different team) did the same thing as me. So that only made me more sure about it. The next day, I stayed/worked and put down 10.5 again, and for the rest of the week I worked and put down 8 hours.

This week, my manager wanted to speak with me. As she was approving my hours, she saw what I did. She talked about how the company in fact *does* pay interns for overtime, and suggested that I do non-urgent tasks outside of work. It was 99.99999% obvious to me that she thought I was trying some shady shit. I realized my mistake, apologized, and then *very clearly* and *twice* explained that it was my misunderstanding, what that misunderstanding was, that I understand now to only work and put down 8 hours and that any exception to this must involve actual urgent work that must be approved by her first. She told me, “we can leave it like this for this week, but be aware for next week”, but I got the message, and no way was I going to make her feel even more strongly negatively about me. I voluntarily suggested to her that I can change my hours by putting down only 5 hours on Friday, even when I worked 8, effectively “making up” for the extra 3 hours I recorded on the first two days on the job. She said that was fine. But I don’t know, I feel like it has already left her a bad impression. This may just be confirmation bias, but I get the feeling that she is visibly/clearly stonewalling me this week at work, not wanting to speak with me (always rescheduling meetings, saying she is busy, etc.)

How bad did I fuck up / how bad of a fuck-up is this for an intern? Short of her being an extreme grudge-holder, do you think she will understand, given what I explained to her and my status as a first-time intern? Is this mistake understandable or natural for an intern (I just want to know what I did wasn’t extremely stupid that it makes me look like I’m mentally or judgmentally incompetent, or maybe it really does...)? I really want to get all I can—honestly not even mainly money-wise but experience-wise—from this summer, and I’m afraid that what I did seriously ruined my efforts.

TL;DR: Unintentionally/mistakenly put in too many hours for my paid internship because of mistaken understanding (wasn’t deliberately trying to wring more money out of the company) last week. This week, manager seems aloof and always pushing off one-on-one chats, discussion on my performance, etc. Legitimately feel like I left a very unfortunate mistake and bad impression even after I very candidly apologized and explained the situation/mistake to her."

Today marks the 4th day in my internship, and so far I feel very useless. Ive been assigned to write some java programs to modify some current data, and move it into new databases. I’ve never gotten to do anything like this, so constantly asking my supervisor (who is very very patient and awesome) questions on every step of the process. What I’m doing also has troubled being googled because it is so specific to the legacy code already written. So essentially, my supervisor helps me more than I feel he should, and I feel like a huge drain on him. I’ve really self motivated and am always coding on my own, so this just feels strange that I can’t really do much with what I’m assigned with. So is this normal for a first time position? Or does this mean I really need to buy a udemy tutorial of some sort. I should also mention I graduate this December with a CS degree. Thanks for any responses!"
bv1csz,2,2019-05-30,What career options does someone with ten years of printing experience have?,tonyc007,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bv1csz/what_career_options_does_someone_with_ten_years/,"I’ve been in the same industry for 10 years, it is the large format graphics industry, think customs signs and displays for businesses, like car wraps and branded office interior decor. I have an associates in graphic design from a not so accredited school that just recently closed, it was a business school, the kind that just churns out work degrees. No bachelors offered. I started as an intern at a Fastsigns in 2009 as a graphic designer, basic layout stuff in illustrator, some more complex things like vehicle wraps but nothing note worthy or portfolio worthy in a graphic design sense, at least not for the jobs which I’m applying. I ended up becoming “production manager” and wearing a lot of hats, basically running the place save for finances.

 I did that for four years and then the place got sold and I became complacent because I had learned all I could, was burned out from the grind and at the time I didn’t know that was a thing or to address it, the place didn’t operate without me so I never took a vacation. The new owners were awful, my father passed and I developed a drinking problem, got a dui and then things went down hill from there. I was fired and had no license so I took any job I could get, a month of no employment lead to a new position helping a guy start up a sign company as production manager but we had no sales and no sales team so after a while he started paying me with cash and I felt the need to find a more secure job. 

I desperately wanted out of the signs business and thought a bridge job to something different might be with an exhibit company I saw an add for.  I got a job with them as a graphics coordinator. I was the point of contact for receiving, modifying and having produced art from clients for whatever projects we were working on, but it also involved managing a few exhibits for a couple big brand name companies which involved flying out to the event, supervising the set up and tear down of these exhibits and tending to any needs that clients had on site. I did this for a year but the flying across the country every other week was terrible. I gained some new experience but I could tell the job wasn’t going anywhere, another dead end. After  I discussed with the owner that I didn’t want to travel as much, he basically said it was required, as I was there to relive him of that, and other tasks.  Ultimately we decided I should resign and now I’ve been working for a graphics production company for almost three years in production. Hating life and still trying to find a way out. I attempted a wedding photography business for a year and did eight weddings but realized I don’t have the personality to do that full time as I’m quite introverted and it is exhausting.  

Basically my plan now is to move into a van, save money for year, buy myself a year off and spend that year learning to code and create a web app I’ve been dreaming up for a few years, hopefully landing a job as a front end developer and restarting my career from that point. 

Alternatively I’d love to move directly into design, but my portfolio doesn’t have anything relative to agency or what anyone is looking for, and honestly I know this but it’s what I have. I read about doing free work to build a portfolio and I’d love to but I can’t even get that far without a portfolio. 

My network is terrible for a job hunt, I’m almost 30 and have no idea how to build a network for job hunting. Networking itself comes with a stigma around fake relationships and I can’t invest time or my limited social energy into inauthentic interactions. This is not rooted in me not wanted to provide value for someone but more so I can’t do the smile and nod with no purpose other than wanting an opportunity, and I don’t know how to engage in social interaction for the purpose of network building without it coming from the authentic reason of desperately wanting an opportunity that would otherwise be unreachable if I don’t build this connection with someone in a genuine way, but for the wrong reasons... and then the cycle repeats itself. 

This is long, and I’m sorry but if anyone knows if any of this experience can transfer to other fields or if anyone needs design work done for free that I can use in my portfolio, or just any hard facts advice about my attitude about networking or how to “get out there and make it happen” lay it on me. I’m totally lost and have already built my van, it’s my last hope. It also allows the option for returning to school, so it’s not just for the coding “pipe-dream” I actually believe in myself and I learn things quickly, it’s just that one day that you can’t muster the energy or you are too mentally fatigued to study because of a 12 hour work day that throws me off course. So I’m still studying but if I can buy myself a year I’ll have the time to build a fantastic app to completion and have something to show future employers. If I decide a bachelors is the only way out of this mess, then the low cost of living will allow me to go back full time. I’m almost 30 so time is no longer creeping for a career change. 

Thanks in advance for any insight, and thanks for reading this much with the intent of helping a stranger. That’s very cool."

I applied for the job as a computer science major and was pursuing a CS degree when I accepted the internship offer, but since then I’ve decided that struggling through the classes and having to retake them (like I was) wasn’t working out. I’m now in a major that’s CS-related but more focused on game design &amp; web/mobile app development, among other things like animation. But since I’ve been here I’ve been saying I’m a CS major (when asked) to remain consistent. 

Whenever I ask for help my manager/ other team members I get the impression that I should know this already. They use so many acronyms without explanation. I’ve spent my time so far researching any material I don’t know. Also learning sql, js, how REST apis work, etc.

I’ve been trying to install the framework I’ll be using to build this dashboard and there’s still issues with connecting it to their database. Been trying to troubleshoot &amp; I’m just confused. I haven’t written any real code or produced anything to show them, really (apart from a basic mock-up of the dashboard). I’m still learning the languages I have to use and this is the 3rd week!
I just feel SO incompetent. Like I should quit while I’m ahead to avoid the embarrassment. 
Nobody’s given any clear feedback on if I’m falling short, but I just feel like I’m underperforming.

Each branch makes their own hiring decision and each time I'm basically told that they want someone with ""more experience.""  I'm frustrated by this because I have been helping with loans for the last year and a half and I'm seeing people that are just fresh out of college bring hired into these positions.  I feel trapped at my current branch because I know that it is hard to find a replacement at our location.  The company has put me through some training outside of work (leadership training)  but outside of that they haven't really offer me any guidance or points that I can improve on.

Everytime I look at job listings I get depressed.  The only jobs I've enjoyed have been when I was an intern for a nonprofit but my last job, also my first job out of college, was the Director of Programs and Communication with a nonprofit that left a very bitter taste in my mouth.  Long story short for that was my boss was an ass to everyone unless you were a donor or a client.

I would love to go back into the nonprofit sector but I don't want to take a drastic pay cut (I make about 45k).  There was a position that my company didn't advertise inside the organization, just on their webpage for a marketing position that I thought I would be a perfect fit  for due to my experiences as being a director of communications and my current Master's program applies to this job as well.  I talked to HR to get a feeling on their reaction to me applying and it was a one sentence response ""Yes, but we're already in the final rounds of interviews.""  I still applied and I haven't heard anything for the last few days.

I'm at wits end.  I love the people I work with, great benefits and decent pay but I feel like I'm being too ambitious and being denied any advancement opportunities.

Huge potential for the internship, big space for innovation, all in all .. its a dream to work with them


Applied .. online interview .. cognitive tests ( very weird ) .. then finally, face-to-face interview 

So here is the thing, I tried multiple times to be myself (no fake personality or trying to sell myself aggressively), not to over prepare and just research the company in a couple of interviews and got very positive feedback all the time

So i thought i will be doing the same here 

But this is where reality hits, yes im a very good talker and im very good with my responses generally

Unfortunately , i didnt answer the basic questions correctly ( tell me about yourself, which courses that are relevant, etc, etc ... ) , due to my arrogance and not preparing well for the interview and the overconfidence at the time, and rejected a week later


Im very thankful that i made this mistake now, and not in an actual job interview


It never hurts to be ready and prepared

Mistakes are the steps for success

Have you any mistakes that you would like to share ?"

During school I didn't spend the time applying for jobs or studying for programming interviews. My last few quarters were pretty tough and I just wanted to focus on finishing. Since graduating, I've put in a a few applications (\~50) but had only heard back from one. As time went on I started doing less programming problems and submitting applications. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am now. Almost a year later after graduating with no programming job. Should I get right back into the job hunt even though I have this strange gap year? Or should I consider doing some bootcamp to sharpen up my programming skills and have something credible on my resume. I did not do an internship and haven't done any projects outside of school ones.

Any thoughts/experiences?",gay_ass_wizard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bv2juv/contracttofull_time_working_at_ford_the_cynic_in/,"So I applied to a Jr Software Position through a recruiting company listed on Glassdoor. I got an email from a recruiter saying they found a Jr Java Developer position at Ford for me. I'm definitely interested in the position but theres kind of a catch.

I'll actually be employed as a contractor for the recruiting company instead of Ford. The pay is significantly lower than what entry-level Ford employees are offered. They're offering me 26/hour(a little over 50k/year before taxes), while entry level Ford employees are paid around 70k/year.

Another thing that I don't like is that the contract is indefinite. Meaning there is not a set date where Ford will evaluate whether or not they will hire me full time. The recruiter said that this position was a ""try before you buy"" thing for Ford and that Ford doesn't hire new-grads unless they've had a co-op or internship there.

It seems kind of weird to me but I want a damn job. I'm afraid they'll use me until they don't need me and decide not to hire me regardless of how well I do. Not such a cynical thought considering Ford just went through another round of layoffs recently.

Another thing that concerns me is that I won't get the proper training an entry-level new-grad needs to get up to speed. I know that training and hiring is expensive so why would Ford use those resources on a contractor who isn't even really employed by them.

These seem like red flags to me but also I don't have that much industry knowledge and I need a damn job. Any thoughts? Am I right to be weary?"

I’ve been going to therapy and the only advice she ever gives is to breathe. I pay her $200 a month to have her say that and it’s super frustrating because that’s the only advice she gives. I took medical leave and need her to approve me going back to college. She wrote the letter and sent it yesterday, but today she tells me I’m not ready. She says I only focus on the negative—kind of hard not to imo.

Sorry for the long wait for those wondering what happened. First off, wow, I am a fucking idiot and so are my friends. Anyways, I probably stayed in the bathroom for a solid 30-40 minutes figuring out what I could possibly do to save my ass after writing the original reddit post. I decided to go back and just come out clean since there was no way I could save this especially after the text message notification. It would've been possible to do so if my friend didn't text that at the same exact moment, but that just sealed the deal. First thing i did was to show her that the pic was deleted for sure and that she could look at my phone if she didn't believe me. I told her that I had a thing with her daughter this year and found her (the manager) attractive, so I ended up telling my friends about it, who became interested. I also said that my friends and I were being completely immature about the whole situation, and that I would understand if there were any consequences. Somehow, she was being considerate and could see that I was fucking trembling (also i am an intern, so I guess that helps since im young). She replied back by thanking me for the compliment but what i did was completely unacceptable and would get me fired anywhere else. She said that she'll let this go (probably understands that i'm an idiot, but also young), and that she will have a talk with her daughter tonight...

Currently, it is the night, and I am scared to go back to work tomorrow because I have no clue what the daughter will say, but at least the mom is being understanding. Will update tomorrow.

Update: It is tomorrow for those wondering (May 31st, 9:45 EST time). I am sweating balls right now. She just came into the office and I am not ready to talk to her again. Will update what happens. 

Update 2 (10:59 EST time): I’m not sure if I have to make a new reddit post or can just update y’all here? but anyways holy shit, it’s been an hour. So when she came I could literally feel the tension in the air. I didn’t make any eye contact, just pretended that I was working on stuff even though I couldn’t focus. She said let’s go to her main office/room and talk (she usually works at her table next to mine but for important meetings/conference calls, she just goes into the room). She says that she brought up my name with her daughter and nothing bad came out of that convo (so thank you ____, if you ever come across this). Then she said we will move past this and never talk about it again and that I should learn from my mistakes. She said that to break the awkwardness, we will get lunch today?? She was in a hurry, so I feel like it hasn’t been completely cleared up. I’ll keep you guys posted. Seems like I’m in the clear though haha. Not sure if I should reach out to her daughter now

Update 3 (3:00 EST Time) Lunch Date: I am back! Wow okay, so basically we went out to eat, just the two of us,  and we were initially in the car just talking about work. I was acting pretty quiet because I was still shook at how things turned out, but I’m sure she could tell I was still tense because she slowly made our convo more casual by asking personal life questions like about my family, etc. NOW this is where things went different... She started talking about her family, and how’s she’s a single mom, etc. I ended up showing a picture of my fam to her and she said, “wow, what a beautiful family. You guys are all so cute together.” Then the convo diverted towards her daughter and she asked me how I knew her. I said from school (I’m sure she already had asked these questions to her daughter last night but she probs asked me this just for the sake of convo starters). At this point, I remembered reading your guys crazy comments about what could happen and felt a surge of confidence come back and keep in mind my boss is pretty hot, so I’m like fuck it let’s see where this goes. I say, “yeah she’s really cool and a lot of people think she has beautiful eyes. I can clearly see where they come from now (hinting at my manager).” She gladly smiles and says wow thank you, and we continue to talk. Now I’m back at the office, and I just got an email from her - BBQ at her house Sunday night. The whole team was invited which is like 10 people.  

Tldr for update 3: I feel like I’m thinking with my dick now, is that a bad thing? Honestly I could just be overlooking this whole situation and she wants nothing to do with me. I’d be the luckiest man alive if I can go from fucking up that badly to fucking the boss. Might have to delete this thread soon just in case though.

Update 4 (bbq): nothing happened, everything is normal. I talked to the daughter too and just caught up with her for a few mins and that’s all


TL : DR; I come out clean to my manager and she understands. Says she has to talk to her daughter about me though..."

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in my life I feel like I'm standing at a major crossing path, and I couldn't find anyone who'd give me proper criticism

My community consists of the rich and wealthy, they're so wealthy they don't question or think of changing anything that seems fucked up... Sexism exists at its core, racism too, they're so obsessed they try to keep their bloodline clean, and they don't EVER bring up the issues in it, they deny it they ignore it

&amp;#x200B;

I have an abusive alcoholic and addict father who stopped living with us when I was 6. He's an major manipulator, he slips through police and has connections.. He's the kind of a piece of shit scum bag that would spread false accusations and get ppl riled up on you to pressure you into doing shit even if they're false... Rape, drugs, fabrication of signatures and documents, taking advantage of minor's financial rights, mental physical abuse on weaker women particularity my mother... He enjoyed scaring the shit out of her... needless to say, although she's the brightest person i've known, her mentality degraded, she's so paranoid she isn't the same person anymore.. My siblings get over 30 miss calls if they're out not because she's worried, but because she's afraid of him talking shit to her about my siblings.. He's physically not even in the house; he only visits but her fear didn't go away...

&amp;#x200B;

He married my mother for money, she gave him an allowance, and education and shit tons of things, he had two step daughters and they are to this day his sole purpose.. Any money taken from us goes to them.. And they're aware of his doings and support it

&amp;#x200B;

I understood these things from a very young age, as my mother would vent and I'd listen and see, so I tried my best to make my mother's life easier, I helped my siblings and her, I paid allowances, I paid bills, I got my siblings jobs and got them in well known universities, I looked after my mother's health (I probably talked to over 50 Drs on her behalf, I went to the hospital so much so I know every corner of it; it's like my own house..).. I even taught my siblings whenever they needed..

&amp;#x200B;

My life from middle school to college revolved around the well being of my mother, and my siblings' future. Because I empathized and felt my mother had suffered enough from my father and her life early on, so living on our own with his minimal presence can be made an easier/happy place for her. I succeeded in that.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother had anger built up as long as I remember, it was let out on me. I was verbally degraded and insulted on an almost daily basis by my mother if she's mad, something like losing her phone or not finding her cards or wallet would set her off like crazy.. Few times she did hit but she regrets her actions and apologizes if it gets that far... Items were thrown and broken from plates to phones... For the first half of my years, the verbal abuse was only done to me in-front of everyone, I guessed because she trusted that I don't get hurt and I'm more mature so she let loose, my siblings got a mild taste from her only after a very long time, but for some reason she just didn't... My sister turned to have anger issues too... but my sister would lose control and hit things..

&amp;#x200B;

I in my 26 years, tried my best, I never once raised my hand on anyone because it's pointless, I rarely if ever get angry, because I reasoned everything can be solved with discussion and if that fails then as humans whose brains are the main advantage it is unfortunate.. I tried to be as fair as I could. Not once have I insulted or degraded anyone or my mother the same way done to me.. I just empathized and took things calmly...

&amp;#x200B;

In the past weeks I began seeing everything in a different light. Because my attempts in this society that I can't change, and this family that is too broken to be fixed seem to have gone to vain.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought if I did my best, then surely everyone will act reasonably and do their parts? But they got greedier and didn't want to do anything since I've been doing everything, and my mother was on my siblings' sides because they're her precious ones.. ""You're the oldest you should understand""...

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this month a very trivial incident happened and my younger sister for the first time in my life, knocked my door, and raised her hand on me, something even my mother haven't done in years.. I was in shock, because I helped this person get a job a career a proper living circumstance... I haven't fought back, I just shouted things to get her to think and leave...How could I fight? My mother was there and I feel it's not my place to do so.. I imagined my mother would stop/scold her? No, she again asked me to understand.. The situation was never addressed

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is a victim but she's manipulative in her own ways and so is my sister... Today another trivial matter occurred and it had nothing to do with my sister, again she throws things and assaults me... I just had to fight back, it was so bad I have bleeding scratches and bruises but she shut up and backed off eventually... I don't want to press charges, it'll complicate things and I know my sister is immature and this is so petty.. My mother again came to me to tell me she's willing to pay me money, she'll give me ""whatever I want""?... How fucked up can one be as to think that's something I'd want.... When I called her out on her act she almost laughed, and actually tried to guilt me for behaving the way I did..

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm debating on whether I should stop empathizing and just be selfish or not.. I need time off and I found an internship abroad, I can travel but logically I know it'll risk my mother's life, and if she's at risk I'll go back to living with my father which is a worst option.. This is because I can't trust my sister and she's irresponsible enough that my mother was afraid for her own life and was against me going.. What should I do in ur opinion?

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like if I look around everything turned to shit tbh, I'm seriously questioning my approach in life. I have no friends because there's not a single person that shared my thoughts in my community they're all brainwashed. You can guess I don't have a partner either, the only thing I can think of is actively look for a partner and move out.. The reason we're living together is because an unmarried woman living alone gets rumors going, and image is the most important thing in this community...so I may as well be forced into marriage

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice even if in private would be appreciated,

As you can imagine, this has been very difficult and stressful. I never did any internships, and don’t have much out of class experience other than a couple of small projects at home. I did well in school (3.3 GPA) and loved doing what i learned, but I just feel like I didn’t learn or do enough to make myself an attractive candidate for most entry level jobs. I have had interviews, but I either can’t get passed the first or second round of interviews or many of the questions asked I simply did not learn in my classes. My morale is fading, and my anxiety is increasing. I am focusing on software opportunities (mainly C++) as that is what I feel the most confident in and enjoy doing the most. My life consists of balancing my part-time job, applying to jobs, tweaking my resume, doing projects, networking, and just trying not to forget everything i learned in school. 

Any advice or words of encouragement would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. This sub seems like a great resource and I wish I knew about it when I was in college and even high school."
bv3ndl,1,2019-05-31,Seeking advice,Kal947,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bv3ndl/seeking_advice/," 

Hello. I've had a few internships doing helpdesk/systems administration work. I've noticed that every time I include my second internship that did not go so well for me due to stupid mistakes on my resume that I get rejection emails and no calls all year then when I simply leave the first one I had two interviews in the same month. I've also only recently omitted that from my resume. I'd like to think that I wasn't getting any interviews because I was still in school and these recent ones have opened to me because I'm graduated now. The market is appears to be tight all year in the Philly area until around this time of year which could be another reason. They wouldn't call my second internship that early before they even call me in for an interview and consider me would they? I really hope its something else. I wrote an article which can be found if you type my name in google basically just saying what I did there and what I learned and that I was proud of working there because its a company that helps others out and I admire that. If I wanted to truly omit it employers in the future would see it and know I worked there. I've asked this but I'm at a loss as to what to do handling the fallout of said mistakes. I've asked them to take the article off their site but they don't do anything.

\*\* P. S. The reason I omitted it was because of poor performance and my bosses may have been angry with me right before I left because I mistakenly didn't go to a party for interns and new employees I was the only intern not there. Stupid mistake I know and it still haunts me. I was caught up in what I was doing and I also have social issues that I'm working on. My supervisor also had to hold my hand for everything. Only the CIO responds to my emails now but won't give me reference and doesn't respond when I ask. I'm still trying to make things better regardless of my issues."

I feel like this isn't enough for even GA compared to the other kids in my class. Safety schools are UW Bothell or WSU. 

I still have to worry about getting into CS too :/ I’m planning on taking those CS classes and hopefully scoring an internship somewhere the summer after HS. I’m scared those math grades will reflect poorly to get into UW CS though. Gotta go hard in calc now. Not only that but I don’t have much experience in CS so I’m kinda screwed. Being a mid-class first gen female may or may not give me an advantage 

Anyways, any tips on how to get into UW then CS? Also would LOVE to hear from current CS students about how y’all got in"

I went the new route because I had a hoopti (old and beat up car) throughout college and every month my senior year I was paying to fix something. Because of this, I didn’t want to deal with any major car issues while in my 3 year grad program. 

Fast forward 2 years to the summer of my second year in the program, I’ve racked up about 75,000 miles on my Cruze as I’ve been Ubering on the side to eat, because my program is too time consuming for a part time job. 

I’m driving home from studying the other day and my check engine light comes on, I take it into the nearest dealership and they keep it over night.

The next day they call me and tell me that it’s a cracked piston. I need to pay $4500 to replace the engine.  Replace the engine, of a two year old car. 
The money that do I have is for rent and school, there’s no way I can afford something like this. I have a grad students credit, young and ugly (my credit not me) and I don’t even own a credit card.

A car is still very much necessary because the internships linked to my program and my school is in the middle of no where so any possible part time job requires transportation. 

What are my options?"

If I didn't have any internship this summer I was just going to practice coding with leet code and w3 schools to learn new languages. While working on a personal project, an app.

I am a a returning intern to software company I have been at the last 2 summers. I am a rising senior and started after my freshman year. Back then I was hired on as a QA intern and was happy to have my foot in the door. 

My first two summers went well and I worked on interesting stuff but I wanted to flex my knowledge more so I reapplied to as a Dev intern. I had a couple of interviews but ended up not getting any of the positions. This was fine, as I know cs internships are hard to get and my technical knowledge may not have been there as the interviews happened in the beginning of my junior year. As such, I accepted my QA position again because I would really like to stay within this company. 

Recently I started again and am really excited about my project. I’m going to be helping build the automation framework for my section of the product using a language I have never used yet and doing paired programming with another intern. All things that I dreamed of in a dev internship! However after talking to the other intern I realized that he’s dev and I myself would definitely like that title. 

We are going through the same training, doing the same project and will literally be working hand in hand all summer on the same thing. He is also a returning intern. 

If there is an opportunity for me to move up here I definitely want to seize it. A dev internship is my dream right now but how should I go about renegotiating my position?"
bvbbfy,1,2019-05-31,Employee or subcontractor? First IT job!,dregxmangler,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bvbbfy/employee_or_subcontractor_first_it_job/,"Backstory: I am graduating with my two year degree in network engineering in a couple weeks (transferring to WGU later this summer). I participated in a paid IT internship for my program last summer, ultimately made a good impression and landed a permanent position with the same company I interned for when they decided to start looking for a replacement last month. When I was an intern, I was just doing basic IT support for a large non-profit organization that puts on the large State Fair, which is a gigantic event that lasts about 3 weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

As stated above, I've been working with the company for about a month now. My boss has a little over 40 clients, about 10 of them being major clients. We currently have 6 employees including myself. The business owner is pretty much hands-off with actual IT related stuff at this point and solely spends his time running the business end of things and establishing/maintaining clients. Everyone is great, everyone is helpful. When I was initially hired on, I was asked if I would prefer to be an employee or a subcontractor. I didn't, and still don't, fully understand what being a subcontractor entails, so I opted to just be a regular employee. The owner's son works for the company, and is literally the only official employee I later found out. Everyone else is a subcontractor.   

&amp;#x200B;

I was approached this morning by a coworker, and he told me he was approached by my boss and asked to talk me into going the subcontractor route. From what my coworker said, he recommends that I start my own business. Seems a little strange, although I could see why it might be a bit simpler for him to not have me as an employee. Not only am I relatively new to the IT field, but I'm incredibly new to the world of business and anything that defers from being a standard 9-5 minimum wage\~ employee. My question is, what is the best course of action here? The main thing I've been told to look out for if I go as a subcontractor is taxes. If I did go that route, I would just stick 30% of every check into savings, so that's not really my concern. I would, however, be very worried about being legally responsible should some horrible accident or loss of data occur. I'm not the most knowledgeable IT professional, but I'm confident and I think I know plenty to address the tasks that I've been assigned so far as I run around helping all of my coworkers get projects caught up with their clients. However, I don't think I'm nearly knowledgeable enough to do something as bold as start my own business. It just seems like a really odd piece of advice, that could just be self-serving for all I know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting at $20/hr, which is actually a fairly generous entry-level IT wage in my state. However, I know the owner is charging clients at least 5 times that hourly rate. Since I feel I would be taking a risk going as a subcontractor, would it be out of line for me to ask for a pay increase as compensation for said risk? Should I just reiterate my preference on being a regular employee? Any advice would be appreciated, especially from those that are/were business owners/subcontractors themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks guys!"

Not sure what to do,braith_rose,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/bvc8e9/sleeping_disorder_not_sure_what_to_do/,"Hey guys, thanks for taking the time to read. I've had this happen on and off throughout my life. This is been happening again in the past couple of weeks and I feel like I can't really stop it. I work a part-time job as a barista and get about 2- 3 days off a week, and when I am working I don't always start on a normal schedule so sometimes I'll have until 11:30 am to myself. I'm also a part-time designer and have made logos and advertisements as a side hustle for good money.  My body usually wakes me up at 8am, whether or not I feel fully rested. This is how my body changed in the past decade as I'm in my mid-20s, and is normal for me outside of random bouts like this that can last months. 

Lately in the past two weeks I've noticed that rather than automatically waking up at 8 a.m. like I usually do, I wake up and I'm very tempted to sleep in. I'll sleep in till 11:30 or 12, get up and have tea or breakfast, scroll through my phone and go back to bed to lay and do nothing for hours. I lay in bed even till 4 p.m. like today, and have very little to no motivation to do anything with my time. The lack of motivation is crippling as I'm not even motivated to pay my bills, exercise like I normally do three times a week, or even talk to my friends. 

The lack of motivation is absolutely crippling and it scares me because it's also affected my design in the past 3 years. I've always loved design and went to school for it, been offered some great jobs and had some amazing internship I'll never forget. But lately it takes me months to complete a project and I've lost customers because the lack of motivation is so crippling I can't even take care of myself. I don't know what's going on and wonder if I maybe have a sleeping disorder or am genetically lazy to a lethal degree. I feel pretty even Keel and regular so nothing seems off but nothing matters to me and I don't know how to be productive for myself like I usually am. 

The part that upsets me the most is by the time I'm up and doing things nighttime is only a few hours away and then I have to go to sleep again. When I have a few days off a week I'll think during work and make list for myself of all the things I need to get done, side hustles needed to complete, exercise I'll be doing and groceries that need to be bought but lo and behold I only have a few hours until the day is over and I have to go to work tomorrow- none of it is done and I'm so ashamed. 

Nothing can give me motivation, not even the things I love. I really don't know what to do as it started to affect my life in a professional manner and I can't seem to control it no matter how hard I try to motivate myself and know that I need to get things done just to stay afloat. Has anyone had this happen to them? If so what did you do aside from going to a doctor to fix this"

* A modern, well-styled Angular 7 front-end to implement the visualizations (currently working on migrating to React+Redux)
* a Node JS backend with passport authentication connected to MongoDB (for user auth) and Oracle XE (for visualization data)

* Completely Dockerized structure front to back for easy deployment

I’m a freshly graduated mechanical engineer working at a medium sized company with a small engineering team in the aerospace industry.

I went from intern to full time, where I spent a lot of my internship using VBA to create design and analysis tools. VBA has been useful, especially given that everyone always has Excel installed. However I’d like to expand my programming repertoire. I currently am moderately proficient in VBA and C++. 

It’s unlikely that my company will shell out for subscriptions to enterprise editions of software, and we’re large enough to not qualify for the small business exception for some community editions. So I’m looking for free/open-source software, at least until I can demonstrate results strong enough to warrant them enrolling in subscriptions. 

So back to the question: Which programming languages do you use in your work? Which IDEs/compilers do you use? And do you have any recommendations for open-source software?
