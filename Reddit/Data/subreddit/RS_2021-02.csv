**Letters of Recommendation**

Spanish teacher - 9/10 - She seemed to like me and she was super excited to write me a recommendation, but I think she struggled a bit trying to figure out what to write.

CS teacher - 8/10 - She offered to write me a rec letter, which I think is a good sign, but a lot of people also asked her so idk how much time she got to write it. We got along very well and CS is my major, so I'm hoping this rec was good.

**Interviews**

My Penn interview was not great and I didn't know what to say, but Harvard, MIT, and Rice went pretty well. I had a better story about why I wanted to pursue CS specifically in healthcare which helped me feel more confident and fluent.

**Essays**

I wrote several versions of my personal statement, both of which are maybe 6 or 7 out of 10. One was on my habit of joining just about everything and the other on some of the activism work I've done for women/minorities in CS.

My ""Why \_\_ College/Major"" essays were quite specific, and I had a basic template (discuss 2 research opportunities, a class, and some extracurriculars) so it never took me more than 2 hrs per school. My more creative essays weren't very good, I applied to a lot of schools so I didn't have too much time to brainstorm.

l9rsma,0,2021-01-31,Is transferring really worth it?,confused_dude_XD,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l9rsma/is_transferring_really_worth_it/,"Hello Berkeley Community,

I was wondering how much of a benefit a Berkeley CS degree would be toward general software jobs, as well as going into startups/entrepreneurship. 

I was lately considering applying as a four-year transfer to Berkeley CS, and while ik the chances of it happening are extremely slim, I am still giving it a thought. While my current university is providing me with an excellent education, I really started having thoughts about entrepreneurship, especially in tech. Thus, I noticed Berkeley has much more of a startup culture/programs, so I wanted to give transferring a shot.

So what I wanted to ask is if it is really worth it. I know transfers have to take 61AB and 70 to declare, despite any previous classes they might have taken. At my previous institution, I would have taken DS &amp; Algo and possibly 1-2 other upper div cs classes before transferring (as well as all GEs finished for reciprocity). While I know getting a good job is possible at both, I feel like I would have to significantly stand out at my current institution.

Some background: Current freshman studying CS at UC Santa Cruz. Not guaranteed, but hoping for 1-2 internships before my transfer/junior year if I don't make it.

Anyways I appreciate any input. If anyone has transferred, or in/was in a similar position it would mean the world if I could read your advice."

I'm a 25-year-old college student studying technology (digital media) and I don't have any work experience. A classmate of mine does front-end coding things like HTML and CSS and his job just had him learning javascript and another friend interns at Adobe doing marketing. However, I don't have any experience in these things and I don't really know where to start.   


I have some work experience at my family business I worked a forklift in the warehouse, and then I also worked a forklift at a lumber yard. I've also run my own freelance photography company but I only get clients like once every 2 months and I'm not that good at photography, to be honest.   


I just want to start gaining experience and trying different things before I graduate. Are workshops and courses good to do for now while I'm in school? Can I put an HTML and CSS or Python course on my resume in order to get a programming job? Or if I want to study marketing and sales can I take a course in that and put it on my resume? I'm just not sure how to get an internship for this summer. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
l9teri,16,2021-01-31,At my wits end,TheSkilletFreak,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/l9teri/at_my_wits_end/," I have posted a couple times in a few places so some of it may be repeated. 

So I got rejected from another company last week. This was the farthest I have been in the interview process (Second interview panel style). I got rejected last week from HR for a different job (No feedback from them). I got an email to answer some questions for another place and I did, no reply at all. 

This recent company I actually went above and beyond. I stayed up to make sure I could answer any STAR questions. I spent hours watching the youtube links of the company they sent me. I looked up interview questions they have asked on Glassdoor. I went as far as to look up the people who were interviewing me. One of them went to the same school and graduated a year before me!  

I felt confident about the last two companies that I interviewed with because the job description listed things I DID know. I felt confident because these jobs actually DID say entry level and recent graduates so I knew that I wouldn’t be treated like I should just know everything. 

I was rejected from my last company because someone else just had more experience.  

All of this is SO energy draining. It’s like I keep putting in more and more effort to no avail. Each time I see that rejection letter or hear that “We decided to go with someone else” makes me less and less motivated to keep trying. I started writing cover letters and changing my resumé according to the job description. I talked to officials at my school and to my friends who DO have jobs who helped me with my resumé. What else could I literally do? 

I am still looking for jobs and I don’t even feel like I am qualified enough or they don’t look interesting. I am still applying. But it seem everything is going against me. I had an internship which ended up making me feel like an absolute failure [ContextHere](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/kr11ka/how_did_you_guys_learn_how_to_do_your_jobs/gi7fbzi/?context=3)  and my GPA is not above a 3.0. I wasted my time chasing a guy for almost a year instead of looking for a job. I got a tech job to get more experience but all I do is weigh things and write things down and do some stocking. How is that even useful? Sure I have experience on the lines and understand them but no chemical industry experience whatsoever. Not even measuring concentrations of stuff. I am slowly losing any memory of my studies. I want to use MATLAB and ASPEN but how do I even gain access to that? It’s been almost two years since I graduated what company would want to hire someone who waited that long? Corona is around, is that the reason I am running out of jobs to apply for? 

Not to mention that because of my internship I am so nervous that I am not going to be good enough at a new job and I think that could be messing me up when it comes to talking about myself because It feel like I liar. 

I won’t stop applying but I can’t see any reason why I should keep trying. I am considering the networking thing but I have no idea what to talk about. I need a ton of help in  that department. I also saw in another post that netoworking/cover letters don't seem to help.

 I feel so tortured at my tech job because it is so boring I hate coming in and can’t bear to think about staying longer.  Imagine being so busy that all you can do is run around, but it's not thought provoking to a point you still aren't having any fun. I hate coming home and knowing it's the same exact thing the next day.

I am well aware of how difficult it will be for me to find a job. It doesn’t make it any easier by telling me that. Just makes it less motivating if anything. I just was here to rant and maybe ask for advice on anything more I can do/networking. Some encouraging words and relatable stories would be really nice as well. Thanks guys"
l9uaud,498,2021-01-31,Mother of two wanting to get out of current living situation. Is this a realistic plan for becoming a software developer?,somegarbageisokey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l9uaud/mother_of_two_wanting_to_get_out_of_current/,"TL:DR: just want to know if my plan to obtaining a job as a junior developer is realistic enough or if I need to do more. Scroll down to the list if you don't wanna read all the other junk. 


The gist of it is that I am in a relationship that just isn't working out and I need to get out for me and my kids mental health (we're safe, no abuse). I did the dumb thing of financially depending on my husband while I went to school (nursing, didn't work out unfortunately). That means I have no recent work experience and the work experience I do have is in retail and over 4 years old. 


I just started my computer science degree. I really enjoy it. I've also been doing Harvard's CS50x on EdX for a couple months. I just started my first Programming Fundamentals course at my local community college. I plan to continue my computer science degree but it will take years to complete because I can only devote part time to it right now due to financial reasons. I want to be on my own soon. But I need to make a livable wage for that. 

So the plan is to take 2021 to:


1. Learn to code with as many online resources as possible (CS50, etc). (My current course is in C++, CS50 teaches in C, and I plan to learn python on my own). 


2. Complete as much of the associate's degree as I can: 
I have all my basics. I think by the end of 2021 I will have completed Programming Fundamentals 1, 2, and 3, physics 1, and calculus 2. After that I would need 3 more courses to complete the associate's. I plan to complete my bachelor's eventually when I'm in a better place financially.


3. Practice Leetcode when I feel ready enough. 


4. Network at school. My current professor has already mentioned that she has a lot of connections in the industry and has helped students get jobs and internships before. 


5. Get a job to have recent work experience: 

Since I have no recent work experience, I'm planning on applying to whatever retail job will take me to have at least a year of recent work experience. Would an office job ""look"" better? Maybe a tech job? I know tech and CS are different but my school offers a short CompTIA A+ course so maybe that's worth looking into.


Is this plan realistic for me to be able to get a job as a developer in maybe a year or two? Is there something I should add to that list?


About me: I am currently in Houston, TX but plan to eventually move to Austin, TX since that's where all my family is and I need a support system. Science and math come easy to me. So far I enjoy programming and find it fun and challenging. I also love the fact that you have to be resourceful as a programmer, as I am a very good googler lol and I'm very resourceful. I love to learn and I have always said I will never stop learning so that's an aspect of CS I like too. I can devote 3-4 hours a night to programming outside of class right now since I am a stay at home mom. When I work, that might go down to 2-3. 

Thanks in advance everyone.

Edit: I wanted to say thank you so much to everyone's responses! I really appreciated all your time and information. I'm trying to respond to everyone today, it's hard with a very needy toddler though lol but I'll get to everyone! I hope this post can help others that are in a similar situation. Thanks again!

I’m 18 and graduated high school last year. My high school let me take college classes so I’m a junior in college and this is my second semester. I decided to major in cs knowing absolutely nothing and took an intro class but failed to pick up most of it and skated by in the class. I was only able to do about two labs on my own. Taking the second part of that class now and I just got a zero on my first two labs. I’m ignorant to all language having to do with computers which doesn’t help. Feeling very depressed and doubting I should get an internship for a long long time. Time that I don’t really have. I don’t want to spend more time in college for money reasons, but I want to feel prepared for an internship+the workforce.

I was pretty much left to fend for myself so now I found coding which is amazing it gives me the ability to actually put legitimacy into my business/marketing knowledge. the problem is I know that I'm going to be competing with people that have degrees and computer science and I don't know how to deal with that. I'm trying to apply for internships but it feels like everyone I'm competing with is younger and smarter than I am(especially because I only know HTML and a little bit of CSS at this point). If anyone has some advice it would really help me (also lost my job during covid so I'm hoping this really turns out for the best).

Let me talk about myself for a bit, I'm a 22 year old Portuguese junior software developer, currently unemployed, I've had 2 internships, totaling 1 year of work experience, as I stated earlier, due to some dark times, I gave up on my bachelors' on Computer Science, but I already have a diploma that states I have a Level 5 QRQ\* Course in IT, mainly developing. I've always had my dreams of creating things and living big, I've done an android game soon to be featured in the google play store, and I've worked on multiple projects as a hobby, so I know I've got the experience.

And now the moving out part comes in. I've always wanted to work hard my 20s/30s and enjoy my 40s+, that being by investing (doesn't really matter on what) and here in Portugal, the salaries for Junior Developers are around 800€ - 900€, and I've done some research that in the Netherlands, for example, its 2800€, which is just way too much comparing to Portugal's salary, of course I also know that the cost of living anywhere but here will be more costly, but that's something I'm willing to face, because software developers get raises by years of work experience, so if I can actually settle in a foreign country with a job, my salary would only go up from that point on. I don't want to be the guy that invests 200€ each month because my country's salaries are too low when he could be investing 1500€ each month (which if you know about the markets, that's an extremely huge difference.Also, I'm pretty fluent in English, and couldn't speak any other language besides English/Portuguese

Honestly I just want to read your words and seek out the best guidance I can find.Thanks again for reading

\*Cant really explain what that means in English terms, but lets put it like this, on the education ladder, the Level 5 QRQ step is right below a bachelors'.

Edit: Thanks for the replies guys! I read them all and I'm sure going to anwser them all!

My ideal goal was to try and get a summer internship to explore my career interest more, but it seems highly unlikely now. Still, I want to try and learn more so I can see if this is something that I actually want to do or just something that I've just glamorized in my head.

My internship makes me miserable and I find myself crying about work every other day. It's an indefinite paid internship and it's only been 3 months since I started. I got this job from my dad's friend's referral after almost 11 months of unemployment. I graduated college about a year ago.

My boss and his boss make very harsh comments so I feel really anxious about asking for help now. For example, on my first week of work, they both made comments on how disappointed they are in my abilities to test their hardware while fully knowing I don't have hardware experience. I was asking a lottttt of questions and my boss told me ""research the questions before you ask"" which is fair but when I did that the next time, he berated me for not just asking! Every time I ask him a question now, he responds with ""like I told you before...."" except my question was about what he ""told me before"" so repeating it again really doesn't help me and it makes me feel really stupid. My boss's boss also made comments about me saying I shouldn't procrastinate and be lazy when I just asked him if I could talk to my boss about available options for projects before I emailed him (boss's boss) about what I feel I would be a good fit for since I literally didn't even know what projects there were. There's more stories than this and I feel like I'm just fucking up left and right but I swear I'm really trying to learn and follow their instructions. I'm so anxious to ask questions now so I'm seriously falling behind on work and that makes me even more anxious because I feel like my boss is just going to comment ""this is all you've done?"". 

Also, I'm working from home now because there was a covid scare in my family. I should've been back in the office but I played up the covid scare thing a bit so that I could work from home a bit longer since I live with my grandparents. Before this, and after my ""covid scare"" is over, they were ""requiring"" me to come to work everyday by saying that someone on the team will come teach me, but when I asked if anyone is coming and who, no one would reply but occasionally someone would show up so I would have to show up to the office every day. I really don't want to go back to the office since my dad is a smoker and it is still some time until my grandparents can get their vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

Working here is making me miserable. I'm so anxious everyday and I'm so depressed I just spent all Sunday in my bed (literally only got up to eat and use the restroom), trying not to cry about having to go to work this week and ignoring everyone. I feel like all my depressive habits are back. I definitely don't even want to stay in hardware so a big part of me is wondering if this is even worth it? Financially, I will be ok if I quit since I still live with my family and I have 15k in savings in case of anything. They're against me quitting since it's easier to get work if you're working but they won't stop me.

Am I being overly sensitive? I feel kind of whiney when I say I really want to quit.  I have been job searching this entire 3 months but no offers yet and quitting seems like a bad move but I feel like I'm running on empty now. What should I do? Can I quit and apply while doing side projects or is that a pretty terrible idea?"

The day everything started to go wrong was the same day I started school. He was “missing” for almost a month, I knew he was gone, I knew him too well to know that he wouldn’t just leave. Everyone was hopefull so I just tried to be for them, but deep inside me I knew and no one understood me. 

I traveled to his funeral, I saw his closed casket, the pain in his family, I saw his friends. I talked to his sisters and shared memories and talked about the pain. And at that moment I thought I couldn’t feel worse. I thought time would help me. I thought I could deal with everything. 

But I can’t, everything at school is going bad, the internship is going bad, on top of everything we are in the middle of a global pandemic. I try to take everything day by day, step by step. I try to be more positive or care free, I have been going to a therapist for two years now because I was dealing with trauma and when everything was getting better, all of this happens. 

But some days I don’t have the energy to wake up and get up in the morning, some days I don’t want to get up in the morning. I want to drop out every single day because I feel like I can’t deal with everything anymore and I’m just pushing myself to the limit. Some days I wake up and the first thing I think about is if I have enough pills to kill myself. I don’t want to kill myself, I know what it feels like to be on the other end, to be the one that loses someone. But I don’t know how to keep living like this, I don’t know what to do with my life, I don’t know how I will wake up tomorrow and go to class and then to the internship. I can’t fail, because I’m already failing.

Over the winter break, I spent a lot of time applying for summer internships. As of now, I've gotten internship interviews from 3 companies. However, the issue is that Company A (An SME) has already given me an internship offer, and they actually gave me a deadline of January to confirm if I'm interning there (I overshot the deadline but I still can't decide). 

On the other hand, Company B that I interviewed for has a more prestigious internship program with a higher pay and I am confident that they will teach a lot more to their interns. I think I did fine for their technical interview and I'm currently still waiting for their updates on an in-person interview with the company. However, this company with a good internship program mentioned on their website that they can only confirm an intern's placing by end-March. 

I'd like to seek advice from seniors who are more experienced in this -- would you accept the offer from Company A? Also, legally, if I accept Company A's offer right now and Company B gives me an offer subsequently, do you know if I am allowed to cancel my offer with Company A? For context, I am a year 1 student in a computing course and this will be my first internship, and I don't really have anyone to turn to for advice... Thanks for the help in advance!"

la3fcs,1,2021-02-01,Requesting advice for new entry-level position at aWS,Pardex,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/la3fcs/requesting_advice_for_new_entrylevel_position_at/,"Hello everybody!

I am here to get some advice if possible and your opinions about a situation that I am about to face.

Some days ago I have landed an entry-level job in Amazon Web Services Germany as a “Capacity Install Technician”.

The requirements for the position are the following:


**Adhere to security and safety best practices in the data center.*

**Installation and testing of copper and Fiber Optic cabling.*

**Basic build and troubleshooting of network devices.*

**Creating/attaching labels and barcodes.*

**Regularly lift 35lbs or move heavy objects into position.*

**Adhering to defined escalation processes and standard operating procedures.*

**Basic knowledge of computer hardware and network cabling.*

**Ability to work well with others in a team environment, displaying excellent time management skills and the ability to follow direction.*

**Knowledge of Copper and Fiber Optic testing methodologies.*

**Ability to read basic layout drawings and floorplans.*

**Previous experience working in a Data Center environment (racking &amp; stacking gear, cable management).*

**Understanding of server operating systems, Linux based troubleshooting such as firmware flashes and bios configurations.*

**And so on…*


I have seen similarities of this position (“Capacity Install Technician”) with the description of other position in Amazon Web Services, like “Infrastructure Delivery Technician”, “Data Center Technician” and/or “Network Technician”.

To give you a more in depth context, my background is:

- I have graduated from my university (from South America) as a “Telecommunications and Network Engineer” and I am studying to get the “new” CCNA.

- I have done 1 “little job” and 1 internship in the past: I worked for 6 months as a Telecommunications technician for a company participating in a big FTTH project in which I did a lot of thermal splicing, some basic PoP tasks (basic device configs, thermal splicing, patching, etc.) and I helped to troubleshoot end-user issues. The internship that I have done it was for 3 months in a really good company inside the Networking team. I basically participated with the “Unified Communications” team helping them to choose their new VC hardware that would replace the old one. I did a lot of network testing inside the company’s internal network (Wireshark dumps, IPerf, etc.) to help them to choose the best option. I also did some simple tasks in their own data centers, as patching, racking devices, as well as get a first approach on monitoring tools inside an enterprise network (StableNet, PRTG).

So it would be REALLY nice if someone more experienced can give me some opinions:

- What kind of job should I expect? How is work inside a data center on a daily basis? Do you guys think I am prepared? It will be my first time working full time in a position like this, and dude, for Amazon...

- Do you think is it possible to start an IT career with this position? Any thoughts about AWS? (it would be nice if someone know something about AWS in Europe, specifically in Germany!)

- I really want to dedicate myself in Networking more than Data Center itself. Do you guys think is it also possible to try to find a path in Networking with this job?

**ANY KIND OF COMMENTS, OPINIONS, SUGGESTIONS AND/OR QUESTIONS ARE WELCOME!**

Thank you VERY much to all of you! :)"

Lots of my classmates are passionate about programming and spend their free time populating their Githubs. This doesn't bring me any joy, actually one of the things that I most dislike about CS is to spend time in projects that have no purpose, I mean, if I'm going to build something I want to go until the end and have others people using it. Anyway, I don't like programming in my free time - actually I waste my time gaming or reading about voice acting - and I'm not very good at CS at all. I know my classmates are better programmers than me because they spend much more time doing it, but only thinking about programming ( == working ) in my spare time makes me tired.

Since August I've been looking for internships so I can help more at home, but the requirements are insane, almost nothing is teached in my university, which is in the top 3 of the country. Because of that I started a Data Science online course but I can't stop thinking that I shouldn't be programming, that if I'm not good at it after 3 years I should try something that brought me joy even in my free time. The thing is that it was really hard to enter this university so I can't leave it unless I graduate, so I'm a bit lost of what to do now. Yes, when I finish a program and it works it brings me joy, but I don't feel that I want to do it for the rest of my life, I'm really different of the average CS student.

Have you ever felt like this? Was CS your first option? Any advices are welcome!"

Got this intern position in one of the leading financial institutions almost a dream come true as a first internship.

Bear in mind im still in college, was my first job and never done nothing like this with no one to guide me as the only two people were extremely busy.

When the boss see's me all blank and still trying to figure out all those trillion formulas in the excell spreadsheets and stuff he asks me if i know this, i tell him i never mentioned i knew this which i made very clear in the interview. 
He tells me to go home and think about if i want to stay here (Politely ofcourse but that was the jist) 

Not complaining about the organization but i am absolutely crushed in my abilities. I soo want to be an analyst but was it fair for them to ask a person who literally has a couple hours into corporate life to begin with a fairly complicated task?

Here is the forty-ninth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I am graduating high school this year and looking to get a laptop that fits a variety of needs. The baseline intention for this laptop is to have a computer to go into college with, that can run pretty decent video editing software (as I am going to do a gap year and be doing content creation projects. Local news station internships along with documenting travel), allows me to do school work efficiently, and also has gaming capabilities. I like to play video games but also have a console so it doesn't need to be a crazy high-end gaming laptop, but I would like to be able to do things that my console couldn't do such as run skyrim with lots of fun mods or play games like warzone with my friends while they are at different schools. Thank you so much for any and all recommendations, and sorry that I do not know more about computer stuff.


Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** 

 Flexible price range tho prolly not fair over $1000. 

 

* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** 

 guess so, if they are still top quality 


* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** 

 

Performance #1, battery life, build quality in that order prolly 

 

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** 

 

Not important as long as it is semi-portable. Not like I'ma be taking it for runs, but if I have to travel with it don't want it to be a big struggle

 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 

 
Mostly don't care. 15"" seems to fit generally . You guys know better than me tho

 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 

 
I am looking to get into video editing software and would like to be able to do that at a decently high level. I also like to play video games and would like to have the ability to play most games (from rocket league, to baldurs gate, to skyrim wit hella mods)

 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 

 

-i don't need to be playing these games at the highest settings. Sorry this isn't much info, but as long as I can play AAA games like warzone at standard fps and settings then I am good

 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 

 

-good keyboard would be preferable because I will be using it to type often. Hopefully will use it for first year of college assignments.

 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** 

 

-Longevity is a factor. Prolly not a mac.

la92bu,0,2021-02-01,"Planning to move out of parental home, but do I want this for the right reasons?",Might-a_Overthunk,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/la92bu/planning_to_move_out_of_parental_home_but_do_i/,"Hello people!

I (22M) have been hungering for a place of my own for a couple months now for a variety of reasons, but I keep wondering whether I am doing it for the *right* reasons.

In short, the reasons are the following:

* Travel time.

Moving closer to my university will save me about 30 hours of travel time a month, not to mention the pretty significant travel costs. It also gives greater flexibility with homework and cooperation with colleagues, especially once my internships start.

* Personal development. 

I feel somewhat stagnant in my home life, as if I'm waiting for freedom so I can actually start building a life of my own. Part of this might have to do with me living in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere, with little opportunity to meet people and do *things*. But the fact that I *want* to encounter challenges of adult life, which I am spared now (bless my parents), is also a big reason. I believe that moving out will help me become a more well-rounded individual, through dealing with whatever problems I might face. Living at home, though comfortable and save is then a limiting factor for me, as priviliged as that might sound.

* Minor financial cost. 

This was the most significant hurdle at first, as we have always struggled with a lack of money in the past. Naturally this assigns more weight to money for both me and my parents. Staying at home is cheaper, hence I stay at home despite other possible benefits that moving out carries. I've made a spreadsheet however, laying out all the income and expenses I will face in the future with both scenarios, and comparing the costs and benefits coming from both. In the end, through the remainder of my academic career, it'll not actually be that bad moving out. The effect even more minimized if I work in the weekends. 

Luckily ol' papa study-financing (government money we get for studying) is able to cover everything and then some, though I am the first generation to have to pay it back (without interest) within 30 years. The difference will be about 12K without working on the side, which will still leave me with plenty of cash in the bank either way (34k instead of 46k if I stay at home) once I'm done with my master and start my PhD. 

* Leaving a pretty unhealthy household (in my eyes).

I won't go into the nitty-gritty, unless anyone in the comments wants elaboration, but my parents run a pretty toxic household. Both are going to a family psychologist to try and mend mostly my step-dad's problems with emotional control. He's prone to emotional outbursts, and has a severe lack of self-control. Expressing it in extreme passive-agressiveness, general lack of thinking about what he says followed by an inability to apologise and admit mistakes, as well as frequent screaming and two incidents of physicality. My mom can't control him, and is often on the brink of a breakdown. 

Both are good people, even my step dad in the background as he really does try to be better and works hard to take care of us. And my mom does what she can to take care of our emotional needs too. Trying to talk once in a while, and being open to give advice herself. But his severe lack of communicative skills, and her tendency to be a bit too decisive in her advice (as in, once she believes something it's nigh impossible to change her mind) makes it hard to deal with. My siblings feel similar about the state of the household, though are younger (18m and 19f) and haven't expressed as strong a desire to leave. So I sometimes wonder whether I'm too sensitive myself, so take this last point with a grain of salt. It's quite likely biassed. 

\[Just to be clear, I'm not asking for financial- or emotional advice with these two last points, but something to consider in the final verdict.\]

So here's the big question. What were your own triggers to leave the nest. How do you judge my situation, and/or do you have any advice on how I should approach this? Am I rushing it and should I think more about what I want, or should I move forward and propose my plan to my parents? Or potentially something different alltogether? 

Thank you all in advance!"

Or should I work again as an embedded  SDET just to keep myself in that environment and eventually try to transition to dev?"
la9v2k,10,2021-02-01,"Advice needed, reneg FBU for STEP?",Fun-Statistician-866,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/la9v2k/advice_needed_reneg_fbu_for_step/,"Hey everyone, so a couple weeks ago I got an offer for FBU. At that time I was still interviewing for STEP and told my recruiter i was going to wait and see if I get the STEP offer. 

I got sent to HC, but STEP was taking forever and my recruiter for FBU only gave me 2 weeks to accept the offer and I didn’t wanna risk not having an internship this summer, so I accepted FBU.

A couple days later I received an offer from STEP. Now here’s the problem: I want to do STEP, but I may want to work at FB in the future. Normally I wouldn’t mind which program I went to but due to my current financial situation I really need the extra cash from STEP but I’m worried reneging on FBU would prevent me from working for FB again.

So about last week FB emailed all their interns saying they’re going remote now, so they’ll issue everyone a “new offer” that we have to sign. Would declining that offer be the same as reneging? Even if I reneg, would I still be able to work at FB in the future?

Thanks for reading."

I have two FAANG offers from with one starting starting early May and ending in July and the other one Starting mid June and ending September. One team is based on the East-coast and the other is on the West-coast so this will help prevent overlap but no sure if this is possible?

I will also have another summer to intern (graduating a semester late)"

Basically, I have no idea what to say in these 10 minutes. I've been to a in person career fair in the past, but I was a sophomore, so I did not get much attention, and plus I had absolutely no clue what to say. I don't want to make the same mistake again of being unprepared again. I am a junior now, so I want to make the best impression possible and make the most out of the fair. What should I expect also, what do I gain from doing well here? Does this basically skip the resume/application process and get me an interview quicker? Or do people generally get offers here? This is for internships by the way."
laba4b,122,2021-02-01,"A Comprehensive Guide to Clubs, Awards, &amp; Activities: COVID Edition",love_and_lemons,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/laba4b/a_comprehensive_guide_to_clubs_awards_activities/,"Hey guys! I've seen some posts recently asking about clubs and activities that you can do during COVID. Here's a guide to some ECs and awards! 

**What counts as an EC/what can you include on your college application?** 

Lots of things! Clubs, internships, volunteering opportunities, jobs, family and/or religious responsibilities, and sometimes hobbies (if you've put a lot of time/effort into them). I'll go over some ideas for each.

**A Basic Guide: Clubs &amp; Activities At Your School/In Your Community**

* Due to COVID, many schools have switched to a hybrid/virtual model, so there may be some clubs or activities that are available online. This information might be in your school's course catalog or portal, but you can also ask your teachers, guidance counselor, and classmates if possible about different clubs. 
* If a club that you're interested in isn't available, you might be able to start your own after getting permission from an administrator. This, as well as holding a position in a club/student government, shows that you have leadership skills (which is important if you're applying to NHS). 
   * *Possible ideas for new clubs*: a chapter of Girls Who Code, environmental club, film club, book club, foreign language/cooking club, clubs that host fundraisers/organize opportunities for important causes (ex: breast cancer awareness). 
* Other activities (see the volunteering section below) that you do over the summer or outside of school also count towards ECs. 
* Lastly, sports can also be included as activities on your college app. 

**Additional Opportunities:** **Online Activities &amp; More**

* Look for virtual activities that intersect with your interests! If you like coding, think about participating in a [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/) or another online coding contest. If you're interested in writing, think about submitting to an online literary magazine/journal. You can find awesome lists online for all different contests/programs/organizations that you can participate in-- everything from [New York Times Student Contests](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/learning-contests) to [the MIT Think Scholars Program](https://think.mit.edu/). The Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth has a good list of [art and writing, history, science, and math competitions](https://cty.jhu.edu/resources/academic-opportunities/competitions/) that might be useful. Essay writing contests are also a good way to enter competitions.
   * However, before entering a competition or joining a new program, be sure to evaluate the authenticity of the organization first-- make sure it's a reputable or well-known group. 
   * It's also important to note that online activities open to all high schoolers in the US may be very competitive or difficult to get into. Some local activities in your area may have shifted online, so check sites like Naviance or ask people like your guidance counselors/teachers for more suggestions. For example, you often compete with people in your school community for [National History Day](https://www.nhd.org/) projects before moving up to larger scale. 

**Internships &amp; Research**

* Finding internships and research opportunities is a bit more tricky during COVID. It's important to note that you don't need do an internship or publish research with a professor to get into a good college, but it can be a very rewarding experience. 
* Johns Hopkins has another really awesome list of [research and internship opportunities](https://cty.jhu.edu/resources/academic-opportunities/internships/arts.html), but some might look a little different this year due to COVID. Again, I would also suggest asking people in your local community to see if anyone is offering any internships/programs this year. 
* As for more virtual research opportunities, there are a lot of different essay contests or research journals that you can submit to [(see lists in the virtual activities section)](https://cty.jhu.edu/resources/academic-opportunities/competitions/art_writing.html). One noteworthy group/hidden gem is the [Concord Review](https://tcr.org/), where you can potentially have a history paper that you've written published. 

**Volunteering**

* Again, first look for opportunities in your local community. Maybe your school's student council is organizing a trash pickup day that you can help with, a soup kitchen is looking for helpers, or a political organization is asking for volunteers for a phone bank. There are so many different activities (both virtual and socially-distanced) that can count towards a volunteering credit.
* If a club/organization in your community isn't hosting an event (ex: blood drive) or looking for volunteers, you can always organize your own (bonus points for leadership credit). If your school is hybrid, you could hold a food/books/toiletries/clothing drive and ask people to leave donations in a box near the front office. Boxes could also be left at other places in the community if you get permission (ex: town hall, library, post office). 
   * *Other simple, low-contact ideas:* make thank you or holiday cards for people in nursing homes/members of the military/essential workers, sew masks, donate medical supplies, etc.
* You also might be able to find some virtual volunteer opportunities. My favorite (and another hidden gem) is volunteering as a [transcriber for documents in the Library of Congress' collection](https://crowd.loc.gov/).  It's super cool!

**Jobs**

* This one is a little self-explanatory. If you've been working during the pandemic (including doing babysitting or tutoring jobs), you can also include these as activities on your college app. 

**Family/Other Responsibilities**

* A lot of different things can count as family responsibilities. Maybe you cook meals for your younger siblings, help them attend online school while your parents are at work, or take care of sick family members. These are all things that you can include on your college app or a section documenting your experience with COVID. 

**Hobbies**

* Think about any activities that you love or that you've picked up in quarantine. What activities have you done pre-pandemic that you've continued to work on (ex: coding projects)? Have you learned to love any new activities like baking bread or making origami in your free time? 
* All of the answers to these questions work really well not only as examples of hobbies, but also as examples of passion projects that you've done during quarantine. When I did my interviews, almost all of my interviewers asked me questions like what I did over the summer/the quarantine period. It's ok not to be productive all the time, but it's a good idea to share with them some new activities that you learned about or projects that you continued to work on. 

Hopefully, this gave you some suggestions about ECs and awards that you can look into, and explained what types of activities that you can include on your college application. Hope this helped!"

I'm still waiting to hear back from many other companies. I have a little over a week to accept the offer at Principal. I don't want to turn it down and end up without any better offers, so I am considering accepting the offer and reneging if a much better one comes along. Any thoughts on my situation?"

lae8dl,1,2021-02-01,Why is it so hard to be productive and self-improve during these hard times?,IncognitoGirl101,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/lae8dl/why_is_it_so_hard_to_be_productive_and/," The pandemic has brought previous difficulties to resurface. Past anxiety habits that were finally in the progress of improvement, have been creeping back onto me but even harder than before. Panic attacks occur more frequently and sudden changes of mood, one cannot control. The last virtual academic school semester had ended on a good note. An internship opportunity was awarded because of it and a lot of self-improvement had been made. But why is it when something good happens, a bad thing occurs? These past weeks have been hell… A family member passed away and one other uncle was/in critical condition in need of immediate surgery. They had like 3 heart attacks alone in the hospital and it felt like he constantly needed surgery. Then what felt out of nowhere, another uncle and aunt were in the hospital because of other health reasons. Mom was emotionally unstable and the emotional baggage that I carried was at its breaking point. It’s always manageable but it felt like lightning strikes were aiming more than once in the same target. Found a way to get a therapist but my concealed past traumas were suddenly appearing along with what was currently happening. Academically, things are getting worse. Internship wise, things are not getting accomplished. Friendships are declining. Overall, this pandemic has brought many obstacles but I know everything has its reason. It’s just a lot for an individual to take. I always look for ways to self-improve and am always that person that is positive for others, but positivity is a rare thing these couple of weeks. Usually helping others is a way I deal with healing but now it just feels like I’m adding to it. Life is hard right now.  I know some people have it harder than others, I wish for them to have a better time than they are having right now because difficulties are a big kick in the butt."
laehl6,1,2021-02-01,I am not really interested in a professional career and would like to live an alternative lifestyle,danielzzzen,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/laehl6/i_am_not_really_interested_in_a_professional/,"I am 26m, and I don't have a great interest in being professionally succesful in the standard way it is usually understood. I guess I am writing this here because I feel like I don't know any like-minded people I can share this with. 

Actually, I was quite ambitious in the past. I wanted to work in Finance because ""that's where the money's at"". So I studied Business and so on, but when I did my first Internship in a Finance company, I absolutely hated it and changed my mind completely. I wondered why the heck I would want to work so many long hours, dress in an uncomfortable suit and basically dedicate my life to a job that I don't care about just to make my money account grow, while I am wasting my life.

I obviously changed my career path, and now I am working in Tourism, in an international hotel chain that is headquartered in my hometown (I live in an island in Spain). I have done a 2-year Training Program in the company, in order to work in sales strategy. I actually don't dislike the job. What I mean, is that the hours are OK, the job is not too stressful, as in I don't think about my job when I am not at my desk, and colleagues are OK too. But still, it is a job and I don't really look forward to Mondays.
The real reason why I decided to work in Tourism, is because I saw it as a possible way to fulfill my dream of living in different places in the world (tropical if possible haha), while using my Business Degree and fitting into the standard of a 'normal life'. 

After my experience in Finance, I was a bit depressed because I lost  my sense of identity. I always thought I wanted to be succesful and make a lot of money, but it turned out I really don't care about it. What I really care about is living close to the ocean (I love surfing and diving) and having good times with my friends. I am not naive though, I know that money is necessary to live, which takes me to my next point: My life plan.

I conceive 'working a standard job' as something temporary until I can get to live the life I really want. My plan is to work my current job for a couple years (maybe 5-10 more years) while living in Latin America and maybe Southeast Asia too, until I don't need to anymore, and just work as a surf/dive instructor, or maybe have a little bar/restaurant, or organizing tours for tourists. Something that gets you some money and is more enjoyable than an office job where you have to meet the standards and be competent and competitive. Luckily, I will inherit some real estate in my home country, so I figured I will be able to rent that out and get some additional rent to live comfortably in a cheaper country. And by comfortably I don't mean a 4-bedroom house and a nice car. I just would like to settle in a beachy place, with year-round Summer weather and tourists looking to have a good time (and spend their money haha). I don't care if my house is not big, or if I don't have a big financial cushion, as long as I can make ends meet without worry and enjoy my time, or most of it at least.

Honestly I think this plan is quite feasible and fun, but whenever I share it with friends or relatives, they think it's not a good idea to leave a good career path just to live the way I described to you. I feel like an alien sometimes, but still I am 100% determined and I am quite sure that this is what I want. 

Just to end this (very) long post, my company will send me to the Dominican Republic in 6 months, so I am incredibly happy about that as it is the first step in my plan.
I would love to hear your comments, inputs, opinions,... whatever really."

I spent the majority of the fall term grinding bs like leetcode/hackerrank while at the same time disregarding my physical/mental health, relationships, and overall wellbeing.

laf71u,10,2021-02-01,How do you decide if graduate school is worth it?,lasagnal0rd,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/laf71u/how_do_you_decide_if_graduate_school_is_worth_it/,"How can I decide if grad school is worth it for me? 

I’m an ME about to graduate with my bachelors this spring. I’ve been bouncing around the idea of going to graduate school, mostly for the advantages of salary, as well as specialization/graduate research. Most of the research I’ve done so far has been in Aerospace sectors, and I wanted to get my masters in Aero. 

I don’t really have internship experience, just two decent school/company funded projects.


Edit: Additional points that brought up more from my perspective:

- It may be better to wait until I’ve solidified industry experience, but there’s the problem of not having the time to go back later when I have time now.

- What I’m looking for is to mostly solidify a specialty within the aero industry. Deciding what the best path is between learning on the job or getting more experience while in graduate school while also earning the degree.

- I’m lucky enough that my parents support me through school, I graduated fast, I pay for my own education while working part-time: I could get grants, honestly I don’t know too much about what that’s like in higher education.

- A point has been made that it’s almost a (soft) requirement, which I kind of agree with. I have a decent GPA, great drive and good skillset, i have the ambition i just don’t have the right tools at my disposal. But with a ton of undergrads earning their degree in this job market.. i wouldn’t say the odds are looking fantastic.."

lai3lp,1,2021-02-01,X friend living off my dad,One-Mission-1345,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lai3lp/x_friend_living_off_my_dad/,"Too long, didn't read: MY dad has codependency issues that my used to be friend Austin keeps taking advantage of, he has bee sob story-ing my dad out of 2,000 to 2,500 a month every month for the better part of a decade now. I consider this a treacherous betrayal, he considers it fine and none of my business. What you guys think in a situation like this? Do you think its okay to ask your friends parents (that you only know through them) for significant amounts of money (basically living off of him) for years? Is there anything to be done?

My dad admits he has a codependency issue. My used to be friend, Austin, keeps taking advantage of that. Hes has gotten my dad to pay for cars for him. He basically gets a couple of hundred dollars of couple of days from my dad, adding up to around 2,000 to 2,500 dollars conservatively each month. My dad does this to ""help"" him, Austin gives him sob stories and basically has him continually believe that if he doesn't give him money, then he will be screwed/starve/be homeless. Austin is in his early 30s. He has bragged about how much money he can get from him, he offered to put thousands of dollars away for me, that he got from him. Austin got his other friend to lend him (over time) over 30,00 dollars. He used to call me a chump and characterize my dad and me as being easy to take advantage of, and he said he was proud of me when I finally refused to give him money.

The problem is I made the mistake of connecting him with my dad and even though I learned my dad hasn't, and now its a nightmare that never ends, this has gone on for the better part of a decade now (causing major problems with my parents marriage too and making my mom feel insecure and not trust my dad anymore, she had to separate her account from his, and so did my sister, because my dad kept taking money out of their accounts to give away)

I decided to go back to school to get a degree in Computer Science because my dad said he would help me so I wouldn't have to take out loans but that also means I'm dependent on him completely until I get an internship or coop, and even after that, basically until I get a professional software job (its not the kind of major you can just be working unrelated jobs with)

Austin's point of view is that once you are friends with someone it doesn't matter how you met them, they have their own relationship now and that there is nothing wrong with him getting so much money from my dad. I feel like this is the worst betrayal of my life, because I didn't have to connect him with my dad, they probably would never have met otherwise, and obviously there is no way I would have connected them if I knew he would do this. I trusted him (as my best friend at the time) to not try and screw me over and this is the worst possible way he could. First of all just because he taking advantage of my elderly dad's codependency issues and issues with enforcing boundaries. My dad has told him he doesn't want to keep giving him money multiple times but Austin just persists until my dad relents. Also this is really messed up because i'm dependent on my dad rn, I in college not getting paid while Austin isn't in school he just lives off my dad. So he entered into a zero sum game with me in terms of my finances, I feel like that's the worst possible result of being friends with someone. Also if I were to get an inheritance Austin would be draining money from that. I know that sounds entitled, a lot of people are getting anything or any help, and it would be fine if my parents gave away all their money to good causes and not to me, but its messed up my used to be friend that only knows them from me is getting that.

What is your guy's opinions and is there anything I can do to combat this and protect my family? Obviously I know there's not a lot I can do and not to waste too much time focusing on something i probably can't change. How would any of you feel in a situation like this? Do you think that is an okay thing for someone to do? Would you still trust someone like this or would you assume they would try to screw you over and not want to deal with some that did this? I might send him the link to this.

If this isn't the right place for this post and there's a better place someone can direct me too I can put it there instead."
lai664,6,2021-02-01,Remote Internship Location,mbathrowuga,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/lai664/remote_internship_location/,"I just received an offer for a pre-MBA internship in the function I'm interested in recruiting for at a startup in the northeast. When the recruiter was walking me through the details, they mentioned that I'd have to be located in their state in order for them to hire me since they aren't legally registered to hire employees in my current state. When I asked if I'd need to physically be located there the entire summer (I'll be working remotely), or if I just needed to have a mailing address there, they said that ""you can take 'working vacations' where you go back home for a few weeks at a time but you need to plan on coming back at points in order to be considered to be officially be working in our state.""

So, for those of you that were in the same situation last summer, was this a ""wink wink nudge nudge"" sign from them basically saying that they won't check on my location? I know it certainly varies from company to company, but I couldn't tell their intent, and wanted to see if I'd be able to get away with staying where I'm currently located (a few states away). I don't exactly want to give up on this opportunity, but I'm also not very interested in paying for a place for three months when my income will be dramatically reduced from what it is now and when I'll still be paying for my current apartment. I have a good friend that lives in the state who said I can put down his address, but he told me that he can't commit to telling me I can be there all summer, since he lives in a studio apartment. Just wanted to see if anyone has been in this situation before and if you had any insight, thanks!"

My GPA took a hit because I slept through an exam and got a terrible grade for the class. It's a 2.93 now. I put my GPA out of my resume as it is already listed in my school's career connection website and I was advised not to put my GPA on my resume unless it's above a 3.0.

I was the president of a student organization for 2 years, worked as a secretary (seasonal), and was a server at a restaurant a while ago.

I have leadership experience, great communication skills, problem solving skills, a knack for teamwork and multi tasking abilities. I am also proficient in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

I'm hoping this sets me apart from other applicants with a higher GPA.

How likely is it that I'll get an internship? My school has a whole website dedicated to getting students at the business school connections to employers looking for internships and full time jobs.

I meet the GPA requirements for many internship opportunities but I fear that my lackluster GPA will hold me back despite all the other experience I have.

I also wrote a pretty well written cover letter/personal statement so I'm hoping that gets me far.

lajb1m,21,2021-02-01,Distraught after a meeting today with my manager about my performance,umnowwhatdoido,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lajb1m/distraught_after_a_meeting_today_with_my_manager/,"For some background, I am a woman who recently turned 25, I’ve been working as a SWE for a little over two years now. I started at my current company as an intern during my last year of college, then I got a full time offer in fall 2018 when I finished school, and I’ve been working there since. I would say that up until the start of the pandemic, I was one of the “main players” of the team who was always very involved in the work we did, and looking back, I could sense that overall I was seen as very bright and reliable, and that my contributions were valued. Even during our past one-on-ones and performance reviews, my only “critiques” were that I lacked confidence, and that I shouldn’t because they could see how I was more bright and capable than I gave myself credit for (though I do wonder if it was because I was this scared 22-24 year old so I had more “leeway”, but idk...). But I even got a promotion and pay raise a little before the pandemic (this was when things were shutting down left and right and there were only less than 100 cases in the US). 

After the pandemic started however, I feel like my work performance has started slipping a lot. Like my attendance at morning meetings became more sporadic (like at times it’s been hard to get out of bed for me to even log in for those meetings unless absolutely necessary...afternoon meetings are alright though), it takes me much longer to finish tasks that I’d usually be able to finish in a shorter amount of time, my morale has become really low and I don’t really feel like I just don’t care as much anymore, and I find that it’s just harder for me in general to simply...focus, and that I get distracted or irritated by other stupid non-work stuff to the point that work just falls to the wayside for me. :/ There have even been a few incidents even before that pandemic that made me start to feel...unhappy with my job, but I wouldn’t say those things affected my performance at the time at all. But anyway, I know that it’s all my fault that all this happened, but I just wanted to provide some context. I do wanna mention though, that I have still always managed to meet my deadlines during this time. 

Well my manager ended up scheduling a quick phone call with me today, where he mentioned that he noticed a pretty noticeable drop in my contributions and performance since Spring 2020, and that honestly...he’s very concerned. He also brought up how a couple of my colleagues and even my team lead has also mentioned a few things recently that ultimately boil down to how I’m just...not as reliable as I used to be. Tbh, I was not surprised at all, but I still felt really bad. I wasn’t really even sure what to even say during the phone call itself and began stumbling around for words, and at times my mind even went blank during the conversation. 

But I mention how I wasn’t surprised at all because I noticed that unless it’s for smaller or more boring or menial tasks, my teammates haven’t been giving me much to do lately, despite me constantly approaching them and offering to help take on some more tasks, which now makes sense when I hear that they find me “not as reliable anymore”. 

Anyway, at the end of the phone call, I asked something like, “How do we proceed from here?” (Idk if that was the right way to go about it...but like I said I really didn’t know what to say, and I didn’t wanna say more that could get me in trouble, so to speak). My manager mentioned that well, this can go two ways, one being that I really step up and get back on track from here on out by improving, or I continue the path I’ve been going down and they end up having to write a PIP (yeah...when he mentioned that I just about fainted). With the latter, he added that it’s something he reallyyyyy does not want to do, and he even emphasized a couple of times how this phone call is simply just a phone call, or a “wake up call”, if you will. 

So...now what? I get the impression that because he had to remind me a couple of times that “this is just a phone call/wake up call” he’s trying to reassure me that there is no paperwork in motion atm. But at the same time, he also asked me to send him an “email” for a plan moving forward, that he asked if he could also forward this to my team lead (which I don’t mind actually since I was very close with my team lead anyway) scare me. Cuz like, if this was truly an “off-the-record phone call”, should I still be worried when he asked me to write up an email to send to him? What do I do now? What should I make of my situation? I feel...bad to say that least."

I'm currently a student in my junior year, and I've been getting take-home projects for internships lately for the interview process. A lot of these are front-end based and have huge requirements (build a fully functioning website with many features).

A lot of these projects are React + large amount of CSS. Honestly, I've just been doing React to be more competitive in the job market.

With all this being said, my skills are much stronger when it comes to DevOps and Back end web development. Does anybody have advice on getting junior level backend dev jobs/internships? It feels hard to show your skills through projects, as i doubt employers really read through my github.

I’m used to a semester system but coming back as a mature-aged student after a few years in the workforce.

People are also saying that people usually take T3 off to do summer internships, is that right? I know it’s a little early for me to think about all of this but seeing as some of the subjects I plan to take in T3 are pre-requisites for next year’s subjects, if I don’t take them then I will definitely be extending my degree by at least a year. But I also do want to prioritising gaining industry experience during my time at uni.

Mind you I am also balancing full-time uni and part-time work so seeing as this is the case, it looks like I’ll have to inevitably stay in uni for longer than the minimum four years it takes to finish the degree.

What is everyone’s personal experiences with juggling a full-time study load via the trimester system, whilst balancing work +/- extracurriculars? What would you suggest in order to maintain my sanity? Please share some light and tips for a hopeful yet nervous first year comms/compsci student. Thank you!"

I changed my project 3 months back and since then I'm working with a new team. Everything was alright in the previous team but in the new team it seems that I am a liability. Some days it feels like I am being paid to be unproductive because I barely get anything done. There are technical jargons and our application's acronyms discussed in the meetings and when I ask my seniors they just tell me to refer to the documentation. It feels working from home in a new project is really a challenge with so many limitations.

I did talk to the manager and they said it gets better over time but things were much easier in the previous project despite me being just a new grad then. I see a huge gap in my learning and have also considered going back to school and getting a masters degree in Fall 2021. Everyday when I log in on my computer I fear that I might either be PIP'ed or laid off. I have even considered to go to my manager and ask him to lay me off because I haven't provided any real value to the team yet. Which is why I have also started looking at internship opportunity for 3 months before starting my masters in Fall.

I'm sorry I did not know whom to share this with so just posting here. If anyone has been in this situation before how did you deal with it?

International with sales/marketing experience looking to pivot to product marketing. Thank you for your inputs as always.

  
1. Ross (slightly less $ than UCLA and Tuck)   
\- Great community vibes  
\- 27% of the class go into WC  
\- MAP offers a great way to pivot into tech  
\- Better recognised in home country  
\- If tech fails, could consider some other roles since they've a good presence in GM and other sectors  
\- College town vibes  
\- Cons: Lower $ than Tuck of about 30k, weather, largest class size of the 3, weather

2. UCLA Anderson ($$)  
\- Location  
\- Tech recruiting   
\- Class size (360)  
\- Good vibes from the community overall  
\- Cons: If tech PMM fails, I may not have a great fallback option, a lot of the class going into tech comes with a tech background, one tier below Tuck/Ross 

3. Tuck($$)  
\- Had almost matriculated last year but pushed plans, so quitethe  familiar with the school  
\- Strong alumni network  
\- Class size (289)  
\- Tech is possibly sought lower than Consulting and IB, so higher chances maybe?

But on top of this, my manager wants myself and the other junior to give her each an additional hour of meetings to go through the components in more depth. The part that annoys me is that my manager wants myself and the other junior to have additional meetings after this to quiz and challenge her.  

I'm totally okay with helping her out and answering any questions but all these extra meetings sound so excessive.

And the amount of support I get from people at the company is amazing and the intern overall has impacted me in a very positive way. From literally shaking taking phone calls, now I’m (sort of) comfortable talking about my plans for the day at the daily stand up meeting which is done in about groups of 15. 

With this good momentum I had, I decided to join the toastmasters and to my surprise, although public speaking being my biggest fear, I was doing alright in all of the sessions I went to. Some impromptu speech I mess up but they are not complete mess up where I just stayed in complete silent. I was getting very confident about myself. And at my intern, they asked if I wanted to present at the event where there will be about 300 people coming in to listen, I was bit hesitant considering how big the event was but I said yes. 

On the day, thanks to the toast masters I walked to the front confidently and I started off really good. I was nervous but it wasn’t a bad nervousness. But midway through, I noticed some concerned/confused faces from the audience. I think I skipped small few things by accident which caused it. And from there I just don’t remember any of the things I said. I just panicked. I started speaking really fast, skipped stuff and stuttered like crazy. It led to even more confusion which made me panic even more and I was just stuck in a horrible loop. 

After the presentation, people gave me some nice comments but I could tell that they were just being nice and weren’t too impressed at all. After that I just went home and cried like I have not before. All the confidence I built up to that point, turned in to ashes. It was the shittest feeling ever. 

Sorry for that long ass story but do you guys think that presentation skill is a must have skill to be a successful engineer? And even if I keep failing, will I get better at public speaking eventually? I just don’t want to feel the same pain I went through for nothing. My confidence level went back to 0 and if this keeps happening it feels so pointless. I would appreciate any advice :)"

Naturally, as I'm sure many upper years have done the same, I thought to myself: if I redid undergrad, what would I have done differently. Not sure if this warrants a thread, but I feel like I should write my thoughts down on a semi-anon platform.

The first thing thought that crawled in my head was, I should have taken 4 courses a semester. Now in my case, I took 5 and a half years to complete undergrad, including 2 summers essentially wasted, and 24 months of internships. If you do that math, that is 7 semesters of school. That was a terrible idea. My grades aren't bad but they aren't great so grad school seems difficult. Plus I didn't really retain anything. It was just figure out how to ace tests for x course and then forget all about it after the final. I don't know how well 4/sem would have worked for my grades, but I know I would be able to enjoy my courses more.

Next thing program choices. I like my program choices. But when I was applying for programs, I tunneled way too hard. There are some many interesting programs at uoft that I didn't even bother looking up. Kinda wish I did something like anthro instead of stats.

PEY: I regret it. While my 16 month internship was really fun, and I learned a shit ton, setting me up for following internships, it was too long. 16 months is good for engineers. For cs students, 8 months imo is ideal. 4 months can be too short to work on anything meaningful. Anything longer than 8, there are diminishing returns (CS internships only). The goal of an internship imo is to learn about a particular role and industry. So I wish I diversified more. Not to mention, it's a struggle to go back to school after 2 years (don't do back to back internships lol). Ideally, do 2 four month internships, then one 8 month in a software role with a mid sized startup. Academic semesters in between.

Last but the most important: I wish I made more friends. I don't know how (even after 6 years) but I wish I had more long term friends. I wish I was as confident in my first couple of years as I am now. Bygones I guess.

I'll add more as I keep pondering my life choices throughout the day.


Edit: Another one I thought of: I wish I did the ""specialist"" courses. For those that don't know, for math and stats (and cs in two instances), there are different versions of the same courses. Sort of. For example, first year calc has mat135/136, 137 and 157. Mat135/137 is the least involved, 137 has a bit more proofs and abstract concepts, 157 is straight up murder apparently. I did 137 and then dropped to 235 in second year. I was scared I would get a bad grade. I did better, but once I got to the 3rd years stats courses I realized how far behind I was. I didn't have the right ""mathematical maturity"" as one might say. To be honest, it could also be that once I took the more computational course, I lost the drive to do better with abstract concepts. Similar thing happened for stats: 257 -&gt; 248."

## **The grind -**

I was doing an internship with Intel, Ireland and it was about to complete in December 2020. I already had a good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) but I was out of daily practice. I started the daily grind on LeetCode(LC) in early July.

With an everyday job in mind, I never really got to do a lot. 2 problems/day with a quick revision of each associated DSA topic from GeeksForGeeks. (Maxing out to 5 problems/day over the weekends)

By September 15th, I had a good practice on BFS, DFS, Backtracking, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps, Strings, Stacks, and Queues. I took one more week to get good hands-on over basic Dynamic Programming problems and some advanced data structures like Tries.

## **Interviewing phase -**

I started my interview season by bombing the first interview with ByteDance. (Well, to be honest, it was until date one of the toughest code-pair rounds I have been through). I knew I had to improve so I started practicing random problems just to be in sync with my understanding of DSA.

*[I appeared for many interviews but I would like to share my experiences with a few big ones here]*

After a few initial interviews at firms like Amazon, Microsoft, Workday, LinkedIn; I realized that I was doing good at code pair interviews. So I pivoted my focus from DSA to core Software Engineering. Alongside being in sync with DSA, I started learning more about Backend engineering, System Design, Database design, Distributed Systems, and Networking.

I had the next rounds of interviews scheduled for all the aforementioned companies in mid-October.

**LinkedIn**:= Couldn’t clear their second interview round.

**Microsoft**:= Cleared their 45 minutes of interview round but the process got delayed because of Covid. (Heard back from the HR before a week for scheduling the next round)

**Amazon**:= Cleared their 3-hour interview rounds(LP’s + HR + Coding) and they had a final round scheduled for next week. I cleared the final round as well and I received an email from Amazon HR that I have been selected for the role. After 20 days, I received another email saying they have canceled the role right now because of Covid.

**Workday**:= It took them almost a month to get back to me. And they said I have cleared their interview process. We had a salary discussion round and I said I’m happy with what they are offering. In mid-November, HR contacted back saying that they found somebody else with more years of experience and they will be retracting my offer.

**Apple**:=

I had applied in mid-August and I received an email to schedule the initial phone screen in the month of November. I was already halfway through my preparation with 2 retracted offers.

After the initial call, I had a coding test on Hackerrank for 90 minutes.
 3 questions all of which were variations of standard LC style questions. [2 medium, 1 easy]. I passed all the test-cases and was waiting for my next round.

The next rounds at Apple were all phone screens.

**1st Round =&gt; (120 minutes)**

* Data Structures and Algorithms — Analyze time complexities for different stub codes, whiteboard algorithms for 0/1 knapsack and fractional knapsack, explain tail-recursive call in depth.

* Lots of C++(runtime polymorphism[vtable and vptr in-depth], volatile, threading, STL implementations [list vs vector, unordered_maps vs maps], garbage collection, move semantics, unique_ptr, pointers, references)

* Operating Systems(virtual memory, segmentation, page faults, caching[L1 vs L2 vs L3], memory management algorithms)

* Web development &amp; JS(Async calls, what is hoisting in regards to JS keywords, alternatives to REST API’s, couple of questions on NodeJS event loop internals, what is event-driven architecture, sessions vs cookies vs JWT in regards to security, basic cipher questions)

**2nd Round =&gt; (120 minutes)**

* Walkthrough on the CV and my experience. Questions about my speaking engagements at different PyCon’s(Python Conferences globally)

* Lots of Python interview questions. A few questions tailored to my understanding of Python features and their internal implementations like (GIL, Asyncio, Multithreading, Subinterpreters). [PS — I had done a lot of research on core C code that powers Python which helped me get through these questions]

* Brief System design question — Design a rate limiter. [The interview wasn’t interested in knowing much in-depth. He had given me a situation and I had to fabricate the rate limiter according to conditions.]

* Many questions on Pub-sub architectures, Microservices, Kafka &amp; Redis caching because I had an experience working with them.

* Few questions on Load balancers &amp; Reverse proxies. Also continuing discussion on Nginx and Varnish.

* HTTP 2 vs HTTP 1.1 and major changes.

* Two brief questions on testing my design patterns knowledge. (On what design patterns are chat applications like WhatsApp and Telegram based. Explain factory vs abstract factory design pattern in regards to the real-world applications?)

**3rd Round =&gt; (45 minutes)**

* Why Apple

* Mainly behavioral round with standard STAR technique questions.

I received a call from a recruiter on 18th December 2020 that I have been selected for the role but the offer letter will take time because of Christmas. Looking at the way companies have retracted offers in the past, I wasn’t too excited until 7th January 2021 when my recruiter called me again and said **“Welcome to Apple!**”.

**Final thoughts**

 1. Interviews are not just about LeetCode and Data Structures. They test your core Software Engineering skills. Learn about them instead of just focusing on LC grinding.

 2. Give yourself 6 months and you will sail through the SE interviews at most of the companies. (The interview system is completely broken!)

 3. Don’t prepare for company-specific questions or mugging up solutions to the questions. You will fail most of your interviews by doing that.

 4. Selection email for a role/offer letter is not equal to **job confirmation** [I have had terrible experiences in the last few months]

 5. Relax, go out for a walk, cook something, take a break for a day or two. Divert your mind for some time. You need hours out of work to concentrate well on your work.

 6. Be confident and most important be yourself. Express what you know and **say a no to that you don’t.**

laz7ml,1,2021-02-02,Stuck in customer service and call center jobs and I desperately want to get out.,TheAvengingKnee,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/laz7ml/stuck_in_customer_service_and_call_center_jobs/,"I have spent the majority of my work history in customer service and I feel trapped, it seems like there is a hard cap on what I can make an hour in customer service and I just don't seem to have the skills want to move to another field. The last 6 years or so have also been call center work and I hate that as well. I love working on computers and even with the customer service interaction needed for a help desk job I would enjoy that more than call center work. I do not have a degree which unfortunately takes many decent paying jobs off the table, and I cannot afford to go back to school. 

If anyone has ideas of what jobs I might not realize I could be qualified for or that might be a good fit I would appreciate suggestions. Below I have included a brief description of my work history starting with the most recent work history. 

2 Years - Support and training - Taking calls to help customers fix errors with an app and website and running training sessions for individuals or groups online and over the phone. 

4 years - Dispatch Technical support - Mostly setting up field technician schedules for the day and troubleshooting issues for them over the phone. 

1 Year - Phone Banker - Answering questions and assisting with day to day banking transactions over the phone. 

2 years - Gas Station Employee

7 years - Electronics specialist in a retail store

I also did a semester long internship at a help desk."
lazn7s,213,2021-02-02,Some takeaways on recruiting as a 1Y student,maxwon,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/lazn7s/some_takeaways_on_recruiting_as_a_1y_student/,"1. **It's becoming increasingly harder to pivot into a new industry with an MBA.** Companies these days are looking for students who can hit the ground running. For example, a lot of ppl on this sub want to join tech post-MBA, but ppl around me this year haven't had much luck so far. Even interviews were hard to come by, unless you're applying to supply chain or finance jobs in tech (i.e. not real tech). Same stories happened with folks that I know recruiting for healthcare -- outsiders were rejected. Exceptions to this takeaway include consulting, banking, and veteran recruiting.
2. **""XXX or bust"" is extremely risky,** especially this year. You will hear success stories, but don't forget about survivor bias. We never know how many students each firm is hiring in any given year. Sometimes, even the firms don't know until the very last minute. For example, this year, MBBs all became more selective during their interview process with overwhelming cases. I know many good casers who didn't get MBB offers because their cases were surprisingly hard. BCG at some schools even replaced first round interviews with an AI chatbot. This is completely out of our control, so plan Bs are always a good idea, because anyone could get unlucky and get rejected for a well-deserved job.
3. **Figure out the pay and hours early on.** I spent 80% of my time in the fall recruiting for MBB, only to realize in January that MBB on average works 14 hours daily. I also realized I January that another job high on my list  pays less than my pre-MBA job (granted, they give a lot of stocks). Do your homework beforehand to save time on networking.
4. **Networking at MBB adds value only before interview invites are out.** After your interview invite, their hiring decisions are solely based on your interview performance. So, there's no need to waste time Nov-Jan networking with them. I did many mock interviews with MBBers and the feedback was extremely positive, but nobody put in a good word for me (nor were they allowed to) during my official interviews. Smaller consulting firms function differently on this.
5. **Big tech** **~~simply~~** **isn't hiring** **much** **for PM positions (or any interesting tech job) from MBA.** When I looked at Google and Apple MBA intern postings, PM simply wasn't listed. (Edit: at Apple, it's there, called ""product marketing""). Amazon hires ""PM"", but most end up doing e-commerce category management work. FB was almost exclusive hiring for supply chain managers. Then, whenever a true PM posting comes around (say, from Adobe), thousands of students like you and me apply. You will find success stories here and there, but those people likely were extremely focused on tech recruiting, had prior PM experiences, and were lucky. Are you willing to take on that much risk?
6. **There aren't perfect jobs -- high paying jobs always have a trade-off.** The more lucrative it is, the longer hours are. On the top of the pyramid is IB, then MBB, then smaller consulting firms, then LDPs. Hours strictly become lower down that line. There are many jobs that pay 20% less where you work 20%-30% less. So, at the end of the day, it comes down to your work style, health condition, family, and your need for brand recognition on your resume.
7. **On the other hand, there are bad jobs.** Some companies simply have awful culture or underpay. So it's worth it to do your research before you fill in that tedious application form and network with recruiters.
8. **Open your mind.** I know our MBA applications required us to pick one post-MBA career path, but the opportunities out there are truly endless. Our dream employers might not want us, and vice versa. Keep an open mind and talk to your peers so you understand what opportunities out there fit you.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
lb0fgz,465,2021-02-02,I’m a senior graduating in May. Nothing anyone says makes me feel better.,sunny5585,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/lb0fgz/im_a_senior_graduating_in_may_nothing_anyone_says/,"Edit: to all the people who are downvoting this - I hope you 1) read through the whole post before judging, i guarantee you have friends going through what i am but feel like they’ll be shamed for saying it and 2) have a good week ahead :) 

Edit 2: Thanks to all the people who relate or expressed sympathy. This was just a way to get things off my chest to people who could relate. It seems like some think I don’t care about COVID, or I’m ungrateful, or I could’ve taken the year off and it’s my fault I didn’t, etc. All of these assumptions are untrue. I’m excited for my future,  I am thankful for so much, and I almost never, ever complain. Today, I complained. I felt really alone and frustrated. I’m sure in a few weeks I’ll be my happy chipper self again. 

As the title says, I’m bitter and can’t do anything to change it. I’m aware we’re facing much bigger problems in this world than class of 2021 not having a senior year but comparing the two doesn’t make it suck any less. 

I am tired of being told by friends, family, and mentors who have all experienced senior year that I’m part of a “pioneering generation” who will turn this difficult experience into something great (and yes, I’m including the people who graduated in 2020. Y’all got most of your senior year and many of you still went on spring break so... kindly stfu. I don’t feel bad for you.).

Newsflash: I don’t want to be a pioneer. I don’t want to learn anything from this experience and turn it into lemonade. I finally felt like I had a place on campus, a friend group, a network, a routine. I finally felt like a college student. I worked so hard the first 2 years just to reap the benefits of the last 2 years - being 21+ years old, taking lighter credit loads, having my own money from internships to do whatever, etc. I was going to experience living in the city with my friends last summer. I was going to travel with my friends, make memories, have some crazy moments to look back on. 

But instead every day feels the fucking same. I wake up, I open my laptop, I barely pay attention in class, scroll my phone for hours, workout in my basement, and rewatch something on Netflix. Every single day, for the past 300 days. I have friends but most of them are scattered across the state and the others who are on campus are too risky to visit because I have a sick parent. I’m so disconnected from college, it’s like I’m not even a student anymore and this degree doesn’t even matter because we all know how much we’re finessing this shit. Contrary to what this post might say, I have been incredibly strong these past 10 months, telling myself to stay positive, stay connected, stay focused on the good things. I’ve comforted my friends and myself at the same time. But I’m exhausted. 

I thought we could AT LEAST have some kind of in person graduation but we won’t. No Club Alex, no last breakfast at Brower, no Senior Days, nothing. There is nothing that is going to make it feel like... the end. And all these people who are trying to comfort me (I know they have good intentions I’m not an asshole) make it even worse because they had the time of their lives in college. I felt like I was only just getting started. I have 4 months left and nothing to be excited about. Is it so bad that I just want to feel like a senior? To have the stereotypical, spontaneous senior year that I envisioned for myself and my friends, that I looked forward to my whole life? Is it so bad to want confirmation that I busted my ass these past 4 years for good reason? Is it so bad to feel bad for myself? Why does it feel like no one gives a fuck about us? 

Alright. If you read this, thanks I really do appreciate it. I promise I’m not the Grinch. If you’re also a senior and feel like this, sending you a big fat hug cuz this shit sucks."

I have been looking for summer internships(off campus) for a while now. I have applied to over 50+ postings from mid to top product / fintech companies without any success. Out of all my applications I only got 1 OA, in which I did well but it still didn't convert to interviews. I have been grinding leetcode, I have made decent projects, contributed to open source, maintained high gpa, optimized linkedin profile, tried getting referrals, interned at 2 startups before and interning at one right now. Good companies rarely come to our college for placements let alone internships. I'm not salty about people with better on campus opportunities or even diversity hiring, I'm happy for the people who made it and I'm just hanging in there waiting for that first opportunity. Most of the students from my college pursue higher education abroad and before I decide between MS and full time job, I wanted to intern at a mid-top product based company to know what it feels like working on a large code base, collaborating with a lot of people, the work culture, etc.

Sorry if it felt like a rant, I'm just lost and need some advice on what should I do to increase my chances of success. The upcoming summer is really crucial for me and my current situation is beyond depressing (ps: nothing suicidal, depression is just a gen-z lifestyle)"

Need some advice.,kindlystfuu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lb3hq6/what_if_i_dont_get_an_internship_this_summer_need/,"Hey everyone, I’m not sure if this has already been posted but here I go. 

I’m a junior in college studying at a state university and I am a part of r/csmajors. Even though the information can be helpful sometimes, it has made me stressed and worried about a few things.

Before I joined the subreddit, I thought applying to about 50 internships is enough but everyone on there says you need to apply to at least 300 to even have a shot. So I have applied a lot more and am up to 180. 

Also there is this idea that if you don’t get an internship, you’re basically screwed for getting a job. I know to a certain extent this isn’t 100% true but it still worries me.

Basically my stress summed up is that I’m concerned if I don’t get an internship for this summer, I won’t get a job or it’ll be extremely difficult to find one. I came here to hear about experiences from people already in the field. I just want to know how realistic these concerns are. I’m honestly thinking of leaving r/csmajors because it makes me feel so bad about myself and I think it’s doing more harm than good.

Any experiences would be helpful: people who never got internships, people who have had multiple internships, I just want to hear something real instead of a bunch of college students speculating and stressing each other out.

I know it won’t be the end of the world if I don’t get one, I just want to know what would be my next steps and how difficult it would be to find a job.

Thank you!"

During my undergrad, I did an internship at a webdev company for 1 year. Upon graduation, they took me as a fulltime, and I’ve been working for 2 years. 

Here’s my plight: I feel like the amount of knowledge I’m gaining here is actually very minimal, and for someone with 3 years professional experience, I’m actually quite dumb in terms of industry expectations. I want to leave, I want to go learn. But— the problem is, I want to learn about different webdev technologies, or in some cases, entirely different sections of computer science (mobile development, for example) which I have 0 professional experience in. 

To me, I literally wouldn’t mind quitting my salaried job right now if I had the liberty of getting an internship in another role that I thought would be interesting or broaden my skill set. But you’re actually not allowed to. A lot of internship applications will say on them “must be enrolled as a student”. Why? Why won’t they take me, someone who’s literally willing to leave his salaried position for a chance to broaden my skill set, maybe pivot my career, and hopefully go full time? 

I would view an internship in one of these areas that I don’t have experience in as an excellent way to gain some professional experience in that area without having no income. I’d maybe even go fulltime with that company who offered me an internship. But it doesn’t seem to be allowed. 

How the hell do people pivot their careers to different areas in this industry? I don’t qualify for salaried data science jobs or mobile application development jobs, so why am I also barred from seeking an internships in these areas? I would literally sacrifice my salaried position for the chance. I feel my career is stalled out where I am currently, and it’s starting to freak me out"

I'm 26 and I've been working in a small company for more than a year now. As it was my first coding experience at work (besides some internships), my goal for the first year was to catch up with the other developers.

I kinda manage to do that, even if I'm still behind (most have around 4-5 years of experience, and 2 years+ in this company, enough to know the stack and the product really well). I'm slowly getting there now, and I think I can be fairly happy with the work I put in to get where I am now (so does my manager says).

Yet, something feels wrong. I can be super happy of a work day, then completely depressed the next day. I know the impostor syndrome can have an impact on this, but I think this is not entirely it. I don't enjoy coding as much as my colleagues, and sometimes the hardness of it can drain me a lot. I'm not as passionate about it and it truly tears my motivation down. 

I'm not sure what I should/could do, I'm still quite young, but my skillset, even if not huge, is coding. 

I know the company isn't the problem, at least not in a 'corporate bullshit' way. It's not. CEO is a developer, even if he doesn't code anymore. The people are great, we can work remotely up to 3 days a week (well, Covid gave us 5 days a week but we could already remote 3 days a week before that). We play some nice CS a few times a week with the dev team and the CEO (not a big deal but maybe you can have a better picture of the company this way).

A friend told me that maybe the company actually IS the problem, but not for the usual reason. His thinking was that I am in a position that is very challenging, either by the demands of our product or by the skills of my colleagues, and that my lack of passion makes is very hard for me to cope with it.

Maybe I should aim for a corporate job? I don't know lol.

Also, my current salary is very small, as it is for most first workers in Belgium. I got a small raise, but I'm still paid quite low (at least when I compare with other countries): around 1.8K €/month + company car (net salary). Maybe that doesn't help me feel good either.

Some here I am looking for every advice you can give me, even if it hurts go for it :) 

Has anyone been in a similar position before? 

Thanks!"

You feel good when you are learning easy stuff, not getting into the harder stuff yet, and thinking about the opportunities in the field...

But one other noticeable difference I just realized is when I first started, I was just ""doing it"" and thinking about learning and problem solving.

I wasn't thinking about if I am good enough for some hiring manager to decide if I am good enough for a position at his/her company by looking at my resume and deciding from my performance in coding interviews. It made sense since there was less feelings of pressure to set foot in the industry.

But I think I did have the mentality right back then. The motivation was less superficial.

The industry focused thinking is such a depressing way to frame it to me. Especially considering how hard this field can be.

I am finding it harder to even look at code now without stressing out, since I have  attached to idea of not being qualified for a company.

\*felt like inserting some humor here but: ""Can't even reverse a linked list. I'll never get a job""

The main point is: Yes, getting experience and getting into the industry is important...we all want a fulfilling career, but ....that doesn't have to be the mental frame I am looking at everything through. I am making myself a slave to outcomes not fully in my control.  And it might be decreasing my chances from even getting those outcomes since it is crushing me.

I ended up taking less classes this semester to dedicate more time to the internship search and preparation for companies, but it is not going well and making me hate programming."

I have been applying for work in the computer science since March of 2020 and it’s getting extremely hard to not lose hope and just give up. I’ve had my resume looked at, did projects and leetcode, but it seems like no matter what I do, I won’t even be given a chance without an internship or any form of work experience in software development. Especially when a lot of these “Entry Level” positions then go on to ask for years and years of experience in which I don’t have, or I end up being locked into recruiter hell, where I think I have a great opportunity set up and they seem excited to hire, just to realize they are just there for my information to “tell me when they find a good fit”. Like I’m daily applying to every software developer/engineer, computer science job I can see. So I’m not sure.

First year MBA student here and am feeling pretty hopeless for a summer internship. I came into my program after a gap year of service from an undergrad in the humanities and feel left behind. Not sure how I managed to even get into my program because it seems that every employer is looking for additional experience I simply do not have. I had hoped to enter the non-profit industry for marketing but have expanded my search to marketing in any industry, and the only semblance of a response I have gotten is for part time unpaid work. I am doing the best I can to network but the virtual life is tough and I have no real professional network from prior employment to leverage either.

I have heard that many companies have much tighter budgets and timelines are pushed back but feel like I should begin looking for alternatives to a summer internships, if there is even an alternative. Rant over just wanted to see if other folks are feeling the same way as I am mainly. Any advice definitely appreciated."
lb8ywg,7,2021-02-02,"all I wanted was to get a cat to help reduce my stress and anxiety, and instead all I’ve gotten so far is exponentially more stress and anxiety for stupid reasons",somethinghappier,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/lb8ywg/all_i_wanted_was_to_get_a_cat_to_help_reduce_my/,"I'm in college and this semester is about to be hella stressful: I’m taking biochemistry and physics 2 plus other courses, I’m attempting to study for the MCAT, I'm a resident advisor and have responsibilities for that, I’ve got to decide if I’m going do medical school or graduate school or both, I’m doing independent research, I’m applying for internships for this summer and have interviews for those, I’m applying to be an SRA (senior RA) next year and have to interview for that as well. long story short I’ve got a lot of stressful shit going on and I’ve got anxiety that worsens with stress, so I decided to get an emotional support animal. yayyyyyyy... right? you would think so.

I look into getting an ESA at my university since I live on campus as an RA; I read everything online about it and fill out the form with the DRC (disabilities resource center) at my school. I get a letter from my doctor verifying my anxiety diagnosis and saying I could use an ESA and submit it to the DRC, as my school requires. I don’t have time to take care of a dog right now so I decide to get a cat, and I don’t have a cat I can bring to campus (my cat at home is mainly outdoors so he wouldn’t be good for a dorm, and is also not litter box trained which is required/necessary for living on campus). so I start looking into local animal rescues and pick out a couple kittens and apply for adoption. the DRC gets back to me with some forms I need to fill out, including their own form for my doctor to fill out which is slightly annoying, I don't know why they couldn’t give that to me initially but whatever. that's not a big issue, but they also need vet records with vaccinations and a picture of the animal and all that before approving it. the issue is I don’t own a cat yet and I applied for two so I don’t which one I’m going to get and I don’t have the vaccination records. I can’t get that stuff without adopting a cat, but I can’t adopt a cat before getting housing approval which I can’t get without that stuff. you see the issue?

I email the DRC back about this, asking if I could be generally approved for an ESA so I could adopt a cat, and then send in the information and records to have the specific cat approved before bringing it to campus. the DRC assigns me a personal accommodations consultant who decides to tell me, after I’m halfway into this whole process, that they require at least a 3 month relationship with an animal to approve it as an ESA. ??!?!?!?! this is not listed anywhere online or in the DRC’s information about getting an ESA. I already have doctor approval (twice over), half of the school’s process done, and have applied for adoptions, and they just now decide to tell me this rather important information?? I do not understand.

the consultant says most students adopt an animal in the summer, and that since last semester was shortened at my school she allowed some students to adopt over winter break to bring for spring semester, and that she isn’t sure if she would be able to approve me without a prior relationship with the animal. would’ve been nice information to know sooner but whatever, makes sense. the issue is I continue to work as an RA over the breaks and live in housing on campus the whole time (including this past winter break, summer break, and the spring semester after everyone went home). so even if I had known this before, there is no way I would have been able to get an animal prior to coming to school since I don’t leave school. I haven't lived off campus for over a year, and I only got my anxiety diagnosis/medication a month prior to that. There is no possible way for me to have gotten an animal 3 months before being on campus.

I tell her this and all she says is once she receives all the paperwork she’ll take it into consideration. like okay, but the whole reason I emailed is that I can’t really get the paperwork done before getting approval and adopting a cat, so the whole reason I emailed isn’t even fixed!!! also I don't know why there isn't exceptions in place for students who live in break housing, I doubt I'm the first student in the school's history who lives in break housing to get an ESA. she also insinuates that I’m going to get a cat and sneak it into my dorm before getting approval which not only is out of pocket, but stupid since I initially emailed to ask if I could get approval before adopting one and getting/sending records so obviously I’m not going to sneak one in or else I wouldn’t have asked that? but at this point I’m so tired of dealing with DRC and their senseless process, so whatever, I'll do my best to get the paperwork done.

now I’ve emailed the two animal rescues I put in adoption applications at explaining the situation and asking if I could get vaccination records before officially adopting a cat. I have no idea if they’ll be able to because I don't know if there’s any legal thing about giving out an animal's records to people who don’t own the animal, but hopefully they aren’t as dumb and senseless as the DRC has been and will be willing to work with me to get this all figured out. I'm just hoping they have the rabies vaccine already (the vaccination specifically required by my school) or else I'll have to try to figure out getting that vaccination before adoption the cat. but until they respond I’m just sitting here in limbo waiting for this is get worked out. and all of this is happening while I'm trying to make a presentation for an interview (which I was just told last night that it's tomorrow) plus everything else going on right now.

all I wanted was to get a cat to help reduce my stress and anxiety, and instead all I’ve gotten so far is exponentially more stress and anxiety because the DRC isn't forthcoming with information, isn't clear on their process, gives roundabout requirements, and seems to have something against helping me and working with me. yaaaaay :|

edit: I’m sure no one is following this, but I finally got a cat and he’s perfect :)"

My school is having a virtual career fair tm, where you basically sign up for 10 minutes, 1-on-1 slots with recruiters from different companies. I'm kinda anxious about it, mainly since I don't know what to expect. The fact that it's virtual also is kind of throwing me off, since I feel like it's easier to connect with someone in person. 

I guess I'm just asking for any advice in terms of career fairs, and also virtual ones. Are they gonna be asking me interview-like questions? How should I prepare?"

I’m a recent graduate from the US, and I’ve been working full time as a front end dev for about 6 months. I’m currently on a contract that expires a year from now, and I’m trying to plan ahead. 

It’s always been a goal of mine to move overseas, and it’s part of why I went into tech. I’m aiming to move to Europe hopefully within the next few years, but I have a couple questions, especially pertaining to education. I’ve mainly been looking into Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK. Right now I only really speak English and I’m conversational in Spanish, but I’ve been learning Norwegian for the past few years. I also studied abroad in the UK for a year, and I have quite a few friends there so I would love to go back. 

My question is, for any of the countries listed above, would having a year and a half (2 with internships) of experience be enough to have a reasonable chance at finding a job? I know that masters degrees are more common in Europe in general; would getting a masters make it significantly easier to find a job? Or would it be smarter for me to apply for jobs in the US to gain a couple more years of experience before relocating? Also are there other places I should be considering? Thanks for any advice :)"

It was advertised at my Universities job board, but they seem so disorganized and I'm having a lot of doubts of continuing to purse an internship with them. So here are some red flags from this internship I've been getting.

1. The actually job description is extremely vague. It doesn't say when the internship occurs and the actual position seems to be 90% documentation rather than working with IT related things
2. The application from my Universities job board specified it was a part time internship, but the package offer sent in the email was a full time internship and some details of the description was changed.
3. They asked me to contact them instead of them calling me which was really strange. A lot of my friends that have graduated have told me their previous internship interviews never asked them to call them first.
4. I called the number provided at the specific time and I was unable to get through. The line basically said I am unable to contact the interviewee with the current phone I am using. I've concluded that HR essentially gave me a desk line that could only be accessed by people already working in that business.
5. I reached out to HR and recently got an email stating that since I had an issue I can contact the hiring manager through his personal phone number. The email then stated to text or call them to reschedule an interview.

So overall, the actual bank seems either incompetent or disorganized as hell. I've described this situation to my friends and they advised I shouldn't bother. It feels like I'm going through hoops. Any advice?"

Like many, I have a question on where to take my career.

I recently graduated with some internships under my belt. I big engineering company hired me as a Test Automation Engineer, both Java and Python (I live in Europe).

Now I know the usual feelings about QA jobs around here, but I took the offer, honestly because the pay was insane, I make at least 1.7x more than any of my friends doing junior dev jobs around the city. That's a lot of money coming out of college. 

I'm still doing my 90 days probation, however today I got a call from a company. One of my friend's working there as a Java Developer, and he loves the culture, but the pay is a lot less than what I'm currently making.

What I would like to know, is what's the better in the long run? For me, money is the only motivation for working. Of course, I need a healthy work environment, but my current job is good in that regard, just not as good as the other. On the other hand, I can live with half of my current salary, but I'm only willing to give up on that much money if it's a solid investment. 

So, I want to know what's the highest possible salary's like for a Test Automation Engineer (and how can I get there) and how much better is Java Dev in that regard?

In one scenario, I am the piece of shit and in the other she is.

I am 25 and she is 23. We both moved out to Los Angeles recently. She came out here because she wants to be an editor and I came out here because I want to be an independent filmmaker. She has done incredibly well for herself. Through the pandemic she got an internship with the American Cinema Editors and is currently editing promos at Fox. She might even make it onto a movie in a few months. She is 100% an overachiever in the best way. She puts in an intense amount of work but still balances her personal life. She has got a direct line to what she sees as success and is making it happen.

I've been a film fanatic for my whole life. Always wanting to live in Los Angeles and make my own feature films with my own production company. It is important to me that I have an infrastructure where I can finance my own films and make money on my own terms  (FYI I'm not trying to finance the next Batman movie over here). Obviously it would take some time to achieve this. I have a video production company that I've run on my own since 2016, focuses on making promo videos for companies. It has been a solo venture so far but it has improved year after year and it has grown to the point that I am about to be able to bring some part time employees on board. I've also been using some of the free time I have to start a film review channel on YouTube to grow a social media presence (eventually i'd like to make  supplemental income from this as well). Essentially, I want to make this business to bring in money without me needing to be running it all the time and have it bring in enough money to produce short films and then feature films. I want to do well on the business and creative side of the film industry and that does not necessarily mean making million dollar movies out the gate. It is taking time to build the infrastructure and get it to the point that I can spend a few thousand dollars on independent films here in Los Angeles.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently we were on a walk and she asked what my plans were next. I said I'd like to bring on people to do more of the grunt work so I can focus more on getting a client or two that moves the company away from videos for companies and more in the direction of commercial advertising. She said I'd have to pump the breaks on the company and go work for a company that does that. I didn't take offense to this but did say I'd rather not put a pause on my company. Whenever she gives a suggestion about what she thinks I should do in this kind of situation and I say I'd rather not go in that direction she will say things like ""I figured you'd want to be climbing a ladder"" or ""When was the last time you did something creative?"". All of those questions came up. I wasn't really sure how to even take those questions, it made me outrageously insecure and defensive.  


I got pretty quiet and after some awkward silence I apologized for getting weird. I told her I unfairly got intimidated by her pressing questions because she has been doing insanely well recently and that isn't fair. She asked why I came out to LA and I told her I want to build my business here because I love it here and this is where the industry is - when I make projects I am near the best talent in front of and behind the camera. She responded to that by asking why I'm not shooting high - I said that I pretty much disagreed with every assumption that goes into that question. After that, I came on here.

How should I be taking these comments? Right now, I am taking them as being pretty damn insulting.

In some way, I could see that she might be calling me out if she thinks I am becoming complacent. This could be the case and maybe I am lacking the self awareness to see it. On the other side, I am about to launch a website for the company that I've been building with a designer for a few months as well as a course that companies can pay for to learn how to build their own videos on their own. 

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT OTHER SIDE - Maybe she thinks I am spending too much time on this business stuff and need to just go out and make things?

This is where I am stuck - Is she being unsupportive or am I being sensitive?"

So I had been a legal intern at law firm for around 3 years. During the height of COVID, I lost my part time job and the internship so I said my goodbyes andfocused on studies.

Just yesterday, I got an email to my old company email for the law firm. I think it was incorrectly forwarded to me but it reminded me that I still have access to it. I had to return my building pass and laptop to the firm but never thought about the email.

I never use the email outside of work so obviously haven't used it for almost a year. Just for context, it's was a bitter departure for me because I told them I would be available for work once things got better as uni classes was still going. But they just ended up hiring someone else without notifying - acceptable but a bit heartbreaking for me.

I was laid off my permanent job in September and started working as a temp for a non-profit as an administrative assistant. I told my boss when I started that I was also looking for something full-time and she said she also wanted to hire someone full time and would try to get me benefits. It turns out the company declined her request to provide me benefits twice so I asked about 2 other positions for which I know I’m also qualified for. She said she already had candidates for them and that she preferred I stayed in my admin position. Please keep in mind that I have a master’s degree, vast admin experience and in my 40s. When I met the people they hired for the higher paying positions I was surprised because they both had their bachelors (something very similar to mine) and no work experience (literally nothing except for some internships). I was surprised and hurt but I took my boss at her word when she told me they already had other people chosen.

Six months have passed and I’ve been furiously looking for another permanent job while still keeping my current temp job. About a month ago she made the announcement to the team that there was a posting for higher paying job on the website (which I had asked for earlier) but it was just so they could have “resumes handy” in case someone ever quit. But, nothing to worry about because no one was leaving. Well, it turned out it wasn’t the truth because two more people left and she announced to the office that she had already made her decision to hire two other people. Last Friday, she announced (in my presence) that she wanted to get someone hired on for my position with full benefits but unfortunately had not been able to get approval from the higher ups. She also told me privately they extended my temp contract and she would keep me posted about another admin job with benefits. 

Honestly, I’m confused and would have left this job in a heartbeat had anything else been offered to me. As a sidetone, I also applied to another job with benefits within this non-profit (which I was overqualified for) which I was sure I would at least get an interview for but they gave it to someone on the outside fresh out of college with, again, zero work experience. I have a feeling this might be an issue of ageism within this company or they truly don’t like people with any work experience. 

I’m stuck and desperately need to get out of this rut. I want to leave only because I feel like being a temp in this office is humiliating when I see higher paying jobs being offered to people with no work experience but I don’t have anything else lined up. I partly wanted to ask my boss why this is happening but I’m afraid this will get me fired and partly don’t give a damm anymore. My fear now is that since I’m a temp, they can let me go with no explanation or notice. I don’t feel like I have any rights and, besides a small paycheck, there is truly no reason for me to stick around. Should I speak with her to clear the air or should I just keep my mouth shut and keep looking for another job (temp or temporary)? Let me know what you think is happening here.

I am a university student in a 3rd world country, and I am on my way to earn my bachelor's degree in systems engineering.  I've worked on 3 different internships (which amount to a total of 1 year) in front-end development with js, HTML, CSS, and a couple of frameworks (.net, angular, react js).   


I am a week close to getting my Udemy certificate in javascript (which I believe I am almost an expert at the programming language), know 2 programming paradigms (functional programming, OOP), and things that are related to software development.   


But I just can't seem to get a job, no matter what I do.  


I've been jumping from 1 company to the other, but they either reject me for the lack of years of experience or specific questions regarding the frameworks that I've applied on.  


I understand the framework part, but it took me almost 6 months to almost finish off the javascript course to try and get to the web development company to get that much-needed experience in programming.  


It's gotten to the point that I've been thoroughly studying back-end languages (java, c#, c++) to upgrade my curriculum and apply to full-stack positions, but it's just so much to learn and checking the roadmap for both front-end and back-end routes has shown me that I am not even close to becoming a decent programmer.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't see what else I can do. I  just don't want to waste my time on another internship and work free for another company that won't even consider hiring me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Just what the fuck should I do?"

A little bit about me... I graduated college with a BS in computer science from a third world country back in 2017. But I have been working as a part time developer since 2015. The work experience prior to graduation helped me a get a job pretty quickly once I graduated.

However, life was pretty bleak... I was struggling with depression, relationship issues, family issues and toxic work environment. I was really just loosing my mind... :( At this point started having suicidal thoughts.. As an desperate attempt of keeping myself sane, I sort of decided to pursue grad school in US. I had a pretty good cgpa and I actually liked studying computer science stuff.. so I took the GRE, applied to bunch of grad school in US.. eventually one professor from my current school decided to give me a chance, even though he was not entirely sure about me. He offered me fully funded research assistant position. I did not had any other offer... and at this point I really was at my wits end... so this offer kind of saved my life :D

But it turned out grad school was not really my thing and my academic advisor did not like me or my work either. So even though I really wanted to get PhD... I decided to sacrifice that dream and get out early with a MS. At this point I was half way through my MS and started applying for internships... things were tough but fortunately I got one last summer! 

I loved working there, and the company also liked my performance and decided to offer me a full-time position. At this point I took a gamble and decided that I'll finish last semester of my MS, and if they have an open position on January I'll join them.. but as luck would have it.. they did not have an open position this January lol.

So now I was in trouble.. my funding had ran out.. I started applying furiously... with no luck. lowest point was when I got 2 interviews but both of the interviews got cancelled they day before it was scheduled... :| I couldn't remember feeling this low ever...

So finally got this current offer 2 weeks ago.. and started working since yesterday. Pay is not that great.. but at least its not thing lol. However, I'll still negotiate for a higher amount once I get settled in because its not fair for me.. and it lowers the bar for any other future employee.

I'm still totally not out of the woods yet.. but I have a feeling that I'll be fine.. :D

To be honest I didn't wanted to move to US and at this point I really dont have any plans for staying here. I just figured that few years of work experience in US would look good on my resume once I return home.. if I ever can... But despite everything I'll always be grateful to US and people of US for pulling me out of a bad situation and giving me a fighting chance at life...

So... if you are an international student like me.. or just graduated from school.. I know things are tough.. but they way I see it... you have come this far.. you can push the extra miles.. dont give up on the hope...

I'm a brazilian undergraduate CS student hoping to complete my bachelor's by the end of 2021.

I'm looking for some guidance and what to expect/dream with having the following profile:

Realistic projection of getting my degree with a 3.3 ~ 3.4 (out of 4.0) GPA; 
1.5 years of undergrduate research experience (will complete 2 by the end of July);
A first author paper published on a 4.38 impact factor cs/bioinformatics journal; And I recently contributed to a lot of bioinformatics research projects (that are in the oven, almost completed) and I'm expecting to get from them at least 3/4 more publications in similar-tier journals/conferences focused on bioinformatics and machine learning.

I also have 1 year of undergrduate extesion experience (including teaching experience in ML), a Coursera Tensorflow specialization, and I want to have some industry level internship experience before completing my degree. 

So... I know my chances of getting accepted in top ML phd programs like Stanford's, MIT's, CMU's etc are low, but I don't know anything about european or canadian top universites. How high are the expected GPAs there? Would you say I'm a competitive applicant for Imperial College, ETH Zürich, EPFL, Toronto University, Cambridge, etc?
Any advice on other good european/canadian colleges with lower expectations?

By the way, I'm looking exclusively for fully funded + living allowance programs.

Thanks!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

I won't numerically rate my LoRs because... just how would I do that?

Entrepreneurship Mentor (CEO): Had a very strong relationship with him, he provided and advanced a lot of my extracurricular opportunities and he was from the entrepreneurship incubator (gave me a scholarship to attend).  He wrote letters for a few other students a year above me at the incubator and they were admitted to Harvard, JHU, Purdue, NYU Stern.  Those other students say I was his favorite.

AP Phys Teacher: Well enough, I've known him for 4 years and he's well aware of my entrepreneurial activities and podcasting (actually had him on the podcast once).  Generally on amicable terms, been good and ambitious student.

APUSH Teacher: Only takes 10 LOR requests a year, I requested mine a year in advance.  Very good terms, probably one of best students in our APUSH class.  Had out of class conversations that espoused my personality.  Aware of my writing and my authorship.

Peer (for Darty): Co-founder in firm, went through a lot together at entrepreneurship incubator and later reconnected as mentors in same incubator.  Read it myself and its quite professional for a peer rec.

**Interviews**

UPenn: Not great, really didn't click.  She was a doctor who was really questioning my want to go to big city Philly and asked me verbatim what I did for fun again (after my initial response of fall into Wikipedia rabbit holes and podcast) with a straight face.  Never making that mistake again.

Duke: Pretty good, was able to make them laugh at end, had an engaging conversation about Duke entrepreneurship and leadership programs.

Princeton: Recent grad who was probably the best so far, she described me as a ""gift to the world"" (flattered) and she said she was impressed by my responses compared to other applicants.  She said to update her on my decision in April.

Harvard: Would say it was good.  Really stoic guy who was in President Clinton's cabinet, had an engaging conversation about journalism and the new media forces (Vox, ProPublica) and my ambition to do the same.  Ended with a bit about him talking about imposter syndrome as his biggest dislike with his Harvard experience.

Stanford: Short (\~40 min)  where halfway through interview I became the interviewer.  Talked a lot about her daughter who was a Stanford senior and the easily accessible small research grants.  Apparently she welcomes the \~60-70 Stanford admitted students every year with a reception at her home.

Dartmouth: Really down to earth conversation with a guy, standard interview questions, he still sends me material and updates from Dartmouth here and there now based on things I said in our interview (like swim team changes, pitching opportunities).  I also update him in April.

MIT: Fairly standard interview.  Nothing really to note here, talked about my journalism and my view on media for the most part.

**Essays**

After being rejected by Penn, I think I went through maybe like 15 CA drafts in total but only the last two mattered.  I applied to half my colleges with one CA draft (that I thought showed how I thought, albeit maybe not as personal as I wanted it).  I ended up applying to all the colleges with deadlines 1/3/20 and after using my Harvard supp as my CA since a friend and a college counselor both read it, suggested no changes, and said it was my best work.  All sups went through 2-4 drafts and were reviewed by either my friend or college counselor.  I had half of them coming into Winter break then I crammed out the rest during break.  I'm proud of my CA essays and most of my sups and have realized throughout all my revising and editing, that I lost a great deal of my own voice in the essays that I initially sent to Penn.  Which is why I resolved to keep editing minimal and my original voice a priority in my later essays (and rewrote my CA).

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* USC Merit (Presidential)
* UCLA (Regents Invite)
* UCI Honors
* UC Berkeley GMP Program (Haas School of Business)
* UCSD
* Cornell Dyson !!!

*Waitlists:*

* UChicago
* Vanderbilt
* NYU
* Harvard
* Dartmouth
* Brown

*Rejections:*

* ED Penn Wharton
* Northwestern
* MIT
* Duke
* Princeton
* Yale
* Columbia
* Stanford

**Additional Information:**

There was quite a bit of new info in additional info on CA and stuff that I plan on updating my colleges with soon:

In March, I was selected for a 12-person cohort in a career development program following my entrepreneurial activities where I was selected to participate in funded projects ranging from Harvard case studies and startups. This was discontinued owing to the COVID pandemic but will be resuming the latter half of my senior year.

I was interviewed by major news networks (November 2020) about the launch of the entrepreneurial incubator clubs chapters in the midst of COVID-19, interview expected to be in outlets like USNews and the like in February (Hopefully in time for RD)

I was invited to join the student council of a social science research program for high school students around the world, hosted by the World Federation of United Nations Associations (WFUNA) on the basis of my journalism and the entrepreneurship incubator clubs program. This just began this February and am currently meeting with the director.

So yeah, this is where I'm at and hopefully I'll get a yes from one of my reaches.  This year is super unpredictable though, so if you're reading this in the future, you might want to note that (25-75% app increases at most selective schools).  If you're curious about my ECs or whatever, pm me.  I'll be active on this sub (as I also have moderating duties lol).  I still have a bit of EC work to do regarding my February updates."

i'm an autoadmit to ut austin/a&amp;m and i think it'll stay that way by the time i apply, so those two are my biggest safeties rn. also looking at rice but i'm not sure how good their engineering and business programs are?

i'm pretty interested in schools like MIT, Stanford, or Princeton, so chance me for those ig? i prob dont have a very good shot at them but hopefully i can beef everything up over the summer

lastly, any other schools i should be looking at?

lbjw3k,2,2021-02-03,I got enough Certification for an entry-level IT position. But,RainbowOverTheHill,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/lbjw3k/i_got_enough_certification_for_an_entrylevel_it/,"So I've recently completed the Comptia A+, Comptia Security+, Google IT support certification, IBM cybersecurity analyst professional certificate and  ITIL

The problem is I live in NZ. the entry-level job market here is dog sht. I was a housekeeper. and I was let go due to COVID. So, no... I don't have any IT related work experience. Just have experience mopping floors to make them shine  brighter than margot robbie's front teeth. IT job industry seems to be booming pretty much every where except here in down-under. I see in media everyday, 'experts' talk about the skill shortage in IT. specially in cybersecurity.  Mayber there really is a shortage. but apparently in Australia and NZ, the  skill shortage is not in the entry-level IT positions. Like even for entry level helpdesk posts, they are asking for people with 5-10 year experience. However they also seem to be ok with hiring Uni grads even though people with professional certifications have more knowledge then those fresh out noobs with a collage degrees. I know I'm a salty bitch. But I also know I'm right.

This brings me to my question, what would you do if you were in my position. Would you keep hoarding certificates. or go back to cleaning floors for $18 NZD/hr? Sometimes I feel like I'm chasing after the wrong certifications or wrong specialty. I want to become a SOC analyst. therefore I was focusing on Cybersecurity. NZ is a smol country with a smol popualtion. coming across a SOC analyst vacancy here is like finding a needle in a haystack. Jr. SOC analyst positions are even harder to find. When there is finally a position become available, as you can imagine, its gonna get bombarded with 15 year IT veterans from across the world because seems like so many people nowadays are trying to get in to NZ.

So, back to my point, Should I put cyber-security on hold for now and focus on network? or may be sys-admin? or cloud? or programming? like what IT speciality you think would let me in. I can't go to Uni and waste 3-4 years. I'm already behind all of my peers. they are getting married and having kids and I am still living with my mom hoarding certificates. In NZ, internships are pretty much reserved for Uni grads. so I don't think I have a shot there.

Please let me know what would you do If you were an entry level noob trying to break into  IT world in a country that doesn't have an entry-level skill shortage.and thank for reading my rant till the end :)"

I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me out.
 
1. I'm majoring in Electronics and Communication engineering, which is sort of an overlap between Computer Science engineering and Electrical engineering, and I wanna get a master's in Computer science. Consequently, I have some common courses with CS undergrads(digital logic, computer architecture, computer networks, etc) but I'm not sure if they'd make up for enough credit. Additionally, I've learnt Python and C++ and I'm certified in full stack development and have two internship experiences in web development as of yet. My current level of German is A1, it'll be A2 by the time I apply.

But as I've found that universities like a ""consecutive"" major (although they do mention that a ""relative degree"" should be fine too), will my current major hamper my chances of getting into a CS program? 

2. If my chances do get lower, the next best thing for me is Communication engineering but I'm not sure about its job prospects or career scope. As far as I've researched, it seems to be pretty okay but I wanna get an actual viewpoint. Could someone shed some light on that? P.s I've no internship or research experience in this field.

lbku6s,1,2021-02-03,Should I think about leaving?,MT_WYNN,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lbku6s/should_i_think_about_leaving/,"I’m currently a software engineer based in California, recently graduated this past June 2020. 

A little background, I spent half my college experience unfocused on my career and thus came out with zero internship experience, save for a few side projects and  small software development tasks at my student desk job.  

I received and accepted my offer over a year ago and was so excited and relieved that a company would invest in me when I had no prior working experience. Fast forward to now, and my experience despite the pandemic has helped me grow and sharpen the skills I’ve developed. The pay is very livable, and the culture is decent. I’ve worked extensively on a few projects, and have even spearheaded some where I have been the only talent with the necessary skills. I’m not unhappy, is the bottom line.

Yet I still feel like I’m not enough for this industry, and seeing many of my colleagues/classmates/friends land offers at top FAANG companies really took a toll on my self esteem. I went job searching for the hell of it recently and found a few local jobs in my area for engineering positions at those top companies, and surprisingly I fit into their qualifications. 

My question is this: should I consider just applying? When should I consider leaving to really get the most out of my career path? The things I worry about the most are being too invested in my company and holding too much responsibility to be able to quit in search of better opportunities."

*Edit 4-2-2021 (14:19):* Thanks everyone for the help! We're going to look into getting topdesk then. Coudn't have looked into it without the help :)"
lbl1zy,5,2021-02-03,"26 yo North African language teacher, is it too late to switch careers?",EyasTheHawk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lbl1zy/26_yo_north_african_language_teacher_is_it_too/,"Hello everyone, I'm already feeling like an imposter posting here but I need some advice...

As the title suggests Im a 26 yo highschool teacher from a North African country who is considering a change in career. It's not exactly that I dislike my current job (far from it) or that I have any really serious problem or anything like that. It's just that my situation is really underwhelming : roughly 400 dollars monthly salary and no real international opportunities (non-native speaker) in a country deeply in debt really paints a bleak image for the future.

I have always dreamt of leaving my native country to seek better opportunities elsewhere and I've been considering switching over to Computer Science for a couple years now but I really don't know what Im getting myself into (only CS I know is highschool stuff : Pascal etc) and Im afraid that Im too old to start over (considering I'll probably be graduating in my 30s with no real experience in a country with massive unemployment rates)

And so here I am asking you: Is it too late for someone like me to start over? If not then what exactly should I do to maximize my chances of getting employment abroad ASAP?

Some extra info:

The programs offered in my native country are 3 year long degrees followed by 2 year long Master's degree (probably no real employment opportunities).

Or alternatively 3 year long degrees followed by 3 years of engineering school (better employment opportunities but much harder/longer).

The initial 3 year degrees (which Im guessing would be equivalent to BSC?) can be studied either on campus or Online. Would picking the online courses affect my chances of getting employment abroad?

What kind of internship can I even qualify for if any?

Any kind of advice is more than welcome  


Edit : I genuinely thank you all for the support and precious advice! I honestly wasn't expecting any answers when I posted this. Truly thank you!  "
lblp25,1,2021-02-03,I have so many things I am feeling and going through right now. Any advice or even thoughts?,anonymous_12343,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lblp25/i_have_so_many_things_i_am_feeling_and_going/,"So I dont know. Lately the last year I have seen so many changes in myself. I used to be this person that needed to depend on asshole friends to feel like I was worth something. 

I threw those people out of my life right before the pandemic. And for a while I was very lonely. But then I became dedicated to my career and I learned I had to be confident to get a job in my field (Finance Major). I now have a great job waiting for me when I graduate this May. I can have the financial freedom I need to be free from anti gay parents. I can be on my own. 

I can be free. But at the same time I am learning something depressing. I am not trying to sound sad or look for pity. But I have always had this weird feeling inside like no one could actually care about me. My parents constantly told me to keep all my emotions inside. But I cant anymore. I dont know all my ""friendships"" up to this point have never quite felt real. It might sound weird but I just never have had anyone I thought 100% had my back. 

With this freedom coming. I am scared. My parents dont want me to move out. They want me to stay for a few more years for more financial freedom. But like I have the money to leave. Also they keep having these huge fights and have some marriage problems which they of course force me into them for some reason. I constantly help them out though and take care of my special needs sister. I dont go to parties or even have any fun. I sacrificed all that in college to help them out. But I am ready to look out for myself and just have fun. 

My dad literally quit his job and didnt work for more than a year. Now he just got a job less than 6 months ago and wants to quit this job as well. And he wants me to fucking apply for jobs for him. I literally did this shit last time for him too. Tired of him fucking doing this. I have my job coming. I dont care he can do whatever he wants. It doesnt affect me anymore so I feel like I shouldnt care. He refuses to go to therapy even though he is super depressed and even suicidal. (Anyway enough about that. My parents are filled with problems and drama and are also anti gay and super pro trump still. I am ready to just escape that) 


Anyway now to the real part of this story. I have developed a connection with this new guy I met at work last summer in a virtual internship we had. We actually met in real life for the first time last week. We had spent hours on the phone and constantly helped edit our resumes and constantly were pushing each other to be better. He moved to my area recently. He used to live like 10 hours away. 

But I feel vulnerable. I dont know this connection is really not something I have felt before. Like I havent ever had anyone put my interests ahead of their own self-interests. He was so kind and constantly was worried about what I thought. 

We basically met up at a mall and did some shopping. Which he then asked to drive me to this Korean bbq place and he cooked and served me food. He even gave me food off his own plate with his chopsticks he put in his mouth. (Wont lie kind of felt like second hand salvia exchange. I had an anime uwu moment).  We took some shots together. We talked about our careers. He even chose to keep our conversation going when he got a phone call. We then went to get some boaboa tea afterwards and he was so polite he constantly opened doors for me and just made me feel like I was royalty. I told some of my friends about it and they think this was a ""date"". I dont know if it was because I have never really had friends to hang with before. (There was more that happened but kind of just summarizing) 

He also wanted to pay for things (I didnt let him) and I just never had anyone treat me this well. I even flat out told him this was the best anyone ever treated me in my life. He kind of smiled and just said this is how you should be treated and how he treats people he cares about. 

Anyway he suggested I go move on my own. He also wants to go out again this weekend. And I don't know I am conflicted. Like even if this is just friend stuff I am fine with either. I have no expectations and have not been making any moves. But like I dont know. I have never felt this good and yet confused before. 

Like it is a good pain? It is hard to describe. All I know is every instinct in me is that I want to continue seeing him and going out with him. But like parts of me wants to think this is too good to be true. And I should stop it now while the memory is precious to me and not tainted. I have had so many people hurt me before. 

I mean I just dont know. I am also conflicted about going out with covid going on. But i have been locked up for a year. And this is the first time I have ever felt this happy before. I strictly want to say I am not dreaming of a scenario where we date. I dont care to be honest. I just want to hang with him. And have him treat me like I matter. 

I just hate this feeling. Cause my motto after I cut those old terrible friends out was to learn to be able to trust myself and not others. I feel so strong but now this makes me feel weaker and vulnerable. I kept waiting for him to say something demeaning to me. Or something that would show his true colors. 

He constantly expressed concerns for what I wanted to do and how I felt. He even wants to get drunk together. I told him I get pretty handsy when I drink. And I even flat out told him he is super handsome and if I drank I probably wouldnt be able to resist hugging and just touching him. He legit said he wouldnt mind and wants to try it out with me since I have never been fully drunk before.

I dont know tbh I feel like he is way of my league anyway if this did even become a thing. Which it probably wont. 

Anyway conflicted. Obviously I should continue going out with him right? And just did what I did last time. Make no moves and just go with the flow? 

I just dont want to mess anything up. This connection is very special to me. I dont need it to be more than friends. I just dont want to lose that spark of happiness he breathed into me. I feel like everytime I talk to him some of the stuff weighing me down just magically lifts. He always knows what to say even when I put myself down. 

Does anyone maybe have some thoughts for me or advice? I dont know I just felt like putting my thoughts out there. Since there is just so much going on right now and so many changes."

Software Project Management/Software Engineer field,Thesmetz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lblspf/phd_or_job_software_project_managementsoftware/,"I'm a computer science student enrolled in a Double Master's degree (Camerino University, Italy) in ""Systems and Software for Industries"" featuring Reykjavik University (Iceland), which I will probably finish this July (with a high probability of 110 cum laude). I've finished all my studies in a fast way, but I don't have job experience (except a University internship during the bachelor's).

What I understood is that I don't want to remain a Software Developer all my life, because honestly, I don't love programming for a long time. And during this master's degree, I understood that probably what I prefer is something regarding Software Engineering/Software Project Management. The question now is, should I continue with the university path, I mean, a Ph.D. in this field (Software Engineering/Software Project Management)  with experiences abroad (that I love)? Or should I switch to a job in order to achieve the positions that I want to do? (I mean Software Developer to Software Engineer to up)

In brief, what I would like is a well-paid job in the Software Management/Software Engineering field, if I could, it will be amazing positions like CTO or similar, but I think that is so difficult.

To bottom-up, someone could explain something about it, like using a career example or else?

lbr965,1,2021-02-03,Two interviews - how to proceed,AnimalPunch,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/lbr965/two_interviews_how_to_proceed/,"Looking for some advice.

I had two interviews today, both went great.

&amp;#x200B;

One was for an internship in a small company (under 20 employees) and sounds more like a glorified customer support. Still, I'd get paid and with the job market as it is here I'd gladly take it over nothing. I'm 80% sure they'll hire me.

The other one is for a top company, would look great on my CV, would get me tons of experience and is pretty much my dream internship. There's more competition here, so I'm not too sure on my chances.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the problem: the smaller one said they'd call this week to tell me their decision. I know the other one (the one I want) will take at least until the mid of next week to give me feedback.

What do I say in case I get accepted to the smaller one? I'm scared if I tell the smaller one the truth, as in, that I want to wait for the result of another interview, they'll reconsider their offer. If possible I do not want to end up with no internship at all, and I feel like I'm being to greedy hoping for the bigger one."
lbru3y,17,2021-02-03,Software dev internship at Microsoft vs Machine Learning Engineering Internship at smaller company,Different_Expression,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lbru3y/software_dev_internship_at_microsoft_vs_machine/,"Edit: So I apparently got the software engineering internship at Microsoft not the software dev lol. Thanks for all the insight, I think I’m leaning towards accepting the Microsoft offer! 

Hi guys, 

I just wanted some feedback about a dilemma I’m currently in, which involves choosing between two potentially really beneficial internships. 

So some background, I’m a first year computer science student who’s really interested in AI and I was hoping to find an internship that would enable me to learn more about it. 

I applied for Microsoft’s Garage internship and made it through the interview rounds and was offered a software development position. This happened almost simultaneously as I was going through the interview process for a Machine Learning Engineering co-op at a start-up (about 250 employees) my mentor set me up with. I was interviewed by the Lead Machine Learning Engineer of the start up and it was possibly the most pleasant interview  experience I’ve ever had. He seemed like he was genuinely really interested in my growth as a programmer and that the co-op would essentially be them paying me to learn. I also really love the culture of the company and the doing a Machine Learning Engineering Co-op in my first year would be unreal! 

Obviously the culture at Microsoft is amazing, that goes without saying, and I know interning at Microsoft would open a lot of doors for me in the future. However the internship being in software development is a bit of a downside for me as well as the fact that it will only be for 12 weeks, whereas the co-op would be for 17 weeks (4 months). Less importantly, my co-op offer is higher than the one at Microsoft but I think that could easily be negotiated if it came down to it. 

It’s also important to know my end goal as of right now (it might change as I spend more time in Uni)  is to go to grad school and work in AI research so that’s why the co-op is more appealing to me as it would essentially be giving me a taste of what the field I want to study is like. 

Please let me know what you think would be the better option here! I’m especially interested in input from upper year students and cs grads. I have to make a decision by this Friday!!"

 Hi, here are 65 New Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning jobs. 
 Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers!"
lbuo5i,2,2021-02-03,"Newbie in ML/Data Science, need some guidance",gcdn,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/lbuo5i/newbie_in_mldata_science_need_some_guidance/,"Hello, so this is my first post here in this subreddit.

I am a final year undergrad student, persuing bachelor in computer science. For the past couple of years, I have been studying a lot about ML/AI. I have good programming experience and knowledge. I am programming since 11th grade as I had CS as a subject in high school. I used to code in C++ mainly. I know Java and a little bit of JS also. 

In my 2nd year, I started learning python from online tutorials. I did a 2-month  course of Machine Learning and its Applications at a govt. institute and build a bayesian classifier for Sentiment Analysis. This project was my first step into ML. I used R for this project. Then I practiced on some small projects which I got from online courses (simple linear regression, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors). In 5th sem, I started with Neural Nets and Deep Learning, which I dropped in between as I was not confident enough for learning more advanced stuff. 

The online courses I did are Andrew NG's course on Coursera and the University of Michigan's Specialisation in Data Science using Python.

I know the basic concepts but I don't know why I am still not confident enough to do my own project.

I am a quick learner and always willing to learn more. I am not able to decide whether I should learn the mathematical stuff first or should I focus on how to program ML models and learn using ML libraries first.

I want to have a job in M/AI field as an ML Engineer orData Scientist. Currently, I am a Data Analytics and Insights intern. My work here is leaned more towards ETL and using tools to gather the data only. We mostly use SQL for queries and tools such as Informatica/PowerBI/Tableau for visualization. Sometimes we have to go into Big Data concepts also.

But I want to do programming, which I cant do here.

Any help on what I should study or do next (not as a beginner) to learn more and move to ML/AI/Data Science.

I know my question might not be very clear, but I really need help because I am also very confused on what I should actually study and how should I study."

lbvole,1,2021-02-03,Realistically what are my options?,Glam-data62,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/lbvole/realistically_what_are_my_options/,"I’m a college junior mathematics major. I want to go into data science/computer science. I plan on getting a minor in stats then maybe get my masters in computer science or related field. I’ve really been looking into like Computer and Information Research Science, or like networking architect and data scientist. After covid I didn’t do very well in school and will probably need an extra semester to complete my degree w my minor. I struggled w my adhd but I got an adhd coach and I am now back in my feet. But my gpa suffered SEVERELY. I am very smart I promise but I burnt out and just couldn’t function w social distancing and remote learning. 

I didn’t have an internship bc of covid, and I don’t really have any experience or things to put on my resume. I have a few organizations but not too many. I know how to code in Java, and I’m currently learning to use Python, R, excel and latex. (Yes all this semester, they’re for my classes but I am trying to do more outside learning/practice to develop them on a more professional level). I do want to do like a boot camp but that’ll have to be either this summer or next semester.

So like, what are my options in applying to internships? What type should I even be applying for? Should I be applying for like basic freshman level internships since I don’t have any experience? Would they even take me? Will my GPA or lack of experience be a major issue? I know I’m not the best candidate on paper but I’m really dedicated to learning about this field and extremely interested. I would like to go after the best opportunities I can and get an internship that I can learn from but can still challenge me. 

Also side questions, can I put my coding stuff that I’m currently learning on my resume I probably won’t feel qualified in these until at least March but I am definitely going to learn and master all that I can before summer."

[Indian Male, IIT, Raising a VC, Bioinformatics, Entrepreneur]",enlightened_by_death,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/lbwi40/deferred_mba_profile_review_advice_am_i_kidding/,"Hey guys, this is my first post on Reddit :)

I was planning to apply to M7 deferred MBA programs next year (2022), so I still have a year left to apply. After coming across a couple of contacts who got admitted in recent years, I had a hunch that maybe I have a shot. If I do, I wanted to fully capitalize on the opportunity &amp; try my best to orient the next months in a way that would benefit BOTH my deferred profile &amp; job prospects.

**Background**: Indian, Male, 21

**Academics** :

* College : IIT (Top 3), B.Tech. &amp; M.Tech. in Electrical Engineering \[Quant intensive course\]
* GPA: 7.75/10 in Bachelors, 8.8/10 in Masters (ongoing)
* Certifications : CFA L1 passed \[&gt;90 in all 10, Top bracket\], CFA L2 candidate
* All India Rank 1 in Aryabhatta Maths Olympiad (All-time record 100% score, probably the hardest math olympiad in India)
* KVPY scholar, HDFC Bank Meritus Scholar \[Math awards\]
* 2 SPRINGER Journal Publications on Bioinformatics research

**Work Experience** :

\[Have 2 full years of experience till now through in-semester internships &amp; vacation gigs\]

* **VC Investment Consultant** @ Stanford University : Linking Stanford's Swiss tech startups to investment rounds from US VC firms.
* **VC Investment Analyst** @ $90M early-stage fund \[Top ranked micro-VC of India\]
* **VC Investment Analyst** @ $35M deep tech fund \[Have a return offer\]
* **Investment Banking Analyst** @ Mid-market Indian investment bank \[Healthcare division\]
* **Quantitative Trading researcher** @ INSEAD \[Professor is an LSE Stanford guy\]
* **Bioinformatics Researcher** @ Top European University \[Published 2 SPRINGER papers\]
* **Independent Consultant** : Advised 3 startups in fundraising, product development &amp; growth \[Hired 4 people, earned INR 1 million in revenue\]

**Leadership Experience :**

* **Global Associate &amp; Campus Investment Partner** @ Asia's 2nd student-led VC fund: Raised $1.5M for the fund from global VCs &amp; angel investors. One of our portfolios went on to qualify for Y-Combinator and raise $1M further.
* **Co-Founder** @ B2B SaaS Tech startup: It's a tech startup to improve access to technological innovations to the grassroots. Incubated by a VC firm, won 7 competitions, managing a team of 11 people.

**Community Impact :**

* **Campus President** @ NSS, IIT \[India's highest public service program for students\]: Best volunteer of the year awardee.
* **Mentor** @ 2 student organisations, held 15+ events and workshops regarding curing stuttering across local schools to help students from my own successful attempt at curing stuttering.

**Pre-MBA Goals \[if I get an admit\]** :

* Run my SaaS startup and probably aim towards acquisition by the only other player in the market
* Scale-up my VC fund across India \[and truly make it an Indian Y Combinator for collegiate startups\]
* Venture into angel investing, spread tech awareness, meet new people &amp; explore interesting ideas

**Post-MBA Goals \[Probable\]** :

* Join a global healthcare focussed VC fund, and gain valuable experience
* Advise my collegiate fund to be THE biggest student-led fund in Asia \[doable\]
* Start my own healthcare VC fund a couple of years down the line \[And use money as instruments of change, as Chamath says xD \]

**Personal Story :** Failure story of my father's healthcare business due to lack of money &amp; bad management, scarred my childhood financially. Wanted to shake things ground up, and use technology and capital to provide resources to companies that my father didn't have 20 yrs back.

**Target Schools:** HBS, Stanford, Wharton, Columbia, Booth

**Questions** :

1. I do not have a good brand on my resume except IIT and INSEAD \[and maybe the BB/hedge fund that I would join post graduation\]. Is this gonna cost me dearly?
2. Between joining a lesser-known VC fund \[but it fits my story\] and joining an HF/ BB bank \[Trading\], which one would improve my chances more?
3. Do I have a shot at any of my target schools? What can I do more to improve my profile in this one year that is left?"

It can be hard to stand out in piles of resumes of bright young students who take challenging courses and do research projects in the topic especially when some of them go to schools like Stanford, MIT, etc.  I managed to get my foot in by focusing on both ML and specific industries.

First, take a few credits doing ML related research.  My university allows you to count research as an upper level elective and this will teach you a lot!  Take a lot of academic classes, learn about it, you know the drill.  Second, get a regular software internship in a field you want to work in, and learn all you can about the industry, get some good experiences.

When you go to apply to jobs, you will have ML research AND experience in the same industry!  This can put you ahead of 90% of the competition!  There are a ton of people who know a lot about machine learning and a ton of people with experience in the defense industry but if you've spent a summer at Lockheed and you have some research projects under your belt, you will be way ahead of the competition!

lc0jho,1,2021-02-03,Am I giving up too easily if I drop the mathematics minor I started this year?,tlacct,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/lc0jho/am_i_giving_up_too_easily_if_i_drop_the/,"It’s my fourth year of college, but I’m going an extra year to finish up a second major. Last year I made the decision to add a mathematics minor on top of my software engineering degree to improve my qualifications for graduate school. I knew it would be a major crunch to finish it before 2022, but I went ahead and added it with the assumption that I’d be able to put in the effort. The first class I’m taking is a course on mathematical writing and proofs. 

Unfortunately, I’m finding myself extremely burned out after four years. In particular, last year was extremely taxing because I was taking hard courses and working on an internship in the middle of covid. I thought I was up for the challenge when I added the minor (and I’ve been putting in a lot of work over the last few weeks), but I just feel terrible. I’m not a lazy person, but after so many difficult semesters I kind of just want to take it easy and catch my breath. 

Failing my first test in the class today has me considering dropping the complete minor and just taking the calculus course my advisor recommended for graduate school. That’s all I was going to do initially, but I couldn’t get financial aid for extra courses unless I added a minor. I just don’t know if I’m giving up too early, if I need to suck it up and correct my shortcomings, or if I legitimately need to address being burned out."

In y’all’s opinion, does dropping this course and having a “W” on my transcript hurt my chances of getting a job/ you internship?

For more info:
- I’m a junior, and still on track for a data science minor
- if I drop the class I’d still be taking the right amount of credits
- I’m also doing independent research and a TA, which I’d be able to give more time to research

I feel trapped in my program,questionofconfusion,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/lc1g5u/wrong_school_choice_just_the_pandemic_i_feel/,"I'm pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at a T20 program, in my second year, and I feel trapped.

I made the decision to turn down an offer from a T4 school, and there hasn't been a week since March that I don't question that decision. One of the major reasons I chose the T20 school was my advisors. I did a Master's at the T20 school as well, and I got to know the faculty well, especially my (now) advisors. They're both really great: they both work closely with me, they're supportive and invested in my success, and one of them specializes in interdisciplinary research that I'm especially interested in. I got plenty of advice when choosing a school, and one of the biggest pieces of advice I got was that advisor choice is very important, so I'm grateful for them.

My advisors think I'd be successful in academia, and so they have been pushing me on that route. But my interest in academia has waned greatly over the past year. I'm unsure that research is what I want to do in the future, and I'm also not looking forward to 6 years of tenure ahead. I'm interested in exploring more connections to interdisciplinary work, but I worry my advisors are holding me back from other opportunities so I can focus on research (they'd rather I just work on research this summer, same as last summer, instead of pursuing an internship or collaboration).

Moreover, the T20 school is starting to feel really small: no one else in my lab is interested in an academic career, and more broadly the opportunities to get involved in collaborative or interdisciplinary work are limited, and I'm losing my mind working on solo projects. Some exceptional students in our lab are co-enrolled at other institutions, so they also have access to opportunities that I don't. Meanwhile, while reading interdisciplinary studies, I keep coming across exceptional people at the T4 school with similar interests and projects that I can't help but wish I could have collaborated with or at least gotten to know there.

I'm sure the pandemic is a factor, so I don't think it's fair to say now that I don't enjoy research. But I'm afraid that if I keep limiting myself to research, I'm going to miss opportunities that will help me figure out what I really want in the future. Should I just stick to research through the pandemic?"

Since this is my junior year internship, I would likely convert to full-time next year, and I'm really conflicted about which offer to take. I've listed some details/benefits/drawbacks to each position below and would love any feedback!

Microsoft:

* Program Manager Intern - Virtual, Full-time in Redmond, WA (thoughts on living here?)
* Cloud + AI - Azure Cognitive Services team (Very very excited about the team)
* Big tech company
   * Lots of clout (I think so?)
   * Not much upward mobility (I'd assume more lateral)
   * Slow and bureaucratic
   * Get to work on really cool ML projects
* Good compensation (not huge deal for internship, but important for full time)

Roblox:

* Product Manager Intern - Virtual, Full-time in San Mateo, CA (went to college in Bay so I'm familiar with area)
* Don't know team yet (scared of being on boring team)
* Start-up
   * Great culture
   * Easier to move up
   * Fast-paced
   * Worried about getting ""stuck"" in gaming industry
* Great compensation (about 25% more than Microsoft)

Overall, I got great vibes from Roblox as a company, but I'm a bit worried about not knowing what team I'd be on, and I'm not sure how excited I am about working on a ""kids"" gaming platform. I think the team at Microsoft is great, the overall reputation is better, and I'd get to work on groundbreaking products, but I'm scared of getting bored in a large, corporate company. I would love to hear people's thoughts on what I should do. Thanks!"

I'm a 31yo undergraduate majoring in Statistics at a well-regarded R1 research university. I'm intelligent and generally competent, but I am quickly approaching graduation and I have no idea what I'm doing.

Before transferring here from a local 2-year school, I was a waiter. I've only been a university student for 2.5 years, and I only declared my major a year ago. My GPA is \~3.75, but I have no internships and otherwise little experience with programming or data analysis outside of the classroom. My resume is better than bad, but worse than good.

I recently applied to a local 10-month Master's program, but it's quite selective, so I assume I will have less experience/merit than other applicants. If I am rejected, I'm considering applying to a 2-year Master's of Info Science program at my school, where there is a Data Analysis track. I am considering these programs because I believe myself unqualified, but I need to create income sometime soon.

Using this information, what are some sensible next-steps I can take? What does my situation look like from an outside perspective?"

Hence, I’ve been recently looking for full-time opportunities.

Initially, I thought that I will be pursuing a PhD but after getting rejections from 50% of my applications so far, things are not looking that good for that. I thought to myself: “hey you have a good background, finding a job shouldn’t be so hard” but things have definitely turned out otherwise.

I’m currently sitting at roughly 260 applications over the past 2-3 months. I’ve even had referrals for some of the big tech companies but mainly I keep getting flat out rejected almost everywhere. The furthest I’ve gotten was a 3rd interview round at Amazon but in the end they decided to go with another candidate. And I’m not applying to unreasonable positions either, all of them are either entry, internships or require very little experience (1-3 years).

I don’t think of myself as a bad candidate either, I did a work integrated Bachelors where I was working during term breaks as a Software Engineer which amounts to roughly 1.5 years of experience, was a SWE intern at IBM, and have recently been doing research in Machine Learning over the past two years in two different groups at one of the leading institutes in Europe. All while maintaining a very high GPA. 

Of course, applying outside of Germany is currently a little more difficult with the COVID-19 situation but I’ve been trying to apply to, both, positions within Germany as well as overseas (many positions in the US) but it seems to be very hard, at least for me.

Is the market so competitive recently? How are other people perceiving this? Am I really that unemployable? I thought CS was supposed to be easiest during these times? Are people with visa requirements still getting hired?"

I have been reading around to find suggestions on whether one should pursue a second bachelors or a masters and found a lot of interesting posts, but wanted to present my own case to get some more personalized feedback.

To introduce myself, I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering (3.057 overall, 2.828 in major) from VT. I did a minor in computer science (3.3 in major) and found that I enjoyed this much more than my major. I spent the first few months of 2020 at an internship doing fixed-wing aircraft maintenance (I like airplanes/aviation) which was interrupted by COVID while for the remainder of the year, I mainly worked on my own personal project (self-employment). The project is unrelated to my major yet I still ended up doing some coding for it and learned a bit about cloud hosting on Heroku and some multithreading with Java. This project has actually been successful to the point that it may actually be able to fund my continuation of CS studies too.

So now comes my currently dilemma:

&amp;#x200B;

\- My results are not very competitive to directly pursue a masters degree

\- I don't really have that much interest in research (or maybe that's just my growing lack of interest in ME talking)

\- What I found most interesting about CS was the coding, data structure applications, development opportunities, and so would like to find work that falls under this

With these points in mind - combined with suggestions I have found on the internet - it seems that the best route for me (and that preferred by employers) would be some pre-requisite courses to then apply for a Masters program. But that seems to contradict with what my main interests are and that perhaps a second degree (maybe not the full 4-years due to my first degree?) would work better...

I guess I could also add:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Currently I am leaning towards studying in Canada (and then looking for work there too). My BSME is from a US college so perhaps applying to another US college would be ideal, but I am an international student and have read/experienced that is near impossible to get a visa sponsor for work in the US

\- I was able to apply my minor during my senior year which resulted in more experience coding in C, additional work with Linux/VM and implementation of an open-source solution for remotely operated underwater vehicles; more to add to my CS resume I guess

\- I'd like to spend 2021 preparing my application and working towards any supplementary material that could offset my lack of work experience and lower grades, but would like to know which path I should ultimately be taking to better schedule this"

I've got a few questions,SmartSpray,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/lc8mws/anyone_on_here_enroll_or_apply_or_know_of_anyone/," I've seen some posts of people leaving their phd after 0-2 years and asking about mba admissions. This wasn't really the case for me, as the first 2 years of a phd in computer science are mainly coursework. I'm in my 4th year and considering taking a job at a big tech company (not faang, but on the same caliber). I'd work for a few years in ML/data science, then apply for an MBA. 

Have you guys seen people who have pursued MBAs after dropping out this late into a phd? Am I going to be at a disadvantage due to age? I'll only have like 2-3 years of full time experience, so I'd be like 29-30 when enrolling. I'm guessing my phd labwork + internships don't count for work experience.

My mom was VERY verbally abusive growing up, and I’m pretty sure my dad has undiagnosed aspergers, so he wasn’t stepping in when my mom would go at me. He’d just stare and shut down. I don’t blame him, but it was tough.

So, after the divorce, my mom turned into a different person. We get along very well now, despite going almost no-contact. I live with her and I have been since august 2020, when a big argument occurred at my dads house. He’s been having a girlfriend, which he didn’t tell me about, but everyone has been asking me about her because he’s openly posting her on Facebook. That really hurt me - and he wouldn’t understand why. He was laughing at me while I was crying, which honestly made me lose my respect for him. 

Also, my mom works every other weekend, and he planned to have my sister the weekends where my mom work, so my dad could hang out with his girlfriend “kid-free” (but with the girlfriends kids still there though)

My sister is 8, and my dad and my mom are using her as a “messenger”. Like, my sister was the one to tell me dad I wanted to move into my own apartment. My sister shouldn’t be the one saying that? She’s 8?
My dad has sent me a message once, planning to go eat at his house. But he forgot about our plan that day.

He’s texted me again asking if I want to hang out. I honestly don’t want to. I don’t think I owe him anything. I just feel horrible saying no. What should I do? I’m pretty sure he’s not together with the girlfriend anymore. But he hasn’t told me, just posts on Facebook. I feel so sad that he feels the need to tell Facebook before his own family. 

Some advice please? Thanks I’m advance."

I recently graduated from a top US institution (top 15 in the world, top 10 in the world for my undergraduate field) and am aiming to apply for the MScAC program (CS concentration) in the next 2-3 years. I am also an international student. My profile right now is as follows: 

GPA : Cumulative GPA (over 4 years)  - 3.15/4.0 ,  Final-year GPA - 3.80/4.0 

GRE : have not taken 

Work experience : one 3-month internship at a startup (more data science oriented though) 

Research experience: none 

I have a few questions: 

1) The website says that they only look at the final year GPA and even though my final year GPA is high, am I at a huge disadvantage for having a low cGPA? 

I've struggled with medical conditions throughout my undergrad years and was even put on reduced course load (2 classes instead of 3/4). Before that, I was doing very poorly in classes because of it and my GPA was consistently low. However, my GPA has been on an upwards trajectory for the last 2 years ( 3.3+ in the last two years, 3.80 in the final year). I have been undergoing treatment and hope to be better within the next few years. 

2) Is there anything I can do to improve my GPA or explain my GPA situation to the admissions comittee?

3)  I'm currently looking for full-time positions in industry cause I need to earn money to support myself. Is there any work experience that is more valued than others?

4) How can I improve my profile in the next few years to be a competitive applicant?"

I was struggling to avoid homelessness but unfortunately I couldn't couch surf with friends past Christmas. 


A coworker mentioned that her neighbor was looking to rent out a room, &amp; after getting in touch with the landlady, we came to a verbal agreement where I would pay $500 a month for a room in a 3 bedroom house, &amp; I paid the first month in advance before moving in. However, I have fallen behind on this month because I'm trying to catch up on other bills, &amp; I'm trying to work with her to pay her, when during our latest conversation, she told me that I'm not 'renting' the place, &amp; on the invoices she has sent me, I noticed that she is claiming the rent is an internship fee. She basically is trying to claim I'm not a tenant, but an intern, &amp; wants me immediately removed from the premises. 

I'm pretty sure this is illegal, because on top of this not being an internship but a short term rental, the house has some glaring structural problems I was not made aware of before moving in. The roof is exposed &amp; leaking in 2 different rooms in the house, &amp; the roof of my part of the house is also giving due to water damage.

I met ‘Hannah’ about 2 years ago who is a sort of informal mentor to me. She has been very successful and has lots of valuable knowledge to share with me,  giving me the kick up the backside when I become complacent with my progress and motivation with pursuing contacts in the industry I want to go into. 

She contacts me once or twice a year and about a year ago she got me into contact with somebody that I ended up doing an internship with. Which was obviously very generous and kind and I am extremely grateful for her and what she has done for me. 

However, the woman and I still have a formal relationship. 

Recently I wanted to get an internship that is more specialised in the industry that I want to focus in, and I finally got a position working for the firm that I want for a few months. (nothing to do with Hannah) This was really exciting as I don’t have any background in this industry, nor know anyone working in it,  so it was a proud moment for me. 

 I  informed Hannah when she contacted me recently about the good news and she was of course very encouraging. 
But about an hour later she texted me asked for a ‘quick favour’ to ask my future boss to call her (basically link her up) as she is a business woman and constantly wants to meet new people for networking reasons and work that she does. 

My first gut reaction was stressed, I wanted to enjoy my good news in peace. I felt like she was taking advantage of the fact that I finally have something I can offer her. (Yes I am unfortunately pessimistic with people in business)

I know that business is tit for tat, but equally this is a big opportunity for me that I got off my own back. 
The idea of compromising this position for me makes me very unnerved, as I still don’t know my future boss very well. We have only spoken around 4 times. It would be completely out of the blue for me to abruptly ask her to call someone I know… 

I also think it is weird because if Hannah really wanted to speak to this woman she could easily find her online and contact her there. And she has reached out to people thousands of times. 
I also don’t necessarily want to be associated with Hannah in this context because it will implicate me if Hannah and the boss don’t want to work together. 

Hannah messages me about 2 weeks ago and honestly I left it, wanting to pretend that Id forgotten about it (yes I am a coward) 
But she has messaged me again the exact same message. But i don’t feel comfortable just yet as I don’t know the woman I will be working with enough. 

I know for business people this is a normal occurrence to call people just like that but honestly I don’t have the confidence in myself yet. 
Is it horrible of me to feel this way? 
I also haven’t replied to Hannah yet so any suggestions on what to respond with would be appreciated. I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

Ps I know this is the most trivial problem!! I am just confused. Thanks"

The current choices for me are Chem and Econ: 

1) I'm pretty good at Chem and have been acing my chem classes so far, but I dread physics and really am having second thoughts about this stream because of future job prospects and how limited it is to chem and delves greatly into physics rather than chemistry in general. 

2) On the other hand, there is Econ, a subject I'm vaguely interested in after reading books and anyways plan on doing the entrepreneurship minor so it seems to have a good overlap with the same, but I've never taken an econ class so have start from 1/2; from what I've heard, they are horrible. 

3) I am taking a gap in spring to do an internship and I can't really do these long stretches of online uni so I was going to do Econ 1 and 2 over the summer but again I'm overthinking and having cold feet about this. If I do econ in the summer I'm also falling behind on chem if I do choose to stick around.

I ended my internship in August 2020 and got an email in October 2020 stating that they would like me to return as a full time hire and are getting the final approvals to prepare a formal offer letter within the next few weeks. I was obviously very excited about this opportunity, given the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this company despite having only interned remotely.

Given the fact that I all but had this in the bag, I didn’t concern myself too much with applying for jobs because I was effectively in the green, as far as I was aware. After the initial correspondence regarding my status as a candidate for potential conversion to full time hire, my recruiter provided me with monthly updates letting me know that they were still getting the necessary approvals to present the offer but that it would not take much longer.

Fast forward to now, February 2021, and after 4 months of keeping me waiting for these business level approvals I’ve just been informed that there are budgeting issues for the intern conversions and that they have placed candidate conversions on hold until the budgeting can be completed, something which I was told has “no definite timeline”.

All this time I refrained from applying for additional jobs because I thought that I was in the clear and would get my formal offer letter any day now, but to hear that I’ve essentially been put on hold has put me into panic mode because I feel like I’ve missed the timelines for 2021 graduate positions and am now scrambling to scrape the bottom of the barrel in case my intern conversion matter completely falls through.

I know that I should have been actively involved in searching for jobs as backup because nothing is certain until it is in formal writing, but I felt very confident about this opportunity.

Since I’m graduating in 4 months and may potentially be waiting for this budgeting matter to be resolved for longer than that I am beginning to fear my immediate post graduation employment status. I was told that in the event of an update regarding budgeting approvals that I “would be contacted in the hopes that I am still interested in the opportunity then”.

This news has been completely disheartening and I don’t know whether to start panic applying for jobs or just wait this out and see how it plays out for the intern conversion."

I think the amitriptyline has a very little impact on my depression and keeps me from falling into the deepest depression. Additionally it helps me with my sleep but does nothing regarding my social anxiety. 

Right now I‘m a dumbo and abusing phenibut and kratom daily (which also are very subtle to me) as I‘m in an internship which is a must-do for my bachelor degree and without phenibut and kratom I wouldn‘t have done it, came so far or being able to the intern tasks I do here. It‘s still one week to go, after that I‘m going to quit phenibut and kratom and 100% experience withdrawal which will give me deep depression and anxiety again, I‘m sure.

Well I wrote so much about my trials forgetting to mention the point of this post. Social anxiety was and still is the main source of my depression. 

My symptoms are mainly anhedonia (lack of interest, nothing that stimulates me or makes me fun); deep psychologically extremely hurting negative thoughts and feelings of emptiness and that I have failed life and will fail from the moment I open my eyes in the morning; cognitive deficiency (caused by yearlong depression); social anxiety and all its symptoms and restrictions to life (a big problem for me is that I never am able to think about anything to talk about, my head just feels empty and inhibited, as if I had no knowledge, memory or experiences at all); then also psychosomatic pain especially in my back, neck, shoulders. Even walking a bit or just standing, keeping body posture, sitting or walking stairs are incredibly exhausting for me. Social anxiety hinders me to build relationships (friends/romantic), open up or be myself and going out, in short it hinders me from experiencing life and developing. For example I hide in my room when I hear that my roommates are in the kitchen (even if I really have to pee or I‘m hungry as fuck). If friends ask me to do something I always invent excuses because my anxiety and panic grows big. If I‘m walking in the city or somewhere and I see someone in 100 or even more meters coming the same direction to me I’m like paralyzed and thinking about how to act for this one second he will be near by me. Like holy shit crazy unnecessary stuff I can’t control. I think that everyone observes and criticizes me, doesn’t like me, just waits for me doing something wrong and so on and so on. Irrational and exhausting things like that which continuously add up to my low self esteem of course.

And what is a life without humans and social life, without being able to build up real relationships or feel interests, passion or fun. I feel like I don’t have a own personality. I feel like I don’t even know myself. I feel like my future has nothing to give. Life feels like living in a dead body for me. I feel alone, a painful emptiness and as if I have nothing to offer and no worth or skills, nothing. 

How should I even have developed myself or skills not taking part in life because my socially anxious brain hinders me from living, experiencing and by it: developing. It takes me all my self esteem and lust for life being like this. Just because of social anxiety. In short feel like a dumb, mentally and physically retarded, incompetent, always bad mood, antisocial and worthless washout. 

So my question to you, how to continue? How should I ever be able to work a real job like this (depressive, socially anxious and „dumb“), build up true relationships and have true friends and true girlfriends? (With true I mean relationships that I build up because I really wanted, relationships in which I can be myself, have fun and especially finally be able to open up.) How should I some day be a father of a family, feel fun, interest and passion, enjoy life and get through all the challenges and so called „life tasks“ that life will bring?

About my resources:
I‘m 21, in college, no future perspectives because of what I wrote about. I don‘t see myself functioning anywhere...
1. At least I was able to almost get through my bachelor somehow, am in 5th from 6 semester now (even if I took one year break in between). I don’t know where to go or what to do after my bachelor.
2. I have friends and family. But I can‘t be myself, open up or feel fun, even at my closest family members or friends. It all feels so untrue for me. As I said I feel like I don‘t have any personality. Everything feels so unreal, daunting, horrible and painful or just boring. 
3. My physical appearance is no problem to me, without wanting to sound narcissistic I really am a pretty motherfucker (I get this told a lot lot). But this doesn‘t mean anything to me, it has no value, it doesn‘t give me any self esteem at all. I‘m still a mental wrack and slouch. I still feel as if really anybody else is 2000% better than me.
4. I had girlfriends and sex. I’m mentioning this because it was something that really helped me a bit as if I kind of checked this life task off like: Job done!
5. I am really anhedonic but still I produce digital music for Spotify sometimes and people seem to like and support it.
6. Im interested in neurosciences but it’s nothing I could make money with.
7. If you would ask me about my hobbies I would say tennis and skiing.
„Hey see you have interests then“ yes but this is on a very anhedonic way. It still all feels so painfully empty and I’m just not able to feel/get stimulated by any of those things. But I can say that tennis and skiing help me with my negative thoughts for a moment.
7. We aren‘t rich (my parents are divorced btw) but I would say we don‘t have any financial issues.

Thank you so so much if you read until here. I could write on and on. Like how my childhood was, what I have experienced etc etc. but yeah I tried to write down the most important things which could be useful for anyone trying to help. If you need any further information please just leave a comment and ask me anything you want!

What are your suggestions for me?

If you suffered from social anxiety too:
What was your way of losing this horrible disease? Or more: What was your way of becoming more social and talkative, being able to open up and just be yourself. I really just want to be able to talk and talk and talk, have fun socializing, open up to other people and just be myself. Right now it seems like I‘m faking 100% the whole time and that‘s so exhausting and feeling wrong and bad.

My therapy as well as I think social anxiety is really the biggest source of my depression as it hinders me from having social boundaries (which is really important for the human species), living life, going out and just experience things to be able to develop and grow in personality and knowledge. I feel like I kind of stagnated since I was 15 and started to become capable of perceiving my social anxiety and it‘s restriction =&gt; so: of course depression, a very low self esteem and restricted not enjoyable life."

lcp5eq,19,2021-02-04,Junior in college without work authorization. Getting nervous closer to graduation.,FewTemperature4492,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lcp5eq/junior_in_college_without_work_authorization/,"I'm currently procrastinating studying for my midterm tonight so I thought I'd make this post which I've been meaning to for a while.

I'm a third year student at a T20 university with a T10 engineering program. I was able to get into a research fellowship in my first year and have been doing that under a professor in the department for the last three years. This program gives me a stipend every quarter, as due to my status, they can't directly pay me. So instead, they ""pay"" me through a stipend through the university. 

I've been applying for internships since my first year but it's a moot point since I always have to check ""no"" when they ask me if I'm a US Citizen or Permanent Resident or if I have work authorization. I've been in this country since I was two, but I've never been able to legally work. Every FAANG or really any company I've applied to asks this, and in every case it results in an automatic rejection email for obvious reasons. 

DACA recently opened up as Biden was elected, so I've applied to that but that'll take 3-8 months to receive an EAD if it's all approved. I've looked into unpaid internships but everyone always recommends against them and the companies that offer them always have horrible reputations online when I look them up. I can't find any well-known company that does unpaid internships.

Over the summer, I emailed the CEO of PlayStation on a whim to ask about something, and I didn't expect a response. I had already applied to their internships before this. We talked shop for quite a bit and he was so impressed with me he recommended me to their university recruiting manager, who then looked over my applications where I answered no to the work authorization question and gave me the same ""Unfortunately…"" email I'd seen countless times. This was really depressing, but a completely expected result. She said I could reapply if I got authorization by next year, so that's something to follow up on, I guess.

I'm getting worried now as it's my third year and I have zero internship experience. The earliest I get DACA will be in my fourth year, but I should be looking for a post-graduation job in my fourth year, not my first internship. It's just demoralizing. I don't see the point of having worked so hard in high school to get a full ride to a T20 only to not be able to do any outside work in all my years here. I love my research projects and am passionate about them but I am not so naive to think that that alone on my resume will be enough.

Advice is appreciated."

Recently, I started interning with an incredibly large firm that has offices scattered throughout the world. The staff is wonderful, my advisor is super caring and trusting, and I've felt extremely fulfilled in all of the assignments I've been given. I genuinely feel like a meaningful part of the team and, more broadly, the firm. My internship is set to last through the rest of the spring semester.

Now here's the issue: I've been applying to summer internships concurrently while interning at this company, since I know the general rule is you should try to meaningfully intern at a few places before graduating. But as I keep working for this company, I keep gravitating towards working there even after I graduate.

For some context, I'm currently a junior and will be graduating in Spring 2022. I intend on living a fairly ""globetrotting"" life and genuinely don't see myself staying in one place for long. As a result, I intend on working for a company that can support moving around a lot. I know that very few companies can accommodate - let alone tolerate - this and I happen to be interning at one that does.

The firm has almost one hundred offices throughout the world, with offices located in all of the cities I intend on moving to once I graduate and beyond. I've had virtual meet &amp; greets with everyone on the team and they're living all over the world as well. It seems like the perfect company given my long-term professional and personal goals.

Should I strive to intern at this place until I graduate, in which I will very likely receive a full-time position (another employee on the team also interned before joining as a full-time employee)? Or should I look for other places to build up a diverse set of skills and experience with the intention of returning to the company? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)"

They're really young and on their first year of uni and their knowledge is a bit all over the place. 

I'm supposed to teach them Node.js, Typescript and some basic linux commands/AWS stuff so they can start to contribute meaningfully in an upcoming project. 

This is basically my first time training people so I'm trying all I can think of.. basically:

- Have them write some small projects (basic input validation, write an API that returns data, call an API..)
- Whenever someone finishes a task, we hop into a meeting and I help them explain their code to the other 2
- We have a group where I send a lot of pointers and suggestions and they can ask questions
- I break down my sprint tasks and if I have a really easy one, we also hop into a meeting and I'll code with their help while explaining stuff

This is going ok-ish, intern #1 is thriving beautifully, intern #2 is a little lost but seems motivated.. but intern #3 hasn't finished a single task and seems not to give a shit. I'm hesitant to be strict with them as it's only been a couple days, but I'd like to see if yall have any suggestions on a different approach to reach them.

Anyway, I'm completely open to suggestions. I'm actually really excited to have this opportunity and I really want them to learn and thrive in this company."

I’m currently looking for internships, but having a really hard time. I’m a computer science major who’s also majoring in theatre. Theatre has been my passion for a while now, but I’ve also been interested in programming so i’ve been getting the CS degree to make sure I have a solid education once I enter the workforce. Unfortunately, however, I’ve realized that having multiple interests has really hurt me. I haven’t taken on any big coding projects or built anything that I can show to employers. I know a lot about coding but since I’ve also been interested in the arts I haven’t been able to devote the time to independent projects or groups.

Basically, does anyone have any advice for what field I could look for internships in? I have a strong interest in technology and media, along with branding and user experiences, and also a love for the arts. It seems like every place requires a portfolio or something like that, and as a college student interested in many areas I just don’t have one. Is the best path to work on making these portfolios?

lctfhx,36,2021-02-04,TIFU by sending my supervisor a mildly inappropriate and very immature joke on Zoom,_telemarketing,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/lctfhx/tifu_by_sending_my_supervisor_a_mildly/,"""Wait, did I send that to the correct person?"" – the thought that everyone who's ever written something risky in Zoom chat has had. The fuck-up is bound to happen one day, and today was the day.

Recently, a friend of mine (whom we'll call Jean) and I started an internship at the same company, developing statistics software. Today, we're having a weekly meeting and everything is going as ordinarily as possible. One of the other devs is talking about some charts he needs to write code for, and one of our supervisors (let's call him Leo) asks the dev: ""what about a P-P chart?"".

Now, what you need to know is that Jean and I have an awfully immature shared sense of humor. If there is even one mention of anything phallus-related while we're in the same room (*or in the same Zoom meeting*), one us will tell the other: ""haha peepee"". You can see where this is going, because the ""P-P"" in ""P-P chart"" is pronounced just as you'd expect.

So, Leo asks: ""What about a P-P chart?"". And I, being true to myself, message Jean: ""Leo said pp chart heehee"". Usually, I'd see my boy Jean smirk after one of these enlightening quips, yet he doesn't even acknowledge that he's seen my message. A bit anxious, I check the Zoom chat. ""Surely, I didn't send it to Leo by accident?"".

I sent it to Leo by accident.

Before I even start processing, I'm already trying to unsend the message. But it's too late. Leo saw.

Leo furrowed his brow for a sec and went on with the meeting, while I drowned in shame for the rest of it. I can't look my supervisor in the eye (or the webcam) again.

**TL;DR: I messaged a friend on Zoom ""our supervisor said pp heehee"", because my sense of humor is trash, except I actually messaged our supervisor and now I'm just embarrassed.**"

It’s simply math for me. I love cs I’ve done all the cs classes I can take that will transfer to major universities but the math is kicking my ass so to say.

Even if I wanted to take a break and take some cs classes I can’t because to be admitted into engineering school and take the core cs classes I’d have to finish calculus 2.

I would really like to work in cyber security that side of computer science is just so interesting to me, but getting this college degree is a personal thing for me, I’m this far I wanna get it done, but I am genuinely at my knees because of calculus 2 this class is awful.

I should be asleep by now and this post might be badly written because of that, but I couldn't stop thinking about this and I could use some advice, encouragement, I don't even know. Something.

I'm on my penultimate semester of university, doing a SWE &amp; CS major. In my country you have to choose a major as soon as you enroll, and I decided to take that one because I was very good at math and had already done tiny bits of programming and web dev. I got a full tuition scholarship from the government, with crazy clauses like ""if you don't graduate you have to pay all the money we spent on you"" and ""you can only switch majors in the 1st year"", to lower the dropout rate and save themselves some money I think. I had many doubts about the major through the years because I'm indecisive as heck, but paying was not an option and I don't know what I would do if I dropped out, so I decided I'd just keep going with this major, try to get good grades and graduate.

Now it's time to actually think about the future.

I don't have any job or internship experience. Zero. Actually, it kind of scares me, not just the soul crushing reality of jobs but mostly the job hunting process. Having to convince these people that I'm hirable when I'm not sure I have the skills they want, or that I really want that job; having anxiety attacks at the interviews, if companies even accept my desert dry resume. I should be getting ready for my first job as we speak, but what type of job should I get ready for? Front end? Back end? Mobile dev? Data analysis?

The thing is, I feel like I have lost the little interest I had on programming over the past months. Maybe it's because while I really liked the calculus, CS and programming classes, the complexity and boringness of IT management, software architecture, cyber security and finances were too draining for me. I haven't been interested in any frameworks or small side projects lately. I haven't coded outside of class. I think I'm in some no-purpose I-don't-know-what-I'm-doing route. I say I want to be a writer instead but can't even write 1 page. I say I want to make music but can't be consistent at any instrument. I say I have to work out but I stay all day on my bed doing nothing. I have even neglected my online friendships, and I don't have any offline. Heh, I hadn't really reflected on how badly I'm living until now.

But despite all this, like the title says, I still need to get a job and make money. I have expensive tastes. I want to travel the world. I want to move out of my parents' at least. I think they're counting on me helping them financially soon. I got some pressure on me alright.

This semester was supposed to be my last one, but I decided to join the uni's internship program next semester to get some experience before the real thing. I'm still nervous at the application process though. I have no idea how I'll get through it. Also, since I'm taking few classes this semester I've been thinking I should use the extra time to gain some skills that could help. But what should I do? Fuck, do I even want to do anything?

Oof, this was long and ranty. I don't know what will I get out of this, but at least I'm glad I got it off my chest."
lczh6d,0,2021-02-04,"Berkeley Bullying, Harassment, and Stalking",Livid_Photograph,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/lczh6d/berkeley_bullying_harassment_and_stalking/,"I‘m a CS major and have been experiencing severe bullying, harassment, and stalking by the university, particularly the CS department, for about (likely more than, who knows) a year now. I ignored the issues and relocated out of the state of California in the hopes that it would stop, but the harassment continued and I have moved out of the country. How do I handle this situation? 

&amp;#x200B;

Formal reporting methods would take too long due to all of the complications and likely wouldn’t resolve issues because the stalking is in the university’s interest and they want to cover it up. Specifically, the department has been a horrible fit for me and I’ve wanted to leave since first semester but continued for years due to parental opposition (my abusive and toxic parents told me I would fail and commit suicide at other universities and I’m simply too stupid to get into another university and I shouldn’t even try and put any effort into transferring, plus they are reluctant about financial support and recently purposely lost their job) since they’ve already invested semesters of expensive tuition for nonresidents and they are blindly enamored with the (undeserved) prestige of Berkeley CS undergraduate degree since they are Asian. This resulted in my parents calling the police on me and reporting to the CS department after several very heated and abusive arguments about their opposition to transferring out, so the department hacked all my devices and has been monitoring everything along with harassing my friends and peers and passing the monitoring to peers to defame my reputation and shut everyone up as well as to make it difficult to find a job or maintain positive past relationships. Essentially, they are sabotaging and stalking me to instill fear in the name of “helping“ me so I don’t damage their already declining reputation regarding undergraduate education. However, I need to transfer out and complete my undergraduate degree after years of learning little since the program is a horrible fit and because the department is toxic to me. My past employer has also gotten involved in this illegal monitoring and stalking, as well as potential future universities that I have expressed interest in for transfer/graduate program. Due to defamation, they believe I’m the one with problems, while the actual problem is that the university is a horrible fit for me as an individual (since complaining about the university’s unacceptable and unaddressed issues is not allowed — the masses of successful students are a testament to the problem being me, not them — and mutual incompatibility is the only acceptable way to characterize the issue). This defamation makes all future employment, education, and personal and professional relationships very strained/negative. I had already experienced forms of career sabotage in my last internship, described vaguely as subtly not subtle explicit racism, gossip, lack of appropriate feedback, device and personal monitoring, and information withholding from superiors, that make career progression difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I address this retaliation for past complaints against the department that are protected under free speech because they are true, valid, and objective observations and experiences I have had as well as get the university to cease bullying me and my peers and stop defaming my professional reputation so I can transfer to a better program and start a career in a different subfield?

I have no experience with internships, struggled through a good number of my higher level theory courses, and I'm not as good at coding compared to my classmates. I am terrified of graduating in the spring as I don't have any side projects that I could use to pad my resume either. I have seen many posts of people saying they couldn't find a job even with internships and a good resume.

What are the chances of me actually landing a job with the lack of experience/good resume? Surely there are others who have graduated that have been in the same situation as I am. If you are one of those people, do you currently have/been offered a job? What did you do to prepare for the job and how hard was it getting the job? What other careers could I look at with a CS degree?

Sorry this a little long, but I finally had the self realization that I don't know what to do with my life. I probably won't be replying tonight as I have been up since 6:30AM and I feel like I am about to crash. However, any and all advice is greatly appreciated."
ld0s5o,5,2021-02-05,Recent grad can't find job,NEETxNEET,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ld0s5o/recent_grad_cant_find_job/,"I graduated in marketing in January 2020, and LA went to shit at the beginning of March due to COVID-19. I still remember how empty everywhere was and how we all were isolating. People eventually stopped caring, but I live with sick family that I've cared for all throughout high school and college, and I can't risk them catching the virus. I naively hoped hiring managers would be mindful of this gap in my resume and lack of experience. Before I knew it, it was July--7 months after graduating and no work.

I switched majors a lot in college, and couldn't land an internship in the 1.5 semesters I was in marketing before I graduated. Essentially, I graduated into COVID-19 with no experience to my name. I didn't know anyone, either. I fucked up big time, but my experience in classes led me to believe I was at least as good as the other students doing well.

Sure, no experience. That's in the past, and I had to move forward. I studied a lot of digital marketing, learned web design, got some certifications. Most of my classmates don't have these skills, but they have experience. I tried my best to be competitive. I still can't find a job.

What should I do? I have skills, but no experience. I can't get hired because I can't get experience. I'm applying to internships even, and still no luck. I look up digital marketing intern/entry level jobs, and I'm still applying despite being unqualified. No calls back.

What should I do?"

I couldn't attend UIUC for the Fall of 2019 because of personal reasons. I started to attend ASU. I hate this school for many reasons. Has to do a lot with the general lack of quality in education, internship and professional opportunities, and the students here (two of my CS classes have had the zoom chat identical to twitch chat [without the fun of twitch chat], nonstop spam, unfunny jokes, and nothing of substance) It seems like this school has settled for nothing but average. I feel that this school is weighing me down.

I'm a CS + Mathematics major with a 4.0, upcoming Trader internship, research experience, and some solid personal projects. I am also an Illinois resident, so I am in-state. Overall, my resume is pretty good IMO. Not the absolute perfect student, but a decent one at that. 



I got accepted into Industrial Engineering @ Grainger during my senior year of HS. I am currently in the second semester of my sophomore year of college. What are my chances of applying and getting into CS as a transfer? I am open to all suggestions or concerns that you guys have."

I know that there are other posts on this subject but looking to gather some insight as my situation seems to be a little different (I think) and I'm trying to find out what I'm doing wrong. 

 I've been trying to break into an entry level IT job for a while now (3 years) and haven't had much luck. I've earned the degree, I had an internship (security analyst intern) and I try and stay on top of all the news and trends. In college, (while I was not the computer whiz from my class), I was pretty resourceful and I loved to learn.  Highlight of my college days was being the first student to break into the machine our professor had assigned to us and ""steal"" the secret documents.  After doing so, I helped my fellow classmates figure out how to do the same so we could all complete the task.  While this pales in comparison to what some of you guys and gals have done (probably much younger than I am), I was pretty proud of it because it told me that I still had the passion for it and to me, it was fun.  

As stated, I am an older individual.  I had a 20 year career in the military (non-technical background) and completed college afterwards.  While I did have a side hustle when I was a kid setting up small home networks and small businesses (back when everything was wired), that was well over 20 years ago.  I have spoken with people in the field, who have recommended getting certs and ""branding"" myself with certain qualifications such as cloud computing etc, but I feel that there is a lot of learning there and that I'm running out of time.  I did get hired at a Marketing company as a customer support rep but I had to move locations and to be honest, did not enjoy the job much as it was remote (temporarily) and I found myself dreading clocking into work as it was not fulfilling as I had hoped and did not excite me as much as the security internship had.  

Currently, I am preparing to attend classes again to prepare myself to start taking some of these certification exams (CompTIA A+, Net+ and Sec+).  I have just moved to a larger house, so I have the space to set up my labs and stuff again.  I'm working on my python skills, reading the books and listening to the podcasts, so I feel like I'm doing all the right things.  It's a bit daunting when you look at the job listings calling for 3-5 years of experience, certifications and security clearances (if your into government/contract/security jobs).  Since I have moved a considerable distance, I am also working on building a network at my current location.  Apologies in advance for the long-winded post and seriously looking for solid input.  Hopefully, I didn't come across as looking for a pity party.  Not looking for pity but rather insight on what I can do better."

Didn't really start applying till a few months ago. I applied to help desk positions and got a job in there for 30k/year. I know it's kind of embarrassing a cs grad. But this is temporary and I am not really well at coding. never had a job before or internship. I need advice on what i can do after this job, as the contract is only 4 months. I am hoping to level up from this somehow.  


My friend was saying to get a job in cybersecurity or learn linux and get something linux related such as system admin/etc. IT analyst was also something my friend recommended. I honestly don't want to make a lot of money and don't want a high stress job so making 60-70k starting out and moving up is fine and peaking out at 90-100k is good enough for me.  


I basically need advice as I just turned 27 right now and I am trying to use my cs degree except I suck at coding so don't really want a software engineering job/coding related. Although, my friend was telling me to try out web dev such as html/css/javascript etc. I was good at assembly language as well.  


So, I am basically want to know is working at this help desk job fine as at least I don't have a lot of gap year/s and am working somewhat related to cs although i think anyone can do this call center job. But I do want to level up and make more money than this obvs and how can i use my cs degree if i don't like coding, what can i learn/put in effort to so i can get that job with the amount of money i want to make. I am also wondering what can I do after this help desk job in the IT field and how can i level up from it and what other type of jobs can i get in the IT field that are better/pay more."

Make sure that the programs you’re applying to are worthwhile or learn a little about how to conduct independent research below. Side note - I meant to post this earlier, as some programs deadlines have already passed, but a lot of the information for other programs wasn't released until recently.*

If you haven't already checked it out, [here's my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kx6fpi/summer_programs_for_high_school_students_covid/) on summer programs in general. Check it out to get an general framework for evaluating summer programs on your own. If you're interested in science research, you've come to the right place.

Meaningful, wet-lab research opportunities are hard to come by for anyone, but especially high school students. In addition, top school admissions offices continue to signal that they reward students that have research experience, many schools allowing students to submit work through research supplements on their applications. There are programs that tout lab experience over the summer, but they often are just one or two week programs and don’t actually contribute to ongoing research projects. On the other hand, there are a number of free research programs that contribute to meaningful, current research and are long enough in length to form lasting bonds with professors and other students. Getting a recommendation from one of your research advisors at one of these programs can really help STEM students stand out from the crowd in college admissions.

The problem with some of these top research programs is that they often only accept students who have prior research experience. This is the same kind of catch-22 situation that college graduates often experience when job hunting, asking for experience in the field for an entry-level position. It can certainly be frustrating for students, but it signifies the value in students planning their early high school summers to get less competitive research experience so that they’re competitive for the more difficult programs later on.

Top summer research programs can be extremely competitive, and there are a number of programs that try to emulate what they do to generate revenue, so the following list is to try to help guide your summer research. We can certainly debate how much better certain programs are than others, but this is based on my own experience working with ambitious high school students over the years. There are a number of programs that I don’t know enough about to make a judgement on. You can find an exhaustive list of great summer science research programs through *Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth* [here](https://cty.jhu.edu/resources/academic-opportunities/internships/science.html).

The list below represents science research programs that just about every good STEM school has heard about. To get a better idea as to the competitiveness and admissions value of each program, I’ve tiered the programs into three categories: S-Tier, A-Tier, and B-Tier.

# S-Tier: Must Go If Admitted

1) [Research Science Institute (RSI)](http://www.cee.org/research-science-institute)  
Program Dates: ***Online - June (six weeks)***  
Application Deadline: ***January 16th, 2021***  
Cost: ***Free***  
International Students: ***Yes (separate application process)***

2) [National Institute of Health - High School Summer Internship Program ](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/sip)  
Program Dates: ***Numerous locations and dates (eight weeks), TBD online/in-person***  
Application Deadline: ***February 1st, 2021***  
Cost: ***Free ($2,000 monthly stipend)***  
International Students: ***No***  
***\*\*\* Bonus: NIH also hosts the*** [***HiSTEP***](https://www.training.nih.gov/histep) ***and*** [***HiSTEP 2.0***](https://www.training.nih.gov/histep_20_home_page) ***summer programs***

RSI is the cream of the crop in terms of summer science research programs. It’s one of the most competitive summer programs that exist for high schoolers and is run by the Center for Excellence in Education, the same people that run the USA Biology Olympiad (USABO). Admission to RSI is just as competitive, if not more competitive, than admission to the Ivy League+. Because it is a free program, the applicant pool is just as diverse as it is competitive. Make sure that you have top notch GPA, test scores, and prior research experience if you want a chance to get into RSI.

The NIH Summer Internships Program is also an amazing opportunity for domestic students. This eight week program is run through the National Institute of Health, meaning that you’ll be working on actual, government-run projects. The application is quite involved, but the NIH SIP website gives a lot of great resources to navigate it. One of the downsides to the internship is that they do not provide housing for interns and they have limited locations around the US. As a result, it helps to live close to their labs on the east coast. Interns will actually get paid a stipend for this program, just like many other government-run programs, so competition is extremely high. NIH also offers the less-competitive HiSTEP and HiSTEP 2.0 programs that can also be great experiences.

These seven programs are less competitive than RSI, but they are still extremely difficult to be admitted into. Each program’s acceptance rate is likely under 10%. As such, many of the top universities in America, particularly the STEM-focused schools, look extremely favorably on students who have attended these summer programs. (in particular, MIT) These programs range from free to paid programs that cover a variety of fields and topics. The rankings here are certainly debatable, but overall, they are all programs that most admissions officers at top schools have heard of and provide invaluable research experience that admissions officers are looking for.

Keep in mind that not every research program covers the same academic subjects and that some programs rely on you to come up with your own research question and thesis. For SSP, students choose the Astrophysics or Biochemistry track and then participate in ongoing projects. For RISE, students apply for a certain track and then participate in existing research within that field. For programs like Simons and Clarks Scholars, students are responsible for coming up with their own research focus and will be paired with a related research mentor after getting accepted to the program. Make sure to know what kind of program you’re getting into. For programs like Simons and Clarks Scholars, part of the application will be asking about your research interests and gauging your ability to find a meaningful research question. This adds another layer of difficulty in the application process.

For the paid programs like RISE, they usually offer up meaningful financial aid, so I would encourage everyone to apply and see what they offer if you’re a competitive applicant. Many of these programs like to see prior research experience as well, so for younger high school students, look to the B-Tier programs to get some experience or get creative and try your hand at some independent research to show your interest in research.

These programs are still meaningful experiences and can be great for students in their sophomore year who are not quite competitive enough to apply to the higher tier programs. Depending on the college, they might know about these programs and hold weight in the admissions process, but more value can be found in getting a great recommendation from a research advisor.

There are certainly a few more programs that belong in this category, but these are the ones that I have experience with. If you don’t care about admissions value, these programs can be a great option to spend time in the summer. However, without the residential experience and community aspects of the virtual programs, they might not be worth the cost.

# What about Independent Research?

Independent research projects can also be a great way to at least show the drive to do research, even if it isn’t as sophisticated as research done in a lab. If you’re clever, resilient, and resourceful, you can find ways to collect research data without the need for a lab. A lot of students are getting into data science, bioinformatics, or computational type research that can be done remotely or on a computer. Bonus points for these students for showing initiative and determination.

In addition, some students will contact professors from local universities to see if they can contribute to ongoing research through an informal internship. Securing this type of arrangement oftentimes requires a TON of cold outreach, networking, professional materials (resume and cover letters), and patience to secure. I’ll try to write an article on how to do this effectively, but Stanford’s Office of Science Outreach has a great pdf with [tips for finding an unpaid lab placement](https://oso.stanford.edu/files/programs_299.pdf).

There are also a growing number of paid services that will connect you with research mentors who are often actual professors in particular fields. These programs can be quite expensive, so be careful when considering this option, as the admissions value of the experience is going to be hard to quantify without any tangible results (Research competition awards or published research). As always, the unpaid programs usually have the most admissions value.

ldabj7,1,2021-02-05,Looking for advice on what to do next. I am halfway to my bachelor's degree and am interested in being able to quit my retail job as soon as possible,iama10rightnow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ldabj7/looking_for_advice_on_what_to_do_next_i_am/,"So ive been working in retail for 5 years, since I was 16 years old. It sucks. I should have found a different job years ago but I'm still here so don't remind me. I'm not very sure what to do next so I'm just going to lay out where I'm at and hopefully someone has some advice for my next goals/moves.

So I have only taken basic programming classes so far like basic Linux, python, databases, a few java classes, and a bunch of general education classes. The next two years are gonna be more focused on my major, computer science (bachelors). I am interested in becoming a software engineer (or developer, I don't entirely understand the different yet) but i enjoy programming and ideally am looking for a job where I can just use my programming skills. 

So I've spent a lot of time on my own learning web dev and python. I now know the basics of how to build a basic website and the basics of python but I'm starting to question if that's all just a waste of time. I'll probably end up learning these things again in a course or two anyway. I currently know the basics of python, basics of web dev (mainly just HTML and css so far), most of the basics of Linux, and am pretty familiar with java. 

My estimated completion date of my degree is May 2023 and I really don't want to waste another two years on this shitty retail job. I'm not looking for another retail job either... well that would be a last resort. But I just don't know what else I can even do before finishing my degree. I feel like I'm stuck here until May 2023 and even then, i have to go through the applying to jobs process. I just feel lost and feel like I have no way out of wasting another two years of my life. 

If it was worth it, I would spend a lot of time learning a language like python or something if it meant I could find some way to use those skills to make money. But freelance seems to be impossible based on what I've read... and its much much easier to get a job with a degree... So i don't really know what to do. I also cant really afford an unpaid internship since i have a car loan and rent to pay monthly.

So I have an internship this upcoming summer, and I have gotten two offers at the same time:

Company A - I already interned here winter 2020, fantastic place, fantastic work environment, would love to work here when I finish school (1500 employees worldwide)

Company B - Just received an offer, same industry as Company A, but it is a much bigger company (24000 employees worldwide)

In company A, I will be focusing on analyzing and automating reports in PowerBI and SQL, in company B, in the interview he said I will be doing a whole load of things, essentially doing the job, but the main skills I will develop will be Tableau and SAS

I KNOW I like company A, however company B has been on my radar. 

One factor is, company A will be based in downtown Montreal, where I would love to live for this summer and indefinitely, Company B is also based in Montreal but the position will be in Brampton for this summer, which I will not be super thrilled about, because nobody wants to live in Brampton lol

I will NOT be at head office for Company B, just another office in the country. Both companies are in the same industry, both companies offer the same pay

Should I instead learn PowerBi and SQL, or Tableau and SAS. Should I try deepening a connection at company A or trying Company B to get more connections, even though it will NOT be head office"

Don't give up! I don't have a degree, I didn't go to bootcamp, nor did I start with an internship. All that matters is that you genuinely learn the skills, work hard and never give up. 

I know people like to think studying for an hour or two a day will cut it, but my one reality was that I studied a lot more than that. I worked full time, so many days I couldn't touch my computer at all-- so that meant on any days off, I was coding 12-14 hours. On work days I still aimed for 2-3 hours when possible. 

The last thing I can say is BUILD BUILD BUILD! Learned CSS/JS? Build a tic tac toe game. Make a pretty website. Learned React or Angular? Build \*another\* tic tac toe game, then build an even prettier website. Learned Express/Node? Build a Password Saver or an I.T. Logger.

If you can't stay motivated, build a project that appeals to you. One of my first bigger projects was an online rpg game that I built using random anime pictures off the web. I never published it or anything, but I sure learned a lot about programming."

I even joined ROTC for two weeks because I thought the military might guarantee me a job out of college. 

I know this is often the time for new students to be looking for internships but not getting them because they don’t have a lot of experience. I want to say this is okay! r/csMajors can be kind of toxic when it comes to accomplishments and things like that. You don’t have to be go go go all the time; your first summer after college doesn’t need to have an internship. 

I ended up applying for summer camp positions to teach and ended up loving my summer! I even got to take a summer class to get ahead in my schooling. These summer camps were about coding so I got to use that experience to springboard me into internships!

Even if you don’t get a job or do a class this summer, you can go to hackathons and check out workshops (mlh.io Major League Hacking is a great resource!). It’s easy to get into a funk I know, but it’s going to be okay! 

If you didn’t get an internship your first year or when you just got started, share your story!
If you’re just starting and you’re stressed out, feel free to vent."

Been a lurker here and loved reading everybody's questions and success stories. I can finally contribute to that. My heart is still racing after I got the call.

Some background: I am currently a senior at a university studying IT as my major. I have zero experience in the IT field and did not do any internships. I, however, was a server at the same restaurant for 7+ years. Even if I lacked any experience, my manager liked the fact that I have some experience with communication and effectively dealing with customers. I also do not have an certs and only have an AA as a degree. A month ago, I got a call from my manager saying that they saw my resume and did a phone interview. He also noticed that I have no IT experience.

During the interview,  I thoroughly expressed that I am willing to learn and that this job is a great opportunity for me to grow. I even stated that my dream goal is to become a System Admin within the next five years and that this job is perfect for me to learn the ropes to essentially help me reach my goal.

After two rounds of phone interviews back to back, my manager hired me because of my passion and eagerness to learn as well as my bubbly personality. Laughing and smiling during phone interviews help a great lot and sounding ecstatic is also a plus. I know circumstances may vary but this is from my personal experience on how I got this particular position.

The pay is great ($22/hour in FL) and is a full-time job from M - F. I basically set up Zoom calls and make sure the computers are ready for the professors before the start of their lecture. I also help with technical issues with students at the university.

I am so excited to start this new chapter in life. I like to thank this sub for helping me gain the confidence I needed as well as the motivation you guys bring to the table.

I know it's just an entry level job but I will celebrate each success. I want to work my way up and continue to learn. Also tomorrow is my birthday so this is the best birthday present I can give to myself!"

ldf1y1,19,2021-02-05,Kellogg vs. Tuck - Need to Make a Tough Choice!,starrystream31,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/ldf1y1/kellogg_vs_tuck_need_to_make_a_tough_choice/,"Hi everyone,

First, I appreciate how active and engaged everyone in this community is. It’s been super helpful to have this sub as a resource going through the application process, and I hope I can pay it forward some day! I’m fortunate to have been accepted R1 to my two top schools, Kellogg and Tuck, and I’m having a very hard time making a decision (with the deposit deadline now one week away). Wanted to write down my thoughts (actually, more of a stream of conscience) on a few of the factors that are important to me and hear perspectives / input from others. I’m happy to hear either the “hard sell” for one or the other or a more objective perspective on what choice seems to make the most sense. Thanks in advance for any of your thoughts!

**Reputation**

* Overall, it seems like Kellogg edges Tuck in most of the rankings and is a bit better known in the business community. Additionally, it seems like Tuck has slipped a bit in more recent years.
* However, rankings are not super important to me and I consider both schools close enough to be comparable, so I don’t know that this will be a deciding factor.

**Finances**

* I’m fortunate that my company is sponsoring me for my MBA, so this isn’t really a factor.

**Academics**

* Both schools offer a pretty even mix of lecture / case study / team projects / experiential learning, which is what I’m looking for.
* It seems like Tuck may edge Kellogg slightly when it comes to pure academic rigor.
* Tuck’s Centers really stand out to me, particularly the Center for Health Care and the associated fellowship program, as I’m primarily interested in health care after my MBA.
* On the flip side, Kellogg’s Health Care program seems a bit less structured, but I have heard from students and alumni that the classes and professors are amazing and that students are heavily involved in planning a significant annual health care business conference that I’m interested in being involved in.

**Travel**

* I believe global collaboration is an integral part of business, so this one is pretty important to me. Although I grew up in the US, I was born in another country, spent a full year abroad undergrad, and have traveled internationally for work as well.
* Both schools have great travel opportunities.
* Tuck actually has a requirement to gain international experience while there (TuckGO), and the Tuck Global Consultancy field course is interesting to me (though not too different than what I currently do at work).
* Kellogg offers a ton of academic and non-academic travel opportunities. On an academic front, I can definitely see myself doing either Global Initiatives in Management or Global Lab, and on a non-academic front, the pre-semester KWEST trip sounds nothing short of legendary.
* I think Kellogg edges out Tuck here due to variety and quality of the programs.

**Career**

* While both would open the door to fantastic opportunities, it seems like Kellogg has the edge here due to size / scale, geographic distribution, and variety of industries represented.
* Immediately post-MBA, my plan right now is to return to my current company (I work in Consulting at a reputable firm). However, I’d be open to pivoting to a different opportunity if I came across one that I couldn’t refuse, and recruiting will also be important for an internship between the two years (haven’t decided what I want to pursue yet, but potentially health care tech / health care VC or PE).
* Career opportunities will probably be more important to me longer-term if I do return to my company and look to exit to industry in the future, which probably becomes a question of alumni network.

**Alumni**

* I think this comes down to a bit of a quantity vs. quality question. Kellogg obviously wins here in terms of quantity; it has more alumni and they are more spread out both throughout the country and across industries.
* I’ve talked to many students and alumni at both schools, and they both rave about their alumni networks and how engaged and supportive they are, so I think both schools have high-quality alumni networks.
* However, given how small Tuck is and how famously loyal its alumni network is, I feel it might edge Kellogg slightly in terms of quality.

**Location**

* This is actually a tricky one for me because I’m not 100% sure where I want to end up after my MBA. I currently live in Boston and most of my family is in the area, so it would probably be the “default” choice post-MBA. However, I’m not necessarily opposed to moving; I traveled for work every week pre-COVID and don’t mind it, so I think I’d be comfortable with traveling to get home when needed.
* Tuck has a large alumni base in Boston, so it would obviously be easy to return to Boston if I went there and have alumni / friends in the area. However, if I ever moved somewhere other than Boston / NYC, the alumni pool would definitely be more limited.
* Kellogg has fewer alumni in Boston (and on the east coast in general), but probably enough to be sufficient. It seems like most people end up in Chicago, and I like it there, so wouldn’t necessarily be opposed to moving. 
* In terms of on-campus life, this is also pretty tricky for me. I went to a small liberal arts school undergrad, so I know I’d be comfortable in Tuck / Hanover’s environment. I also love outdoor activities like hiking and skiing, so I’d fit in well with the activities at hand there. However, the distance to the airport / city is definitely a drag. 
* I visited Evanston a few weeks ago and I really liked it. It honestly seemed like the perfect college town that blended campus life with a nearby urban scene of bars / restaurants, as well as nature (Lake Michigan). There is a probably a greater variety of opportunities / activities to do there for any speed.

**Community**

* This is probably the most important factor to me. Not to sound shallow, but since I have job security post-MBA, I want to have the best experience possible over the two years.
* Both of the schools seem like they have very close-knit communities with a ton of school spirit. At Kellogg, everyone goes to the school-sponsored TG happy hour at the end of the week and hangs out at Five &amp; Dime, the local MBA watering hole. At Tuck, it’s a similar story: everyone goes to the school-sponsored TuckTails happy hour at the end of the week and spends a lot of time at Murphy’s, the MBA bar in town. 
* Given the size of the school, I think Tuck might be slightly closer-knit than Kellogg. More students live on or near campus, everyone is in the same 2-year MBA program, etc.
* If I had to summarize, I’d say that the Tuck experience seems a bit more homogenous than the Kellogg experience, while the Kellogg experience is a bit more self-directed. At Tuck, everyone has a fantastic experience, and it’s a very similar experience given the size. At Kellogg, everyone has a fantastic experience, but folks are more intentional about carving their own paths and self-selecting into the communities and experiences that they want to be a part of based on their interests. Neither one is inherently better than the other since they both lead to great experiences; they’re just different.

Anyway, I’ll end that long-winded monologue here and spare you from any further musings. Appreciate your points of view!"

I love my team and they seem to reciprocate that, as they tell me how much they greatly appreciate all my contributions and even extended my internship an extra 8 months with talk of full time after.

I am a student though, and school is back in session, meaning my hours have been reduced from 45 per week to 20, which is great. However, with this reduced time, I’m not able to debug my code as much since I’m trying to work faster and get more done in the shorter time frame. This has led to a few mistakes/buggy code being pushed into production by me.

Half of me just wants to think ‘oh bugs and mistakes in code happen. My managers haven’t angrily called me out and there’s never been rude/unwanted confrontation by them about my errors. We just mutually know I need to fix them and move on. I’m still a good intern’

But the other half of me asks whether I’m making too many mistakes. It seems every other gd day now I’m up at 5am trying to fix a bug that a user reported at 2am of which the root cause traces back to a recent update I pushed. 

My question is, am I allowed to make common mistakes like these as an intern? I’d think I’m expected to make some mistakes since I’m new to the workforce but I don’t want to be making too many where it’s detrimental to me. Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice to provide? It would be very appreciated"

My role was that of a full-stack developer working in Java based microservices. I joined this company as an intern and continued working there. The first year was all new to me and the people around me seemed to be very smart and I learnt stuff everyday. I was happy.

As one year past, I learnt all is not well with the product vision and started raising my opinions about the culture and engineering practices. To be very honest, I wasn't abusive or anything, I just wanted to let them my leaders know how I felt and help them.

Fast forward 2 years later, I'm always praised for being an advocate of good engineering practices and following the industry practices, but get fucked over in the performance review. Got peanuts worthy of salary increment without being told what I did wrong. While my peers, who are mediocre at best and aren't really aware of the industry standards get all the nice increments and benefits without adding any real value or reporting flaws. 

I feel I could have been in a better place had I not tried to voice my opinions and sucked up to the leaders. Lesson learnt. Doesn't matter how much you know or want to change the way things work, all that matters is are you making your manager and his manager happy.

First of all I want to thanks you all, for your support during this pandemic.

I was doing a reconversion to be a developer and after 1 years and 3 months, i finally got a job as a web dev junior.

I did start my reconversion by learning (by myself) C ( lots of C) after that I did some c++, but it would be hard to find a job with C programming ( lots of students who go out of school know C).

So I decide to teach myself web and mobile programming, i did some small website project with react/ nodejs/postgresql.

I did work like hell every single day..

This allow me to land a intership in a startup where I have to do a social network app with React-Native and firebase.

After finishing my internship, i did apply to a lots of company to try to have my first jobs. 

At that time I knew
 - JavaScript / Typescript / c / c++ / python / java / ruby
 - reactJS/ React-native/ RoR
 - nodejs / expressjs / jQuery 
 - mysql / MongoDB / firebase / postgresql 
 - android studio
 - docker / kubernet

I just did one month of search before finding one (i so lucky to have one so fast.)

Before I start searching for a job, I never did a single  interview, so the more interview i did the better I was performing (the key is to sell yourself). But it went well, if you are not to weirdos, it pass :D.

For reference, i land a job in paris that pay me 40k/years. That is good for someone with no degree.

My job is to be a full stack web developer.

I am really happy about it :) 

It was a really hard year ( i live alone ) and the  pandemic didn't help, but it pay off :).

I am really grateful for all of you, everyone on reddit have helped me and motivated me to keep going :)"

1) University Honors Program. I was admitted to the honors program and took some honors courses, but graduated without meeting all the requirements (didn't graduate with honors). Should I still put it? Is it misleading? Should I clarify it somehow (and if so, how)? 

2) The projects... are those the types of project descriptions that employers want? I feel like the info I give in that section is too trivial and specific, but I don't know how to explain the project and highlight my general skills concisely.

3) Internship... is it too old to include? Should I just not put the date?

I've talked to some people about this involved in the tech industry and I'm still a little unsure about where to go from here. 

To give some context: I am a junior computer science major and have not had an internship yet, but I am slated for one this Summer (not a Big-N company but still fairly well known). I recently got an offer from a separate company close to home (I won't have to rent) for a co-op right after my summer internship. The thing is that the position I'd take at this co-op, although it was advertised as a Software Developer I, is more along the lines of software validation and manual testing rather than software production. After talking to the engineer I'd be working under, he said I wouldn't need to know much knowledge about the software beforehand since they'd teach me, I was never asked really any technical questions during the interview before the offer, and he said himself the only coding I'd do is if I wanted to automate some of the testing.

It still seems like a good offer (the company is legitimate besides this), but I'd probably have to delay my graduation if I wanted to take the job. I'm not sure how much this experience would help build my resume if my goal is to become a software engineer at a large tech company in the future. After talking to some peers, I think my next option is just to email the engineer and tell him my concerns about the role and ask if I could write more production code rather than just QA since he also oversees a team of engineers that do the code production (he just isn't looking for anyone right now). Right now I'm leaning towards just declining the offer but I wouldn't want to let a possibly good opportunity slip  by. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!"

I recently received the survey asking if I want to go fully remote or hybrid this summer for the Toronto office. I was wondering if anyone was in the same position and what they were leaning towards?

I would love for some of it to be in person, but we won't have assigned desks and the amount we go in is completely up to the manager we are assigned. So I am on the fence about whether relocating is too much of a gamble.

For extra detail, relocation stipends are paid whether you choose remote or hybrid. If I go hybrid, I will be paying 2 rents over the internship as well. That being said, I would still 100% chose hybrid if I was guaranteed a few days in the office every week.

I'm going to computing and financial management at waterloo Sep 2021 and will have my first internship May 2022 or winter 2022. 

I'm interested in the data side of fintech and like the analytics part of it. I want to intern for a Canadian fintech company, probably something in waterloo or Toronto because I know a lot of them like wealthsimple, borrowell, financeit, flexiti and more.

Right now I am learning using codecademy pro.

Ive done Java and command line. Working on finishing python(didn't finish the whole thing).

I work on the codecademy projects on visual studio and practice coding problems for CCC.

I'm planning do their computer science pathway so I learn basic computer science theory and the basic shit like algorithms, data structures and recursions, stuff I see they ask for those coding interviews on YouTube. 

Then do a analyze date with python skill path, then data analyst pathway, finish rest of the data science courses, and then move on to machine learning. If I put in at least a hour of coding each day I should learn all of this by next summer to next winter. Probably earlier since I'll be university and doing this everyday. 

What kind of things should I learn to be ready for a data type co-op? 

What are some tips for me to become a better programmer and have simpler, better code?"

1) Technology is always evolving. My learning ability would start to falter and I may not have the time and efforts to keep up with the technology when I get older. Therefore, I would have a hard time competing with fresh grad when I am in my 40s ( The high wages may not be justifiable when compared to a fresh grad)  

2) IT jobs could be easily outsourced. Companies could hire cheap interns like me or outsource its infrastructure instead of hiring dedicated IT staffs. 

3) Social skills and language proficiency are much more important than the amount of technical skills or certs I have. Soft skills and networking would define how far I can go. 

How accurate is his advice? I am working on my first internship in IT so I have no clues whether he is right or wrong. Any comment is much appreciated."

It's not just leetcode, but distributed systems too.",compscibar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ldqdm2/the_bar_for_high_paying_jobs_is_getting/,"Just got a reject from Amazon and Google because of my lack of distributed systems experience. Interviewed for entry-level positions.

Read, watched, and did tons of system design interviews and questions. Have a bachelors and masters degree in CS with a 4.0 GPA and 2 years (non-distributed system intern) experience. One interviewer even commented my system design and knowledge of distributed systems is well beyond my years.

Grinded hundreds of leetcode questions, read CTCI, read EPI, read tons of programming language books related to my language/stack so I could master it, spent countless hours watching talks on writing good code.

Read distributed systems textbooks and was able to have conversations with interviewers on topics. Even discussed a side project I had been working on for several months where I implemented the Raft algorithm to make a multithreaded high availability scaling distributed in-memory key-value store with consistent hashing and active replication. Benchmarked, and can handle several million requests per second.

Submitted optimal questions for every leetcode problem and walked the interviewer through it every step of the way.

Thought I had it.

Both companies pretty much said the same thing to me:

I performed exceptionally well on every metric but they're simply looking for people with more **work experience** on developing distributed systems.

I literally applied for a generic entry level position, and both of them wanted 2+ yrs experience (which I have, just not in the right field, supposedly...)

Welp. I tried so hard but I guess I'm stuck writing C++ for 60k/yr.

The bar is so impossibly high, now it's not enough to score perfect and have side projects... **you must have years experience doing the job position you are applying for too.**

Not only that, but smaller companies won't even consider me for entry level positions in these fields because they all want 2-3 years + experience working on distributed systems. So I guess I'll never be able to get into a FAANG company or get those 100k+ jobs.

How do you all feel about this situation? Any thoughts on how the trends are going?"

ldqhxg,3,2021-02-06,Internship Stress,ZetaWarrior48,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ldqhxg/internship_stress/,"Internship Stress

Ok, so before I start this, I want to say that I am very stressed when writing this and I have terrible anxiety on top of it, so it only adds to this whole thing. Also, this is going to be a long post, so I wanted to give a heads up to that.

Ok, so in a nutshell, I recently graduated from college and I have been looking for temporary and permanent jobs within the next six months due to my unique living situation (Adult Disability Program that helps students gather the skills that they need). My Dad is paying for my living situation and he’s constantly looking for internships/jobs to partake in and I am eternally grateful for that.

With this in mind, there are two internships that I am partaking in (to an extent). I’m already sign up and working with one internship and it’s a dream job/internship and I’m really excited for it. My problem lies with the other one. I know very little about it despite my research and my Dad signed me up for stuff despite him not knowing anything about my work in video editing (He admitted to me in person). In short, I’m not very good and multitasking on major projects/assignments, I learned this back in 2015 when I tried balancing a 20 hour job and four classes. 

But my dad wants me to go in and do two internships at the same time. I know my limits and I know that I can’t do that, I already have 20 hours a week on the first internship and since this one is presumably going to pay me, I have no idea on how many hours there will be. And I know what your thinking, “You’re an adult, just tell him that you won’t do it and that’s that”. But my father is as stubborn as an Ox and has a very strong “My way or the Highway” type thing.

Now don’t get me wrong, I love him to death, but it’s very frustrating to try to talk to him with this kind of stuff. My situation also includes him paying for everything in my life. He also made the connections for both internships, so I have little say in the matter due to his contributions. I also know how this will go down if I do confront him with this.

I call him, he picks up, I tell him my feelings and viewpoint, he ignores it all and furthers his wants and needs, then I counter it with good points, the. He refutes that stuff, then he guilt trips me about responsibility, maturity, being an actual adult, and an extra tidbit about how he’s paying for everything followed by me caving in and apologizing. And after looking into all of that, I’m too tired and stressed to go through that (To be fair, I would go through that on my best day).

So I decide that I will at least give the place a shot to see what they will offer in terms of internships and stuff, but I had to put off meeting with them twice, once because I had to wait for two days to get a response from my Dad on how to handle talking to an internship when an already had one in the pipeline. (He only texted me for a minute or so when the meeting with said company was hours away and I tried settling this days before hand,and then told me that I’m doing two internships out of the blue on the same day). 

The second time was today and I messed up big time. So I got the times from today’s meeting at 1:00pm and last weeks meeting at 2:30pm, and I only realized it ten minutes before the internship because I was stupid enough to not double check stuff until the last minute. I called and emailed them and told them what happened and they asked if I wanted to come in half an hour later, or later next week. I said next week because “I want to look my best when I see you in person”. That is, in my eyes, a horrible way to explain my reasoning for postponing the meeting to next week and I am beating myself up for it.

I was planning on talking to him to explain what happened because I was planning on seeing him and some of my family during the super bowl. (Don’t worry, I check for symptoms and temperature before I leave 2 days in advance) and I don’t want to argue and ruin everyone’s night (Unfortunately, I have a history with doing stuff like that, especially during the holidays)

I feel like I messed up royally and I feel like all of this work that I done this year has gone to waste. I don’t know what to say or do, and I’m anxious and frustrated at myself beyond belief. I just need help getting through this. What do I say/do."

le02j4,68,2021-02-06,"[JC] To all JC year 1s, here are some advice from a senior",skilio_,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/le02j4/jc_to_all_jc_year_1s_here_are_some_advice_from_a/,"Hey all! Ive been scrolling through this subreddit and noticed many posts about being worried about JC, fitting in, school culture (JAE &amp; IP divide), Subject combination, JC or Poly, CCA selection, etc.. I am a senior who has graduated from JC and in hindsight would like to give everyone here some tips regarding JC. Being a JAE kid going into an IP JC myself, I understand where some of you are coming from but I reassure you that things will get better.

Orientation does not define the overall culture of the school nor does your orientation mates depict your ability to find like minded people in the next 2 years. Honestly, JC is filled with many opportunities and experiences, and therefore theres many avenues for making friends. Be it through your classes, CCAs, enrichment programmes, VIA, competitions, etc. Your group of people is out there, be open and be friendly, you will find the group of friends for you. 

Entering into an IP school, there is definitely a ""barrier"" you need to cross. People generally and will naturally stick with what they are familiar with. Be patient and stay open, people will open up eventually. I feel that in everything that we do if we want something to work in our favour, you have to make the effort for it. So if you feel out of place, put in the effort to include yourself, your efforts will definitely pay off. If for some reason you still feel that you do not belong, I suggest looking out for other platforms or other ways to know people outside of your class, your orientation group, etc. Don't go in with the mindset that you are different, sometimes you are your greatest barrier. Stay positive and you will be fine :)

Subject combination: Probably too late since most of you have chosen your stream. But for those of you looking to appeal

Arts stream: Do take note that there is a limit as to what courses you can apply for in university. For example, you cannot take medicine, computer science (in some universities) and science degrees. There are much fewer degree options. However, if you have a flair for writing and aren't good in Math and Science in general, don't force yourself into the science stream because a) you will either suck at it real bad and be superrr stress or b) you will lose motivation and passion halfway

Science stream: You have a wider range of degree options and some of the concepts you learn may be relevant to your degree in the future so do not play play ah... learn properly. (Am taking a module and some math concepts from JC could be applied but I dont remember anything) (I am from the arts stream so not much comments here)

JC or Poly:

Heres the thing, to be very honest I feel that the Poly route provides a lot of opportunities JC students miss out on. I am not from the Poly route so I cant provide much advice from that aspect. But I can say that if you are someone who is more hands-on, Poly might be better for you. JC is like an intense secondary school. So all of the opportunities (which is a lot not saying there is none) are very academic based. Like normal lor.. CCA, competition, olympiad, etc. But in poly, you will be exposed to work experiences, you will be learning things that are actually applicable in the work force. Think of it as a mini university. So if you do well and get into university, (if you are taking the same course) some of the modules in uni might be similar to what you have learnt in poly.

of course there are more factors to consider other than the above. If you feel that you are not set on a certain career path yet and you want more time to think. Please go the JC route, enjoy your time in school and think through properly. If you feel that you want to go into a career choice which is more application based and not very textbooky. You can consider going poly. For example, computer science. If you go poly and you do well and go uni, the experiences you are exposed to would have overly surpassed that of a JC graduate. And that is very valuable for internship sourcing and especially in your first 2 years of university. (you basically have a headstart)

For CCAs, choose what you have a passion in. It is a platform for you to find like minded friends and... yea a platform to destress and relax. Of course, CCAs help you to build your portfolio and can help you in securing your internship in the future. The experiences you will gain helps to develop your soft skills and provide leadership opportunities. If you will like to find out more about soft skills development or get in touch opportunities to that will develop you holistically, you can join Skilio's telegram channel at [https://t.me/skilioeap](https://t.me/skilioeap). We often provide tips to help JC students like you. Skilio is a soft skills measurement and analytics platform, we also pledge to help empower students towards holistic and soft skills development.

So yep, here are the tips. I hope that its helpful to all of you. If you have any questions, you can always pm me or comment down below, be glad to help :)"

**Before we start:** If any of these ideas interest you, then you should pursue them. **DO NOT** pursue them just for the sake of ""oh MIT 🥵"" . I want to talk briefly about CS right now: CS is beautiful and opens doors (don't write about this in your essay though). A prerequisite to this post is knowing how to program. If you want to learn how to learn programming, read the edit (if you want specific advice, pms!). After acquiring your skills, you might still need to know where to go though, hence this post. I'm also not an AO, but i'm just giving you ideas on what you can possibly do. Take my advice with a grain of salt. Ready? Let's go.

# Passion Projects: Why isn't my code working?

Ah, we have come to my favorite thing in the whole world - passion projects. Why are these so great? It's in the name - **passion** projects. The whole point of this is to build something that you want to build. This is incredibly rewarding and all of these have immense potential. Start churning out quality projects that have potential to have an impact. Try make some sort of impact to be impressive. You should try to have users, make money, or fix a real problem. Moreover, there should also be a *story* there. Scale your small summer project into a start-up. Start selling your service. Start helping people with what you built. Build something cool and have fun with it! Honestly, *anything is fine*.

# Competitions: 24/7 Leetcode!

I ball at coding, yeah that's a sport. Competitions exist for coding, algorithms, development, and the like. USACO is probably the most notable one when it comes to competitive programming. For this you're going to have to practice..practice..practice until competition time comes around. This is not for the faint of heart though. A lot of people really like the problem solving aspect of programming and this is how you pursue it. Put some gel in your hair, drink some chai and start the grind. [Here is a list I found on CS competitions](https://cty.jhu.edu/resources/academic-opportunities/competitions/math.html).

The next type of competition is the esteemed hackathon. You're in luck right now! Since everything is virtual, [here ya go](https://mlh.io/). If you have a ok grasp of programming software, you should be good enough to win some and have a good time. Your given a topic, a day, and your imagination. Start clickity clacking and learning how to build good products fast!

Yet another type of competition are those that I have dubbed ""development"" competitions. These are basically long hackathons where you are given a far longer time frame to build something centered around something and you submit it. I don't have any good examples for these, but they are out there.

# A Nice Shirt : FAANG Preparation.

Go grab your suit and tie. Your MSG and tea. Your rice and chai. This section is about internships and research. Honestly, for internships go email CS professors whose work interests you to aid them in their research. There are guides on A2C: [here is one I like](https://uvasrg.github.io/prospective/). The best advice I have is be short and sweet: 1 paragraph.

For companies, you can either get them through connections or cold emailing if you're impressive enough.

This section is pretty difficult to achieve as it depends on other people and most places are pretty reluctant to take in high schoolers.

# Social Good: Take my award!

This is all about helping people, doing the best with your resources to help those around you. Create a club to teach kids programming, give them an outlet. Create a local chapter of a national organization. Work with NPOs focused on empowering through technology. Tutor underprivileged kids.

You don't have to make Sal Khan quake in fear of your prowess at lifting kids up, you just need to help people out. Make a Women in Stem, a Girls who Code, a Hack Club. Tutor kids at your library. Teach people. If you find joy out of it, it can be extremely rewarding to see people being lifted up by your efforts. Try zoom stuff out during COVID times.

# The Juicy Intersection: I'm pregnant!

I think one of my favorite posts on A2C was one about ~~what happens when a girl and a boy love each other a lot~~ combining your interests to find meaningful and unique ECs. Two interests merging to form a child. It's like a sandwich: the pieces of bread on the end are just ok, but the juicy meat is what you want to eat. If you like CS, \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_, combine all of them to create a whole new world. This one is really up to you. Take your favorite interest (besides CS) and merge it with your other favorite interests. Like sports? Make a sports app, a blog, or do literally anything. You'll know more than I do! Find the intersection, where your interests meet. These happen to be the most unconventional, creative, unique, and interesting ECs.

# The End: git commit, git push

Do what you like. If you have any other questions, want more specific advice, or j wanna talk 🥺👉👈, send a pm my way.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

A lot of people have been asking me ""how do I get started with programming?"".  Since it's a prerequisite for this post, I would like to talk a little bit about that. First you're going to need to figure out a ""why"". Why do you want to learn it? What do you want to build? You have to work backwards from there. Google is your friend - each tutorial, each question, each blog will help you inch towards being confident in your programming abilities. Project-based learning almost never fails, so I would encourage you to try it! As always, ask any questions in the comments. Good luck!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

8/10 - Cheer coach and English teacher who saw me grow a lot during my time in high school and really liked me. (Submitted to all)

6/10 - Biology teacher who I only asked because I needed a STEM related LOR, no close relationship so I imagine the letter was pretty indifferent. (Submitted to schools that required 2 teacher recs)

7/10 - Neurosurgeon I interned for, seemed excited to write it and told me he made it as strong as possible. His professional is very related to the major I want to pursue so I imagine that helped. (Submitted to schools with a non-teacher recommender option)


**Interviews**

So far I've had interviews with...

•Harvard: I thought it went really well. Clicked with my interviewer and discussed out opinions on world events. Was very complimentary and optimistic about my chances (lol)

•Princeton (RD): Went alright, was also complimentary at the end and told me I was a great fit. 

•Stanford (RD): I was the most nervous for this one because I knew my interviewer’s name before the interview (without looking him up), which intimidated me tbh. Still went ok

•Yale (RD): Hardest but most fun interview. She “poked” my answers a lot, and wasn’t as complimentary as the others, but it felt more like an intellectual conversation than an interview which I think is good for Yale. 


**Essays**

8/10. My CommonApp essay was about my love for writing and how it helped me express myself and grow as a person. I’m pretty confident in my writing since I do it a lot, and got a ton of feedback on my essays. My Harvard ones were the first ones I did, and looking back they were incredibly boring lol.

It was a good experience and had a good relationship with my manager and the team. I did not stay I touch with them after the internship but I got a return offer from the company to join a different team. I accepted the offer and rejoined the company last week, the job is still remote until further notice.

I'd like to know what's the best way to reconnect with my former team to let them know that I'm back at the company? I don't see the need to have 1x1 with each member to catch up as I feel they are really busy and I'm also busy myself getting adjusted to the new position. I was thinking of an group email or something similar but would like to hear your thoughts on the best way to reconnect with that former team."

I decided to leave a job in July to up and move to a new city for grad school - no job prospects, just living off of savings. It was a huge risk, and I'm trying my best every day to not freak the f\*ck out, because I love my program and the field I'm (hopefully) going into. This process of looking for even an internship has been absolutely gutting - a constant roller coaster of emotions - but my decision still feels right. So, thanks. 

That said, I finally had an interview last Thursday (1/28). They said they were \***hoping\*** to get back to everyone by the end of the week (i.e. yesterday), yet I still have not heard anything. 

My question is twofold:

1. Should I follow-up on Monday, or would that seem too needy? And what do I say? Like ""I'm still really interested in the job, and I just wanted to follow-up on how far along you are in the hiring process?"" 
2. In your experience (and I hate playing these games, but this is where my mind is at currently), does this mean that they've gone with somebody else and rejecting me is on the bottom of their to-dos? They said ""hoping,"" so my thinking is that something else came up, but I would love to hear everyone's experience on this."

instead he asked the name of my community college, what website I found my internship advertisement, what time i wake up/go to bed, and other shit like the title and the author of the tedtalk I worked on (i couldn't remember the last name of the guy who gave the talk and he gave me such a suspicious look for that; i followed up with an email right after with the name of the guy but it honestly seemed like he was questioning all my shit instead of asking legitimate questions). 

also note he never asked why Princeton, why major (had to squeeze that in myself), and didn't start with a ""tell me about yourself."" spent the entire time questioning and asking all the little specific details I honestly thought were unecessary.

another thing is that i had no freedom in explaining my answers. I'm a very elaborative person and i give very good explanations (which all my other interviewers liked) but he just kept on asking very oddly specific questions, some of which i think were completely unnecessary as it was already on my application? like why ask the name of my school and what scores i got on the ap exam???)

i had 4 other interviews so far with comparable T10's but NONE of them went like this or asked the type of questions he did. pton is truly my #1 and i devoted so much time to preparing for this and i feel like the style of my interviewer really blew it away.

anyone else have a similar experience?

edit: it's not like I failed to answer any of his questions or made a really bad impression its just that I didn't get to fully converse and engage in interesting discussions or portray a side of me absent in my application like I was able to do with other schools. just overall left a really weird feeling of disappointment and suspicion :/"

I'm not sure what I want to do in medicine, but I do know that I want to be in the medical field. The human body is super interesting, and having to information to save someone is super awesome. So for any of the people who have gone to med school or work in a hospital I have these questions for you.

I know that many college students after they graduate dont find a job very quickly, was it easy for you to find a job in a hospital? or did you first work at a normal job to make money? And about money, how was your debt, I read that the average med student will have 300,000$ in debt by 2024, was your debt able to be paid off, as in when you started working in a hospital was the salary enough to make the monthly payments? While in med school did you take internships at hospitals? and also how would you go about finding internships? I know they say med school is very hard, but im guessing it wasn't all hell, how was med school for you? and how did you make it through to the other side? And one more thing, is their anything I can be doing while in highschool to up my chances to make into a good med school?

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's all the questions I have, if you have any more advice or information you think I should know, please tell me! and I know google is a thing but I think being able to talk to people in the field would help a lot more than just reading an article.

&amp;#x200B;

also I know I'm just a junior and have a little more time to choose what I want to do in life, but medicine is very interesting to me and I want more information on it!

I am currently a junior with a biology major and just started a cs minor. I also have been programming for years so I have a few projects under my belt including starting a sneaker bot that I can use for a resume booster. I am also planning on contributing to some open source projects and open sourcing some code to show to potential employers.

I would like to get a job in SWE or biotech but am unsure if my current major will work well with getting an actual internship. I saw an internship at the Boring Company in my city, but my brother said that I wouldn't get it because they don't want people with cs minors. I am currently contemplating on whether I should stay a bio major or switch to a cs minor to help get internships and a job in CS or biotech or just keeping my major right now. I am also considering doing a double major because I am almost done with my bio classes I was hoping on some insight on which option would be best.

I am also wondering what classes would be best to take to get a job if I stick with a cs minor.

Ive been thinking about doing cs for a while now but was always hesitant. I was also more interested in the cs side of cogsci (at least I thought I was, maybe I’m doing it for the money or hype IDK) than the psych side. I also thought that I’d be more likely to land a job with a cs degree than with cogsci. Long story short I changed my major to cs, and I thought that would be the end of my stress. 

Fast forward to present day, I’m starting to think about all the interviews I’d have to go through to land a job in cs. I really suck at interviews and the thought of them scare me. I’m really bad at problem solving on the spot, so I don’t think I would do well in coding challenges. I’m really stupid and I’m not particular good at coding. Unemployment rate for cs majors are also one of the highest. I know there are high demands for tech, but there’s also WAY more competition, and I really don’t think I’d stand out in a pool of talented people. Now I really don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m starting to realize I’m not really passionate about any particular subject. Also all these people with internships and experience make me feel bad. 

So I thought what if I did a double major to keep my options open so that I’m not confined to one major? Like if I only did cs, then I’m kind of stuck with just tech related jobs. And if I only did cognitive science, I’m not really sure what I’d do.   
Can someone please give their inputs?"

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of 2020, I was applying to IT jobs and finally got a call. It turned out to be one of those ""we train you and then find a job for you but you're ours for some number of years so we can make money off you"" things which I had gotten offers for before, but at this point I had been applying to jobs since I had gotten out of college and had gotten only a couple actual interviews in the year+ since graduation (probably due to not taking an internship in college). For anyone that doesn't know, it's basically like 12 weeks of very fast paced learning about tech stuff that they'll find you a job in. Part of the way this process works is that they tell you ""ok here's this new resume"" which has many years of experience and they ask you to look over it, memorize it, and give you basically fake details about the project ""you"" were working on so when an interviewer asks you, you're prepared. I wasn't really thinking too much of it at the time because generally after the interview, it doesn't matter. That's where I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up getting placed at a nice job a few months ago and I have been doing exceptionally well at it, to the point where my coworkers will come to me for any help they need and I've basically assumed a leading role within my subsection of the team. I stay late even though I don't get paid to do so just to make sure things work and get done. I like this job, I like the people, I like the environment. It's great. The company has expressed interest in hiring me in a couple months and I would love to work there.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things get a little hairy. One of my direct bosses (older gentleman, great guy) actually worked at the last place on ""my resume"" and occasionally asks me stuff about it. I've had to avoid answering some stuff because I obviously don't have answers to that. ""What building did you work in? What was your boss's name?"" etc. He's been trying to use this fact to bond with me and admits he thought of hiring me as ""saving me"" from that company he worked at. I hate the lying though. I want to tell him because I constantly fear the next time he asks me about that ""job"" and I want to just be myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to tell him and I can see it going one of two ways: I get fired, or he laughs at me, tells me I'm an idiot or something, and I'm doing a great job. I'm uncertain of how to go about this or even if I should at this point (but I would really like to). I really want to work there. As I said I thoroughly enjoy the environment, I like the people, I find the job interesting. I don't think he's trying to figure out if I worked there or whatever, I think he's genuinely a nice person and is just trying to bond.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't want to keep up this facade of pretending to be someone I'm not. I've saved probably every penny from this job that I don't have to spend in hopes that I can buy out of the contract with the bootcamp thing but I'm still a bit away from that."

legly7,1,2021-02-07,[IWantOut] 20nb Student UK -&gt; US/Canada,Just-A-Twat,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/legly7/iwantout_20nb_student_uk_uscanada/,"Hi everyone, sorry if this is too much detail, and maybe has some irrelevant info, but the rules said to be detailed, so I thought I'd basically cover absolutely everything - feel free not to address it all, any advice is very much appreciated regardless of how brief!

I'm single and planning to move by myself, I'm bisexual, white, male (in the closet trans/nb) first-generation (neither parents went to college, both finished education at 16) without savings, but potentially 3k from my family that has saved over the years for me/my sister to help us with a mortgage. Currently live in a pretty poor town, relative to UK standards, that's consistently been voted the number 1 (or at least top 10) poorest area in the Uk over recent years. I study economics at a top 15 university (in UK rankings). Just saying this, as I have no idea if there are certain schemes (like I know some employers do for hiring) that somehow helps with moving to the US/Canada.

**Moving goals:**

I'm open to moving to many states, but it's pretty mandatory that I move to a city with a good financial sector - Montreal, Vancouver, SanFran, LA, NYC, DC, Boston, etc. - but I'm unwilling to move to the rust belt, deep south (bar Texas and Georgia).

I need a job, obviously but I'm not necessarily looking for permanent residency - as long as I can confidently work and live in these countries whilst working. A hard limit for moving is by 5 years at a maximum, but I'm looking ideally at moving in 2-3 years. Like if it's easier to work for a big company for 2 years, then transferring to NY then I'm happy to wait.

**Career goals:**

Currently looking into going into investment banking/corporate banking/asset management/consulting, OR a masters in finance/econ/business - depending on how COVID and the job market is next year, and if it'll make moving to the US significantly easier (as long as it costs 20k at maximum for tuition, i.e. basically not doing it in the US, but I'm willing to do it absolutely anywhere else in the world that's at least 150 in QS ranking, and teaches in English).

Though I acknowledge very, very unfair - I have a guaranteed potential graduate internship offer in the Cayman Islands/London (and MAYBE, maybe other cities but from what I know, this doesn't include the US/Canada) at one investment bank (one of the top 20, i.e. not a boutique) due to nepotism exclusively. Although I'd rather get an opportunity at any other investment by myself - I'm fully willing to take this if my graduate job searching comes up empty-handed.

I know there's a preferential system for jobs in demand for the US, and I have no idea what to look for specifically or what profession, but I'm totally willing to choose one over the other if it helps my chances at moving.

**For my CV and education:**

I've got professional experience in Consulting, web development using HTML/PHP/CSS/SQL/JS (and lots of programming in general), marketing, project management, creating/managing a careers event (involving companies like HSBC, EY, UBS, etc.), a committee member for an entrepreneurial society for my university (having managed hiring new members recently) customer-facing jobs (at a 5-star restaurant, catering at weddings, and in retail), tutoring, and two banking competitions (one is something interviewers are always impressed by and love to talk about, though the other is something I omitted from my CV since it isn't worth the space it takes up) from college (17 yo) to now, along with a summer internship this year lined up (either at an investment bank or insurance company, the latter a backup to the former - after a final interview, though I feel very optimistic about, I think is 50/50 on me getting it due to its competitive nature). Additionally, have a small investment in the stock market (£500 - almost exclusively to learn more via experience, not to make money) - mainly ETF's in renewable energies, emerging markets, etc. 

I know no other languages, only achieving a D at GCSE german (though I AM working on this now, and regret this a lot), and having level 1 British Sign Language. At A level, I achieved A\*BB (with both B's 1 off of an A) in mathematics, further mathematics, economics - and I studied a year in computer science, before dropping out. My GCSE's aren't great - I achieved an 8 and 7 in Maths, English Language at GCSE (the equivalent of A\* and A), and the rest were B's with one C and a D, achieved at a below-average state school.

At university I get 1st class results in all of my module exams with an average of 87% for my exams (with 70% being the minimum for a first-class) so far in my 2nd year of the course, especially doing well in mathematics. I'd be a bit shocked if I don't get a 2:1 at least. When it comes to the numerical reasoning/online tests/bullshit IQ tests that many employers have, I do well in them due to mainly practice (I applied to a lot of places for an internship) and always kinda being good at maths/problem-solving. When they give feedback, 80% of the time they say I do very well (though of course, I fail some from time to time).

I think that's everything that I think maybe relevant. Thanks for reading, and I'll appreciate any response! If additional info would be useful, I'm more than happy to help more!"

Between a few months leading up to my graduation and now, I've fired off probably close to 1,000 applications, and the few interviews I've gotten haven't been successful (in my case, they've asked for my GPA which was &lt;3.0). To make things worse, I don't have any internship or ""real"" experience in software development outside of school, except a shitty game of pong I made a while back. And yes, I've tried to do some personal projects on my own to improve my resume, but I have no idea what I'm doing, how to really BUILD anything useful besides a simple gui (and solve a few leetcode easy and mediums), and get i just frustrated to the point where I give up after trying to follow unhelpful tutorials. I'm also not someone who can just sit down and figure it out on my own with no mentoring or individual guidance. So what should I do with my life? Did I just waste the past 4 years of my life? I will literally take any job I can get in software development or tech in general. I've been told my resume looks pretty decent for what I have, so do I just apply to another thousand jobs and hope that I get &gt;1 callback?"

Extracurriculars: 

Member of Badminton team (4 years) Captain (1 year)

Interned for a real estate lawyer (3 summers). Became very close with lawyer. Learned a lot about law and real estate. Would read contracts, meet new people, and would help others around the office with whatever they needed help with. Received intern of the year award for 2 years in a row. (Wrote a very good letter of rec for me)

Started a Passive Income Club outside of school (3 years) where I would teach about different investing strategies and about reaching financial freedom. I would mainly speak about stock market and real estate investments. I would speak about my own investing strategies also and what I personally do to get passive income and to attempt reach financial freedom. Eventually had about 30 members per meeting and had members of all ages, even adults. Made a big impact on many people's lives and taught them how to invest correctly and to stay away from these get rich quick schemes that kids nowadays seem to be very fond of. (This is a very big part of my application and I also wrote my Common Ap essay about it)

Investing in the stock market since 7th grade

Had a tutoring volunteering program where I would go and tutor different people in my community. I mainly tutored underprivileged people in my community. (3 years)

I worked as an assistant at a real estate development company (2 years) where I would help out with anything that the company needed me to do such as filing and organizing papers and things like that. I got to meet investors and learn a lot of financial skills. I was also able to sit in at meetings and learn the art of raising money, negotiating, and good business manners.

I was a peer leader at my school where once a week for half a semester (2 years) I would teach freshman and sophomores about things such as safety, mental health, leadership, drugs, peer pressure, etc.

Deca (3 years). Placed in regionals and qualified for states for both sophomore and junior years.

Essays: 9/10. Overall all of them were pretty good and connected to my major of finance. Common Ap essay was about my passive income club. Stern supplemental essay was about my job at the real estate development company and how it connects with their finance program with a concentration in real estate which is what I want to study.

Letters of Rec: 

Precalc Teacher (9/10)

AP English Lang Teacher (8/10)

Guidance Counselor (7/10). Doesn't know me very well.

I never really had dead-set aspirations for what job I wanted to do after uni, hence the maths degree, but used to think I wanted to do something vaguely related to computer science. Thinking about what actually interests me or what I enjoy doing, at this point the first thing I can think of is stuff like playing around with money/budgets and that sort of thing, and I feel like there are plenty of jobs where that would be a focus.

I also had a brief look at what the role of an actuary is like, and that seems like it might be a consideration for me. I'd value being in an enjoyable job over making more money, but the salary of an actuary looks to be pretty good as well so if I liked that job it might be a win-win for enjoyment + pay. Has anyone here gone on from doing a maths degree to becoming an actuary? I'd like to hear about what it's been like.

I've pretty much missed the summer internship deadline for 2nd year which is a shame but I had plenty of time to consider my future and just decided not to. In my head I wanted 2nd year summer to do fun stuff and go on a holiday or two, not having to stress over an internship or job, however given the state of the world I probably won't be able to do much of that anyway. Are there many opportunities to get experience in the actuary/financial field between now and graduation? Is it even necessary in order to be considered for a graduate job position? Regardless, I think I'd want some experience to work out whether or not it's something I want to pursue, since it's not a field you'd typically hop in and then out of (because of the years of exams).

I wouldn't be against the idea of taking a gap year after graduation, and if that meant I would be allowed onto summer internships (that people would typically apply for in 2nd year) then apply near the end of my gap year if I decide I like the position. Has anyone else done the same, i.e. left their career decisions late and took a gap year post uni before deciding?

**TL;DR:** 2nd year maths student looking into finance-related fields for a career post uni. I want to hear from people who are or were in similar positions, specifically if you considered or are doing actuary work, but also any other related jobs like accountancy."

I am currently a bit lost in life. I have graduated from Software Engineering in the UK last summer (First with Honours), and have been trying to find a job in Investment Banking. I planned to finish graduating and go straight to masters in Finance (big dream of mine), however, due to the COVID I had to go back home (Brazil) to take care of my parents.

At first, I thought my cv was a good match, combining good technical skills with some prior IB experience (internship) and good communication and leadership skills. However, I have applied for more than 100 jobs, and haven’t even gone through to an interview in the UK.

During the last four months unemployed, I have been doing the following to make me more ready for an IB job:

\-      Financial Modelling Course on WallStreetPrep

\-      Reading books in the subject

\-      Studied Excel and PowerPoint to advanced

As I have not been able to find any internship/graduate schemes so far, I am thinking to start a masters in Finance in one of those locations:

\-      Oxford, London School of Economics, London Business School, Cambridge or Imperial College London

This would be a massive investment for me as I would have to take a loan to pay the £35+k tuition fee…

I don’t know what I am doing wrong. I will leave my CV here to see if anyone can give me some tips on where to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be forever grateful for the help!!

Over the last 6 months, I've developed a process and set of questions that have made this much easier for me. I wanted to share in case others are struggling. 

First time writing a guide, so go easy on me. 

**Step 1: Research the school**

You should have done some due diligence on your target schools already. Watch a webinar or two touting the school's unique qualities, and perhaps research a few clubs and classes you'd be interested in. It will make your conversation more productive. 

**Step 2: Research the student/alumni**

I always hit up LinkedIn, followed by a cursory Google search of the person's name. The Google search turned up a podcast my actual admissions interview alumni did, and she was blown away when I brought it up. Using your research, fill out the template below.

**STUDENT NAME** (I put this in massive letters at the top of the document so that during the interview, I don't forget their name).

  
**Background**

* Undergraduate school and major, including extracurriculars of note
* Summary of pre-MBA, professional experience
* Summary of MBA experience, including internships and clubs

**What I Want to Learn**

Here I write out 2-3 bullet points focused on what I want to learn from the person I'm interviewing. This has helped me structure the interview and have something to fall back on if the conversation slows. 

These bullet points do not have to be like mine below. They should be specific to the career and school you're interested in. 

* What were your experiences at Amazon and Microsoft? How did the organizations differ? 
* What experiences at Target School were big contributors to your internship, the most useful?
* How did leadership development play out for you at Target School?

**Questions**

Here's where I load up a list of 3-10 questions I want to ask. You don't have to go through all of these, and for that reason I suggest prioritizing them. However, for someone as anxious as myself, it helps to have a bunch of fall backs in case we run out of stuff to talk about. 

At the bottom of this guide, I'll copy a TON of questions to ask. 

1. How did you decide you wanted an MBA? Why did you decide on Target School?

**Summary**

I used to take notes during this conversations, but found I struggled to keep a good pace of conversation going. Now I just immediately debrief after the call. 

EXAMPLE

Great to talk to. Super enthusiastic. 

Conversation Highlights

* Differences between Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon more driven by results while Microsoft is more laid back. 
   * Each have a community of alumni making a mini target school environment in it all. 
* Strategy and Managing People and Organizations were classes that helped a lot. These taught them how to see the big picture after being in such an implementation role, and how to work with stakeholders. 
* As far as innovation goes, they offered a lot of good info. Here's what I recall.
   * Some details I recall about clubs and courses of note. 

**Thank You Note**

I always try to write this immediately after the call. I often do not send it until later that day, but writing it after has been so much easier than trying to several hours later. 

EXAMPLE

Hey Person,

Thanks for chatting about Target School and your experiences at Microsoft and Amazon. 

I really appreciated learning what the differences are between all the opportunities to learn innovation at Target School, particularly Student Club. It was also great to hear how both of the companies you have worked with have their own Target School communities that are so supportive. One of the major reasons I am pursuing an MBA is to join and contribute to a community like this.

Thanks again, and best of luck with the crisis challenge. It sounds awesome!

MrGoBlue\_9114

**Step 4: Send you thank you letter**

Repeat. Using this process, I've gotten the prep for a single candidate down to 10 minutes or so. 

Good luck, everyone!

I am worried that I will not have the experience necessary. So as a junior what should I do to prepare for these roles to encourage a seamless transition between undergrad and product management. What type of internships should I look for and will I be able to apply my major/degree to this line of work. Any advice is much appreciated.

We haven't tried to get pregnant, we were waiting to be more financially stable and be in our 30s. Well now we have arrived. Problem is that I'm in grad school, still have 3 years left, studying to become a psychotherapist. I'm starting my internship this Fall in September and will be gaining licensing hours while still finishing classes.
After graduating I'll work for a year as an associate to finish my licensing hours. Then I'll be fully licensed. So about 4 years total. Then I can start my own practice. 
I'm SO excited to start my paid internship and start working in the career I love.
But sometimes I do wish I had a baby and we started a family.
If it was up to me I'd just wait no problem. But as you all know, once in your 30s, the internal clock ticks, no matter what you do.
I know plenty of women who have health beautiful kids in their late 30s. But I personally don't think I want to be that age when I START having kids.

So then I wonder, oh my goodness, then when in this 4 year endeavor does it make sense to have kids? Knowing that kids change your life and need 24/7 attention?

So I feel like there are two paths, both of which are exciting for me. Sometimes it stinks how we have this internal clock. But that's life I know. So just trying to figure out timing. Any thoughts or advice?"

I am 30 and I kinda want to graduate as fast as possible. I was wondering if 6 classes is too much? They require about 7-10 hours/week of homework/class combined. I also get a paid internship between each semester, so I'll have a break from this schedule every four months.I don't work, I have enough savings to cover everything.

Kinda scared shit would hit the fan hard during crunch time. Maybe I am better off taking a slower pace and investing time into practicing coding.

Id like to graduate as soon as possible but its not the end of the world if I don't. So what do you guys think? Is it worth it? Anyone of you tried it? How hellish would it be?"

I got a job offer from another company that seems to have pretty much same benefits, all the internal politics, company values seems to match.

I really like the company that I am working at right now. But I have been feeling like I do not improve, learn as much as in the begining. And feel like changing work would help me restart with learning and improving. But what if not? What if my work - life balance would get worse? These are really important things for me.

What would you do?

There is also a salary increase, but that is not the most important part for me.

letx3f,1,2021-02-07,I was let go from an unpaid internship early and I can't decide if I made a mistake or if they did.,throwAway5650988,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/letx3f/i_was_let_go_from_an_unpaid_internship_early_and/,"I would like to hear someone else's thoughts on this. I will keep it short.

I wanted to start a new career, UX designer, found an unpaid internship at a tech startup, decided to take it to get some experience.

To my shock, there was no senior UX-er at this tech startup company to guide me. I was reporting directly to the CEO. 

I saw it as an opportunity to get better and learn even more since I had to learn a lot on my own. Trial and error, not with a mentor.

2 out of 3 months in . My internship abruptly ended. The CEO invited me to a surprise meeting that also acted as an exit interview. Here was the feedback I was given, and here is where I will need your opinion :

1. Sometimes I said I would finish something in 2 days and it actually took me 3 days. I did that a couple of times and they were happy with what I delivered in the end. I was at fault here and I learned to give myself more time to do a task.

2. ""You brought a negative energy that demoralizes the team."" This app is a disaster. They are running out of money and will probably go bankrupt this year. I pointed out that things are bad and they should change some ways they approach their MO. I was always ignored or dismissed.

3. The worst one: ""You were being proactive without telling us"". This company was pretty incompetent when it came to UX and they didn't know how it works so I did a lot of it on my own and presented to them at our daily meetings. They were unhappy that I didn't tell them I was working on something extra even if I had finished all my given tasks. I was fired for being proactive.

This is not supposed to be a vent. I don't do that. From what you read, do you think I was wrong and deserved to be fired? I want an objective view on this.

Thanks!"

I cannot get any interest from companies at all and was never able to in the past.
I will be graduating without an internship. 
I am not a very competitive candidate (3.0 GPA even, no experience, no projects, no research, no papers, no clubs)
It has taken everything I had just to complete my coursework while working wageslave jobs to pay for everything.

I feel as though the standards have changed out from under me and my previous expectations might have cost me big time. When I was 18, I always heard an engineering degree was a sure ticket to the middle-class. If you could just get through school, you'd have multiple offers waiting for you. I didn't have the chance to go to college back then and had to defer it. Now that I'm here, I'm learning that the degree is not enough and you apparently need to be highly distinguished as well. It's almost as though presenting yourself as a beginner isn't sufficient - you need to be a professional on day 1. 

I just don't see how I can compete with the rest of you. I see other people posting about how they can't get a foot in the door and their resumes completely blow mine out the water.

I never expected to feel this way after getting an engineering degree. This has been my plan for so long and I was certain that I'd finally have a career at the end of it, now I feel like I've just wasted years of my life and took on tens of thousands of dollars in debt for nothing."

 I dont have enough experience as a software developer to be confident to appy for a normal web dev job or even a junior dev job.

Advice?,Julius_Mynt,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lev3i1/from_happy_to_unhappy_again_advice/,"So to start this off, I'm 21 and I'm from the Netherlands. Currently I'm a student and I'm doing a course about animal care. Recently we had to start our internship in a animal related company.  We have 3 periods where we have to start our internship at a farm/zoo,  store and work with dogs and cats. For my first period I chose to work at a store. Our internships would be 2 months in for every period. So in total that would be half a year. My course is 1 and a half years long.  In our internship period we also don't get paid. It's 40 hours per week. 

I started last week, I have to work from 9 am till 6 pm. 5 days long from Monday to Friday.  After having worked for almost a week since I started Wednesday I can already say that I'm unhappy about the hours. I come back home around 7 ish and eat all alone. I call with my girlfriend for a hour or two and then she has to go to bed for her next school day. Afterwards I pretty much go to bad myself too since I'm tired after such a long day and I can't do anything for a long time. If I start up a game I can only play it for a little, not able to enjoy it because I'll be to busy looking at the time. When I lay in bed I also feel a stinging pain in my left knee because of a knee injury I had from snowboarding. My doctor told me it would take some time for it to heal. Max 3 years. But it's already 4/5 years later. (I'm making a appointment this Monday) . Even in the store I feel an imbalance and pain in my left knee after a couple of hours. Resting doesn't help since I'm not tired or anything. When I stand up I just feel the same amount of pain in my leg. Making it difficult for me to focus on my tasks. 

Honestly, I feel really alone coming home and having to eat all by myself. Only being able to spend a little time with my girlfriend and spending time on the activities and hobby's I enjoy.  I wake up in the middle of the night since I started the internship and can't fall asleep properly anymore. I'm already dreading the next day, hoping something will happen so I don't have to go. It's not that smart for me either to change courses because the level of education I'm doing requires you to do internship. And I'm guessing it's all 40 hours long. Which I can't handle mentally and physically. I'd rather work at home. Become a voice actor (which I'm bad at and don't have the set up for). And enjoy my life. My free time feels taken away and I don't want to waste any second of my life. Which it does feel like I'm doing right now. Working 40 hours isn't made for me and it's not something I could ever do. I'm really at a loss since I need to get a diploma before I'm 28, otherwise I have to pay back all the student ''loans'' I get monthly. But at the same time I don't want to do any internships that require you to work for 40 hours. Especially without any salary. 

Can someone give me any advice?"

Since then I have been working full time in the telecoms sector - mainly in Business Strategy type of roles where I haven't been doing too many tasks realted with Computer Science apart from automating a few reports, doing data analysis in R and some very simple web scraping for data collection. I did work in a part time Web Developer (frontend) role during my studies and I completed a 3-month internship in IBM before my full time role to develope a Chrome browser extension.

My degree was essentially a combination of Computer Science and Business Management - my transcript have modules such as Object Oriented Programming, Database Management, Software Engineering and Programming for the Web (50% of my courses are CS-courses basically). I don't have the highest scores in some CS modules but i did graduate with an overall 65% - which equates to something around 3.5 GPA. My question is do you think I have a chance of being admitted? If not, do you think i should take extra courses online/from a college to increase my chances? What would be your tips?

I have been reading around to find suggestions on whether one should pursue a second bachelors or a masters and found a lot of interesting posts, but wanted to present my own case to get some more personalized feedback.

To introduce myself, I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering (3.057 overall, 2.828 in major) from VT. I did a minor in computer science (3.3 in major) and found that I enjoyed this much more than my major. I spent the first few months of 2020 at an internship doing fixed-wing aircraft maintenance (I like airplanes/aviation) which was interrupted by COVID while for the remainder of the year, I mainly worked on my own personal project (self-employment). The project is unrelated to my major yet I still ended up doing some coding for it and learned a bit about cloud hosting on Heroku and some multithreading with Java. This project has actually been successful to the point that it may actually be able to fund my continuation of CS studies too.

So now comes my currently dilemma:

&amp;#x200B;

\- My results are not very competitive to directly pursue a masters degree

\- I don't really have that much interest in research (or maybe that's just my growing lack of interest in ME talking)

\- What I found most interesting about CS was the coding, data structure applications, development opportunities, and so would like to find work that falls under this

With these points in mind - combined with suggestions I have found on the internet - it seems that the best route for me (and that preferred by employers) would be some pre-requisite courses to then apply for a Masters program. But that seems to contradict with what my main interests are and that perhaps a second degree (maybe not the full 4-years due to my first degree?) would work better...

I guess I could also add:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Currently I am leaning towards studying in Canada (and then looking for work there too). My BSME is from a US college so perhaps applying to another US college would be ideal, but I am an international student and have read/experienced that is near impossible to get a visa sponsor for work in the US

\- I was able to apply my minor during my senior year which resulted in more experience coding in C, additional work with Linux/VM and implementation of an open-source solution for remotely operated underwater vehicles; more to add to my CS resume I guess

I heard that you should start applying for summer internships in August the year before, so I’m wondering when to start applying for winter/spring ones. I plan to start applying in the coming weeks, but if most companies won’t start hiring for a while I won’t stress about it.

Also, is it harder to find non-summer internships? Do big companies hire less outside of summer? This is my first time doing any of this so any advice would be well-appreciated."

lf0c45,23,2021-02-07,Wellness and Health Tipline Idea,sweetcruton,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/lf0c45/wellness_and_health_tipline_idea/,"To start, I am new to a B4 firm, but I had 2 internships and each one lead me to the same conclusions. There are certain things that I like about this job. I like the exposure, the challenges, the learning opportunities, but there is also plenty I dislike about this job. I will also add that I am on a very challenging client and my team is often working 80+ for two months and this is not an exaggeration. I think for the staff level on my team, we are constantly feeling pressure to perform and work these insane hours. There is another first year on my team who is having very similar thoughts and feelings about the pressure we are experiencing. We both would like to address this, but we do not want to hurt our careers by asking for more help or by showing that we are not capable of these situations. 

My idea would be to create a system that is similar to a fraud tip line, but for unhealthy work environments. We do not want rat on anyone, but if anyone seriously looked into how bad of a work environment our team has, it would be immediately stopped by anyone concerned about wellness. As such, I wanted to gauge the opinion on basically a “wellness and health tipline” where an employee or possibly even a family or friend could submit a tip about the pressure or work environment a team has. I am thinking about submitting this idea because as of right now, the cons are definitely beating the pros of this job.

Again, I don’t want to just complain on here. I want to get over my obstacles vs just talk or runaway from them. I think this career field needs to change because as of right now, I would say I am a good candidate, but I value my health and sanity more than my career advancement. Thanks for listening."

I also want some feedback on some changes I'm considering

1. I've been noticing that resume parsers have been unable to successfully parse my address because it's currently split into two lines for styling purposes. Would it be advised to have all my contacts/address in one line (It's somewhat cramped but fits if I get rid of the ""Email:"", etc labels)?
2. I'm considering getting rid of my part time job as a course developer since I didn't really get much out of that job and it's also not very relevant to many CS jobs I'm looking for (software engineer, frontend, fullstack). I'm thinking I could maybe remove this job from my resume and expand on my experience on the software team of the math competition club, which is probably much more relevant to many CS jobs (working with a SQL database, creating new SQL models, creating webpages and forms connected to the SQL backend, working with Git/version control, working with Amazon AWS, developing algorithms to parse equations, etc). 
3. Is my current skills section alright or should I separate out the languages from the libraries/frameworks/tools?
4. I've noticed my project bullets I very long and wordy (I was trying to be as descriptive and technical as possible). Should I try to separate into two bullet points, and does anyone have suggestions on how to break up those descriptions?
5. Is it generally advised to use Google docs to create resumes or is LaTeX fine too? Part of me worries that my resume might not be processing properly because it was made in LaTeX. 

Thank you for any feedback!"
lf2eht,8,2021-02-07,Everybody wants to do Computer Science. What's the future like?,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/lf2eht/everybody_wants_to_do_computer_science_whats_the/,"Everybody wants to do computer science. CS has become without a doubt the most popular major by far because high employability, high pay, and relatively easy to learn, obtain a degree, and enter the workforce. CS also attracts a lot of people who aren't truly passionate about any other field but find CS to be a good alternative to what they haven't found. Not only that, loads and loads of pure engineering (mechanical, computer, electrical, chemical) and even business students leave their line within a year of graduation and go join software jobs. And not just in US, without a doubt everybody in India and China ofc will do CS and aim for software jobs in the US. 

But now what? Think about all the classes (ex class of 2022) behind us and in front. With everybody wanting to do CS, is the industry really gonna grow to meet the demand or will the growth stifle making it incredibly hard to find employment in the future? I know there is a high employment rate for CS right now, but will it stay like that? Just a worry

And lets say you can't find a job or you open up you're own company. Its still incredibly hard to find clients considering the immense competition between companies. To top it all off, CS is so easily accessible (as long as you have an internet connection you can really conquer the world of CS) to everyone that people have done insane ECs, internships and projects all through college and high school. Anybody and everybody can and will learn CS and the amount of people succeeding with immense knowledge in the field is just exponentially increasing.

Or if you just want some general tips, I'd be happy to share what worked for me.

Update: My background; Applying to Cell and Molecular biology - type programs. (This particular one was a US top 30 school on the east coast)

Coming from undergrad (not R1 school) 

* GPA: 3.65 
* Major: Biotechnology 
* Minors: Chemistry and Computer Science
*  GRE: didn't take 
* Research experience: 3 years of part time research. 
* Multiple projects with different skillsets needed. 1 genome publication (so maybe: .5 of a normal pub lol). One paper on the back burner.
*  1 research based internship in industry 
* 3 strong Recs.

Update: #2 

This is the most internet fame I've ever received, and to the 40+ people who asked me to read their paper: I am severely flattered, and I'm trying to get to them on a first come first serve basis.

&amp;#x200B;

My general advice:

**My ""one quick tip"" to write a more appealing paper:** (disclaimer: it worked for me, it may not work for you).

Okay, maybe it's more of a philosophy rather than a 'tip', but use it to guide what you emphasize in your papers.

**Be passionate / emotionally vulnerable.** There is an incomparable level of significance to us prospective grad students wanting to devote our lives to these areas of study. It takes a special mind to devote oneself to these fields. For most of us, we are attempting to  ***permanently*** ***expand the realm of human knowledge.*** How is that not one of the most noble pursuits a human can put their mind to? There is a huge emotional component to that discourse. The people reading your papers want to *know* that you are devoted to this cause. And you and I may know that we are, and the people reading your papers (theoretically) assume that you are, but how do you show that?

What is the driving force in your endeavor to pursue your dream? Yeah your field is really cool, and the work is really interesting, and it impacts lives for the better, and it is going to cure cancer (mostly a joke), but the people reading your paper ***are*** the field! They know that! You wouldn't be writing the paper if you didn't come to those conclusions naturally. They are so universal that making them ***your reason*** ***why*** is almost assuredly not going to make you stand out. I know that they motivate you, but they are the reason why the field of study exists in the first place, not why *you* specifically want to be a part of it - if that makes sense. Your SoP is about YOU. 

This is kind of where you have to soul search. What is the real driving force in your actions? Why does biology make your brain work so well, when other subjects seem so dull? Why do problems in psychology occupy your brain as you fall asleep? Why does daydreaming about owning your own business take up a lot of your free time? The answer of ""because my subject of interest is cool and exciting"" applies, but it doesn't stand out. Throughout your life, what inspired your brain to take on the characteristics that make you so great in your field?

I'll use my self as an example:

What gives me that rush of dopamine in life is seeing a project through to the end. To be able to conceive something, to tackle the problem from multiple angles, to breathe life into it, and make it my own. The end product is a part of me, something that I can say ""my brain did that, and I'm damn proud"".  ----- That sentiment perfectly applies to doing research in the general sense. That's why I'm so drawn to science. Some of you are probably reading that going ""hey, yeah, I can totally relate to that, and honestly, that's kind of obvious."" In which case: Articulate how ***you*** experience that in your paper (using examples and or stories)! If the way your brain and body operate is so perfectly matched to your area of interest, then make sure they know that. Of course, this applies to my field, and wont apply to others, but there has to be some underlying theme that portrays the exemplary person in your field. 

I know that one of the ""death sentences"" of SoPs is to go way overboard describing personal information, and I think that has scared a lot of people from being open about their emotions towards the field at all - But we are all so damn emotional about it! We check this subreddit 500 times a day to receive validation and provide support because we all care so much about our future positions as academics. I started my SoP with a brief story of how I came to have my scientific mindset (starting from when I was a child), and how I have tried to implement it to every aspect of my life. So based on a sample size of one, I recommend relevant and relatable stories. 

\*sigh\* This is all very hard to articulate. The distinctions aren't as clear in text as they feel in my head (ironic I know). This isn't me just talking out of my ass either, 30% of my interview was talking about how people need to be more emotionally available in science in academia in general. Not only because it's important to self actualize, but to relate more to the non-academic community. 

Maybe this isn't what you were looking for, and I apologize, but this is really the only thing that I can think that I did 'differently' (probably not even very unique, I'm just trying to phrase it in a way that worked for my brain) from any of the thousands of other websites and posts that offer their advice."
lf305l,0,2021-02-07,Child Labor Law Abuse-Internship,personxx20,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lf305l/child_labor_law_abuseinternship/,"Hello. 

I am 21 now and this occurred when I was 16&amp;17. 

I was an intern for this lady who ran a theatre company. The internship was extremely demanding of my time, gas (in which I would pick her up at times and drop her off an hour away), and soul. She manipulated me into thinking that after a year of working for free I would get paid something. I was practically an unpaid personal assistant. She told me not to get my mom involved or I could not do this internship because she doesn’t like helicopter parents. I came from a rough parental background and she told me later on she could tell. 

We had an argument that she started when I was 17. I was so tired, but kept on doing it because I was way to impressionable and really wanted to prove myself. I was with her all the time, my schooling suffered, and I was being emotionally abused.
A friend realized this and a couple people from the community had an intervention with me and my mom finally stepped in and sent her a “resignation”letter on my behalf. I was so emotional manipulated that I kept making every excuse for her. It was really abusive and the tipping point was the following.

I had shown up late and forgot to memorize a skit the day before because I had organized a whole event on her behalf. She was so infuriated by this she went to give me a “hug” and grabbed me in this awkward uncomfortable position while she firmly scolded me in a passive aggressive way. The next day at a rehearsal she held me after and completely insulted my being. Stating that I was terrible, selfish, troubled, how my past is why I am so messed up, lazy, how I’m never going to get anywhere, how I stole an opportunity for someone else. It was terrible. My best friend was in the room and said nothing, and we are not friends anymore. 
I fought back verbally as I cried my eyes out saying “how much I did for her the past year” and “ how could she say those things”. She kept on grilling me until I was shaking in the chair wanting to die. 

I went to my therapist when I left that terrible scolding because I was about to kill myself. It was one of the worst days of my life. I realized how evil she truly was.


I could have pursued this when I was 17/18, but it fucked me up for a long time. I am 21 now in nursing school and far away from the toxic theatre world. I am curious if I can now press chargers. She is still running this illegal internship program and sucking in vulnerable kids with the promise of making them big in the little theatre community I was a part of. Oh and not to mention, when I did reach that “one year mark” she did not pay me a cent. A bunch of false promises from a terrible person.

I am at a great mental state now and can openly talk about what happened without my ptsd running rampant. 

Any advice welcomed.

lf42pk,210,2021-02-07,[Rant] Too much anxiety over A level results,Excellent_Apple_8179,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lf42pk/rant_too_much_anxiety_over_a_level_results/,"Hello Reddit users, I'm here to spill my guts out about the upcoming A level results release because I'm genuinely worried about them.

So I graduated from a mid-tier JC, taking hELM, and my prelims results were like 65-66 rank points thereabouts. Not the best, but really better than expected because I was struggling with JC life (big regret going to JC but that's for another time).

&amp;#x200B;

Now that it's like 1 to 2 weeks before results release I was just struck with the sudden realisation (or more like suddenly remembered) that 1. My whole future kinda rides on these results because uni admissions, and 2. I wanted to prove to my parents that I can do something good in my life for once.I didn't really care about the results throughout December and January because I was either too busy catching up on sleep (no joke I passed out for 14 hours after my last paper) or I was busy with my internship. That and the release date was far away to me then, and I didn't pay much attention to it.

Now that the date is approaching (which they haven't even confirmed, and that's making me worried too) I've been struggling with anxiety over my results. I know it's stupid to panic now because 1. The results can't be changed anymore so why worry about something which is already past, and 2. getting bad grades isn't the end of the world as there is a lot of other options available (albeit not as 'honourable' or as cost-friendly). 3. There's the possibility of doing well, and (not really a reason but) 4. it's in more than a week so why worry now.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also bad cuz I'm usually the person people look to for reassurance and comfort esp during results release or just stress and anxiety since I've had my own experience and kinda know how to deal with it (unprofessionally ofc, I'm still an 18-year-old after all). So my friends still text me for comfort and to rant but it's just making me more nervous when they do it. I don't want my friends to suffer from anxiety (esp since I have it pretty bad) so I wanna help them as much as I can, but I'm really just suffering and I don't want them to worry about me when they have their own problems to worry about. I've texted other online overseas friends about it but they just don't understand how important the results are (to me at least).

I'm just in constant fear about the results and I've told my parents about it but they aren't believers in mental health and told me to just suck it up and live with it (basically). Talking to friends can only do so much because they are just as nervous (some even more) and it's just a cycle of anxiety. I'd talk to my seniors but they are all busy with uni and I'm scared that I'll be disturbing them, and I'd talk to my juniors but they're busy with school and don't need my overemotional rants rn (i really hope that they do well for their A's this year).

I'm just really stressed out about it and it's making me have panic attacks nearly daily to the point that I've thought about just not collecting my results at all in fear that I'll do badly for them. Realistically I know that even if I do badly I have many back-up plans in place and the top 3 unis are not the only universities in Singapore so I don't need to worry about getting into university. (I really just wanna go to NUS-FASS).

I know I put in my best effort, and I know I can't change the results. I know I have options to pick up from if I do badly, and I know what I want if I score well. So why am I so worried about it??? I'm just a mess 24/7 now, and I'm just growing more anxious each day (I can only think about results and it makes me too nauseous to stay on the train. I've skipped meals because my appetite is just really bad all the time). I've tried counselling and therapy but it really doesn't work for me. I've considered going on medication but the last time I tried it was a horrible experience, and I'm not comfortable to try it again. That and my parents were complaining that ""all those mental health things were just sucking money"" so I've resigned myself to ranting in discord servers or just talking to friends irl.

&amp;#x200B;

I just really want the results to be out like nOw but hey we have to wait until 19 to 23rd Feb. I don't even know if I'll survive by then (i mean like I'll physically be there but my mental health is full trash). Honestly, I just posted this to get it off my chest so I can hopefully feel less worried about it. I'm just desperate for any ways to function like a normal human being at this stage.

I genuinely hope we all do well this exam and can get into the uni courses we want! and also I hope yall are surviving :D until I spot grammar mistakes or I decide it's time to rant about my anxiety again, cyalls and stay safes. Also happy CNY to those celebrating!!

TLDR: I'm just overly worried about A's result and needed somewhere to talk about it :/

on a kinda related note, I just realised my anxiety is really bad considering I stared at this post for nearly an hour to check for grammar and to see if it makes sense. Also, mental health is important and I hope yall are doing ok :)

Edit: the formatting went wild so I had to fix it

Edit 2: Really want to thank yall kindhearted people!!!!   
idek if you'll see this but just a huge thank you to the people who've commented or DM-ed me cuz it really helped!! I'll probably respond to them in a while cuz I've just been panicking most of the time, but yeah ig just ATB to the other A-level result recipients and hope yall do well!! and also ty to all the people who've been offering words of comfort :) sometimes nice words work like a miracle"

i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder 6 years ago so it shouldn’t exactly be a surprise, but i’m pretty fucking suicidal but i feel so uncomfortable and scared opening up about my emotions to people who claim they care about me. i’ve tried in the past. it’s always been that they get uncomfortable when i merely mention the fact that i’m not doing well. the subject shifts to whatever album they’ve been listening to, a bad joke about how “we all feel like this, we’re in our 20’s!”, or other random shit. and bpd is a “scary” mental illness. i’m not manipulative. i keep to myself, i speak only when spoken to, i try so hard to make others happy and no one knows that i have this diagnosis. i’ve been taking lithium for about four months but it doesn’t stop this kind of thinking. i just don’t have panic attacks daily anymore.

i hate my major. i can’t fucking stand it, but i’m a year away from graduating and i’ve sunk my parents into debt with this shit so it’s way too late to change it. i don’t want the piece of paper but it’ll make them happy. my two older siblings went to one of the best universities in my state on a full ride and i can’t hold a candle to them, so i have to compensate in what little ways i can.

i can’t even tell my therapist about how i’m feeling because i’m so scared of being sent to the hospital. i’ve been institutionalized twice. some of my favorite quotes are:
“your parents could’ve picked this or a really nice, expensive funeral. your ass is lucky they chose this.”
and
“you’re not close enough to god, i can see it in your eyes. that’s why you’re anorexic, that’s why you’re so messed up. pray more and your problems will be solved.”
“damn, you cut yourself? you really don’t give a fuck about anything do you?”

i also got all career aspects from me stolen by covid. i was supposed to intern at captured tracks, rough trade, or third man this summer (three killer record labels) and all of those got cancelled. i went from making a living through professional music and show photography to delivery driving and eating once a day if i’m lucky.

i feel like i’m spiraling into alcoholism. i can’t remember the last time i spent a night sober. i usually start drinking at around five if i don’t have to work, and i almost always crack open a beer before my shift if i do. 

it’s just...tiring. it’s tiring feeling this alone, awful, alienated. i don’t know how to fix it. i’m trying my absolute best but sometimes shit just doesn’t work out, i guess. i don’t even think that i want to kill myself, i think i just want someone to understand how shitty it is to live with bpd but i’ll never have that. and that’s alright."

I am an international student and am having trouble deciding between two admits in: USC (EE) and Gatech (ECE). My main focus is on digital VLSI coupled with computer architecture from the hardware perspective.

I currently work as a EDA engineer and want to get into core hardware fields like front-end digital design, physical design, verification, etc.

I have done some research on the two and my findings are:

Gatech: Very good reputation overall. But less courses in digital vlsi, more on architecture (labs are also related to making simulator for different architectures). No (or irregular) courses that deal with design using HDL or verification. Fees is affordable. Apart from a few main courses, other courses seem very irregular. A few students also mentioned that GT has removed some of the vlsi courses that were offered a few years back. Apparently a very big career fair with a lot of opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

USC:  Very good courses structure in all aspects of digital design. Has a processor design course with design using verilog. General reputation seems to be lower than the GT with very high student intake. Not sure how it affects the internship opportunities. Total cost to attend on the higher side. (maybe also consider the case the I get some scholarship in this case).

&amp;#x200B;

It would be great to get your inputs. I do have an exactly relevant work ex to my target fields so might need to consider doing the courses and projects which will help me.

Thank you in advance for your inputs and time in helping me make a decision."

I am currently an intern at one of the big4 . I heard a lot of stories about getting FT offer after internship, but wondering who will be one making the decision ? Is it your recruiter or your manager/counselor ? And around when you will get to know whether you get the offer? At the very end of the internship? And who will talk to you about the offer?

I am asking because my counselor does not seems to care me at all. It is been 5 weeks, and he never reached out to me (except on the first day) or give me any works. On the first day I did send him a message to say I am happy to help with anything, but heard nothing from him since then. Everyone else in the team has been very helpful and nice.

I'm a software engineer in my 2nd year of working for an investment bank. This is my first full-time job since I got my undergraduate degree in computer science from an Asian university. I've decided that I want to get a non-research Master's degree, either full-time or part-time, from a university in the US. The biggest reasons are that I want to move to the US and that I want to learn more in-depth.

The thing is, I've never considered getting a master's degree during my undergrad studies. I have some decent internship &amp; hackathon experience, but I have a mediocre 3.0 GPA, not many personal relationships with my professors (1-2 at max, and I doubt that they still remember me), and I don't have any research experience. I have read that GPA and letters of recommendation are the most important in an application, so I doubt whether I have a chance at any decent Master's programme in the US.

I am willing to work for a couple more years at my current company before I make the move. In the meantime, what do you suggest are ways in which I can strengthen my application and improve my chances?"

Most of such organizations, and even multinational companies, are usually based on the outskirts, or a little far from big cities, and that has been the case with this job as well. About an year ago, I decided that I need to move away from this job and find a new one, but upon some research and my own search for jobs, during the pandemic and also when the things started to open up, I felt that this is not a career I would like to continue in. 

With some help and understanding what kind of a career I could go for, given my technical skills in engineering, I realized that data science and machine learning are careers I should excel at and eventually introduce and implement in the engineering industrh since automation is already on its way. This January, I started on my journey to learn data science fundamentals, build projects and eventually take a break to find internships and jobs.


I received a call from a job consultant today regarding an opportunity in a small town. The organization is big, a multinational company and I have the opportunity to improve my resume by leaps and bounds, and possibly find better opportunities in the same career in the future.

But I'm confused. My heart is set on data science, but I also need the money that this new job might pay considering that I eventually want to take a break. My current job woould do that for me as well but it would take me a longer time. I don't feel like committing myself to the same career though, even after realizing that the monetary benefit and the perks are going to be huge.

Need some help to reach a decision on this front."

Hi Guys,

I am an international student and am having trouble deciding between two admits in: USC (EE) and Gatech (ECE). My main focus is on digital VLSI coupled with computer architecture from the hardware perspective.

I currently work as a EDA engineer and want to get into core hardware fields like front-end digital design, physical design, verification, etc.

I have done some research on the two and my findings are:

Gatech: Very good reputation overall. But less courses in digital vlsi, more on architecture (labs are also related to making simulator for different architectures). No (or irregular) courses that deal with design using HDL or verification. Fees is affordable. Apart from a few main courses, other courses seem very irregular. A few students also mentioned that GT has removed some of the vlsi courses that were offered a few years back. Apparently a very big career fair with a lot of opportunities.

USC: Very good courses structure in all aspects of digital design. Has a processor design course with design using verilog. General reputation seems to be lower than the GT with very high student intake. Not sure how it affects the internship opportunities. Total cost to attend on the higher side. (maybe also consider the case the I get some scholarship in this case).

It would be great to get your inputs. I do have an exactly relevant work ex to my target fields so might need to consider doing the courses and projects which will help me.

Thank you in advance for your inputs and time in helping me make a decision."

I was planning on putting  in my 2 week notice today but i decided to call out sick and take a mental health day before I put in my 2 week notice. Even better that they want me to get tested for covid so that gives me more time to emotionally and mental rest before I brace myself for my last 2 weeks and whatever  my boss throws at me. 

For about 4 months now I've been working at a law firm as an investigator, straight from graduation I thought this was a dream come true to have a professional job with the current situation. 
And while the pay is good my boss(investigations director) is terrible. While he is cool 70% of the time the 30% he's not he's just absolutely mean(I mean this as his daily overall mood, there are days when he's cool one moment only to change dependingon again if something person or work related occurs that irritates him during the shift). His mood for the day pretty much depends on if he has personal issues and brings that work, which he does. Those days pretty much include snapping at me and my coworker when we make mistakes. I understand I'm new and will make mistakes, and his understanding of that varies in his mood. Him getting mad at me is akin to treating me like a little kid and once he's done he magically becomes cool, so pretty much taking it out on me. This attitude also can trigger when I ask him questions which has discouraged me from asking him for help because I'm scared to take the gamble, because he'll either get angry at me and tell me I'm overthinking, to use common sense, or just tell me Google it, or be cool and help me. I reached my breaking point when he one day he was angry, raising his voice at me(almost yelling) and scolding me like a child for a mistake I made, which would have costed us maybe a day or 2 delay in obtaining a report but very easily fixable, only required rewriting the letter and requesting a new check. 

Pretty much all of this has made me feel like I'm in a hostile work environment and given me tremendous stress and anxiety to the point where my mental health has been declining. I don't feel confident doing work around him because I'm scared that I will make a mistake and be used as a punching bag for him to feel better about his personal issues. I do feel bad about quiting because my only coworker in my department is cool and now will have more work and to deal with my boss by himself but he would probably understand as he also thinks our boss is not a good boss. 

So enough is enough, I'm leaving. I may not have another job lined up but it's OK. This job taught me to take things slow, that I do not want to work the legal/lawyer sector, and that working part time while doing remote internships, volunteering, and studying for the GRE for grad school would offer better benefits to me than staying at this job. It sucks the pay was amazing and I'm sacrificing half of it ti go back to retail but you know, it is what is. Thanks for the people who supported me, I just wanted to give an update and more context to my job situation  :)"
lfdy2l,4,2021-02-08,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (2/8/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/lfdy2l/weekly_job_qa_thread_282021/,"Hi all,

Here is the fiftieth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

lffdi8,269,2021-02-08,Amazon Vent,rohitmen01,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lffdi8/amazon_vent/,"I know this sub is annoyed with all the Amazon posting on here, so I apologize in advance, but I felt the need to vent out here, so bare with me pls :).

So I had my Amazon SDE Internship interview last week. Spent the whole week prepping, by doing all my school work as early as possible and grinding Leetcode and a Pramp (highly recommend). Even went thru their LPs and my school’s DS notes. Finally, it came time for the interview and I didn’t expect to know any more or any less.

I got in 5 minutes early, and my interviewer came in a minute late (nbd). They introduced themselves in the beginning and asked me to introduce myself, where I mentioned I was former Amazonian (Fulfillment Associate) and had an AWS cert (felt the need to appeal to Amazon like that). Then they started it technical, showing me what seemed to be a leetcode medium/hard problem. The question to the prompt was super vague, and I asked for some clarification on the prompt, which they failed to give to me clearly. I knew I had to put in my best effort for it, so I took the approach that made sense to me from reading the prompt. I started to explain my thought process and began writing some code, and after 10 minutes, they realized I misunderstood the prompt and then offered clarification, which I then I began to offer another plan to approach it. Long story short, I got cut off near the end cause they needed to hit me with behavioral, so I offered my last train of thought and also gave the runtime/space to my program, which I believe was the only thing I knew.

When I thought it couldn’t get worse, they asked me two behavioral questions, the first one I answered with an example from my Eagle Scout project cause it fit best to the scenario. After going on about it for 3-4 minutes, they sat there quite confused, probably cause they may not be as familiar with Eagle Scouts in general, and then asked if I had an example relevant to programming. That was where I got pretty annoyed, since they never specified that to begin with and also let me continue without interrupting to say that or to ask me to clarify.

Long story short, I thought HireVue was bad, but this interview experience topped that. I had a high school physics teacher who would give off awkward smiles and give u looks that felt condescending, which made your realize you what your saying was stupid or something. It’s been 2 years since I’ve felt that, and last week gave me that vibe. It is important to note that I know there were multiples instances in the interview where I could have done better, but this, being my first final round technical interview, was a valuable learning experience overall.

If you made it this far, bless up. If you still got your interview coming up, good luck! For the most part, I’ve been hearing pretty chill things about it, unless you get as unlucky as me, just try as best you can and persevere. It’s more about understanding how you think and approach problems rather than solving for these interviews (although getting it right is basically bonus points).

Edit: Forgot to mention I also got rejected next business day"

***LONG POST BUT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME***

So  I am currently a freshman student studying computer science at a  competitive school in Canada (don't think it's relevant but just wanted to explain my situation in detail if it helps.).

I am currently in the 5th week of my winter semester and I feel I am repeating the same mistake as I did in the fall term.

My GPA wasn't that bad (I got a 3.3) but most of my subjects averaged out at mid-70s and personally, I find that terrible.

The major issues I had during my fall term were:

\-Not studying regularly or revising what was taught the very next day or any day!

\-Not preparing notes or working on practice problems given to us to do better.

\-Not working on assignments on time and working on them last minute and stressing a lot and feeling sad and shit about myself. Sometimes I would be tempted to just look for the solutions to the questions online because I am unable to find solutions to them. I feel really bad doing this but I feel helpless and dumb compared to others who do better than  me in class and assignments.

As a  consequence, I experience imposter syndrome when I see my peers doing better than myself, asking more intelligent questions in class and engaging with the class better. In my CS classes, I find lost when the professor teaches concepts like recursion or binary trees whereas everyone else is so engaged. This is similar in other subjects like  maths (calculus class)

I have 3  exams in 3 to 4 days and I still haven't studied for them. I recently had my math midterm for which personally I spend just a few hours  studying and I got destroyed (expecting 40%). I don't want to do the same for my coming midterms.

I really want to get my shit together and improve myself. I want to do so many things but **I AM JUST STRAIGHT UP LAZY.**  I plan out so many things to do, make a to-do list to get the job done for the day but the next day when I wake up, I feel like going back to doing the same thing as yesterday: Watch Netflix/Anime/YT, stay in bed  and use my phone and when its time for class, attend class or work on some assignment if anything is due.

I  watch videos on how to do better in school, read posts about others and  I get this spur of motivation in me resulting in me to make the plan and later not doing anything. If at all I do something one day, the next  day I tend to spend just 10-20 mins at the most doing the work and spending rest of time idling around.

I find myself very lethargic too and not wanting to leave the bed. Furthermore, whenever I get bad marks in tests (which happens quite often), I tend to masturbate and this is just the icing on the cake to my lowered self-confidence and motivation to study. I tend to make plans the next day on how to get better but I go back to doing the same thing again. This has now become a habit for me where I tend to masturbate often even if I don't feel sad.

I  know I am capable of doing much better and that I am not dumb. I  realize that I may not be the smartest kid or grasp new and abstract concepts very quickly. Personally, I take a long time to get the concept and understand something (even though its not a perfect understanding of the idea).

I really really want to change myself and be a better version of myself. There are certain  things I wish to do like work on my skillsets so I can land internships in the coming year, work to improve myself like develop habits like reading, working out and so much more. I know that I cannot get started on doing all this all at the same time because of college schedule and messed up timings due to online learning but its something's I wish to do. In short, I want to develop stronger habits so I can be a better person than I was. I feel by doing so I can be in a much better situation than I am now. This way I can help overcome the imposter syndrome that I experience. I feel I am not smart but I may be a smart kid who has been lazy and dumb in his activities for so many years of his life.

I would really like your thoughts on this and how I can overcome this pit I am finding myself in.

Thanks a lot for reading through this!

Stay safe y'all!"

I fell into my own hole of depression, after going through a heartbreak and feeling no content in my life. After failing three courses, I have been placed on academic probation, which really took a toll on my gpa. But I was still able to land an interview and a job offer for a CoOp as a materials engineer. Excited and re-motivated, I quickly accepted and this spring semester I began working in the real world, conducting projects, learning professional etiquette, asking a bunch of different questions and getting a first hand look at how what I’m learning in school can be applied in the real world...that lasted only a month. Friday I was pulled into my supervisors office, and with my supervisor’s boss there too. I was told I’m being terminated due to consistent tardiness (2-5 min late almost every day). I understand how this is my own fault and my own behavioral issue that I need to fix, and I’ve learned and plan on improving down the road, hopefully at my next internship and at my full time job when the time comes...but right now I’m so lost and struggling. Nothing seems to be going my way, and the one opportunity I had to improve myself I blew. Although majority of my issues are self inflicted and require serious life changes, life just doesn't seem to be in my favor, no matter how hard I try. I’m looking for advice, insight, anyone who can share their experiences and how they overcame. That would be much appreciated.."
lfht6r,8,2021-02-08,Any engineers/computer scientists/STEM people that switched out/stayed in their field after their ADHD diagnosis?,digolanddyrnerede,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lfht6r/any_engineerscomputer_scientistsstem_people_that/,"Does it get better after you control your ADHD? Or did your ADHD warrant switching careers to something you found more creative/felt passionate about?


Optional background:
I've been working in engineering for over 2 years as an entry level engineer and had mixed success with it. I came out of a toxic workplace wherein I discovered my ADHD due to management accusing me of being stupid crazy and lazy, and even recommended I see a doctor. I received a PIP with vague goals, then quit and gave my two-weeks notice, only to be fired before my notice was up.

I  decided to switch careers to computer science, since I prefer the actual critical thinking vs the non-engineering aspects of engineering: highly detailed, deadline-oriented, high liability, contractor/client focused lifestyle. I can hyperfocus while coding more than when I was doing design work.

After I self-diagnosed, I saw a psychologist who confirmed that I had ADHD since I was a child. He told me I have emotional trauma from my last job specifically, and once I resolve that trauma, that wouldn't necessarily continue at my next job. However, I had a  internship at a prestigious company that played out similarly, wherein I performed mediocrely due to their high standards and me being assigned real projects versus intern duties in my previous internships. 

He believes computer science may not be the best option for me, as he thinks it will be more demanding than my current job, and suggested I find something that fits my interests.

Should I continue in STEM, or switch to other jobs? I am conflicted, partly because I already had invested so much time and effort in my field, but partly out of fear to start something new. Mainly, I'm worried that any STEM job will just be a rehash of my previous experience. 

I am also not passionate about engineering, and only did it because I didn't think art would support me financially (previously I had a brief stint with art in high school).  However, I worry that I am switching jobs, not out of interest, but out of novelty due to my ADHD.

==========================================
Tldr; thinking about switching out of STEM due to traumatic  experience at previous jobs and internships. This was before I knew I had ADHD. Am I not cut out for technical work, or was it just a previous traumatic experience that therapy can help heal?"

I joined a tech startup as a Data Scientist 2 years back as the first employee with 2 co-founders which are in mid fifties. I was referred to the startup by a mutual connection.

For 2 years, I was the sole employee and helped them build MVPs so that they could pitch it to investors and potential customers. It took two years because they couldn't get a funding and hence couldn't hire anyone as they were bootstrapping. 

Now they've hired 2 interns to help me build the product. I've told them it will take atleast about 6 resources team(Full-Stack Devs, DB, Backend etc) to build actual product which is very complex unlike MVPs. But they don't understand the significance of it and are trying pull off entire thing with me plus two interns.

These two co-founders being bit old and non technical, don't know much about softwar, so currently I'm the only one they are relying on totally and I'm doing my 100% to build the product. Both the co-founders are good with me and I have a respect for them.

But now, I've got an offer from a different startup which is offering me 2X of what I'm earning plus equity, a good team, and location. I don't own equity in current startup. I'm really inclined to accept the offer, but I feel HUGE HUGE guilt leaving current company.

I feel responsible that if I leave then entire product plan will be shattered. I'm not boasting, but I handled not only DS but backend, DB, Cloud, website, domain specific things etc etc and they won't find replacement easily for all skillsets combined. Therefore even though I've got a good offer, I'm not even happy of the fact that I cracked all the interviews and converted the offer. I'm worried that if I leave they won't be able to go live at all. 


I would love to hear what you guys think. I'm in moral dilemma."

I had a preliminary interview with a recruiting manager last Tuesday, a second interview with three managers in the department I’ll be working with last Friday, and today I was emailed by the original recruiter to meet with her later today although she mentioned to me they had more interviews lined up for this week. Should I be prepared for a rejection today when I speak with her or is this good news? I thought the first interviews went well they liked what I was studying and what I did in the past and that I was readily available for work now rather than the summer.

Edit/Update: I got the position! Here’s what I did to prepare incase anyone is looking for some tips:
- I went on sites like Glassdoor or Indeed to find the interview questions that are posed to people with similar positions, if there is more than one location narrow it down to the one the position is at that way you can probably prepare for the same questions from the same recruiter 
- Think through what you want to say and it doesn’t have to be as perfect as you practice because it might feel super scripted when giving your responses
- For this particular HR internship I spoke about my classes at school, what we have or will learn,  why I enjoyed them, and what I can implement from the classroom to the office setting (this case remote but you catch my drift) 
- If the candidates like you a key indicator is that the conversation gets casual in some spots, for me it was talking about the transition to remote school and assignments I didn’t like to do (in my case a research paper for math during freshman year) 
- interviewers will sometimes tell you that they like your answers right after you give them so take it as a confidence boost and assurance"

I’m 17f and had the sudden realization that I’m growing up. 

College, marriage, living on my own, and getting a job have always seemed so faraway but all of my counselors have started sending my class information about after high school paths and it’s been freaking me out. Scholarships, internships, and military opportunities keep being brought up and it’s frightening.

People around me are also changing and I’m panicking. One of my neighbor’s daughter is getting married and I met her when she had just graduated high school. My grandparents are getting older and I’m afraid of losing them.

I don’t know if it’s because my life has seemed to been at a standstill because the pandemic has caused my daily life to be repetitive and structured and it all seems to be changing. The idea of college and leaving my home has always seemed so far but now it’s so close and I don’t like it.

I don’t know how to feel and haven’t even been able to sleep or properly do school because I keep remembering how school is going to end for the last time for me. I also keep thinking about how my current life isn’t going to be permanent and it’s scaring me a lot.

How do I stop worrying about the future and how everything is changing?"

I recently took final rounds for both the microsoft (garage program) and amazon swe internships, and feel like I took Ls on both despite entering both with confidence and a lot of preparation.

Felt that I communicated my thought process as well as I could but wasn't able to completely solve the medium-hard LC questions that they threw my way and ended up only being able to code out the solution with some help (for amazon) and half of the solution (for rounds 2/3 of microsoft onsite). On top of that, my amazon interviewer didn't seem to be paying much attention during my behavioral portion and cut me off in the middle of my first answer (even though I thought they weighed LPs heavily). All in all, just feeling pretty discouraged, but still gonna try my best to push through and keep my fingers crossed!"

32, and graduated last year from no-name university in CS with a sub-par 3.0 GPA. My final semester was Spring 2020. Been looking for an entry level position since the pandemic. My hopes in searching for employment right off the bat had been low, but not this bad.

I think I did everything wrong in college, aside from making a few genuine, loving, and supportive friends. Didn't have time with internships. Family problems which frankly could have been smoothed over if people were to simply cooperate. I never bothered joining clubs, getting to know my professors, and networking with professionals in the field. Nonetheless, it's missed opportunities I've traded off. I had worked part-time in a field that has absolutely nothing to do with CS, but was relatively well paying for its lack of educational requirements, which luckily enough paid off my whole college tuition and my car + decent savings.

During the pandemic, I've started learning Unity, and I fell in love with game dev. I started three games which two might never reach completion due to my naiveté in game dev. One of the game sucks because of poor planning, and lack of thorough understanding of Unity's physics engine. The other also suffered from poor design and planning, with a massive scope. The good thing is that with all the art asset and prior code, I'm making a simpler game which might help me with at least feeling a little progression.

I'm also suffering from the ""grass is greener on the other side"" syndrome. I'm looking at my classmates, friends, and people my age who are raking in 80K + benefits up to six digit figures, and think, ""The hell am I doing wrong?"". They're saving for retirement, and I'm just starting my career.

I don't know if I'm ever going to become wealthy like that doing game dev, and torn with the potential opportunity costs. Also feeling the, ""I should have done that, instead of this"" syndrome, as I probably should have gone through trade school.

Here's to hoping for a better future.

lfmzaq,41,2021-02-08,How to evaluate graduate programs for a DS career,dfphd,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/lfmzaq/how_to_evaluate_graduate_programs_for_a_ds_career/,"I've been going through a round of hiring recently, and some of the things I'm seeing combined with the usual ""which MS program should I choose?"" posts made me realize that other than broad generalizations (e.g., ""don't do an MS in DS""), no one has ever covered the why and how you should evaluate potential programs.

This is by no means meant to be a ""this is how everyone thinks about this stuff"" kinda post, but rather how I specifically think of these programs both as a hiring manager and when giving people advice as to what programs to pursue.

First, let's start with what are the main elements that (most) hiring managers are looking for when evaluating a resume:

**Is this person smart enough?** Pretty straight forward. You want to hire smart people that are going to push everyone in the team to be better.

**Is this person productive?** You don't want smart people that never get anything done. You want smart people who deliver.

**Will this person be able to learn the things about my company/industry that are necessary for the role?** Most of the time, this means ""will they be willing to learn"", as most domains are not rocket science and just require some dedication to learning the ropes.

**Do they meet enough of the foundational technical skills required to do the job to where I think they can acquire the rest?** If you're hiring for an entry level role where someone will be using Python, R, SQL and Tableau, maybe you don't care that much if they've never used Tableau - it's easy to learn. And maybe you don't care if they know R - because if they know Python, it shouldn't be hard to pick up. But you need them to know at least *some* of this stuff - mostly so you have some reason to believe they can learn the rest.

**Do they have an area in which they have demonstrated deep expertise?** It's fine to hire someone that is jack of all trades for some roles, but generally speaking something you like to see on a resume is that someone has been able to take an area of focus and become very proficient in it. You recognize that every data scientist can't be great at everything, but you ideally want them to be great at *something*.

Ok, great - now how does this help us evaluate MS programs?

**Is this person smart enough = What is the university + prorgram's brand?**

While an interview process can certainly help you further refine your estimate as to how smart someone is, most hiring managers will (consciously or subconsciously) look for ways to estimate this faster while sifting through resumes. And academic achievement often becomes one of the places we look at first. 

Question to ask:

* How easy is it to get into this program? GRE scores, GPAs, what does the average person entering the program look like? Is it mostly kids with excellent grades from excellent undergrad programs in fields closely related to DS? Or is it basically ""anyone willing to pay for it""? Or somewhere in between?
* How easy is it to graduate from this program? Is it like an MBA where everyone graduates? Or is it like a traditional MS degree where the first semester often comes with some grade casualties?
* How is the university (and more specifically the STEM fields within the university) perceived by the people in the field? And is this program taught by the same faculty that have earned that reputation? The red flag here are programs that bring in lecturers just to teach the classes in this program.
* How new is the program? A newer program has a smaller sample size to evaluate its grads, therefore its brand will never be as strong as that of more established programs.

Now, let me be very clear here: just because someone graduated from Stanford, MIT, etc., it does not automatically make them smart. And just because someone graduated from a less reputable school, it does not mean they are not smart. However, hiring managers are human, and at the end of the day, if they see that a kid graduated with a MS in CS from Stanford vs. another kid who graduated with a MS in CS from the University of Alaska at Walrusville... your biases are going to start showing even if you are aware of the fact that this bias could be wrong. What's worse - some hiring managers will not even look at resumes that aren't from top, top schools (a horrible hiring practice).

So if you, as an individual, need to choose between two programs, at least one factor should be ""how smart will people think I am if I graduate with this degree from this school?"".

**Is this person productive? = How much work will you need to produce to graduate + how much work will you be enabled to do?**

Some programs require a capstone project. Some require a MS thesis. Some require at least one publication (which then doubles as your thesis). Some require internships on top of that. The higher the graduation requirements, the more likely it is that when you graduate, your resume will have more entries that show a hiring manager that you can do stuff (beyond going to class).

In addition to that, programs that encourage or facilitate grads to work in multidisciplinary projects, or personal projects, etc., will also helps grads in terms of filling out a resume.

**Will this person be able to learn the things about my company/industry that are necessary for the role? = Has this person shown the ability to learn about a specific domain already?**

Some programs are very theoretical - so much so that someone may graduate without every applying their work to an actual, specific industry application. I've seen this a LOT with people working in statistics and OR - where research will focus so much on methodology that the ""applications"" end up being horribly simplified, toy model-like constructs.

**Do they meet enough of the foundational technical skills required to do the job to where I think they can acquire the rest? = Do they at the very least know R or Python** ***really*** **well**

I could go on for hours here, but at the end of the day someone who is really strong in R or Python should be fine. SQL, Tableau, cloud stuff, git, etc, is all easy stuff to learn by comparison. But the more work you can show where you've used these, the better.

**Do they have an area in which they have demonstrated deep expertise? = Have they been recognized for their work in any given area (e.g., like through a publication)?**

This is the one area where programs that are MBA-like in nature really struggle, i.e., where the graduation requirement is a capstone project. Why? Because a capstone project is normally an exercise in execution, not depth. The goal of a capstone project is to arrive at a solution in a fixed amount of time. It is not to get a full understanding of the field and then try to make a contribution to the literature - as minute as that contribution may be.

However, it doesn't have to be a journal publication that validates you here - it could also be in the form of their work actually getting implemented by a company. Or receiving an award for the quality of their capstone project. But it needs to be something that says that other people - outside of your professors - thought this contribution was meaningful.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

With all of that listed, where do different programs fall? It's not always easy to say, but let's pick some examples and work through them:

**Masters degree in Computer Science from a top 10-20 program in the country  (e.g., UT Austin, Michigan, UCLA, Penn, Purdue):**

Smart? Probably - the admission requirements are pretty high for these schools/programs. Plus, these schools are normally well-regarded in STEM in general. I would assume that someone who met the criteria to be accepted is probably fairly smart. Also, these are programs that are hard to graduate from.

Productive? Maybe - you will need at least a thesis to graduate, but how much more than that you do is going to be very person dependent.

Domain knowledge? Probably low - these are programs that are going to focus much more on methodology and SWE skills than they are on any one individual industry.

Technical reqs? Pretty strong - you're not going to graduate (or maybe even get admitted) without knowing a good chunk of Python, SQL, coding practices, etc.

Deep expertise? Probably - graduation requires a thesis, so it's likely that someone with a MS in CS will have made a pretty deep dive into a given topic.

**MS in Business Analytics from a top 10-20 program in the country (same list of suspects):**

Smart? Maybe - the admission requirements are certainly not that stringent, and given that they follow an MBA model, in my experience they are not hard to graduate from. So I wouldn't just assume that someone who graduated from such a program to be automatically smart (although it certainly doesn't mean they are not smart - plenty of really smart people enroll in these programs).

Productive? Likely yes - there will be a lot of classroom projects, a capstone projects, and likely an internship (which most traditional programs don't do).

Domain knowledge? As strong as it can get in a classroom setting - you are much more likely to spend time talking about specific applications to specific problem statements in the real world.

Technical reqs? Questionable. It's likely that you will graduate knowing how to write Python code, but not to the level of someone with legit swe skills.

Deep expertise? Probably not. MS in BA programs tend to focus on breadth over depth, so it's unlikely that you will have spent a ton of time on any one area of data science - certainly not enough for you to become an expert. In my experience as a hiring manager, this is the spot that candidates from this background struggle with the most.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, does that mean that no one should ever enroll in a MS in DS program?

Not at all. It just means two things:

1. You should expect to compete for a different type of job. That is, it's highly unlikely that a hiring manager looking for someone with either a) deep expertise on any sub-area of DS or b) the ability to write production-quality code is going to look to someone with a MS in DS as their prime pipeline for candidates. However, someone looking for DS generalists and/or people who want to be much more business embedded/facing may very well find better fitting candidates in DS programs.
2. Going into it, you should know what areas you may need to further develop on your own. And this goes for both camps. 

* If you're studying CS, something you may want to do is develop your own personal portfolio of more applied projects where you can showcase your real-world problem-solving skills. 
* If you're in a MS in DS program, something you may want to do is spend more time outisde of class working on your programming chops."

I understand that poly could be new to some of the member here. I would share some general tips ar. 

for GPA you can refer to this link from SP(you can take this as a rough guide)

[https://www.sp.edu.sg/sp/student-services/osc-overview/student-handbook/grading-system](https://www.sp.edu.sg/sp/student-services/osc-overview/student-handbook/grading-system)

* Please pace yourself for your assignment and project. nobody will remind you one. your lecturer will only remind you on the deadline
* Please ensure you understand what is going on during lecture(pace maybe fast for some) you may consider to read reference book(either buy or borrow from library) or ask your lecturer if you have any query
* if possible is good to spend some time to recap what your lecturer has taught you today
* it would be good to find a group of people really want to study and form a study or project group(poly have some amount of project need to work in group)
* take note that every semester matter the gpa is cumulative so each subject grade matter
* do learn to time management your stuff
* it would be wise to find out more about FYP(final year project) during year 2 semester 2 then you may consider to plan our group or what project to take
* if possible to try explore and see if you can do some career planning 
* take your intern seriously, you may never know if the intern company may offer you (kena offer before) 

for those in IT course. you may refer to the link below (another guide by me)

So, to give some context, I started a new internship on January 18th. I work on Mondays and Thursdays. However, we worked remotely after my manager tested positive for COVID on the 19th (the day after my first day). She said she had a family emergency and let us out early on our first day - little do we know, I received a text that her son tested positive. Mind you, my manager and one other intern did not wear a mask. Fortunately, I tested negative but stayed quarantined for two weeks. 

Fast forward to today, which was my first day back in the office, I SEE THAT NO-ONE IS WEARING A MASK! Including my manager and the three interns I worked with!! 

They expected me to eat on my desk (no separate room to eat) which resulted in me skipping lunch. I did not want to take my mask off - especially after hearing the other intern’s working at clubs &amp; going out. 

So after posting this on r/covid19 and reaching out to friends, I decided to quit. I sent a message reading: 

“I had a great time in the internship and I loved meeting the team. But unfortunately, due to my concerns over the exposure to Covid, I'm afraid I won't be able to continue to come into the office. I was under the impression that there would be adequate safeguards in the office to account for the pandemic (mask requirement). But given the fact that no additional procedures were put in place even after a  staff member was revealed to have been exposed to it, I realize that what I had in mind was different from the office's actual policies. I see my sister who is currently pregnant frequently. I cannot risk this and I hope you understand. I appreciate the opportunity to experience interning at ______”

And then I received a reply that read: 

“Ok. Well (manager who had covid) tested negative a week ago. In addition the office was sanitized when we shut down for 2 weeks.
But if this is your decision that's fine. I'll find a replacement.”

I don’t think they understand that all of the procedures they’ve done does not matter if no one is wearing their masks. 

Should I tell him that or just move on lol I’m very happy that I quit after reading the response I got. 🥺 Stay safe everyone!"

lfviwr,7,2021-02-09,my old landlord is suing me,asianpersuasion1867,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lfviwr/my_old_landlord_is_suing_me/,"I rented from a landlord a room in VT on a month to month agreement. I had previously asked her if it would be available for three months for me to rent out because I had a summer internship there that was about three months long. The security deposit was $500 and the rent per month was $500. I paid her both for the month of June.

However, I was really depressed due to how secluded the area was and decided to move to a different town. There were always ants in the house due to it being built in 1840 and I always found them in in my room, the bathroom, and the kitchen (all in the cabinets too). I'm not sure if the other tenants noticed but they were everywhere. I didn't say anything to the landlord because I assumed that it was just because it's an old house that caused so many ants. I notified my landlord that I was seeking to move out and she texted me back saying okay, and to just let her know when I will be moving out so she can start showing the room.

The day I moved out, I cleaned the room (swept the floor, vacuumed, washed the sheets, bedding etc, wiped down the windows and the floor) and put everything back the way it was when I first moved in. I texted the landlord saying that I've officially moved out and that I had left my room keys in the door of my room before driving away. 

After waiting for over 2 weeks, I texted my landlord asking if she had sent my security deposit (check) back to CT (where I am from) and she said it should be there already. My parents verified that it wasn't. I waited another week. I then asked her if she could resend it because we hadn't received it for a few weeks. She told me to come pick it up and I had to tell her that I couldn't because I moved far away from her now and that I didn't have time during the day to drive that far and back to pick up the check.  I then asked if she would be willing to just send it to my new VT address instead. 

She did not respond. I called a month later, it is July now and she does not pick up. I left a voicemail asking politely if she had mailed it out or not. No response. I texted her again a week later and called again, but no response. My parents still hadn't received the check back in CT. So by late August, as I was leaving for CT to go back to school, I send her a letter demanding my security deposit back as was suggested by other tenants and vtlegalaid. So I did. 

She finally responded with a letter and half of my security deposit. She claimed that $250 was taken out because $10 I did not leave her the keys, $90 because she claims that my father peed on the floor of the bathroom when he was helping me move in and that she had to clean it, $50 extermination fee claiming that I had stored food in my room (I had only stored unopened boxes of crackers because the cabinets in the kitchen were infested), and $100 for a professional cleaning fee for the room I had rented.

I filed for a small claims case against my landlord, asking for the $250 back (it costed $65 to file). She did not respond and the next steps were to have the sheriff hand her the papers (over $50 to do this service) in which she promptly threw in his face and he wrote me a letter telling me this (affidavit). 

She finally answered (its Feb now) and she is doing a counterclaim for $1000, saying that I cost her that much money because I didn't stay for the entire three months. 

What should I do? She never said in text (which counts as in writing) that I would actually HAVE to stay for 3 months and since it was a month to month agreement, does that mean I could be held liable for that $1000? ($1000 is a lot for a college student paying for school). There were no terms added to the month to month agreement through text. All it said was month to month agreement. And she is still using the claims that she made in her letter when she sent back half of the security deposit. 

How can I counterargue this? I really don't understand how someone can tell if someone peed on their hardwood floor. How can she charge me for an exterminator fee and claim that no food was to be stored in my room when she never told me that food couldn't be stored in my room? And I thought that landlords couldn't charge for cleaning fees (I sent the court evidence of the cleaned room e.g. pictures). I sent the text messages between the landlord and I to the court too. I have yet to find a counterargument in court for the extermination but a text about me complaining about ants to my sisters in a groupchat might help as evidence. 

Thank you if anyone has advice/suggestions!"
lfvppo,513,2021-02-09,I tried coding after some time off and I ended up breaking down. I'm terrified of failing.,Shlano613,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/lfvppo/i_tried_coding_after_some_time_off_and_i_ended_up/,"At the beginning of 2020 right before Corona started, I took a boot camp to learn full stack web development. I expected to get an internship and a job straight away but because of the corona situation I wasn't able to. Ended up spending a few months doing Udemy courses in JS and React. I even eventually got a web development internship.

After spending months looking for jobs with no luck, I decided that I needed to be bringing in money for my wife and I so I decided to get a local job in security, which doesn't pay a tremendous amount but it's something. 

I want to give myself a few months to settle into my job before I decided to jump back into programming and look for jobs like that again. Yesterday I gave my first real concerted effort to try and jump back in and build some kind of project.

I open my laptop and tried to start a simple JavaScript project and I could barely do anything. I was trying to manipulate the DOM and nothing was working and I just broke down. I've been dealing with heavy anxiety for the last few months and I've always been very worried about my future and working and making money. 

Since I've started on my programming journey I've never felt confident in my own abilities. I really do want to get better and I was trying to start working on some independent projects which I've been hesitant to do. I ended up turning everything off and breaking down to my wife about being a failure and my fears of never being able to get a job as a programmer.

Looking back on it now, I think I may have bitten off more than I can chew thinking I could make an entire app from scratch after having been away from coding for a few months. I'm going to try and get back into Freecodecamp to get down to the basics again and go from there. 

I've never wanted something so badly but been so afraid to work at it. It was hard enough for me to even open my IDE and start writing a few lines, but hitting a wall so quickly on something that I've done many times before and should know just made me shut down. 

I don't want to give up, but I'm terrified of failing. I know it's part of it but still... 

Do you guys feel this way sometimes? Have you ever feared messing up so much you don't try at all? I feel stuck in this mindset and want to change and get better.

Edit: Thank you SO SO MUCH to everyone who commented! Rip my inbox.

I'm overwhelmed with the positivity here and I'm so thankful to everyone for their advice and support. Especially thank you to u/Daniel_SJ for your simply amazing offer and incentive. I will definitely be in touch soon. 

This community is so incredibly supportive and helpful. I won't give up guys, I promise."

Relatable experiences?",externitee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lfwzg9/2_years_out_of_college_with_a_cs_degree_trying_to/,"I graduated with a Bachelor's in CS 2 years ago. My goal was to find a job as a software engineer. When I was going through college, I realized I didn't apply myself enough, and by the time I realized it, it was too late. I didn't understand the importance of trying to get internships early on, and it wasn't really emphasized to me at school until my senior year. My main experience was doing most of the work on my group senior project with a startup, who promised some mentorship, but didn't really follow through. I wanted to specifically work in web development. 

After I graduated, I spent time taking courses for web dev (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), created a portfolio site, and a few small projects, and went on to applying to jobs. I had a few interviews, but no success in getting an offer. 9 months after graduation, I settled on a job with the state as a Database Admin. My goal was to continue coding on the side to eventually get myself to still become a software engineer. After about a year working, transitioning with the pandemic and some other life things, I finally started coding again. The work I was doing at the state wasn't fulfilling, and I really wanted to go back to doing something I enjoyed. I could always transition into a software engineering position at the state, but a lot of it is legacy systems, old technologies, managers with no goals of innovation, etc.

I am currently about 2 months in back to coding with a friend who is software engineer mentoring me. I've been working on a project and have a few more planned, but I'm starting to run into the big wall of imposter syndrome again. My goal for this post isn't to try to get myself to start applying right away, but set some goals that I cab accomplish and benchmark myself to get myself out of this hole. 

Things I'm looking for is maybe someone with similar experience of not going into software engineering right away, and finding their way back into it. Advice on getting jobs where there isn't a booming amount of big tech companies. I live in an area that is probably 80% government oriented private companies. And 20% mix of private companies using older and newer technologies. My goal is to land somewhere in those 20% of companies, but I feel like a lot of articles and posts end up being more towards big tech companies where as things like white board interviews aren't prevalent here.

I appreciate any tips and insights that anyone can provide. Thanks!

tl;dr graduated college 2 years ago with cs degree, couldn't land software engineering job, worked 1 year as a database admin, trying to get back into coding. need tips, especially with smaller companies"

Some people's physical and mental health have been negatively impacted, and some people have lost someone they loved. To you whose life has been upended by the pandemic, I'm truly sorry. I hope you will stay strong and get better and better from here.

But I really love being able to stay at home. I feel like I can control my life better from the comfort of my own bedroom. Prior to the pandemic, I felt like a zombie just going through the motions of living, barely catching any breath from all the humdrum of my busy, mundane, and mediocre life. When the stay-at-home order happened, it truly felt like a divine intervention that halted me from leading on this passive life and made me re-evaluate many of my former choices. 

I used to push a lot of valuable things in life aside, but now I'm able to better maintain friendships (my text-response rate has increased by at least 30%; I dropped off care packages for friends without having to meet them in person), plan out time in the week to exercise at the park (I used to not care about exercising), prep for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner, and put more time and energy into my academics and internships. I also save a ton of time and money by not having to travel or rent apartment. Not having to relocate to Georgia saves me a shit ton of money. Though OOS tuition is still no joke, I'm just glad that I don't have to worry about housing, parking, dining, etc. on top of tuition.

As many other universities project to resume in-person teaching next fall, I'm dreading that I'll have to move to Georgia and physically be on campus after summer. Pandemic has forever altered the course of my former way of life, which I don't miss a bit. If I have to reverse back to that old way of life, I think I'd be very depressed.

I'm wondering how everyone else here feels about the ongoing pandemic and current format of online classes. Do you hate remote classes and can't wait for in-person meetings to resume? Do you feel similarly relieved by the pandemic? What do you think about the possibility of returning to campus? Would you choose to take online classes if it's still an option? If fully online classes won't be an option anymore, will you celebrate or will you try hard to cope with it?"

Anyways we talked, she asked me a few questions on interests and experience. She also told me the salary for the role. Towards the end of the phone call, she gave me feedback and said she will set up an interview with the manager (direct supervisor for that role), and sent me the job description for it. This was going to take place the next day (28/01).

So I did the interview with the manager, he asked me basic interview questions, ran me through responsibilities and importance of the role. I was confident because I had the relevant experience they wanted. He said that he was looking for someone who took some extra time out of their studies to gain professional experience, and so far I had that. There were also other connections b/w the company and my experiences, so I was quite confident that it went well. And looking back, i could have done better but I did not have any regrets.

So after the interview, on the 1/02 (monday following week) I sent a thank you email to both the manager and the talent director. I didn’t receive a response and didn’t expect one since they could have been busy and its only been a few days.

Its now the following week (9/02)  and I’m wondering if i’ll look too desperate if I send a follow up email now. Should I follow up even though I got no response from both the manager and the talent director? How should i do it??? i understand the talent director could he busy because she manages all recruitment for different companies owned by the parent company. But the anxiieeetty is killing me.

I've been thinking about the k-mean clustering algorithm. Can I perhaps use it to cluster transactions or companies in some way? Is there something to learn about companies that saw their turnover/employee count drop as a result of the covid-19 outbreak and those that didn't.

I'm (25M) in a bit of a pickle right now, and I hope you'll be able to help me a bit and give me some advice.

Ever since I was a child, I've always loved drawing. I love manga and illustrations and I would've loved to learn how to draw. I tried teaching myself multiple times but I'd get overwhelmed and give up, trying to convince myself that it wasn't for me, and that I wasn't meant to do that after all.

For a while it worked. I tried to be more realistic and enrolled in a local university to study Computer Science. I lasted for two and a half years but eventually I gave up as I couldn't get myself to like many of the subjects.

Now I'm 25, and I can't stop thinking about drawing and daydreaming about how my life would've been if I'd chosen a different path. But still, my parents are now rightfully pressuring me to find a job and having no other qualifications I have to apply in this field.

I'm about to start a 7 month internship (32 hours a week for 500 euros) focused on back-end development and I honestly don't want to do it because that means that shit is about to get real. The internship is probably going to result in me getting hired, working 9 to 6, with an hour commute and no time or mental energy left to try to pursue my passion as a hobby. I spent the last couple of nights staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep thinking about the future that most likely that awaits me.

The only other option I can think about is to do the internship and in the meantime try and enroll in an art academy in order to start around September or October. 

Not only do I not know if my parent would support this decision, but also if I started the art academy this year I'd be 28 by the time I finish, and I don't know if it's worth it. In my mind it is, because it's what I've always wanted to do, but I know I most likely won't be able to find a job pertaining to it when I receive my degree.

Should I be realistic and get a job in tech while becoming a corporate slave, or should I be absolutely delusional and think to follow my dreams?"

I’m new to IT after deciding a career change is best for me (I know, I’m one of those guys). This is a long read, I’m sorry!!! I’ll give a couple gold medals to some of you fellas who help me! Not sure if you guys even give a shit about these medals and karma to begin with lol. Thanks ahead! 

u/Sovano suggested I make a post to get better feedback (thanks u/Sovano!) So my only relevant tech experience the past couple years was just installing devices and before that did call center tech support helping mechanics install electrical components to cars (but I did paint my resume in a way that emphasized IT technical experience although it was quite minimal). Other than that, I don’t have much experience or knowledge in IT. To make up for that, I’m working towards getting a Comptia A+, and also trying to learn coding and bash at the moment to get the necessary basic knowledge. 

I’m a graduate student set to graduate in spring 2022 with a master’s of information systems program and currently with a 4.0 GPA (bachelors in business management with a shitty GPA). I’m also currently in a Army ROTC program as well because I want to join the Reserves and land a military job that has to do with computers (like a cyber MOS) to get the training that I need to prepare me for the IT world, plus I think it would look good on my resume when I want to land a DoD job which is my main goal. Unfortunately, part of being in ROTC involves me doing a month of ROTC summer training which should conclude at the end of June, and I realize a lot of companies (including DoD companies) are doing 10-12 week internships like around end of May-August. 

I’m applying for these internships anyway for the summer and hoping I can explain to these DoD companies that I’ll need to miss the first few weeks of their internship program for ROTC, I’m not sure if they’re okay with that even though I know a lot of veterans and Reservists work at these sort of companies, which is why I’m sticking with DoD companies because they would appreciate me having a security clearance and I think they’d be okay with me being in the Reserves who has to drill every month and summer. I’d like to learn new skills at these internships and network with these companies and IT people. Crossing my fingers my clearance goes through by the summer. So money is NOT an issue, I’m even willing to do these internships for free. Location is NOT an issue either, I’ll literally go anywhere in the world to land a good internship, preferably a DoD company. 

I’m applying to these internships like crazy and I don’t know if I can even land one in the summer, especially in the DoD industry. That’s why I’m considering applying for part time help desk jobs for regular work while I’m in college, and maybe apply to these internships in the fall or spring if they even offer it in the fall or spring, or even better: the summer after I graduate (but I may still have to drill with a reserves unit by then lol). 

To top it off, I don’t even know what career path to take exactly. Although I’m interested in Systems Administration and Network Administration, but open to careers similar to these. DevOps is on my radar too. 

Thanks for getting this far!!!"

lg4iut,0,2021-02-09,How important are internship roles to first job?,jimmyspinsggez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lg4iut/how_important_are_internship_roles_to_first_job/,"I am a software engineering student and graduating this year. I aim to get a grad job as software engineer - backend or mobile side.

I have been looking out for internship opportunities so I can increase the chance of me being hired as a grad in a nicer tech firm.

However, when seeking for internship, all I've been offered are roles that are not quite relevant to software engineer. I have been offered QA engineer intern and data analyst intern the most, but none of the software dev intern.

Now its been half a year since I started looking and I start to wonder if it is okay for me to just take one of those roles, just for the sake of having another role in the work experience section on my resume? Or if the roles I was offered are not related to what I want, I should not jump into them as they don't contribute to skills and knowledge of the domain I wish to be in?

Please share me your wisdom."
lg4lio,24,2021-02-09,What book to get to Understand c++ in depth?,[deleted],AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/lg4lio/what_book_to_get_to_understand_c_in_depth/,"Hey guys, I'm a 21 year old computer engineer student. My coursework thus far was a mix of computer science, electrical engineering and computer hardware mix, but I mostly was inspired by software development and I am actively pursuing internships in the field. 

I had some interviews proceed to the final stage, but unfortunately no offer for now and I think it's because of the way I code. I can come up with the solution pretty quickly but I don't think I have the most optimal code and I make rookie mistakes cause while in my free time I always relied on stack overflow to get simple things like initialization of objects, etc. Also I have been working on python for the last year and my c++ is kinda rusty, so I really want to dive deep and understand the underlying structures.

I feel that I am really experienced with coding fundamentals and data structures, but I am lost in terms of how c++ works in the background, and I feel that I should improve this to give myself better opportunities but to also write better code. 

So my question is, do you recommend any text book that goes super in depth? I have the C++ Programming Language by Stroustrup and I think to start by reading it in it's entirety. Is this the proper way to go and is it any good ?"
lg4npm,33,2021-02-09,Best Engineering and Technology Summer Programs 2021,theadmissionsangle,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/lg4npm/best_engineering_and_technology_summer_programs/,"If you haven't already checked it out, [here's my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kx6fpi/summer_programs_for_high_school_students_covid/)  on summer programs in general. Check it out to get an general framework  for evaluating summer programs on your own. If you're interested in  engineering or technology, you've come to the right place. Again, I apologize that many of these programs' application deadlines have passed, but this year has been quite difficult for organizing summer programs given the COVID situation.

Students interested in engineering and computer science also don’t have the opportunity to really explore these subjects sufficiently in high school. If you’re lucky, your school has engineering courses that you can take as electives or computer science courses beyond AP Comp Sci. Most students interested in engineering and CS have had to be resourceful in finding opportunities to confirm their interests or hone their skills. You know the type. The self-starters who taught themselves to code since they were in elementary school. They’re serial hobbyists interested in robotics, 3D printing, Arduino projects, or cryptography. But what if you have tech/engineering interests and don’t fit this mold?

If you come from any kind of underrepresented minority in STEM (woman, black, latino, native american), there are often even fewer opportunities and resources to ever get involved in Python coding or FIRST Robotics competitions. Luckily, there are a number of summer programs that try to address these inequalities in opportunity. They are often free programs that explicitly say on their application pages that they are looking for a certain type of applicant. Given the inequities inherent in education, these programs are great for inspiring a more diverse, next generation of STEM students.

If you’re not from an underrepresented minority, there are still a number of programs and opportunities to spend your summer. Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth has some great lists for [computer science and math internships and research programs](https://cty.jhu.edu/resources/academic-opportunities/internships/math.html) that have some overlap with some programs on this list. Overall, if you’re a engineering, tech, or CS interested student, we advocate - more than anything - to get your hands dirty by working on independent projects, completing online courses, and just generally taking charge of your education.

The following list represents engineering, technology, and computer science programs that most top schools have heard of. To get a better idea as to the competitiveness and admissions value of each program, I’ve tiered the programs into three categories: S-Tier, A-Tier, and B-Tier.

# S-Tier: Must Go If Admitted

1. [Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES)](https://oeop.mit.edu/programs/mites)  
Program Dates: ***Cancelled 2021***  
Application Deadline: ***Cancelled***  
Cost: ***Free***  
International Students: ***No (US residents/citizens only)***  
***\*\*\*MIT is encouraging traditional MITES applicants to apply to the*** [***MOSTEC program***](https://oeop.mit.edu/programs/mostec)
2. [Women’s Technology Program (WTP)](http://wtp.mit.edu/?wm=3049_b111)  
Program Dates: ***Virtual, June 26th - July 23rd (4 weeks)***  
Application Deadline: ***January 15th 2021 (passed)***  
Cost: ***Free***  
International Students: ***No (US residents/citizens only)***
3. [NASA Internships](https://intern.nasa.gov/)  
Program Dates: ***Start -- Late May/Early June, End -- August*** ***(ten weeks, numerous projects and locations)***  
Application Deadline: ***February 1st, 2021***  
Cost: ***Free (majority of interns are paid a stipend)***  
International Students: ***No (US citizens only)***  
***\*\*\*Fall and Spring session internships are also available***

MITES and WTP are both extremely selective programs run by MIT. They were both created to help underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields learn more about technology and engineering. For MITES, applicants should be minorities from underrepresented ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. They also prefer to admit students who will be first-gen college applicants. Specifically, their website says they encourage students who are African American, Hispanic/Latino, or Native American.

WTP focuses on addressing the under-representation of women in STEM fields. Each accepted student chooses the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) or Mechanical Engineering track and takes rigorous courses related to the field. WTP really tries to accept female applicants who are strong in math/science classes but don’t really know what engineering is. They seem to prefer students who apply to the program with somewhat limited engineering experience. While they are different from MITES in wanting to accept female applicants only, they also do give priority to students who come from underrepresented backgrounds.

The NASA internship programs are available to high school students aged 16 or older. However, these positions are also available to undergraduate and graduate level students, making it extremely difficult to successfully get accepted. Those that are accepted certainly will see some admissions value in their participation, as these programs are quite long and contribute to actual NASA missions. If a student does have a dream to one day work for NASA, these internships could be worth applying for multiple times, even after they’ve gone off to college. I’d suggest reaching out to [NASA’s STEM Engagement Offices](https://www.nasa.gov/stem/about.html) to learn more about what you can do to prepare for your application to any of these internship programs.

These next batch of programs are all quite different, but they all give students opportunities to learn about, explore, or even perform research in the fields of engineering and computer science. Each program’s acceptance rate here is still quite low and admissions are very competitive. These programs range from free to paid programs that cover a variety of fields and topics. The rankings here are, again,debatable, but overall, they are all programs that most admissions officers at top schools have heard of and provide invaluable science and engineering experiences that admissions officers will value.

The Jerome Fisher M&amp;T Program is quite different in scope but similar in how competitive admissions are. M&amp;T is a joint engineering and business program, run by the Wharton Business School and Penn Engineering department. Students who are also interested in business would probably enjoy the M&amp;T program. The mission for this program is quite different from MITES and WTP, in that it is an expensive program that doesn’t mention financial aid at all on its website. This is one of those rare paid programs that are just as competitive as some of the best free programs, and if you’re a student interested in applying to the M&amp;T program at Penn, admission here can give you the opportunity to secure a recommendation letter that helps you in admission. As it is quite a competitive program, other engineering and business programs likely look at it favorably from an admissions standpoint as well, though I would caution students to be aware of the privilege that a program like this affords certain students.

Simons, Clark Scholars, SEAP, HSHSP, and RISE are all research programs that give you the opportunity to research in engineering and CS fields. They are very competitive, as mentioned in our [best science research summer programs article](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2021/01/06/best-science-research-summer-programs/).

These programs are still meaningful experiences and can be great for students in their sophomore year who are not quite competitive enough to apply to the higher tier programs. Each of these are quite specialized, ranging from engineering research to data science opportunities.

LaunchX is a technology and entrepreneurship program that is somewhat similar to Jerome Fisher, though not quite as competitive. LaunchX focuses more on actual entrepreneurship through technology and centers it’s program on building your own startup company. Students work on actual product development with engineers and learn about the business idea pitch process with business mentors. For technology and engineering interested students who are also curious about the business/entrepreneurship side of things, LaunchX could work for them. There have been issues with the program as of late, which has dropped it from a competitive program to a B-tier level, but we'll see if they can turn the ship around moving forward. AI4ALL focuses on teaching minority students about programming and AI to better prepare them for the quickly changing technology world. Girls Who Code focuses exactly on what you’d expect, helping more girls to get interested in coding and apply to computer science programs in college. There can certainly be admissions value in these programs in the form of an outstanding recommendation from a mentor or advisor in any of these programs.

There are certainly a few more programs that belong in this category, but these are the ones that I have experience with. If you don’t care about admissions value, these programs can be a great option to spend time in the summer. However, without the residential experience and community aspects of the virtual programs, they might not be worth the cost.

# BONUS PROGRAMS

[MOSTEC](https://oeop.mit.edu/programs/mostec) is an MIT research program that runs over the course of six months. It starts in the summer, so it could perhaps classify as a summer program, but I'll keep it here in the bonus section for now. Because MITES was cancelled this year due to COVID, they have been encouraging students to apply for the MOSTEC program instead, which is conducted mostly virtually. The program is also highly competitive and a great opportunity for students interested in engineering/technology to do research and get mentored by professors and professionals in your field of interest.

The [Ace Mentor Program](https://www.acementor.org/) is a year-long program that connects high school students interested in Architecture, Construction, or Engineering with mentors who are actually in those fields. Students get to work in teams and interact with professionals in a design team that emulates a professional setting. With over 10,000 students in the program and locations all over the US, ACE is an impactful and somewhat accessible opportunity that helps motivate students to get into architecture, engineering, and construction. While they do boast a majority of their students being minorities and one-third of them being female, there are students from all kinds of backgrounds who participate.

Edit: Adjusted LaunchX ranking from A-tier to B-tier and added the MOSTEC program as a bonus.

lg4qso,1,2021-02-09,Is it too late to pursue a career in art?,throwaway09022021,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lg4qso/is_it_too_late_to_pursue_a_career_in_art/," 

Hey everyone. I'm (25M) in a bit of a pickle right now, and I hope you'll be able to help me a bit and give me some advice.

Ever since I was a child, I've always loved drawing. I love manga and illustrations and I would've loved to learn how to draw. I tried teaching myself multiple times but I'd get overwhelmed and give up, trying to convince myself that it wasn't for me, and that I wasn't meant to do that after all.

For a while it worked. I tried to be more realistic and enrolled in a local university to study Computer Science. I lasted for two and a half years but eventually I gave up as I couldn't get myself to like many of the subjects.

Now I'm 25, and I can't stop thinking about drawing and daydreaming about how my life would've been if I'd chosen a different path. But still, my parents are now rightfully pressuring me to find a job and having no other qualifications I have to apply in this field.

I'm about to start a 7 month internship (32 hours a week for 500 euros) focused on back-end development and I honestly don't want to do it because that means that shit is about to get real. The internship is probably going to result in me getting hired, working 9 to 6, with an hour commute and no time or mental energy left to try to pursue my passion as a hobby. I spent the last couple of nights staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep thinking about the future that most likely that awaits me.

The only other option I can think about is to do the internship and in the meantime try and enroll in an art academy in order to start around September or October.

Not only do I not know if my parent would support this decision, but also if I started the art academy this year I'd be 28 by the time I finish, and I don't know if it's worth it. In my mind it is, because it's what I've always wanted to do, but I know I most likely won't be able to find a job pertaining to it when I receive my degree.

Should I be realistic and get a job in tech, or should I try and follow my dreams?"

I graduated from GT May 2020 with a BS in CS (concentration in Intelligence-Media) with a 3.4/4.0. Originally I planned to do the BSMS program but the advisors told and my application wasn't able to be processed (something about not being able to apply the semester you graduate). Currently working as a software dev at an FFRDC and have two recs from my supervisors and one from my tech communication professor. I only did 3 years of undergrad (graduated early) so I've only had two internships and I've been working full-time for maybe half a year now. I've been looking at some of the other posts on this subreddit and most people have a lot more qualifications than I do, so should I hold off, take some more classes, get more experience, and apply later? Also is a 3.4 low enough to warrant needing an explanation in my SOP? I took a few of the joint undergrad/grad courses at Tech, should I mention that? Am I just too anxious about this?"

I'm a senior in a CS bachelor's at a not-large-not-small state school. I will be graduating in summer (May 2021) with a pretty poor GPA (&lt;3.0 after this rough semester). Admittedly, my resume and GitHub are not too strong right now. I have an internship on there, my senior project, my volunteer experience, and that's more or less it. I was REALLY hoping to use Summer to strengthen my resume with some side projects while I take the 1 or 2 classes that I need over summer BEFORE I start applying.

however, I was recently told that a lot of companies batch summer graduates with Spring graduates. I guess my question is this: should I start applying to full time NOW, knowing that I have a slightly weaker resume / experience / projects, OR should I wait until I have the chance to strengthen that resume over summer before I start applying? I just don't want a company to look at my weaker resume if I apply now, put it in a pile of ""not qualified for this job"", and then when I DO have a stronger resume (at the end of Summer), I've already been ruled out for this hiring batch (I have no idea if this is how hiring actually works, any insight would be helpful).

Thank you so much in advance for any advice"

I'm planning to apply for Fall internships, and I started to browse through different job postings. I was unpleasantly surprised to see that most companies that I'd love to intern at, such as Amazon and Apple, require majoring in CS BS.

I'm a student at high ranking university from which FAANG hires a lot of students. I had to switch from BS to BA due to updated degree requirements, and I don't want to stay for an extra year to graduate with BS for financial and personal reasons. However, both BA and BS have huge overlap with little difference, however, because of high demand for CS classes at my uni (it is almost impossible to register for some classes), I won't be able to finish BS in 1 year.

**Is it worth applying for internships that require CS BS? Or am I just going to be automatically rejected if I put on my resume that I major in CS BA? If this is the case, can you recommend any companies that hire people with CS BA?**

lg8bt7,0,2021-02-09,Potential career choices for my awkward degree?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lg8bt7/potential_career_choices_for_my_awkward_degree/,"I'm currently an undergrad doing a math/CS dual degree from the top university in my country with the caveat that the focus on CS is largely theoretical and not application-based: while there have been several programming courses that have spanned anything from python to functional programming, the bulk of the curriculum has been algorithms and computation (automata, complexity theory, yada yada yada). I've been coding independently and competitively and have become alright in it, but my experience is still not really close to people doing engineering or a pure CS degree. 

I'm wondering what potential career choices I have with this awkward mixture of theoretical CS and math, and in general looking at my interests I'm almost certainly going to get a master's before I join the industry. The issue is that I'm not interested in programming all that much - my main interest is cryptography and cybersecurity, with a second option probably being an analyst or statistician.

Based on this, I'm going to take a call on whether I should continue competitive programming, internships and also what I'm going to commit to for my masters in CS.

**Tl;dr:** Weird degree focusing on Theoretical CS, interested in cybersecurity and an analyst position over a developer. What options do I have?"
lg96xl,2,2021-02-09,How do you go about asking for more work (especially in a WFH context)?,Consulting-FinTA21,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/lg96xl/how_do_you_go_about_asking_for_more_work/,"So, going to try to keep this concise, but it goes a bit deeper than the title question itself.

So I work in software consulting for a software company. On my 2020 Review, I got marked down on initiative, because I wasn't actively asking for enough work.

Now, a part of me feels like this was a distortion of the truth and not representative. 

&amp;#x200B;

So from Jan to roughly July, I was working with my original product group. My PM wrote on my review that I was not reaching out enough for more work. Now what annoyed me about this is I only heard about this in August from my RM for my mid-year review. I was never told anytime before that even implicitly that I was having issues regarding this matter, so I had no clue he wanted me to go about this differently. Also, truth be told, there was a pretty big slump in available work for the time surrounding COVID. I was asking for work quite a bit, but after weeks of getting not much in response -- I chalked it up to COVID causing the work pipeline to dry up a bit. After about a month in, they started assigning me projects and tasks, so I assumed they were going to give me whatever work they could find. 

Now, what really annoyed me was what came after this. I got loaned to a different product department because they were really understaffed, and I was supposed to be able to get more bilable hours there (that ended up being less than true FYI). I was working crazy hours during the period of this loan (from August to late January) and my PM was extremely micromanaging and wanted to do multiple internal meetings everyday. I was actively back-logged my entire time during the time I was in this product group, and on top of this -- I got no proper product training and most people in the department were very unwilling to help me. What annoyed me about this is he would claim something about not taking on enough work despite the fact they threw me on as the only active consultant on multiple projects without any product training, and I was constantly backlogged (there was hardly any time besides the week of holidays that were actually light on work).

&amp;#x200B;

Kind of going off on a tangent in this paragraph, but tbh, the PM in this group was very counterproductive -- would constantly promise things to the client that weren't agreed upon in the contract (nor did he get director approval on), would argue with people who were more experienced than him, constantly wanted internal status update meetings despite him showing zero effort to get involved or assit on the cases (in fact, he would just straight up have the consultants lead the external update meetings -- so internal meetings were almost completely useless and a waste of time), wasn't even aware of key deadlines or how to reschedule certain deadlines in the project (another consultant had to open the project gant chart/calendar and show him where exactly we could move a certain deliverable without missing the key project deadline, because he seemed so convinced it was impossible to do as such), and was just generally very unorganized (one day he'll claim we'd have a lot of hours to bill, then literally the next day he'll claim we didn't have many hours to bill). 

The only time I ever refused to take on a task was when there was a major issue causing a work stoppage. I was only about a month into the group and had never seen the issue before, so I suggested to my PM that it might be best to escalate this to a more senior resource instead of having me (a person who knows less about the product than the client and barely had 3 weeks of actual experience in the product) to try to spend hours away researching with a low likelihood of coming to a sufficient solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm back with my original group (thank fuck), but my reporting manager told me this is something they want me to work on in Q1, and if I'm still not up to par -- they will consider putting me on probation.

I'm with a different PM now, **but she doesn't seem to like me bothering her about asking for more work, so now I feel really puzzled on what to do.** I personally hate asking people for work too (especially more than once every other day), because it just makes them realize you don't have much work to do, and I feel like I'm being judged personally because of that (I had a bad experiences at multiple internships where I asked for more work and got scolded, so it feels a bit traumatizing doing it today). On a side note, isn't it part of the PM's job to make sure everyone is actively being leveraged and utilized sufficiently (and not to let months go by without them being utilized as such)? 

\-- 

I'm not saying I'm perfect or am unwilling to improve, but the review being framed in a sense where I couldn't defend myself at all (and couldn't even ask for concrete examples of X claims) felt very annoying.

From the very first semester I struggled in school. I was barely able to maintain a B- GPA which was needed to enter the internship program for my school. Luckily I just passed the requirements and enter the program. A big tip for those looking, one of the biggest reasons I managed to find a position was I started applying ASAP. The first day I was enrolled in the program I started hammering out applications and it paid off. I was interviewed for a position in a nuclear facility and I ended up getting the job. A lot of my peers waited until after midterms and by that time there was so many people applying for limited positions it was difficult to find a job. During my time there I saw a lot of other interns who sat around all day, kept their head down and just do their work, and some who chose to do practically nothing at all. Honestly the time you spend in your internship should be spent expanding your network and building your skills, so that's what I did. I volunteered for absolutely every project I could get my hands on and made a significant effort to build my network. I can honestly say this was the smartest thing I have ever done. A lot of my friends who graduated last year have struggled to find a job let alone get an interview, and my one friend has sent out over 300 applications. Because I worked hard to expand my network I was able to use that network to get 3 job interviews and 2 job offers before winter semester even started. Now I know this can be attributed also to good luck, but after talking to my other friends who found jobs their experience was the same. If you have someone in your network who know you, and knows that you're reliable and a hard worker, that can do wayyy more for your career than a degree ever could. So please those of you who are on or have an internship coming up, make the most of it! Network and volunteer for everything you can, good references and building your networks can make a world of difference.

I feel kind of dumb because I was a communications major beforehand but when people asked what I wanted to do with it my mind always went blank and then i decided to switch majors and looking at my school’s catalog nothing even remotely interested me but I decided to pick journalism because i used to love writing when I was younger and even pursuing this degree I worked on my colleges newspaper and did an internship and I enjoyed it. I’m really into pop culture and I love researching topics and learning new things. Now i kind of don’t like writing, i like the researching topics part but that’s about it. 

Now i have this degree and I don’t know what to do with it or where to look for jobs. And I want to get a full time job (things in my life have changed and it’s giving me the push to get off my butt and finally get a full time job with my degree). People around me suggest I go back to school but 1) i don’t have the money and 2) i literally don’t have an idea what to study. I look into the future and I cant see myself with a dream job

I think my question is, is there someone professional I can talk to about where I can go to look for jobs or what i can do with my degree even though my love for writing has faded. Any advice is helpful thank you."

I am 26 year old male from Norway. I have a bachelor degree in computer science (no work experience) and am currently completing my fourth year of medical school (out of 6) at the same university. No work expierence here either, only some internships thats part of the education.

My degrees in CS are C+ B- on average and i have passed the four years of medical school (No grades in Norway in this university).

Want to move somewhere else. Never been happy living in such a small country and i dont like the weather at all.

I was planning in testing the waters by doing some exchange student semesters, but was unable to because the semester of CS my mom got sick so i couldent leave and now it's COVID.

I am quite unhappy with medidical school though and wont finish it, i'd much rather work as a CS tech guy.

So any advice on where to get CS jobs in the countries and if it's easy to get a job as a CS guy? I've asked some Norwegian / International companies if they could hire me and put me in the international devisions. So far the job market is pretty shitty though due to covid so we wil lhave to wait and see.

I dont have a lot of money saved up (25 k US dollars) so i could live for a few months without a job. Regarding Australia as well i've heard of holiday visas for a year where you can work. Is that a possible part for entery to a more premanent visa?

The preferences in title are ordered. :)

In January, I got an offer from American Airlines to start this coming August and I accepted it (definitely want to work here). I’m now sitting here idly looking for a contract position for the next couple months, but recently got an offer for a company to start this month. What I need help with: 

Should I accept this offer and work in between now and August, only to leave them for when I start American Airlines? 

Concerns: 

1) American Airlines takes this badly when they perform a background check and see me working for another company, only to leave for them coming August.

2) Obviously only working at this company for the time being, they’ll probably be mad I’m leaving them only a couple months in.

3) With the COVID situation, very slight fear about what if American Airlines pulls the offer due to funds or whatnot. 

I’ve been stressing about this quite a bit so if I could have any help that would be much appreciated. Thanks so much all, it’s been quite a hard couple of months in the job search and good luck to all who are searching."

I got some awesome advice from this Reddit and am hoping I could once again get your two cents. 

Here’s some quick info to catch you up: 
-Psychology B.A. with minors in Applied Psych and Education
-graduated Summer 2020
-career goal: get a PhD in school psychology after 2 gap years to build a better application 

The dilemma: we all feel how hard job searching is, and not even a month ago I was angsting about the dreadful radio silence after submitting tons of applications. I was waiting on a really sweet promising position as a School District Spanish-English translator simply because it was full time and the pay was $23/hr (basically a million bucks to a broke college kid). 

They took too long with the hiring process (lots of testing?) and I was getting nervous so I accepted an entry level job as a Behavior Technician in an org that serves children with autism. Objectively my current position has more to do with my major than the translator job, but it’s part time and is only $17/hr, and I’m hurting to move out. However, the translator job can lead to a reimbursed tuition and an internship as schools are in need of bilingual psychologists in our area. 

Here’s where I get confused: suddenly all the jobs I applied for are calling me for interviews! I declined the ones that pay less or that I wasn’t really interested in, but one place is offering full time as a bilingual Outreach Mentor and their pay is $19/hr. It’s slightly more relevant to my career goals than the translator job (I would  help disadvantaged families to procure valuable social services etc). 

Would it hurt my career if I took the school translator job and then went to grad school, or do you think grad schools want relevant experience? 

Also I know that my situation is the opposite of a problem! I’m sending out positive energy to the universe to get all of you guys callbacks and companies that value you. Obligatory: you all deserve to make a good living and I am super grateful that my own situation is improving."

Recently, I passed the Network+ certification after taking a community college course, but my problem is that I've never really worked hands-on with any of the tools they want me to have experience with, like Help Desk and Windows Server.  I've only worked very briefly with simulation mock-ups.

I can't afford to attempt to get a degree or work an internship, so I'm trying my best to relate my time in specialty retail to customer service, but beyond documenting customer issues, I'm at a loss.  I'm especially stuck on what to include in my cover letter to really catch the hiring manager's attention, as I'm sure however I cut it, hiring me and helping me gain my first genuine experience in an IT position must realistically be seen as a riskier choice for the employer than simply waiting for somebody with more relevant experience to apply.  Has anybody else navigated similar situation(hopefully from retail) with a similar lack of experience?

Edit: Would it help that I make clear my intention to use the position as a steppingstone, gathering first-time experience and pursuing certificates and more involved, higher-paid positions?"

Recently I've been applying on my university's platform to get internships where I'm located to medium/large sized compagnies (they are no FAANG, but are popular locally) and I'm getting absolutly no interviews whatsoever. Most of my experience is in web dev but I wanted to try something else (you know for an internship) and tried getting one in infosec and gamedev. I thought that most of the programming skills I have are easily transferable (and I also took optional courses on the subject and passed with excellent grades).

I have more than 3 years of actual professional experience in web development and multiple personal projects on GitHub, I have my website (React/TS), a library I made for GraphQL, a mobile app in Flutter, a small game in Unity, some CTF writeups and school projects (Java/Python/C++). I made sure to put only good stuff that I'm actually proud on my GitHub with clean, well structured code and with good commit history. I also have multiple Udemy certifications posted on my Linkedin (I know they don't mean shit, but I thought they show that I like learning new things), I've done the eJPT and I'm studying for the OSCP which I've put in my description.

I have to say though that my personal GPA is not very high (\~2.8) because since I've been mainly focusing on my side projects that I feel are more rewarding and I'm learning way more out of them. Since I'm applying on my school platform (which is required to make the internship count with the school) they automatically send my grades.

On the platform, I can also see who else applied to the internship and have their name and if they got call for an interview and I saw one of the internship I was refused for that some guy got an interview and well I've looked him up on Facebook/Linkedin/GitHub and he had no public repositories and no professional work experience (only internships).

I'm feeling really confused and genuinely down that I'm getting no interviews with all I'm doing and providing. I really feel like either they think I'm overqualified (but they shouldn't care if that's the case right, the better for them) or I'm screened right away because of my grades.

Here's what my resume looks like, don't mind the mistakes, English is not my first language and I've auto translated the content.

Got called for a 2nd interview last wee. This afternoon, I got an email which was yet another rejection email. Rejection after rejection. It's bringing me close to the point of just giving up altogether on job hunting. Come May, it'll be 3 years since I graduated with a bachelor's degree, and I've still had no luck breaking the ice into IT. I don't have the money to pursue IT certifications and training courses and materials, and I'm in no position to save up the money to do so. COVID continues to impact the job market as there's hardly any job security anymore. I can't really ""network"" to see who may know of entry level opportunities. Heck, ""entry level"" doesn't seem as open as you'd think it should be. Most ""entry level"" positions want anywhere from like 3-7 years experience minimum, so how can people who have very little or no working experience and college degrees be expected to even land entry level work when it's so difficult? Even trying to reformat my resume isn't helping much either. I have no experience outside of 1 internship and 2 college degrees.

I have no confidence in the job hunting process anymore as I always die on interviews. It's nearly impossible to hold on to faith in a breakthrough will come for me. With almost 3 years of hard luck and rejections, it's killing me physically and mentally. I'm this close to going batshit insane and giving up on the job hunt altogether."

It’s mostly my fault. I didn’t apply to enough companies for internships, and I wasted away my winter break instead of applying for more companies, learning new skills, and practicing for interviews. 

Right now I’m in the interview process with several companies but things aren’t looking good. I only have course projects like my CS307 project to refer to in interviews, and I’ve forgotten a lot of the concepts I’ve learned. I’m so stressed with schoolwork that I find little time to do independent coding or time to practice interview skills.

I only have 1 more semester after this and I feel like I have very little practical skills. I’m familiar with a few frameworks here and there, but I still haven’t found my SWE niche.

I guess my questions are

- How can I best prepare for the job market? 

- Best things to do during the summer? 

- Best certifications to go for? 

- Best resources/websites to learn from?

- Best tools and frameworks to learn?

If anyone else was in this situation, I’d like to hear your story. Thanks"

**Letters of Recommendation**

*English Teacher (9/10): I love her. She always recommended the right books to me, she makes english really fun. I've had her since freshman year and she has really watched me grow and mature.*

*Physics Teacher (8/10):* Also advisor for 2 of my clubs so he can speak to my responsibility and organizational skills. Can talk about my easy understanding of math and physics concepts. Really understanding, lenient, and reliable guy.

*Co-Director of the Non-Profit that I intern for (9/10):* Started as an intern during 9th grade so she can also attest to my growth and coming out of my shell since I started. Have a really close relationship, she's really fun and always listens to my ideas. Couldn't have asked for a better advisor.

*Spanish Teacher (9/10):* Spanish is one of my favorite subjects so she can attest to my language skills. Also have a close relationship and I have eaten lunch in her room since 10th grade. She's definitely one of my favorite teachers, and I love her dearly.

**Interviews**

*Upenn-* He was Class of 2019 so we connected pretty well. It was a phone interview and he only asked me why Penn and why huntsman (the program I applied to) then I got to ask questions for the rest of the interview. Said I was a good fit

*Georgetown-* He was from Puerto Rico so we connected on being from islands and being POC. He was really transparent about his experience at Georgetown. I think he liked my community involvement and social activism.

*Yale-* Had it with a current senior. She was really nice and we talked about IR and she 'poked' my answers a bit, she asked about my opinons on nuclear proliferation that I was not expecting. But other than that it went great.

*Tufts-* Had a group interview with 4 other students and an admissions officer because I did their Fly-In program. It was good, the most conversational out of all. Kind of hard to stand out but I think I did.

**Essays**

*Common App-* About my family history and how hearing those stories my whole life shaped me. More specifically, being of Ethiopian and Haitian heritage and Ethiopia was never colonized, and Haiti had a successful slave rebellion. It was about feeling that I had to be exceptional because of my ancestors, but also feeling proud and inspired by their liberation.

My other essays were about being from the Virgin Islands, my extracurriculars, and why I'm interested in IR.

I am brand new out of college and so far this is my only professional experience (no internships or anything). This position was advertised as a Site Reliability Engineer position but is almost certainly just a operations role. I spend most of my days responding to alerts and upgrading applications. Slightly just dabbling in docker and terraform. I have really wanted to get into the developing side of things as I really enjoyed coding with Python with my passion projects and school projects. 

A job just opened up on our company portal for a Java/SQL developer. (I dont have any experience in either and the job listing asks for 3+ years) although my job posting also required years of experience and I was hired with no experience. I think I would like both the pay and the work of being a software developer rather than operations/SRE/devops. 

I have a great relationship so far with him but we don't talk much as he's always incredibly busy. I feel like in my few months here, I've already made an impression on all my peers and colleagues so I think I could get a good word in if they asked. Although, will it look bad that I am trying to transfer jobs so soon. I am worried that since I am so new, word might get around to my manager that I applied and they could potentially want to fire me since I am job hunting or something like that. 

Is it accepted to want to move into another position so soon? Has anyone else done something like this? Any help is incredibly appreciated."

I am a junior CS major living in California in the Bay Area and at my current internship I’m making $24.60. The internship I’m interviewing for (second round) is more or less expecting an answer for how much I want/expect (since I asked for time to research the first time I was asked). They said that they have competitive wages/salaries for CS internships but I don’t necessarily know what that means. They’re also not a startup but not exactly Google. 

Essentially, how far can I push the rate within reason?"

Save the date and register your interest:** [**https://industryday.cs.toronto.edu/**](https://industryday.cs.toronto.edu/)

I'm sure some of your have seen me around the subreddit, but let me introduce myself. My name is Julian. I'm a Senior Software Developer at GitHub and the instructor for [CSC491/2600](https://csc491.dcsil.ca).

I've worked as an instructor for almost 2 years and over that time I've had a handful of industry folks in to give talks to my class. I realized this year that David Jorjani of CSC301 does the same.

After David and I chatted we decided it would be helpful to all DCS *(department of comp sci)* students to host an ""industry day"" for everyone. We know this year has *^((puts on professor voice))* been unprecedented and troubling - especially for finding internships and job hunting in general. Which is why ~~you can't have that extension~~ we hope this will help some of you connect with industry &lt;3

This will be a day of talks, Q&amp;A, and panels by professionals in 5 tentative categories:

* Software Engineering
* ML, AI, &amp; Data
* UI &amp; UX
* Infrastructure
* Product and Entrepreneurship

We are working with the department to make this a success, though our schedule is still to be announced past a ""save the date"" of March 8th. We hope you'd like to attend!

lgn4ha,272,2021-02-10,Note for the discouraged CS majors,YouALilCray,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/lgn4ha/note_for_the_discouraged_cs_majors/,"As someone who graduated last semester and luckily found a full time software engineer position(super average salary), I just wanted to share my experience being an average CS major at UMD. 

**About me:** 

First I had zero coding experience and was very average in math. I also had few part-time jobs throughout the semesters (mainly on weekends). 

**Course history/experience/tips:** 

***Here was how I started out my first two semesters:***  

* Calc II: C
* CMSC131 (Fawzi): C
* CMSC132 (Fawzi): C
* CMSC250 (Kruskal led): C 
* STAT400: C

As you can see, I sucked at math and I barely escaped the major weed out classes. My advice for **CMSC131/132** is focus on time management. You probably will hear this a million times, but try to start your projects early. Or at least read the project descriptions ASAP. This habit will help you out in the long run. Don't be like me and have a panic attack at 11:59pm trying to submit the project. 

**CMSC250** is when you first get a taste of the power of the curve. Probably one of the most stressful class for me because of my weakness in logic and math. Now don't depend on the curve, but you can expect it at the end. Aim to complete all your homework as it will be very helpful for your grade at the end. 

***The first summer I took a summer class and got a part-time job around campus:*** 

* CMSC216 (Nelson): C+

Nelson is probably one of my favorite CS professor (highly recommend for any classes). Keeps the class entertained with dark/light humor but also really tries to teach the material to everyone. In **CMSC216** you will mainly code in C and assembly. Assembly was the hardest part for me and the projects will take some time. Just like CMSC131/132, start early! 

***This was probably my worst semester mentally/physically:*** 

* CMSC330 (Anwar): C+
* CMSC351(Telli): C- 
* STAT401(C): C

 Like Nelson, Anwar is another great CS professor that I highly recommend. **CMSC330** is a very project oriented class and deals with new languages. In my case, it was ruby, rust, and ocaml. Mainly coding projects in ruby and ocaml. There was an optional rust project for extra credit which I did not do. Had I taken this class without 351, I probably would've gotten a B. 

Now for the infamous **CMSC351**, the gatekeeper for all CS majors. I would definitely recommend you NOT to take it with Kruskal. I've seen many Kruskal students with a soulless gaze coming out of that class. Telli was just manageable. His lectures will bore you with this monotone voice and the endless material. This class is also where you learn the true power of the curve. I passed this class with a 50% after getting a 30% on my final. Make sure you DO NOT miss any homework and try your best to at least get an above class average score on one exam. I had sleepless nights waiting for the curve to be announced. Anxiety level was at 100 and my body was a skeleton. I wish the best to those taking it. 

***Sigh of relief and cruise control on (sort of):*** 

Once you complete 351, you will feel like worst is over. That depends. Now it's more of a choose your own adventure. You get to decide what to take and what professors you want (sometimes). Here is a quick overview of what I did: 

Winter term: 

CMSC388A: A- 

CMSC388B: A+ 

Spring2020: 

CMSC414(Marsh): B 

CMSC420(Marsh): B- took a P instead

CMSC451(Kruskal): D took a P (passed because of COVID)

Fall2020: 

CMSC421(Regis): B+ 

CMSC425(Miller): B-

CMSC436(Porter): A

Winter term II: 

CMSC388T: A

First if you can take advantage of winter term STIC like cmsc388A/B/T. Consider these to be miniature GPA boosters and almost guaranteed A's if you put in some effort. As I mentioned about Kruskal for 351, my dumb butt wanted a challenge and decided to take 451 with Kruskal. Worst mistake ever and I was only bailed out by COVID because of P/F. You will hear some negative remarks about professor Marsh but honestly he isn't too bad. It just could be worse. **CMSC420** is a class that is pretty much required since its a prereq for few classes. Think of it as a continuation of cmsc132. My Fall 2020 semester was just classes that were personally interesting to me. Introduction to AI (**CMSC421**) isn't exactly what you think it is and can be a bit boring. Game programming (**CMSC425**) is pretty cool and you get to work with a group throughout the semester to develop a game. Mobile development (**CMSC436**) is fairly easy if you have knowledge in any mobile development. We did android development, but I had experience with React Native and Xcode prior. 

**End Result:** 

Finished with a GPA just under 3.0. Landed myself a full time software engineer position with an average but comfortable salary. I applied for about 90 companies, was interviewed by 6, and had 2 offers. 

**General Advice and Tips:** 

1. Manage your time and stress. Start projects early. Find some outlet for stress (mine was lifting 5 times a week). Sometimes you might feel stuck on a project/assignment. Relax, take a break, stretch once in a while. 
2. Start thinking of personal projects early and do tutorials related to them. I was able to list at least two personal projects to my resume. None of which I completed or even coded successfully. However I had fundamental understanding of the technology I was ""using"" and what it did in my program. *For example: I said I used Firebase as my database for a mobile app. I did some tutorials on using Firebase and was able to explain why and how I used it for my personal project. Companies will rarely ask you to see your code.* 
3. Apply for internships early and have your resume prepared and reviewed. Most companies want to see at least one professional experience relating to your degree. Applying for internships will sometimes feel more stressful than your classwork. Do your research early and take advantage of career fairs. I got no offers from career fairs but I was able to learn what they were expecting just by speaking to company reps. 
4. Use online resources but be smart about it. Chegg was my go-to(if you have the budget for it). But it was worth it for me, especially for classes like 250, 351, 451, and my math classes. **Don't just copy and paste answers**, try to understand it before even attempting to copy it. Google will be your best friend. 
5. Don't be shy and use the office hours. TAs are there to help. If possible meet a few early if you can and see who is the most helpful so that when you actually need help you will know who to go to.  That being said don't abuse them either. Don't just expect them to give you answers. A good TA will nudge you towards the right answer. 
6. Take care of your body. It's easy to sit for hours in front of your computer. Don't be like me and come out of school with chronic back/hip pain. Stretch and hydrate! 
7. Solidify your knowledge in at least one language. Mine was Java which was used for all my coding interviews. Google &lt;your programming language&gt; interview questions and keep studying them even if you aren't preparing for an interview. 

Anyways thanks for reading this jumbled mess. I hope everyone stays safe and good luck this semester. You're welcomed to PM me but remember I'm not going to be giving solutions/answers to the classes I've taken. All I can offer is my experience and tips. Also I apologize for any grammatical errors and this horrible formatting. I was literally just typing as I was thinking."

Hey everyone, I'm a 4th year finance student and due to having social anxiety and generally not being proactive, I don't have any relevant work experience and not much experience in general.

As such, I decided to delay my graduation so that I could maybe land a few internships (through a school program) before graduating. However, I don't really have anyone I could use as a reference because I felt like the manager at my old job (grocery store) just didn't like me and also I left that job a few years ago. I also don't really talk to my profs.

All I've got really going for me is that I have a decent GPA (~3.8). 

How important is it to have references? Also, if you were in my position, what would you do? Would you look for volunteer position or try to get another irrelevant job?

I've been applying for internships this past month and I'm really starting to worry about my future. 

Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

A concerned student."

I am around the corner from finish up a engineering/commerce double degree which took about 6.5 years to complete because I’ve failed like 10 courses and dropped out of a few more. Anyways as the title suggest my overall WAM is 57 because I had ADHD which I have officially been diagnosed for and I am getting treatment for it now. Obviously it doesn’t all depend on that but it did effect me a lot. Currently I am going through cognitive-behavioural therapy since none of the medications I’ve tried seem to work. My question is how do I get around the shitty WAM situation for getting a job. I don’t want to put on my resume that I am looking for pity because I have ADHD and frankly no companies with competitive positions would want to hire an engineer with issue that relate to executive functioning. It’s especially been difficult since the market for jobs has been very quiet and landing an intern is very difficult. What are your suggestions on this? Feel free to ask questions.

TLDR: have a terrible wam of 57 and lots of fails, I have been diagnosed with ADHD recently. How would I look for jobs?"

And my parents tried to sabotage every step. They would call the office and YELL if I was a little late coming back home, they would insist to follow me to workshops and literally wait outside for 8 hrs, arms crossed, fuming because I'm ""wasting their time."" They denied me internship opportunities etc. I would cry every day about it and until now, even though it's pretty cool where I am, I cannot forgive them.

They would tell me to try and do something else that makes more money.

And then I moved out ... or ran away, whatever (whee!) and continued to do my thing.

So I have no idea why they would 100% support my sister (19F) who wants to do the exact same thing. She would join my parents in denouncing me and sometimes even beat me. She used to spy on me all the time and report to them if I did anything ""wrong"" eg look at my phone and laugh.

I don't know if she will end up having a career in the same field but she has been going for the same program. Fun fact: I used to mentor this program some years ago. A relative told me that they've been encouraging her to do it LOL.

APs also let my sister have a boyfriend when they literally spent every day beating me for having one (I married him anyway).

Like, are they trying to get back at me? What are they doing?"

He dated and instantly rushed his marriage with this one woman. He makes my sister and I clean the house for his bidding and when his “girl” is coming over he decides to act. He literally works from home due to his job letting him have leeway and instead of being active and nice in the house he sleeps and shuts the door, closing me and my sister off. He left for a year leaving me with the majority of the bills and leaching off my paychecks. I’ve supported him the best I can and apparently I’m still the asshole. 

I turned 21 not too long ago and my friends and myself have gotten some liquor that I barely touched. I was instantly turned into an alcoholic in his eyes. I never touched the bottles because I’m still in college and got class everyday as well as work. My dad found a new girl and now is actively trying to clean the house and rush it for her, not for our well being as a family. He finished his internship and came back. 

He’s been back for 2 weeks and the house is miserable. My sister and I left notes because talking to him personally does nothing and he is too stubborn to listen. He just likes to have control. He then dumps my bottle of liquor out without me knowing. He touched my stuff in the spur of the moment because he was angry. I confronted him, and he tried to control the situation once more. Told him I was taking my sister away and he can explain to his “girl” why his two kids hate him. 

One thing led to another, he trapped me in my room and told me instead of calling the cops he was going to handle it himself. Grabbed my gutair as a weapon and from there I punched him. I tried to refrain the fight but putting him in a headlock but after 2 min and he broke free he proceeded to say “let’s box”. Living with my mom but I thought I’d get advice or hear others opinions. I’m so lost."

The team I work with doesn’t meet regularly (only does 1:1 calls) and is comprised of hardware-oriented peers.  The fact that my coworkers are in hardware doesn’t bother me, but it’s almost like we’re speaking different languages when talking about my project. 

And with my project, it’s in a language and technology I’ve never used before, and though I’m usually good at learning quickly, existing code is poorly commented, variables aren’t relevantly named, and because of the disconnect between my coworkers and I, I’ve spent about 3 weeks doing nothing at all. 

I had a previous internship with this company that was pretty much the opposite of what I’m experiencing right now, so this has really thrown me for a loop.  

As of right now, I’ve been trying to ask questions to my manager and coworkers, but if I get an answer, it generally confuses me more, and makes me ask more questions and I ultimately end up more confused than I was before. 

Does anyone have any advice of what I can do (ways to frame questions, meetings to schedule, etc) that might help me understand what I should be doing in my job?"

As the title pretty much says, I am a full time third year college student doing two forty hour jobs. Ever since I have started doing both jobs, I have been staying up the whole night for the whole week and Saturday, and on Sunday, I try to get some sun, but I just have been spending it on bed crying and contemplating my life decisions. 

For background, the main reason I decided to do two internships/job is I want to get a headstart on my career. The last summer, I did two 40 hour internships also, and it was torture as well, I literally cried every night about the work I am doing, I was miserable, and I was tired every single day. As an immigrant coming from a low income community, I feel that I am behind compared to my peers. In addition, having classmates that has very rich parents does not help at all. I just feel very insecured. It's really annoying to see how I am working 80 to 95 hours in the corporate world and still not able to afford like my own car, a vacation, etc. While my classmates are working 20 to 30 hours at fastfood and complains about how they work a lot while having their own cars, 2k laptops, because their parents have a fund for them.

I do feel very blessed that I am doing 2 corporate jobs (data analyst and audit) rather than fast food. But, the fact that I also spent a shit ton of hours on my freshman year training and revamping my technical skills rather than going to parties is also a trade off. At this point, I just try not to think about it.

Just venting here, thought I would just write all the things that I am feeling right now. I am very close to depression and have thought of suicide a lot of times. However, I do feel lucky that I at least have 3 close friends who believe in me more than ever. I am really passionate about change and giving back to the community, but I am tired, miserable, and mostly, burned out.

Any specific skills that you had to demonstrate before getting that internship? 

I'm in my last CS term to complete my pre-requisites for the CS Masters program. Taking Intro to OS and Programming Language Analysis this term. 

I started looking for Summer internships, but the requirements are pretty staggering. Many job descriptions require the student to be full-stack developers. Just wondering if there are internships that don't require this level of knowledge, or one that offers more entry level positions?

Please don't get me wrong, if that's what it takes for me to get an internship so be it, I'm working my a\*\* off to learn. But would just like the exposure to a full-time job as early as possible.

Thanks in advance!"

Hi guys,

First-time poster, long-time lurker here. I’m coming to a bit of a crossroads in my career and I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation or would have any advice. Apologies in advance for the long post.

I’ll start off with the fact that I’m not in the software game, I’m a digital design engineer working for a very large semi-conductor company, living in Galway. I graduated in 2018 from an electronic and computer engineering course (which about 60-70% of the modules were software-based) and started my job in September of that year. I did my internship with this team and was offered a full-time job about halfway through my final year. As ye all know this is a fairly stressful time, so I accepted the job fairly quickly as it relieved the worry of “what will I do with myself after college”.

For the most part I enjoyed the work and found it fairly rewarding but did feel like I was missing the software side of things a bit. Fast forward to late 2020 and I’m still in the same job. I applied for another internal digital design job internally as it looked like a great opportunity and a lot of skills gained through the work would be extremely valuable and sought after in digital design, if I ever decided to leave the company. I got this job and started a couple of months ago, only to be transferred to a completely different team in January. The product is completely different and nowhere near as exciting. If this was the position advertised, I’d never have applied.

I’m obviously still very new and ramping up so I’ll be giving it a while to see if my opinion changes, but it got me thinking again about the idea of a lateral career move to software, maybe mid 2022 after this COVID craic is finally settled. It seems that even people coming into grad jobs in software now are offered more money than I’m on now, even after 2 years’ raises and a promotion. I feel like if I don’t do it now while I’m still early enough in my career it will never happen. This brings me to my question(s):

\- Has anyone on this forum done something similar and do they recommend the move?

\- If I was to go for it, will I be starting from the bottom again? Is it inevitable that I’ll be taking a substantial pay cut? 

While the design flow of ASIC is quite different from the software dev cycle, there are a number of skills I believe are transferrable. Basic stuff like version control, being used to working in a linux environment, continuous integration etc., as well as using languages like Python and C every day for testbench development and algorithm analysis. I was fairly nifty at Java in college and am in the process of refreshing myself in the software development cycle by creating a website and a personal project portfolio while we’re all in lockdown. Am I being far too optimistic here that anyone would even glance at my CV?"
lh1hro,3,2021-02-10,[Tech] How do I talk about myself on phone screens when I did the bare minimum in college?,justadudewholives,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lh1hro/tech_how_do_i_talk_about_myself_on_phone_screens/,"Background: August 2020 computer science graduate. Due to unaddressed mental health issues, I was getting poor grades (finished with a 2.9), didn't network, and did 0 internships. Currently doing better, but I have only had unrelated work experience and fail phone screens miserably. The work experience on my resume looks like:

* Enlisted in military for 3 years before college
   * coordinated radio communications equipment classes increasing department radio literacy and proficiency by 30%, leading to highest performing department for a single year
* Work study receptionist on campus for the veterans office
   * led peer tutoring workshops in programming fundamentals (a bit of stretching the truth of what i actually did on the job), contributing to the university's highest veteran retention rate in a semester
* (Current)  Warehouse associate
   * training associates on various sorting tasks and facility procedures

I also have 2 personal coding projects, and 2 classroom projects on my resume.

I have a phone screen with a startup tech company for a back-end web developer role, and I am unsure of how I can even go about answering ""tell me about yourself."" My resume's objective says I want to leverage my passion for working in data (shown in a very simple web scraper I made), military communication skills, and my computer science background in becoming a back-end developer (it's worded better in the resume). 

I really have no story to tell. I lack a lot of self confidence (applied to over 400 places and have very low callback rates) when it comes to this and it shows in my previous phone screens as they all went terribly. Any insight is, greatly, greatly, GREATLY appreciated."

I'd love to just take the summer off, spend time with my family, learn R, go biking, recuperate from the stress of high school, etc.

If I take time off instead of finding a research opportunity or summer internship, will I be at a disadvantage when trying to get research assistantships etc. at Harvard? Will I be the only Harvard freshman to have taken the summer off? 

For reference, I'm looking to concentrate in Computer Science and I've already got a fair amount of coding experience from an internship, personal projects, and extracurriculars. But I dont have research experience right now, so would it be substantially easier to get involved at Harvard if I get more experience over the summer, or will I be fine either way?
Thanks in advance!"
lh2juw,4,2021-02-10,How much is my school's location worth?,Apollo989,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lh2juw/how_much_is_my_schools_location_worth/,"Hey everyone.

I'm 31 and have an unrelated bachelor's in journalism. After wandering aimlessly from job to job, I have decided to bite the bullet and go back for a degree in CS as I know I love working with programming and want to make a career out of it. I am planning on applying for master's programs just in case I can get in once I finish my math and science pre-reqs.

However, if I don't I will be working on a BS in CS. One thing I'm wondering is how important is my school's location. I am current in TN and am planning on attending UTK most likely once I finish my pre-reqs.

However, I really don't want to live here any longer. I'd love to get back to NYC, where I lived briefly, or the west coast. I know CS degrees travel pretty well and the local school would be a bit cheaper due to instate tuition. However, I was wondering if the potential for internships and such from local companies would make it worth applying to places like CUNY, Oregon State or some universities in CA.

If it matters, I currently have no student loan debt. I have estimate my state school will cost about 25-30K including living expenses whereas the year of out of state tuition will likely bump that number up to about 35 or 40k. I was just wondering if the extra expense would be worth it or if I'd be better off saving the money, working on local internships and applying elsewhere when I graduate?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

Also the word junior implies that they work below a sys admin, like an intern or recent graduate. Is being a jr sys admin not an entry level position?"

Like for one example, what are some signs that a company is fishing for anyone (not even in CS graduates) or trying to find desperate graduates? And if you see them how do you approach the them? I get worried about my safety if companies have me try to apply though shady sites/links, weird contact messages, and etc.

Or general advice for people is less than advantageous positions to apply like myself. A senior with no internships, 2 small personal projects, and was the only friend in my group to go to University (so no tech connections). I'm not trying to get any sympathy, just stating my current situation. I'm at this point attending every school event, meeting, etc to get into the field to try to break into the industry. Or even get some tips on the industry since I have no idea what I'm doing. Resume checks, tech seminars, etc. All the fun stuff.

So what are some tips/advice to abide by? Complex or simple, I'm just interested in since I'm trying to understand how to approach the job market for someone who's new to this."

I have a good (3.8) GPA, and have a few small personal projects on my Github, along with coursework in Software Development, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

I started applying for internships in mid-September, and have applied to 90 different internships (I targeted my job search to 3 main cities, so it became hard to source new internships after awhile). Last week, I was lucky enough to receive a DevOps internship position at a smaller no-name company. I'm really grateful that I even got this opportunity, but I can't help but feel a little disappointed. I thought with my high GPA I'd be able to at least snag an interview at some relatively more well-known companies (not necessarily FAANG, but something with a little national recognition), but I haven't even gotten an interview from any other company.

This late in the summer internship game, I'm happy to have a summer opportunity. But I can't shake that fleeting feeling of disappointment and keep hoping a ""better"" offer is going to come along before I accept my current offer."

lh6yed,1,2021-02-10,Internship after graduation,Classless_G3ntleman,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lh6yed/internship_after_graduation/,"So I have been searching for a job for a while and I found an internship that had a pretty good set up, I would get payed for my work and it included two areas that I was passionate about copy editing and web design. Going into the internship its at this person's house with an already dedicated team and set designs, their main copy editor is part time now because of family issues.

So when I start my first assignment they give me an idea and then basically say good luck, I am given no information no training or anything about what who when or how I do anything with this group. Whenever I turn in something my ideas are immediately shot down, when I do it the way they want me to they tell me I'm being too litteral. The second assignment I am given 2 hours to do and I have to do a lot of research and write a few paragraphs on something I have no information on, I tried reaching out to them about what I am supposed to or asking for help. And they tell me that I should just research this or know what I'm doing already. 

I am disheartened and have lost all confidence in myself and my abilities here, am I just being an ass and not working with them and just misunderstanding or am I being weeded out. I was attached to an email chain which included them talking about how I am not a Christian so they don't know if I'll even fit with the assignments. 

Should I quit? Am I allowed to just quit an internship after a week? Should i just suck it up and be a man about it? 

TLDR: got an internship that sounded like a good first step out of college, turned out to be entirely unstructured and I am left to figure out my position on my own. When asking for help I am given none and told to figure it out, my week has been filled with two assignments that i have been given very limited detail and litterally no instruction. Should I quit? Can I quit? Should I just shut up and suck it up?

Thanks for any advice"

This is my third internship and I will have 3 more after it. Trying to decide what is the best way forward and I am sure others have been in the same dilemma.

1. A small company doing work that is not very exciting, but the work would be as a ""full developer"" with the tech I want to pursue but in a different industry, and I might have the opportunity for project ownership
2. An ideal company in the field I want to work in, much more exciting and fast, but the position is as a test-developer/QA
3. A good company, in a development role, but not in the industry I want to end up in or with the tech that I want to work with. This would help diversify my skillset  


Basically it comes down to what is the most important in a mid-level internship if I am trying to level up the kinds of companies I can work for? 

* Experience in the industry as a QA/Test
* Experience as developer with projects under my belt
* A diverse background with skills in different technologies

I really like the Front end position and they like me as well, they asked me for quick assignment of a fast React app that utilizes an API, which is a piece of cake and I have a week to do it. I want to be a Frontend/Fullstack once I graduate and I think this is a good opportunity for me.

With Blackberry on the other hand, it is a 4 month internship and I will be working with C, making Unit tests and the Operating systems/Kernel. I like Blackberry because it is a well known company and it will look good on my resume, however I do not like working with C. I have sufficient knowledge in it and I am sure I will excel and go through the 4 month, however I do not see myself becoming a C developer in the future.  With Blackberry perhaps I can get transfered to another department once I graduate. Plus I can always do React/Front end on the side.

Which one should I choose? Essentially doing something I love or doing something to get wellknown name on my resume? I'm given 12 hours to decide for Blackberry so this is pretty urgent."
lh890g,6,2021-02-10,Staying at a startup vs going for Google,pioredditor01,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/lh890g/staying_at_a_startup_vs_going_for_google/,"Hey,

I got dilemma about my career choices and wanted to ask what other people may think about it. For some context: I'm based in Europe, graduating from my uni this year, done internships at Big N companies before (including Google) and still not sure about the direction of my career I should choose.

I've been working for several months full-time for a startup company (around 200 ppl) as a Software Engineer. The company is great, seem to be growing really fast, a lot of new people joining with new ideas etc. The work is fairly interesting - the company has it own product sold mainly to big companies, the things I've been doing so far are definitely not any rocket science, mostly Java backend, but in the near future it should be more interesting with new projects starting, requiring some more architecture design etc. TC is good, perks not so much but it doesn't really matter as it's all remote anyway so far. As it's remote it's really flexible as well, not really any pressure on the devs, people seem to be happy about working here.

From the other hand, I got an offer from Google. I know that it may sound like a Holy Grail for many people here and it's definitely cool, but the reason I'm not so hyped for that is that the headcount for most offices for new grads is almost zero and the only office I could start right now is the Warsaw one. Now, I've been interning there before and I know what are main projects there, technologies used etc. - it's mostly internal infrastructure, Google Cloud, kubernetes, internal cluster manager, auto scaling etc. These are all interesting stuff to work on and really challenging from an engineer perspective, but I'm not really hyped for those - I'd much more prefer working on backend services for some user facing products, maybe be able to see the result of my work somewhere out there and not really buried somewhere really deep into internal infrastructure and stuff like that.

My main pros for going for Google: having that good enough for FAANG stamp on my CV (I already have that from the internships, but it's not the same that full time), work may turn out to be interesting (but can't really know that), good in terms of career development (a lot to learn about niche stuff like infra etc which are not that common like regular java backend), possibility to transfer to other office &amp; get some other project in the future

My main pros for staying where I am: really like the company &amp; the work, they have a lot of plans for the future and the company will keep growing for sure, possibly interesting work in the future where I can design stuff from scratch, career development options could be there as well (e.g. becoming a TL in some time), good work life balance, possibility for getting stock options if I stay for a year and the company IPO in the future and actually slightly better TC right now - comparable to offer at Google, but it's all in cash monthly vs getting a bonus, stocks etc at Google.

Now I need to make a decision whether I'd take Google offer or stay at my current work. What would you do if you were me? I'm really stuck on that."

So far I've taken countless programming courses (C++, Java, C#, web dev, databases) Overall, I'm doing pretty well in school. I have almost straight A's in all my courses. So this is probably the least of my worries honestly. Outside of school, I've built one full stack project using nodejs, express, some ajax/jquery, CSS, MySQL and Amazon S3. I have a portfolio site on my own domain and I also have a GitHub (with only that one project on it)

As of this week, I've begun working on self-learning DS&amp;A with the intentions of starting Leetcode problems within a couple weeks/months or hopefully sooner (It's hard for me to grasp concepts so this learning curve will probably be steep for me lol)

I've applied to maybe ~40 internships but nothing has bite. I guess that was to be expected since a) I'm only a sophomore and b) putting that I'm in CC has probably not helped either. I did have one interview last month for an unpaid internship but I completely bombed it lmfao. However, it was a learning experience more than anything else.

My goal is to get an internship for Summer 2022. This is why I've honed my focus in on DS&amp;A so I can begin preparing for tech interviews as early as possible. I will also be transferring to a 4-year since in the Fall [2021]

Is there anything I'm missing that I should be doing at this stage in my academic career (as a sophomore)??

I'm in community college and I'll be transferring to a practically no-name commuter school in my city so I realize I have to work a bit harder than those at other schools to get an internship and such.

Thanks for any advice!"

In the ACM discord server, throughout since last year, there have been people with good options in hand just constantly interview grinding on the regular, is all that really needed? Even though it has been great to be part of that community on the server, it really makes me nervous and feel unprepared at times about my future.

**Background:** I am not from a finance major, but I am studying business. I've took corporate finance I and II as well as financial and management accounting as my courses. Besides that, I have learned financial modelling at a foundational level, as well as have a strong interest in pursuing a career in finance. I told all of this to the hiring manager during my interview and said I would even consider studying further to excel in a career in finance. I made sure she knows I am not a finance major but I've been trying hard to get a finance related position. Also talked about my past internships, I've worked as a business analyst and a consultant. I was given a very small case during my phone call with the manager and she basically asked me a few questions, and I've had experiences with case analysis so I answered to the best of my abilities. The hiring manager also asked about where this company ranks for me as a preference and I said first because I want to work there and the position is great of course. Two days later, I got the internship/co-op call. So this will be my third and final co-op before I graduate.

That being said, I will be graduating right after my co-op ends in August and was hoping if any of you guys could tell me how to show that I want to join full-time after i graduate. The hiring manager gave me a shot despite the fact that I'm not from finance major. Therefore, if anyone knows how I should ask, please do let me know.

Regardless of if you were accepted or not, I’d love to know (but please specify if you were!)

1 - Does there need to be a specific theme to the types of things you’re involved in on campus? Let’s say you’re interested in some area as a career, but your activities aren’t all directed towards it. Is that ok?

2 - How long of an internship should you have? (Let’s say specifically for summer) Is a shorter internship bad?

3 - Are the grades you earned in Haas pre-requisites more valuable than the grades in other classes? I guess I’m trying to know more info about how GPA affects admissions.

4 - If accepted, what do you think made you stand out? You don’t need to specify too much because of anonymity, but maybe just a vague explanation?

5 - What do you personally think Haas loves seeing the most? I know the whole embodiment of the pillars stuff, but maybe more specifically?

6 - Can you use an activity you listed on your application in one of the essays, or is it better to do something completely new that wasn’t mentioned on the application?

7 - Since Covid has created much different circumstances for applicants, do you think it’d be okay to use maybe something very notable from high school? (This is a much less important question, it was just something on my mind)


Honestly, any other tips you may have, or if you have something more you’d be able to share with me (in case you don’t want to write it here, please feel free to message me).

1) Ever since I became a high schooler, she never let me hang out with my friends. She said it's a waste of time when I could be studying. My friends would ask me to hang out but I always said ""Sorry I can't, my mom said no."" Eventually they stopped asking me to hang out and I was so sad and cried to my mom. I know why they stopped asking me, but it still made me happy that they even considered to invite me. My mom asked me, ""Well why didn't you hang out with them then?"" I was lost for words and reminded her that she said no all the time and she just brushed it off saying, ""Oh did I? Friends are useless though. You only need family.""

2) I'm the younger child who graduated college and had good grades throughout my school years and landed internships, but my mom still favored and favors my brother over me. My brother dropped out of community college, always cut class, and yet my mom still gave him allowance, &amp; not to me. I would have saved up those money instead of spending them. 

3) I can't play any games while my brother can. I can't hang out with my friends, but my brother can. He can have online friends, but I can't. I only have to work and read news. I can't read any fiction &amp; can't watch anything except the news &amp; documentaries. My brother wanted to play a game with me one time, so I secretly played with him but he snitched to my mom so they both yelled at me for playing games. They started to go to the backyard so that they can look through my window to see if I'm playing games or not. 

4) I like a non korean guy but my mom said I have to marry a rich, korean (we're korean) guy who has a perfect family. Very hypocritical of her considering how she married my dad who didn't graduate college. She then proceeded to tell me that if the non-korean guy's family is against marriage, they can come find me and kill me with a gun like what the heck??? 

5) I'm the only one who earns money and my mom said my money isn't my money. She said it's family's money. I have to pay the rent and bills, and she and my brother cannot treat me well and won't let me do what I want to 

6) I currently have a job, but my mom wants to move somewhere else and wants me to move there too and change jobs. 

7) She won't let me move out either. She tells me that I will get murdered or sexually assaulted if a guy finds out I live alone and she said I would have to pay double the rent, &amp; double the bills (her place (our current place) &amp; my new place if i ever move out) 

Having a stereotypical parent is so stressful and rough. I don't know what to do. I feel so suffocated. It's my life. I'm over 21, but she's still trying to make choices for me even though I could make good choices for myself. She said I would be unhappy forever if I control my own life."

Are there research internships available for foreign students this year?. If so what are the projects that help me to get into research ?"

I have finished a lot of tasks while other interns are still stuck in the first tasks they had to do 3 weeks ago. Today, I had a meeting with my supervisor where he asked me if I felt like I had a lot of free time, if I wanted to go faster, and I said I would go faster if you tell me, and he said no its okay. He also joked about me leaving the company for another which better. How should I interpret that? I like working here, but maybe being too productive is bad?

I lived in my car twice through school for about 13 months total because of financial hardship. I love engineering especially machine learning and software. I’ve built some things in my free time like a React Native App and a Smile detector that pours beer, but honesty I’m not an amazing student, I really only managed a 3.2. I’ve applied to nearly 100 jobs maybe more maybe less since August with absolutely no luck. I had an offer with Panasonic as a Machine Operator for $18/hr and turned it down because it was going to conflict with school and although I love electrochemical storage it seemed like too low an offer to accept. Two months later and I can’t find anything and Im starting to worry I made a huge mistake. I really need help getting in the right direction. I’m honestly thinking I might install solar or work ropes window washing or something if I can’t find a engineering or tech position."

In October 2019 I started a  CISCO CCNA course for networking, it should have lasted until June/July  but the Covid epidemic begun, a lockdown was initiated and we coudn't  meet anymore face2face and we didn't meet on an online platform either  so i didn't do my final exam so i could get certified. This is my plan  for this summer, get my certification since i still have the courses. I  am a student studying electronics&amp;telecommunication which kind of  fits with the whole networking thing well at least the telecommunication  part, and my question and the motive for this post is :

1. What other skills/technologies  should i learn that would benefit me for an internship position  ?
2. What are the skills that the people in the domain are looking for ?

The  reason why I'm looking for an internship is to use the skills that I've  gathered in the course and the things that i learn in school and on my  own. Now, I am not sure that this is the path that I would like to go  down on for the rest of my life, but I would like to experience it since i really liked the courses and i would like to experience this  part of the IT domain. I have heard that, can't say that this is true or not maybe someone here will  confirm it, that positions/oportunities in this area of work are kind of rare?  because there aren't many jobs as a whole.

Thank you!

p.s if this question was already asked somewhere else please just post the link and i will delete this post thanks :)"
lhi04o,27,2021-02-11,I need help,harmonic-dissonance,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lhi04o/i_need_help/,"Hi. I need help. So I'm throwing this out into the void. 

I feel like such a failure. I flunked out of college and moved back in with my parents. They felt like I needed a hobby so they enrolled me in a culinary program. I didn't have any cooking experience but I was told it would be beginner friendly. I was excited. 

It was not beginner friendly. I was the youngest person there by a decade and the only person who had no experience. I constantly held the group behind. It got bad enough that I would have full on anxiety attacks most days before going to class. Eventually I had a breakdown and begged my parents to let me drop out. They were extremely frustrated with me but they agreed. Out of guilt, I took it back and told them I'd try to stick to the program. And I did. Slowly, it became a little easier. 

As the program neared its end, they began to put more pressure on us to speed up. I was overwhelmed. I didn't even have the techniques down on lock yet, so trying to go quickly made me sloppy. I started to get more and more stressed, and I once again dreaded going to class. 

Yesterday was the last day. I told myself I just had to make it through. My chef was lurking near me as I worked, watching, but not saying anything. It made me self-conscious. Then, he started to critique me, telling me that I was doing everything wrong. He went on a rant, telling me that I was no better a cook than I was at the start of the program, and asked me if I've even learned anything. He told me I was slow, had no technique, and that if I wanted to do internships or work in the culinary field I'd better shape up fast. He asked me how I was going to even pass the final exams. As he yelled at me, I began to cry. I excused myself to go wash some vegetables so no one would see. I tried to calm myself down but could feel myself slipping away and going numb. I was despondent the whole rest of the day. I broke down once I got home and became really suicidal. Eventually I calmed down and decided to text my supervisor in the morning and explain to her that I would like to defer my final assessments, because I did not feel prepared. 

Morning came, I sent a brief message to her, and had my breakfast, feeling better. When I checked my phone again, I saw that she had replied without much sympathy. She told me that I should just come in and if I failed, then I failed. I didn't know how to explain that I physically could Not deal with this exam. The stress of being in that environment, cooking under a time limit, being judged by someone who had yelled at me less than 24 hours ago. Not to mention that the recipes we're expected to do are ones we haven't practiced in 6 weeks. Nor do we have them in our recipe books, so I can't even review. 

I didn't text her back. I felt really torn. I went to my mother, and she was unsupportive. She told me that she didn't understand why I was making this a big deal, and she asked me how I expected to live my life if I continued to run away from every little thing that stresses me. I left. 

I'm in bed with the curtains closed. My exam starts in four minutes. My classmate just texted me asking where I was. I'm ignoring her. I'm so tired. I feel like a failure. I feel incapable. I don't want to live in this world because I clearly can't handle it. 

I'm so glad that other people can. But I cannot. And I'm sick of trying. 

I'm angry with my mother. With my supervisor. With myself. I'm feeling so many things and I don't have any logical place to direct any of those feelings. They're all over the place. 

My therapist isn't responding. I don't have any friends in my city. Anyone who I could text for support lives on the other side of the world and is probably asleep right now. I am alone."
lhkw41,66,2021-02-11,I am an IT fresher. I am having difficulty in choosing between a job in hometown with less package and one in other state with more package. Which one should I opt for? More factors to consider...,sweetpoision,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/lhkw41/i_am_an_it_fresher_i_am_having_difficulty_in/,"my_qualifications: B.E Information technology 

Hi, I am in final year of my B.E degree in Information technology from Mumbai University aff tier-3 college. I live in Mumbai. My graduation is due May 2021.

In the previous semester I got placed through on-campus placement in Capgemini for Analyst position where salary package is 3.8LPA CTC. 
Capgemini has 2 years service bond. 

Recently I appeared for another job through off-campus and got an offer from a company which is based in Bangalore for SQL developer job role  where salary is 5.5LPA CTC. 
This company has no service bond.
They say I can start internship training next Monday (14th Feb) with stipend of 25k/month.

Now there are more than one problems because of which I can't make the decision of whether I should take the Bangalore offer:

1. I preferably don't want to leave Mumbai. Even though I had to, I would prefer  Pune than Bangalore. If I had to go to Bangalore, then it should be for a better salary like 7LPA or more. 

2. The SQL developer position really doesn't excite me. I have knowledge in SQL but not interested to do a career in it. 

3. The company does not provide accommodation so I'll have to pay out of my pocket while staying in Bangalore.

Now you may be thinking, well the answer is clear, don't go to Bangalore. But wait there are reasons why CG doesn't look like a solid option.

1. I don't know what job role I will get at CG
2. I don't know which location CG will post me to (although most get posted in their home town)
3. CG is known to have a delayed hiring process. Some people from 2019 and 2020 are still waiting for their joining letter.

While I am still applying for jobs in Mumbai/Pune, I fear that I might not get selected in those and the Bangalore offer might be the highest package I could get hold of as a fresher.

Other thing is I want to do a job and side-by-side, with the money that I earn, I 
want to do cybersec related certifications also.

I need suggestions. Kindly help

Edit: It is  WFH internship. Another question: do you think I could leave in between the internship if I get a better offer somewhere else in the upcoming 4 months? I don't know if I can do that.
 If I ask them they will see the uncertainty in me and might reject me even before starting.

EDIT: Thank you guys so much for your valuable suggestions. That really helped. I have decided to take up the internship for now as it does not have any bond and if I want to leave then there is a notice period of 15days(I didn't know this earlier and this is was the most important factor). Parallelly I will keep applying for other jobs while improving my aptitude and data structures skills. 
If I don't get a better job offer before May then I will definitely go to Bangalore and do this job for one year."

lhmvyn,2,2021-02-11,How to consider a career change from engineering to education?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/lhmvyn/how_to_consider_a_career_change_from_engineering/,"I graduated with a biomedical engineering degree in 2019, had three co-ops and internships in the neuroimaging industry, and currently still work in it. A lot of different aspects have come into play for the career path I set myself on that are making me reconsider a career change from engineering to teaching (I originally considered it when I was graduating high school in 2014, but my parents strongly disapproved of it).

When you work in the computational side of the imaging sciences industry, where you have to create a visual representation of biological phenomena, you are expected to be self-motivated to create that picture that can convey a deeper meaning for doctors and researchers. In order to do this, you have to take part of two industries: biomedical engineering and software development. I love the theory behind it all, but I'm getting burnt out by the environment and the job search/grad school search I have been on. It's partly due to the specific company I work for, where there has been a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a caste-like system of roles in the lab depending on how many degrees you have. There's so many politics and cockiness about whether you have a PhD or not. My job is in this weird, obscure intermediate level where I get to interact a lot more with private investigators and be in touch with pretty high up professionals and scientists, but **I also teach technicians and engineers that are the 'lower' (hate saying that) level how to use a software development kit from a start-up company that we started a contract/collaboration with right before I started in August of 2019. This is the part that I enjoy the most out of my job, and I've gotten so many remarks about how I'm good at helping others learn and to feel motivated.**

**This is what I would want to get out of something I do 40 hours a week. That was about 20% of my job before, and now, because of a shift in responsibilities, pretty much 100% is writing software to translate some imaging analyses into the aforementioned start-up company's cloud service that I had to take on and learn and teach others about. Both the primary lab I work for and the start-up are overly ambitious and get so caught up in it, that there is a lack of documentation on how their commands and software work and I find myself just cranking out test commands and scripts and going back and forth on StackOverflow and suggesting what to write up in their documentation for a niche programming solution that best fits the needs at a very present time. It feels like I am working for two companies that just get a kick out of me doing their grunt work, and it's been very draining. Sometimes I'm not treated well about it either because it ends up being that I don't fully understand their original intentions behind the specific command.**

I still really like engineering and learning about how the research comes together, but so far in my path, I have to force myself to be a professional whose purpose is to only fulfill the grants of a select few rather than the growth of potentially a higher amount of others. I'm also realizing I'm at my happiest when I'm not on the computer as much anymore except for when I'm interacting with others. I'm isolated in my niche position and even more so as the result of my shift and the general direction in which I am headed (and COVID as well making everything remote). Looking around at jobs hasn't been any more hopeful for me, and I'm not as invigorated by the prospects as I used to be. Especially if the research is what kept me going, but I know I'm not the one to go for a PhD already (so don't recommend that for me). I know I can still read papers about it in free time.

Would going back to getting a teaching certification in HS Science (probably chemistry) be a good step? Is that a crazy, unrealistic move? Because of the initial reaction I had with my parents scoffing at me (and wasting my 'potential') I worry what others may think, as shallow as that sounds. I'm thinking of doing a MS that couples the student teaching and getting a degree and cert at the same time. I'm from PA in case anyone needs to know either.

Thanks in advance for reading my novel :)

**TL:DR; I'm not getting what I originally envisioned in software development/neuroimaging because of my tasks and the environments I have been in. But I have enjoyed being somewhat of an 'instructor' role in my positions, and have in the past considered being a HS teacher. Is this a crazy move? And what would you recommend?**"

I know at the end of the day I need to make my own decisions. I don’t really want to bring this to my family first because I have a feeling I’ll know what they’ll say regardless of whether or not they would support me (I’m sure they would, at least in the sense that if I failed, I’d have a place to go).

TL;DR - 24 years old, Business Systems Analyst, minimal bills thanks to living at home and the hold on student loan payments. Torn between pursuing passion in film or trying to pursue field I’m at best lukewarm on to have job/financial security.

Background: I’m 24 and currently work as a Business Systems Analyst (just crossed 6 months). I have a BS in computer science and minored in math. My job pays decently (perhaps slightly less than average but with 0 prior relevant work experience, I have no complaints). I still live at home with very few bills (inherited car so I only pay for gas, lucky enough to still have insurance covered; still on family health insurance; about $40k of student loan debt but the bulk of that is on hold currently due to COVID; I try to buy groceries for the house on an alternating schedule, which is usually about $250-$300 a month; still on family phone plan but I pay the insurance plan for my phone which is very low; I pay for a few luxuries like streaming services and generally can afford to pick up relatively small things at my own discretion like movies or games). This has allowed me to save up a little over $30k so far (combo of pay from my job and unemployment/COVID relief from my state when the first job I was going to take was indefinitely on hold once everything started shutting down in Feb 2020), which I am immensely grateful for and lucky to have. It took me a little over a year to get this job after graduating – I couldn’t get a programming job, which was what I studied in school, and I wasn’t sure I wanted one anyway. Now that I have a taste of a non-programming job, I would be curious to go back into programming, but I know I’d have to work basically as hard as I would if I try to pursue the film industry just to get a software developer job considering my current circumstances (2 years after graduating, no experience as a software dev, and probably getting rusty, although I was never a great programmer to begin with).

I knew around my junior year of college that I should’ve majored in film. It was between film and CS when I first started applying to schools, and I eventually went for what I thought would be safer and was something I genuinely did have similar interest in at the time. However, after a couple years, my interest in film grew exponentially, but I stayed with CS because I thought it would be more dependable. Didn’t have any internships and it took me basically a year to find a job even tangentially related to what I’d been studying for 4 years.
I got in contact with a family friend who’s been very successful in the film industry, and said he could ask around and see if there’s anyone who’d be willing to give me a shot as a PA (either on set or as an office PA on the business/producing side) in NYC. I know I would have to work my ass off to do that for a living (assuming I’m even good enough to keep getting work). I know I would be taking a substantial pay cut. I know I would be trading job stability (both in terms of the industry and the specific job I hold now. I don’t want to be in this specific position forever, but there are people on my team who have been with the company for decades). If I wanted the family friend to ask around for me and something did come up, I’d have to quit my job to put my all into it or even work any days other than weekends, which I probably have no control over anyway (at what point during this process I’d actually have to put in my 2 weeks, I’m not sure). I feel like I’d have to live in the city too, because the trains don’t run 24/7 to where I could commute from while living at home, and I don’t want to cut myself off from any opportunities that might run overnight. I do have options for roommates in terms of my friend group, and I’m sure I could find someone who needs a roommate in one of the most expensive cities in the country. Yes, I’m getting very far ahead of myself.

My big concerns on the stability side are my future job prospects and financial freedom. It took me what seems like a long time to get a job that was even tangentially related to my degree. I’m concerned that if I fail, I won’t be able to get back in. I also know that I’ll lose out on a lot of the comfort I have now with a lower salary and more variable pay since I would be freelancing. I would also lose out on a pretty good work/life balance and benefits like insurance (which I will need in under 2 years, as I’m unable to stay on my family plan past that) and retirement contributions. Practically speaking, if I manage to get into software development or even continue up the chain of the work I’m in now, I think I could only get more financial freedom. Depending on where I end up living, I don’t need six-figures a year. I just want to sustain my life (not to discount the cost of necessities like food and insurance, but I think my hobbies are pretty cheap) and be happy.

My big concern on the passion side is making the same mistake twice. I missed out on going to school for something I love, and now I might have a real opportunity to pursue being in the film industry. No, it’s not a 100% done deal and I’m aware of that, but I need to either commit to it or not if this is the capacity I want to be involved in. There are things I could do on the side while keeping my job for now, like putting my all into video editing (another interest, although one I haven’t really pursued) and hopefully taking on editing assignments and maybe one day being in film. I’m also scared that I simply like movies more than making them, which would basically be a crisis for me because this feels like my dream. I haven’t really made a “movie” since high school, although I’m currently developing a short with a friend of mine who did go to film school. I’m hoping that provides some insight, but it’s slow-going at the moment.
I feel like I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t.

I know that fear is something I’ll have to simply accept: the fear of doing or the fear of not knowing. Either way, I’ll have to make some kind of trade off, both of which are important to me. I want to be practical, but I also know that the longer I wait, the more I close off my ability to make a risky career decision like this. It wouldn’t be impossible, but I’d presumably have more responsibilities and a greater need for financial security the older I get. It also seems like a good time now while I’m still eligible for my parents’ health plans. I don’t exactly have many medical issues (knock on wood), but better to take risks now than later, right?

Additionally, for anyone in the industry who might be able to weigh in on this specific point: I would really like to move out to LA. Do you recommend LA over NYC? In terms of ease of access, NYC is definitely the preferable choice, and I do have some affinity for the city, but I also really want a new environment to be in. I didn’t exactly grow up in NYC, but LA has the prospect of warmer weather and just being somewhere new. If that’s a viable avenue for me, should I see if my family friend could possibly look into LA for me? It would certainly take up a bigger chunk of my savings because I would have to move cross-country and get a new car. I currently drive a 15-year-old car that simply won’t be able to make that journey with me. I might just have to stay in NYC, but is it possible once I have experience to transition to LA? Is that a dumb question?

Thanks for reading all this if you did. I’ve written papers shorter than this. I really appreciate any input."

If possible, I would like to ask for support with this two questions:

1) From your experience do you believe that is important to list every past experience in your resume, even if its not related to your current job?

2) Am I overreacting about my work history of 4 different companies in 4 years?"

Any tips on how to feel better?"

SO, I am currently 21, graduating early in March with my BA in Media and Cultural Studies. I am a straight A student, and I've only had one job in my life, but I worked there for about 2 years and gained a lot of experience (administrative assistant, project planner assistant &amp; social media intern). I never had a clear vision of what I wanted to do, but would just answer the question as ""working for a brand on their creative team, creating content or doing marketing). In general, I would say I am very ambitious, hard working, creative, and never thought twice about me doing something ""big"" with my life (I am also from a SUPER small town, and I guess I always felt pressure to prove that I made it).

I recently got an Internship at my dream job, a beauty start up company with a large following. I started last Friday (wfh). Usually starting anything new I am filled with anxiety, but going into this I was ready and excited! When I started however that all changed immediately. Everyone was nice, but ALL IN. They were doing 5-8 projects at a time, working at the speed of light. Barley trained me before throwing me into the deep end. I was brought on to the ""social team"" (ended up just being me and one other person). I had so much responsibility and clearly learned right off the bat that none of their employees (hourly or salary) had any time for a social life. Just to try and catch up somewhat with how much they needed me to do on that first day I worked 6 hours unpaid after clocking out. I was sobbing the entire day between meetings, not eating. But told myself wait until Monday, this is all just new and you will get used to it. Over the weekend, it was still none stop. None of us were working, but were expected to reply to the mass amount of texts and ideas being shared in the group chat. I also spent most of my weekend just trying to organize all the info and projects and tasks that were to be expected of me. I also didn't even like what I would be doing, and applied to this job through their Instagram. Thus, I didn't know my job description or how much I would be making (minimum wage) until after the 4 rounds of interviews it took to get hired. I know looking back, I wanted to work here so bad... it wouldn't have mattered what they wanted me to do I was desperate to work THERE. But, once that curtain was pulled back, I just knew I wasn't a good fit for them and they weren't a good fit for me. I knew that the problems I had with the job weren't things that would fix over time (i.e. getting some questions answered, becoming acclimated with the websites/tech I needed). But, rather, it was the fundamental things I learned wouldn't be good for me. I gave it Monday in hopes that I just had a bad first day, and it only got worse. I stayed up until midnight again, trying to finish my work. I also missed a quiz on this same day, In one of my last classes I need to graduate... Tuesday again, I went in with hope that things would change. But when I met with my supervisor and she asked how I am liking everything, I just broke down. I was honest and told her my concerns and she was nice but pretty much told me that my problems were innate to the company (being stressed all day, having a million projects, working after my shift) and that if I didn't think it was right for me to tell her sooner rather than later. So I did, and that was my last day.

I feel like such a quitter. I KNOW deep down, nothing would have made that better for me. But, because I didn't make it more than 2 days, I feel like I am internalizing the bad fit as me being defiant. I KNOW I can work hard, I KNOW I can multitask and do the most for my job... I have before. But this was next level and was costing me my sanity in just those two days. Now I feel lost, I need to reevaluate what I want out of a job, because it certainly wasn't that. I want a job where I feel confident and comfortable to be able to go above and beyond. I want a job where I can have a life outside of work. I want something that is structured and give clear directive/training. I don't want a job that is directly creative, because I am more of a creative thinker, and feel that I can apply that to any job setting rather than being cut throat in an industry that has so many talented creative artists. 

Right now I don't know what my next move is. Am I even capable of working a normal job (target, Taco Bell, Walmart)? I don't want to loose that drive and motivation, but at the same time I want peace. I want a job that allows me to live the life I want to live, not one where my work is my life. I am scared that because of how hard that experience was, I will never make use of my degree and just be a loser for the rest of my life. Does anyone have any advice for me?

Good Morning everyone,

I am seeking advice on how to tell if a job is a healthy, well organized environment because apparently, I am a bad judge of that. I just left my stable job as a tier II technical support specialist because I got thrown under the bus again for a conflict resolution issue that I had no control over. 

I got thrown under the bus a lot for a bunch of random stuff and no matter how times I sought advice from my supervisor the issues would always seem to get blamed on me. Also, the entire setup seemed disorganized and no one knew what anyone else was doing, which ended up being a problem when we all switched to working from home.  I decided that nobody was looking out for me, so I resigned. 

I would like to note that the job before this one was at a tech startup and though they had a beer fridge and ping pong table, I was a diversity hire and they gave me no work. Then they yelled at me for not working. Also, people who were only friends with the founders got work and others were ostracized. I didn’t really pick up on that until too late.  I still worked there for a year.

Before that I had an internship where the entire staff changed between the time of hiring me and driving there a week later. New lead decided I wasn’t necessary, so they gave me busywork to do while I worked remote. I had to make up most of my senior presentation for college because no matter how many times I asked at scrum every morning I was given not much to do or learn. I wish I had better judgement so I could see such a huge change ahead of time. 

Anyway, I have a degree in information communication technology and perhaps 6 years of IT helpdesk and database analyst support. I’m thinking of getting my Network+ while applying for all these jobs. Besides advice on how to spot problematic and potential dead-end employers, how should I know when to get out of dodge? I kind of feel like I wasted 3 years on pointless jobbery, for lack of a better word.

TLDR: How to spot problematic and potential dead-end employers, and how to improve/where to do from here? The benefits could be awesome, but the work environments end up royally donked."

I have my eyes set on a top 20 school in my field, international relations. I feel like I’ve done a ton, but never enough. Here’s a brief list, any ideas what I can add:

International studies major 

Econ major and Math minor (quantitative skills)

3.8 GPA; 3.9 Major GPA

Undergraduate thesis published in small journal

Multiple relevant internships, mostly smaller NGO type organizations

Three amazing academic references

Published pieces in area of interest for a small NGO

Research Assistant position for one of my professors

NVivo experience

President of a major economic student org 

Treasurer of another more activist student org

Volunteer-work teaching ESL (rather brief)

Learning Farsi; not great yet, but hopefully will be decent by application time

Though, not application material, I’ve also read quite a lot about my field and filled multiple bookshelves now, so I’ve tried to cultivate knowledge and not just resume build.

I’m considering an internship abroad this summer/fall and then graduating next spring. 

What can I do to stand out more? Am I driving myself crazy? To me this kind of seems like a lot but it always seems like someone else has done more"

my name is Rene, 34, from Germany.
Im a senior software developer since 15 years now, my main part is C# and React in my day to day job. 3 years ago I started to teach pupils in an IT school in Germany before Covid hits.

Today I got greenlight from a sponsor which will take all costs on my own coding camp in Germany in the end of summer. 

The plan is to offer 15 pupils a 2 week (10 days, 8 hours each day) coding camp for free to get into software development, learn a bunch of stuff and creating their own website. I dont earn money with it, I do it for free, all costs will be covered like rooms and drinks / lunch for everyone. I plan to offer each pupil being their mentor afterwards if they want to stick with coding, want to get internships or just have questions. I will get help of 2 other software developers I knew from work, they will do it for free too.

Here is a image of the rooms we got, its called ""the computer lab"", 5 big touch screens with 15 tablets (so group of 3 for the touch screens and everyone gets a tablet): https://imgur.com/a/6UYihXP

So my main question here is that you please give me input on my detailed but not finished timetable I plan to teach. Of course it is not that detailed that all questions will be solved, so if you have one, DM me or just shoot a comment.

Link to timetable:

I would be pleased to get help to offer them the best mentor and teacher after covid they get.

The plan is to offer 15 pupils a 2 week (10 days, 8 hours each day) coding camp for free to get into software development, learn a bunch of stuff and creating their own website. I dont earn money with it, I do it for free, all costs will be covered like rooms and drinks / lunch for everyone. I plan to offer each pupil being their mentor afterwards if they want to stick with coding, want to get internships or just have questions. I will get help of 2 other software developers I knew from work, they will do it for free too.

Here is a image of the rooms we got, its called ""the computer lab"", 5 big touch screens with 15 tablets (so group of 3 for the touch screens and everyone gets a tablet): https://imgur.com/a/6UYihXP

So my main question here is that you please give me input on my detailed but not finished timetable I plan to teach. Of course it is not that detailed that all questions will be solved, so if you have one, DM me or just shoot a comment.

Link to timetable: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uq_XcDCGnJuFPtY7JY1Ao5A7-7ICY2LHtWPzurFsC3E/edit?usp=sharing

I would be pleased to get help to offer them the best mentor and teacher after covid they get.

I've been blessed to be able to choose between these two opportunities, but I'm having a difficult time with my decision.


Right now my considerations are:

Microsoft seems to have a better WLB

Amazon offers a higher salary

Amazon has the potential to be hybrid rather than virtual

Microsoft Garage is a unique program where I can create something from scratch and have it go into production by the end of my internship

Amazon seems to be more stressful?

Randomized team placement on Amazon versus I can rank my preference in projects for Microsoft Garage




Do either of them look particularly better to future employers on my resume? What other options should I keep in mind? Does Microsoft entertain offer negotiations if I presented them with Amazon's numbers? Could the value of having Amazon on my resume decline because of how many they're hiring?

Not too concerned about return offers because I'm a sophomore with another year to go and I'd preferably try out a different company in the next year.

li57du,3,2021-02-12,what to study for filmmaking?,apoorvjais,unsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsw/comments/li57du/what_to_study_for_filmmaking/,"Hello,

I want to know about your experience studying either of these degrees, or anything similar(AFTT, AFTRS, etc.) or others that you know who have done similar study, so that I can decide which one to stick with.  
Any other feedback is also welcome.

I am currently trying to decide whether to continue studying my Bachelor of Communication (Media Arts and Production) at UTS [https://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/bachelor-communication-media-arts-and-production#course-overview](https://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/bachelor-communication-media-arts-and-production#course-overview), or study Bachelor of Media in Screen &amp; Sound Production at UNSW [https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/programs/2021/3438](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/programs/2021/3438) instead. 

As far as I understand it, the general gist of the two degrees is:

* UTS has more of a focus on being able to study filmmaking alongside another discipline such as journalism, public communication etc. as the second major. I will probably choose the creative writing stream, so that I can have skills in two creative mediums.
* The UNSW degree is much more focused on Film Studies and Media studies, so has the same amount of production work but with a lot more subjects about analysis and study of film.

The MAIN THING that I want to get out of either degree is being able to create a good enough portfolio to work with people as a director, being able to offer past work when pitching new projects, connections, industry experience and anything else that will help me get started on working on my own TV/films as soon as I leave uni.

The following factors are what I would like to know more about:

1. **How well you can network at either institution**: UNSW offers an internship subject, and UTS leads up to a capstone project, so either seems like a good choice. But I would like to know to what extent there's networking opportunities at either place? To what extent is the student cohort good to mingle with? Are there alumni networks that I need to know about?
2. **How much is writing vs. media analysis important:** It seems these days many people try to become writer/directors, and in general knowledge about narratives seems generally useful. On the other hand it might be useful to make myself an expert on films and media analysis so that I can implement it in my films as well as use it as talking points with collaborators. What do you think is more beneficial?
3. **How much I should work on my own stuff in my free time**: UNSW does trimesters with 3 subjects each for a total of 9 subjects a year. On the other hand UTS does semesters with 3 subjects each for only 6 subjects a year. Would I benefit more from using the free time from UTS and work on my own short films and projects, or would it be better for me to study more and learn ore at uni?
4. **What the staff are like**: T*his is what I am most in the dark about.* I would like to know which staff are better, since that can make a huge difference. I am from Adelaide, and I have heard from many people that the staff at Adelaide uni are not nearly as good as Flinders when it comes to creative disciplines. Any names or courses I should look out for would be extremely helpful.
5. **What the postgraduate programs are like:** I know that both UTS and UNSW offer Honours and postgraduate study, but I am not sure about what I should go for. I can go to either when the time comes, but it will be beneficial to already know the staff and facilities through my undergrad experience.
6. **To what extent I will be ready for the industry:** Assuming everything goes well and I get a good start after leaving uni, which degree will better prepare me for jumping into the deep end? I want to avoid doing further study if necessary, maybe a masters at most. I would like to be fully ready for any project, or at the very least know enough to learn on the job.

Any help on these fronts, or anything else that I need to know, will be really appreciated, thanks :)

Edit: I did apply to AFTRS, but didn't get in. But I want to apply again next year so any tips would be recommended 😊"

And I'm not sure whether I should take it or leave it.  

I'll list down arguments on both sides of the coin -  
  

Why I'm thinking I shouldn't take it up:  

- It's a startup. It has no lead or full time engineers as of now. This is the first time they're hiring.
- They aren't going to be giving any training. They say they are going to dive into the problem head first.
- There is no internal structure to this internship. It'll most likely be a bunch of untrained interns.
- The recruiter (who also happens to be one of the founders) said that there will be 'a lot of work', and it will be 'chaotic'.  
- I really need to spend a lot of time practising DSA and work on my projects, and I'm not sure how much time this will leave me with to do that for final year placements. I also need to bump up my grades.  
  

Why I'm thinking I should take it up:

- I've interned at a lab at my university, but I've never interned for a corporation before.
- I'm getting paid. It isn't much, but it is something.
- I might not get another chance for an internship this summer, cause companies are at the fag end of their hiring process.
- They say that if my work is excellent, they might consider me for a full-time opportunity (The dream is of course the big leagues (FAANG and what have you), but what if I don't make it there?).
- The problem I might work on sounds interesting from a research point of view.  


P.S I don't want a masters. I'm looking to get employed full-time.

Apparently having contacts in the industry helps a lot in navigating these things, but I don’t have any. I'd really appreciate any feedback."

I just found this subreddit, so I'm reposting what I posted in r/internetparents because I just want more opinions since I am still at a loss.

I have been working in HR for the past few years and landed a job after my internship at one of the largest companies in the US as a member of the HR team. While I am happy that I work in such a well-known company I am not very happy with my day-to-day life. I had to take a 5-week medical leave back in November because of how poor my mental health was from my job. I have become a lot more cynical and hateful in regards to the world and others because of my job, and I have become someone I absolutely hate. I originally chose HR because I had a skewed view of what HR is. I thought I could help people and I loved talking to people. I was wrong. I decided to stick with it because this job pays well. Also, I was told that I am good at my job so I figured that was enough.

Boyyyy was I wrong. I have been trying to find the motivation to learn new things and/or apply for different jobs, but I am currently locked in this job for 4 years (the only way I can get my full package). I am thinking of transferring horizontally, but I am not sure how to do that because I have no direction in my life right now and my managers are preventing me from applying to other positions within the company.

I have spoken to my therapist and other people I have networked with at this company, and I still don't really know what I should be doing or how I should proceed with discovering a new career path. I don't have to love my job, but I want to be able to bear it. I just hate the rigid structure that comes with HR and the repetitiveness of it. I am definitely still very grateful that I have a job during these times. :) Gotta count my blessings.

With those things being said, how did you find a career path you like? Since I'm still young, I have time to explore but don't know where to start. Also, what would you do in my position? How can I transition out? :(

**TLDR:** Lost and unhappy with current job (HR) and don't know where to go from here. Also, lack of motivation is hindering me and I'm not sure how to proceed."

As such, I got rejected from all MBBs without interviews -- made sense, I was rather unqualified/unfocused, had only a F500 Strategy internship on my resume + no leadership positions etc, and was generally clueless about the process. The only thing I did was aggressively network so I made a few good connections who are still extremely helpful to this day. After learning more I was determined to make a change for senior year.

So I decided to upskill myself, reading this victor cheng article and getting advice from people. Between Junior and Senior year recruiting I got a 4.0 GPA, interned at a Big Tech in Strategy and a T2, and picked up a few leadership positions as well, all of which which I was extremely grateful for, especially when the pandemic hit right in the middle of it all. When Senior year recruiting rolled around I networked again, applied, and got rejected without interviews for 2/3 again but was lucky enough to land an interview at one! Which I then bombed. Maybe not bombed but I performed much worse than I knew I could (silly math errors, going in the wrong direction), probably because of some combination of one-itis and stress and ended up getting rejected.

I know I should not be unhappy, especially given this pandemic situation. I am fortunate to have a return offer from my T2 internship and am gladly going back (although I have no idea what a T2 firm is anymore or even if that matters because it seems like everyone has a different opinion based on Reddit/Fishbowl/Real Life, Geography, and which firm the people they are jealous of work at. Typically i would say that that doesn't matter, but aren't these the same people that would be hiring me 2-3 years out if I choose to exit from whatever? Idk).

I keep thinking maybe it is because of the pandemic/hiring numbers that I did not perform as well as I could have, or maybe I should have networked more or explicitly asked for a referral. But I know that it was just my fault and I was unqualified, I don't even know if the targets were lower plus other people from my internship class were able to break in so it was definitely possible. But that leads to thoughts that maybe all these firms have all seen that I am unqualified for one reason or another, so is consulting or strategy even the right industry or function for me? I turned down going back to the tech firm for consulting but was that a bad decision?

**tldr**: I'm just bummed that I went all-out (or at least my definition of all-out) between Junior and Senior year and only marginally improved my situation. I went from being rejected at all 3 firms without an interview ... to being rejected after the first round at 1 firm and at 2 others without an interview.

Which leads me to my initial question of how the fuck did I become so involved with prestige and this nonsense. I never would have used terms like ""MBB"" or ""T2"" or ""T3"" or ""Big Tech"" or ""F500"" or even given a fuck about my GPA before the ""consulting grind"". Is there some shit about this culture that slowly erodes the psyche and makes me think mostly about prestige? Now I'm thinking about what ""Exit Opps"" I can have after and ""M7"" vs ""T10"" and ""FAANG"". Oh boy, can't wait to dash my brains against the wall with hopes of ""breaking into"" the coveted ""dream jobs"" of ""PE,"" ""HF""(preferably ""MF"" though am I right) or ""VC."" Wish I could just go back to the days where MBB meant ""Men's Basketball"" and not ""firms which literally think you're a dogshit pile of shitmuffins""

Like what the fuck. I get that its branding and branding matters but jeez is there even a difference. People everywhere go to everything and the difference between who gets Prestige Job X and Prestigious Y is like 1/10 of an interview or 1/2 a friend that they knew. Someone who didn't get X prestige gets X+1 Prestige and both of them could've gotten X+2 prestige and missed out on X-1 prestige. I refuse to believe that really matters to hiring managers n years down the line but apparently it does and I'm an oblivious bumpkin who grew up in the yokel world of rationality.

I am literally a prestige gigolo now and I hate it. I just want to go to the mountains and live in a hunter-gatherer community where my success will be measured by the number of berries I bring home rather than the perceived exit opportunities for berry-picking which are probably only marginally better like grape-picking anyway where I'll then be judged by whether I bring home red or green grapes and god forbid they're raisins.

**edit**: the icing on the cake is that this was originally deleted by the automod. The original title of this post was ""**how did I become a prestige gigolo**,"" which I changed because I thought the automod didn't like the word gigolo. Turns out I was wrong because it got deleted again after I changed the title. Which is honestly on brand. Regardless, thank you all for the comments its good to hear both sides and that I'm not alone in my mental gymnastics."

&amp;nbsp;

These past few months I have been struggling to get into the cybersecurity field. I have been in the IT field for about 5 years and am currently working as a HelpDesk Technician. 

&amp;nbsp;

I hold the Security+ &amp; AWS CCP certifications. Studying for the Sec+ was pretty easy, as a lot of the topics/tools covered in the exam, I worked with on a daily basis (ex: SSO, MFA, least privilege, &amp;, etc.). 

&amp;nbsp;

I do understand that cybersecurity isn't an entry-level field, which is why I am working on building up my skillset. At the moment, I am working on getting the Azure Fundamentals, CYSA+, CCNA certs as well as learning python and Linux. I also understand certs don't hold much weight without actually having hands-on experience. I have a subscription with A Cloud Guru and utilize their labs, I have a virtual home lab with Linux VMS, and try to lab every day.

&amp;nbsp;


It feels like it isn't enough and I'm starting to feel really overwhelmed with all the things I have to learn. I search and apply for jobs every day, but all I get back are rejection emails. Now during my searches, I'm starting to see these Summer security internships pop-up which seems like a great opportunity to get real hands-on experience. I'm not currently enrolled in a college degree program, so I don't qualify for these internships.

&amp;nbsp;

Any tips/suggestions on how to get my foot through the door would be greatly appreciated."

How's it going? I've been working as an ML engineer at a startup for 1.5 years now, but I'm reaching my limit. I don't know if this is normal startup behavior or if I'm simply not cut out for the work.


**The Background**

For starters, I'm 25 and graduated with a CS BA in 2018. I had an internship in college at a consulting startup (they've been around 17 years and still call themselves a startup... I should have known better), working largely in a consulting role. After leaving, I decided consulting was mostly enjoyable and provided many unique challenges that aren't necessarily present in stricter engineering roles. My senior year, I was able to take an AI course where we focused on DTCs, Clustering algo's, and finally, a project of your own. I found neural nets to be fascinating and learned as much as I could, culminating in an ANN Schizophrenia classifer. I loved the work and the experimental nature of it, but accepted a consulting position after graduating.

I worked as a consultant for 1.5 years before deciding I wanted to get back into the weeds. There wasn't much programming in this position, and any programming was done in VB.NET. My work revolved around data warehousing and report writing. I wasn't building systems or applications; the majority of the work was configuration and bug fixing. So, I left.


**The Situation**

The startup I joined was presented to me as, ""a YC-funded security company with small offices on the west coast, one in the south, and one office in Europe."" I am working from the southern office, which is fine. Most important to me was the high-energy workplace with hands-on ML work and mentoring opportunities. The CEO told me they have a great team of engineers and I'd be working alongside a new ML Engineer hire plus their full-stack engineer. My first day, I realized there are no other offices. The engineering team is literally just the other ML hire, the full-stack, and myself. On my second day, the CEO fired the full-stack engineer. He said he'd hire another, but he hired an embedded engineer first. Looking back, I should have left when I found out he was lying about the company.

Since I had the most general programming experience (The other ML engineer was an EE Masters and the embedded engineer is a Computer Eng. Masters), the CEO figured I could start taking over the full-stack position while working half-time on machine learning. This was okay with me since I was learning a good bit about ML processes from the other engineer, and I got to start learning about cloud systems and distributed sensor networks.

A year and a half later, I have now become the sole person who manages and builds our cloud infrastructure, databases, client platform, and internal tools. I've repaired the CI/CD pipelines, expanded testing coverage, brought our system uptime to like 99.99%, and improved our production models. The CEO has not hired another engineer in this time. I've had to build various TypeScript apps, pick up Java-Spring, and some C++ while trying to stay on top of learning more TensorFlow and improving my Python skills. I'm the only person here who pushes code to our platforms. The other ML engineer quit in December, leaving the embedded engineer and myself as the company's entire engineering team. That said, it all feels like it's too much. I've written 10k+ loc in the past month and a half, but there's no way it's great. I need support and help to grow as an engineer. The company has a great mission, but the CEO hasn't invested in developing his engineers. The breadth of the work is challenging and I enjoy having new problems each week, but I'm starting to burn out. I still love creating models and building computer systems, but I can't do it like this. Is this par for the course at startups?

Thank you all in advance for the help."

I’m still in the process of training at my job since I was recently promoted to another position. My trainer is currently in the office today, and was Skyping me to teach me something.

Here's some background about my situation:

I've been working doing IT Support for 3+ years now while attending college. I attend classes part-time and am working towards a bachelors degree in IT. Right now I am a Tier 3 Service Desk Technician full time at the organization I work at and make $56k/year plus benifits (401k, Health, other stuff).

Today I was offered an internship position. The title is DevOps Intern, and it will pay $32/hr. It will be 10 weeks long, and starts this June. Below are some things from the job description.

* Build, manage, and maintain Kubernetes clusters including underlying infrastructure and in-cluster apps/services.
* Design and develop tools and frameworks to enable continuous code integration and automated infrastructure management across all layers in the cloud – Servers, Storage, Network. Operating Systems, Database Management Systems, Management infrastructure Applications, and Monitoring and Alerting.
* Design and implement Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery solutions.
* Provide technical direction to Engineering teams on best practices for deploying software in the cloud, hybrid clouds and multi-active data centers.
* Develop a full understanding on the operation and architecture of the Alarm.com clouds and provide innovative solutions to increase reliability, performance and predictability in the operations.
* Embrace DevOps activities to increase consistency and visibility into change management under a highly compliant environment.
* Leverage both Open Source and Commercial solutions to build tools on an ad-hoc basis.
* Support application deployments.

What are pros/cons of leaving, have any of you been in a situation like this?

Ideally I would want know that I can return working at my current job. Do you suggest trying to reach out to my management/HR about doing the internship and returning afterwards? How could I start that conversation, should I wait to ask/notify my employer or tell them now?

I feel like this position will help me gain a lot of new skills and is a great oppurtunity. I am nervous about leaving my job, and health insurance. I think leaving regardless of whether or not my employer agrees to let me return is worth it to gain the skills/experience from this oppurtunity.

Thank you in advance to those who take time to answer and provide advice about my situation."

**TLDR:** Don't give up! *The grind pays off*

3 years, 600 rejections later, just got an internship from the place ***that shall not be named***.

What I think made the difference in getting responses:In the last 4 months, I added 2 new projects, that made my response rate go from 0 for 400 applications to about 7 for my last 200 application push. Not amazing, but after no responses from all my prior, I felt like I cured COVID.

My major focus for these projects were to make them either flashy/cool or useful to solve a real life problem I had and that anyone could use. For both, I had a genuine narrative of why I did the project, what it solved for me, and me going from dumb to competent in my journey of learning how to make it.One was a web-scraping project that has a discord bot to tell me when NVIDIA 30XX is in stock and runs on AWS.Other was a computer vision project that tracks social distance violations.Funnily enough, didn't know how to do either, both ended up being less than 500 lines of code. My tip, lean *heavily* on libraries, apis, and code from others. A lot of my learning (and positive interviewer comments) came from learning to connect things together, not innovating from the ground up. Not ragging on the latter; however, it's dramatically easier to make

What didn't make a difference:Any classes I took, GPA, not having internships. Actually removed a prior internship I had on my resume because I only used Excel and always got negative comments from career fair people about it.

Advice to anyone in my shoes as of 6 months ago, use awesome premade tools to make awesome products.

**Most importantly**, what I've learned and saw in myself, applicable to everyone working their heart out...  
You're not an idiot.  
You're not gonna work at the coffee shop forever.  
You're not a failure.  
And yes, yes, you're good enough to be a software developer.

EDIT: ***that shall not be named*** *=* ~~^(amazon)~~, I'm just a boy trying to meme  
EDIT2: I'm a senior going to be a super senior."

I’m writing today to ask for a bit of advice / guidance / support. I’m a second-semester freshman at a T10 university who’s about to switch his major from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science.

My biggest reservation against majoring in CS from the start (&amp; why I was an EE major instead) was a fear that the major is oversaturated with students who, by default, have more experience than I do... it seems as if many students have been coding since early high school. As a result, I’m concerned that it will be nearly impossible to get internships or technical club positions when students like this can just blow me out of the water.

There are some good things here: my school does very well with FAANG placement (are top 5 employers in Engineering are all Big N), and I have multiple leadership positions in professional student clubs. I’m also a team member on a technical club (a 20 hour per wk commitment in development, highly regarded). 

However, I’m intimidated by the extensive knowledge others seem to have. I’m motivated to push myself hard this summer to ‘catch up,’ but is that even possible? Can I go from no-knowledge-freshman to FAANG-return-offer-holding senior? Even though my heart is in CS, is it possible for me to be competitive? Can I start from ground zero and succeed in such a cutthroat industry?

I’d really appreciate some advice here! Thank you so much!"

We both live in Alberta, we had the idea of buying a place using money saved from internships (about $20k per summer), our idea is that we'd be able to stay there during school, while paying mortgage instead of rent.

That way after we graduate (he in 2024 and me in 2023) that we'd be able to live there while we job hunt, and if either of us have to relocate, we'd rent out a room (or the whole condo if we both leave). We were thinking of each saving $10-15k each and putting a down payment for an apartment/condo worth $100 - 350k in either Edmonton and Calgary.

Are there any things we need to take into consideration? Because it seems like a more beneficial plan than just splitting rent of like $1200, when we could pay mortgage and have a property after it's all said and done. Worst case, we don't find well paying engineering jobs after graduating and end up working a lower-paying/ minimum wage job and we will live there and pay mortgage.

As for student loans, he's got them, but I'm an international student sponsored by my parents (though I 100% plan on paying them back over time). So should we forget about his plan and focus on paying off the debt?

Let me know if you need any additional information in order to make suggestions! We're just some college students trying to set ourselves up for the future.

My LoRs were written by my school professors and two of them have significant contributions to AI research. I have researched with both of them so I suppose that their LoRs are fairly strong but no guarantee.

My major concern right now is my GPA since I heard that people who got admitted to those programs usually possess a 3.8-4.0 GPA.

It was a terribly messy situation, the way he seduced her (using private sessions where he helped her ""train"" and improve her clinical medical skills as an opportunity to seduce/groom her before he asked him to move in with her and have regular sex with her), all without my knowledge, while we were long-distance.

This jerk waited until I spend $300 and 12 hours to fly to visit him for me to find out...I found her things in the house and he finally came clean after I figured it out.

This isn't the first time that my ex has used his power/superiority as a doctor/osteopathic (hands-on) practitioner to seduce women: he's had sex with his classmates after ""treatment"" sessions, various friends who he practiced his medical techniques on, and even his supervisors. An ex of his even filed a  sexual abuse complaint against him, which he successfully fought in court but I believe it might still be a dent on his record (I don't know the details and I don't want to know). 

This man is out of control and also uses spirituality and his father's spiritual school (his dad is an overt narcissist who is a world-famous spiritual ""guru"") to draw in vulnerable women, often with health problems or desire to seek ""healing"" to gain sexual intimacy. He's cheated on me multiple times, and has left a wake of girls who were psychologically damaged by his actions.

The question is: do I bother to tell his residency program about this? I'm LONG over him (we broke up a year ago), I don't care about him anymore, and I have 0 feelings (besides disgust) for the guy. Would telling his residency program about this affair he had with his intern at the hospital be inappropriate of me? I don't want to only act out of drama /vindication and I also don't want to bring drama into my life. But I'm a bit worried about this guy and I feel like what he did is disturbing and inappropriate, and possibly even illegal, and I think it should be on his record incase he does it again.

TL;DR: 

Psychologically abusive narcissistic ex-bf had an affair where he groomed/seduced/cheated on me with his intern (who he supervised and was responsible for) at his medical residency program. I'm concerned about his behavior and am contemplating whether or not it is appropriate for me to contact his residency program to inform them about it. This was a year ago, so I didn't do anything because I was too upset/traumatized by the situation, but now I am feeling OK and considering informing his supervisors about what happened."

Courses :
9th and 10th - ICSE
11th and 12th - ISC
These two boards are considered the toughest in the country.


9th and 10th - Math, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, English, History, Geography, Sanskrit
11th and 12th - Math, Chemistry, Physics, English, Computer Science (Indian curriculum has all AP level syllabus for regular standard, so all these courses were AP equivalent)


Grades :
My school doesn't do GPA, only percentages, and the grades are all probably weighted as difficulty of curriculum is already high.
The tests that are given in my school are incredibly tough, they make it so that the board exams are easier, so don't be surprised if 10th board exam percentage is much higher than the others.


9th - 91%

10th - 97% (rank 12 out of 128 in school, but I didn't mention rank anywhere)

11th - 90%

12th - Exams not done yet, but mid year grade - 87%


Overall average grade up to 12th mid year - 91.25% (which is like 4.3 weighted out of 4.3 according to some website because of my curriculum being ISC, so it's naturally ""tough"")


SAT -

Math - 740

EBRW - 720

Total - 1460 

According to the common data sets, I'm above the 75th percentile for both the mentioned colleges.



Extra curriculars -


1. Computer vision and python internship with a defense contractor (I was selected out of more than 150 national applicants). Getting an internship while still in high school is not an easy thing in India and is probably a great achievement of itself. I worked on machine learning projects and even had an individual project regarding naval and rescue sign detection using deep learning.


2. Participated in Google Code-in (international coding competition) contest three years, came in top 10 out of 123 in my organization in 2019 contest. Basically we need to work on real tasks that the organization we have chosen gives us, whoever does the most number of tasks wins. I did around 20 tasks, but probably didn't win because I wasn't involved in GitHub issue helping and stuff.


3. I have also been the leader of the audio-video team in my school. We edit and create videos and photos for school events like valedictory ceremony, school annual day and stuff. We've received recognition from the management and been regarded as the best a-v team among all the branches of the institution.


4. I also do competitive coding, not won anything, but did go to the finals of a city level contest.


5. I do quizzing, won third place once in a city level competition.


6. I'm a junior level violinist, had stopped for a while during exams and stuff, so couldn't advance further, but picked up again and I learn songs and play in my own. I've given multiple concerts and performed on stage, no awards and stuff as I wasn't seriously indulged in it.



I don't have any awards per say, but I do have a lot of certificates from competitions and exams, I don't know if that counts.



Essay :


I'd say it's a pretty well written essay, I'd rate it 8/10.
My topic was ""Describe a topic, idea or concept that you find so engaging that you lose track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to learn more?""


I wrote about my love for computer vision and how I find coding and computer science very interesting. I wrote about my internship and my projects, how I started coding when I was still 10 years old, played around with Arduino (a microprocessor which you can use to build and program small machines), how that made me curious about automation and AI and computer vision, I've included some literary stuff to like stuff about superheroes, Sherlock homes and Isaac Asimov, about how we should ""not only SEE but OBSERVE"" everything around us, blah blah, overall it's a good essay and has a truly captivating hook.


I don't know if this counts as community service, but I volunteered to help people who were affected by floods in my state and a neighboring state. I formed a team with my friends and went house to house to collect stuff like food, clothes, commodities, money to give to the people of those affected states. I included this too in my essay saying this was an inspiration to use my technical skills for good and help save people from natural disasters and built rescue sign detector, fire and smoke detector and stuff during my internship.

Excellent recommendations from Math, CS, English teachers and the school Principal, I'd rate them all 8/10 on average.

I have since taken ownership of that decision and the regret has slowly subsided.In my country once you get a law degree one has to undertake a postgraduate degree to qualify as an advocate.A path which many people pursue because of fear,apparent access to more job opportunities and of course to legally practice.I didn't want to go down this route but my parents insisted and even though I knew I didn't want to practice the law I was scared and didn't have a ""solid"" alternative.

I went that route and unfortunately failed.Failure is bad enough but failing at something you didn't want to do and didn't put much effort in because of lack of interest is worse.The guilt and doubt ruined my self-esteem and I don't think two years later I have fully recovered.

After I failed I got an internship at a law firm and had an awful experience that reinforced my belief that this isn't a path I want to follow.My parents and peers were adamant that I should re sit the exams arguing that""it might help in the long run,you never know"".

Long story short the registration period for the exams have opened up.I had two years to read but didn't and I am still trying to figure out which path I should follow but I do know it's not the legal route.

I am sure if I do register I would need to force myself to read..I also don't like that I have to be emotionally invested in something to do it,but during the lock-down I started programming to switch careers and earn an income but ended up oddly enjoyed it.But I keep telling myself that I would probably have to work insanely hard to make a career out of this since I majored in something else,especially in the moments when I compare myself to other well-established programmers.

So I begun contemplating doing the exams under the rationale that I live in a country with very few job opportunities and would gain an upper hand with the postgrad qualification and in the future it might even earn me a higher salary,also my peers who passed the postgrad are doing really well and would probably do even better than me if I didn't do it.

But even as I thought this I didn't feel right inside,but then I also question whether I am being unrealistic and should become more pragmatic because I also do need some stable income and the post doc would help me in achieving that. 

I can't sleep...my self-talk is skewed towards the negative..I am so confused and afraid.I don't know what to do.Is this normal,how do I regain the confidence to pursue a different path without regretting not doing the postgrad.

How do I stop telling myself that I will be poor and unsuccessful if I don't do it.I need stable income to become financially independent so do I need to just suck it up buttercup,register and do the exams."

I'm 27 and haven't had a job before. I have completed my bachelors in computer science &amp; Engineering. Took 3 years more than the usual 4 years taken to complete my bachelors. Wasted my time at the college and when the realization hit, cleared all my backlogs in 2019. Applied for a job, got interviewed, and soon covid came and the company decided not to take anyone new. ( Also my performance in the interview wasn't that good. So I can't really blame covid for not getting that job.) 

During the covid time, I tried to learn HTML, CSS, JS and then started with React. I was targeting the MERN stack.  


2 weeks before, I got an internship. The internship is for 6 months, and the company said they'll make me permanent if they are impressed with my performance.   
Here, I need to work with .Net Core Web API and Angular. Although there are senior engineers to help here and there, they are busy with their work and I feel very anxious thinking about what will happen if I go forward with the current state of knowledge I have.  
I feel like this is not for me. Sometimes, I feel like running away from that place. But I can't. I'm already 27 with No prior job experience and there is no way I can get another job or internship.  


All I know is some terms I heard from seniors while they instruct me to do things. I hear DTO, Entity Framework, DB Context, Swagger, Dependency Injection etc. Its been 2 weeks and I still have no idea about what I am doing and what all I should learn.   
Also, I have this doubt that if I continue with something like .Net core and Angular, will that stop me from getting a job on the stack of my interest? I hear no one talking about .Net Core these days. That's the next thing that makes me anxious. I have thought 100 times whether to post this here or not. I can't handle the anxiety anymore and I am trying knocking all the doors. Please help. Also If anyone can provide a simple roadmap that I should follow, that would be if great help.

lj3fdi,38,2021-02-13,What do I lose by NOT pursuing a master's?,TheRealKingofmice,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lj3fdi/what_do_i_lose_by_not_pursuing_a_masters/,"So I'll preface this by saying that my situation is a little bit unique - I attend a mid-tier UC school and plan on graduating in three years, and am in my second year right now. I'm thankful to have a fairly high GPA, a lot of project experience, and an internship coming up this summer. 

With that said, will I lose anything by not pursuing a Master's Degree in CS? I ask because I'm really conflicted on how much it will truly benefit me versus not getting one. I have no idea what subfield of CS I'd like to specialize in, but they all sound so interesting - cryptography, cybersecurity, AI/ML, etc. I just don't know yet. On the flip side, I'll be very busy this summer anyways and it will be hard for me to study for the GRE, and I'd prefer to not spend 2 years in a master's program (I also literally can't afford it). So my only options are to either take the GRE anyways and apply for the super exclusive one year programs at schools like Berkeley, Harvard, Cornell, UT-Austin, etc., or skip the GRE and pursue a master's at my current school (but have to stay an extra 1.5 years, albeit it's much cheaper here)."

I’m a fourth year student but I’ll be graduating in 5 years. My plan is to go into data science, my schools has a masters in data science but I’m not interested in it. My plan is to get a masters in Econ and I spoke to the guy in charge and he would allow me to take 9 credits from ms in data science and apply it to my master. 

However, at the moment, I have very nothing on my resume in relation to computer science. I’m taking my first CS course, 6 of my math credits counted and a course in excel. So at the completion of my intro course, I’ll need only two other courses from the computer science department to get the minor.   

I have little programming experience, but I am practicing. I am way ahead of where the class is and I do mini projects on my own and keep learning. Is getting an internship this summer or the upcoming fall unrealistic or is it something I could realistically do?"

He has a degree in econ and never took a CS course past intro to CS.  He taught himself basic frontend development from codeacademy and youtube, and eventually got a job as a frontend engineer at a small startup before moving into full stack developer roles at bigger companies.  He said back then, the fact he had an econ degree did not matter and a lot of employers were ok with him not having a CS degree.






Even just before the pandemic destroyed the job market, it really was getting pretty competitive.  I noticed that this subreddit has turned against going the self-taught route and coding bootcamp route, and just recommended going back to school.  CS degrees, which seemed like a sure thing 5 years ago, has turned into 4 years of crazy competition for internships and jobs.  





I started going to school for CS in the mid 2010s, and there was definitely this mentality like I'm getting a very valuable undergrad degree.  People said that the degree itself would guarantee employment, and getting an internship or two would be a huge bonus.  I graduated with one internship and had a decent time finding a job, and I had friends graduate with no internships who still found jobs.





I'm still surprised when I see the number of people from top schools applying for jobs at my company without internships.  I'm also shocked to see people graduate with one or two internships from top schools struggling to find jobs."
lj4uxt,2,2021-02-13,Can someone please tell me if I'm fucking up or not by not looking for internships/co-opts as a freshman?,sunnirays,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/lj4uxt/can_someone_please_tell_me_if_im_fucking_up_or/,"Because I really can't be bothered with anything else besides my mountain of gen-ed coursework (i'm a CompSci major) and my turbulent family life (without going into details, it's lots of on-and-off fighting :/). Seriously, I'm doing pretty well but unlike high school where I could easy breeze through everything with As, it's taking a lot more of my time and energy to not completely fail.

Additionally, I'm not even going to be free for a good portion of the summer because I'll be using a scholarship to take Calc1 (for free!) for 9 weeks so I'll be able to jump right into my major classes in Fall 2021. And from what our student-mentors have been telling us, since it's so short, it's a lot more vigorous than the PreCalc classes we've taken so far (three-hour integrated TA study &amp; lecture periods, five days a week!). So, if I actually want to do well in that, I really have to be able to focus on that class specifically. 

Finally, whenever I actually get to do co-opts and internships, I don't want to have to do some sort of remote thing. I actually want to be able to be at the actual work place, talking to people without concern for social distancing or masks, actually learning and doing the things my future permanent job will require of me. Maybe this one is a bit unrealistic considering I probably won't get that until my junior year at earliest (maybe spring semester of sophomore year if we'll see).

And to be clear, I definitely will do this stuff eventually (especially since my school has it set up in a way where you can still do 3 co-opt semesters and suspend your classes so it doesn't mess your financial aid and scholarships), but just not right this very second because I don't think I can handle it right now.

I just have this weird anxiety that by not doing it right this second, I'm messing up and job potential I'll have post-grad, especially since I'm constantly getting spammed with emails about joining employment sites and LinkedIn and I have to attend a career fair next week (virtual, which means setting appointments on Zoom instead of just walking around talking) if I want to pass one class I'm in which is actually needed if I want to do co-opts later.

I am currently a 3rd year MEng engineering student from the UK, but I have the option to leave this year with a BEng.

I currently have two job offers: one is a summer internship, the other is a full time graduate role.

However, I am not sure which one to take.

&amp;#x200B;

**Graduate Job Benefits:**

* Full time, permanent job
* Working in bridges which is where I want to work
* In a city which I prefer
* No more school.
* No more applying to jobs

**Graduate Job Negatives:**

* Having a BEng as oppose to an MEng will prolong me becoming chartered
* Starting salary is nothing special
* No guarantee they will sponsor me to do an MSc (for chartership)

**Summer Intern Benefits:**

* Only 8 weeks
* I can go back to school and finish with an MEng/MSc which helps towards chartership
* Possibility for sponsorship through final year and guaranteed job
* I really liked the person who interviewed me

**Summer Intern Negatives:**

* No guarantee of a job/sponsorship afterwards
* In an expensive city and I would need to find accommodation.
* Not sure what exactly I'll be doing.
* Much smaller company than graduate job (but still a multinational)

&amp;#x200B;

One option I considered was doing both, since I could technically fit the 8-week summer placement in after my degree and before I start my graduate job, but that might end up being stressful.

To be a chartered engineer in the UK, you ideally need an masters degree (MEng or MSc) to meet the educational requirements, however there are ways around this if you can show on-the-job learning to the same standard.

If you were in my position, what would you choose?

Thanks."

So I’m in what I think is a unique situation. I’ve been fighting for over 4 weeks to get my scholarship money from GT.

My scholarship sends me money every semester for 8 semesters with the only rule: be a full-time student during the semesters I want their money. This semester, I’m doing an internship that can be registered through the school as classes to go towards a minor (so they’re unaudited). The internship is 6 credit hours, I added an optional 3-credit-hour course taught by the same professor to complement my internship experience, and I also requested a 3-credit-hour Special Topics course through my college for a project I’m doing with a specific professor. In short, I made sure I was at 12 credit hours, and OSCAR confirmed I was at 12 credit hours.

While paying for classes on the Bursar deadline day, I was being charged much more than expected, but I figured my scholarship was slow to come through. However, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships emailed me the next day telling me that because I wasn’t a full-time student, the scholarship sponsor had asked for their money back. From here, I get sent on a wild goose chase between the Office of Finaid and Scholarships, my academic advisor, the Registrar, the Bursar, and my sponsor where I learned several things:

* I  was registered for 12 credit hours, but only 10 were billable. The optional 3-credit-hour internship class turned out to only have 1 billable credit hour. To reference what the Office of Finaid and Scholarships told me, in the eyes of GT, I’m full-time, but in the eyes of the scholarship sponsor, I’m not.
* Every office I emailed asking how I’m supposed to know how many **billable** credit hours a class has (because I didn't know this was a separate thing), they either didn’t know the answer or avoided the question.
* The Bursar said they needed “permission” from the sponsor to disburse my funds.
* Scholarship sponsor said it’s up to GT to determine if a student is full-time and they choose to characterize it based on number of credit hours vs number of billable credit hours. In my situation, the money was sent to GT, GT made its decision, and then GT sent the money back to the sponsor. It was out of the sponsor’s hands, and they won’t send any permission to GT.

My Bursar payment history shows that I’m paying the same amount this semester as I was last semester. That's weird. Last semester, I took 13 credit hours. Turns out GT changed their policy so that students who take 1-5 credit hours pay a flat rate, and students who take 6+ credits pay a higher flat rate ([source](http://www.bursar.gatech.edu/student/tuition/all_fees_sp21.pdf)). That means a student who takes 6 credit hours pays the same as someone with 12 credit hours. Therefore, there’s nothing that distinguishes me from a full-time student, and I’m still doing the workload of a full-time student.

After lots of back and forth, the Office of Finaid and Scholarships is standing firm on their decision: in order for them to disburse the scholarship money to my account, I must be enrolled in 12 billable credit hours. Full-time status is determined by the number of billable hours the students has enrolled into. I may be considered full-time through the academic and registrar department, but for disbursement purposes through the financial aid office, I am considered less than full-time. My sponsor bases their decision to send the scholarship payment on their full-time policy.

So here’s the thing. Do I continue pushing? It’s been over 4 weeks. I’ve made it clear to the offices that if I lose the money for this semester, it’s money that can’t be applied to any other semester because I don't plan on being here for more than 4 years total. The finaid and scholarships office seems firm on their position even though the concept of billable/non-billable credit hours doesn’t seem to be common knowledge. The 12-billable-credit-hour requirement seems arbitrary when we’re all paying the same amount now due to COVID. I'm caught on a technicality that screws me over, and GT offices have no incentive to help me because their pocketbooks aren't benefited."

I'm a sophomore currently and one of my main goals for Summer 2021 - that is this summer, of course - is to get a tech internship. Sadly, due to well everything, I've been in a really bad place for the past year. 

As a result, I've only applied to three companies for summer 2021, and even though I got an interview at a reach application ( JPMorgan ), it's in less than five days and I don't feel like that's enough time to prepare properly. 

My current plans for getting something resembling a tech internship is to apply to REUs and  Google's Summer of Code, I'm not extremely confident in those options. I'm also looking for companies to apply to but I feel like it's not going anywhere. 

I'm just asking for some advice on what to do in a situation like this? Is it unrealistic to get an internship this late in the game. Are there any resources, I could make use of maybe?

The employer said the work should be done within three weeks and I'll get paid every week. This gig was to be seen as an intern position to see my level of skill. Boss told me, if I do well, they'll hire me early Jan of 2021.

The issue is that there were factors that made the project far longer than intended. Not sure if the the boss knew I wouldn't finish by December. The issue is because I didn't finish by the third week, I have not been paid the final payment and I have not been getting paid every additional week I've been working on this project, I was only paid the first two weeks, but because we are now in Feb, the payment would not be worth all that time.

Anyway, one of the factors that has contributed to the slow progress, was backend apis not been done by other team members yet, which I was not aware off when I came on board.

Also as time passed, it became very difficult continue putting time and energy into something that has not been paying at all, especially when I need to help my family get bills paid, in a devastating time where covid has affected my family financially.

I started putting less and less time into the work so I can focus on landing other paying gigs and also been helping  my brother on his gigs(not programming related) since he's been able to get a number of jobs on a consistent basis. So me helping him finish his work faster brings money into the household faster, though he doesn't really pay me since the money has to go straight into the bills so we can eat, have electricity and keep a roof over our heads.

I eventually came clean to the boss about my situation and why I can't put my undivided attention into the work anymore. Not getting paid. It's that simple. Got bills to pay.

They've seen progress in the app at this point. We had a call about how they felt about my performance. They said given all the issues I've had to deal with while working on the project, they said I've actually been successful. They said they never expected me to finish in December, they just wanted to test how I dealt with pressure, which actually means they knew I'd be working without pay.

The boss said that he would like me to come aboard on a more permanent basis, as soon as the first project comes in from one of the regular clients for android development. So he says just hang in here for a little while.

In the meantime they would still like me to finish the app though.

In my head I'm thinking, the work I've done as an intern, is the amount of work a full time employee would do, but for salary. I know they are also getting free work out of me, for a product that they may profit from down the line.

So a couple of things.

1. There's no guarantee at this point actually if I'm going to be working full-time with them yet, although they said, they're just waiting for the first android project to come in for this year.
2. So though they said they would like me to come on board soon, they would still like me to finish the app in the meantime, which I'm not sure I should, because it's not getting me paid, and the payment I would get would not be worth the time I've put in at this point, so I don't know if I should worry myself to finish the project and try squeeze time for it, or just continue to focus 100% on paying jobs(not programming related) with my brother's video editing gigs; looking for more paying programming gigs, and working on my own projects for my portfolio.
3. My family have said, I should not waste another minute with this company if they have not been paying me, and just continue helping my brother grow his company and bring in more money into the household with him(money doesn't go straight to me though, but gets some of the bills paid, it's a tough time for us).
4. I don't have a degree, so getting programming work has been difficult. Not sure if I should stick it out with this company a little while longer to see what happens.

What are your thought guys? I'd really appreciate some advice.  


  
Edit: Thanks for all the responses. I've decided to not waste another minute with this company. I'm already look for work elsewhere while building more side projects and gigs."
ljqa5w,17,2021-02-14,Laid off from COVID. Early in my career and lost. Help please!,VapesfromBible,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ljqa5w/laid_off_from_covid_early_in_my_career_and_lost/,"Hello --

I am 25 years old and roughly 1 year out of college. Throughout college, I did numerous IT Support internships and gained some great experience. I was able to accept a job right after college -- but my role was impacted by COVID.

 The company I was working at was a SaaS based company that sold a low-code web development tool and also a live streaming tool. When I was initially hired, my title was “IT Support Specialist” and I did everything from providing internal support to the employees and being the “IT” guy. After about 5 months of learning the IT processes - they approached me and asked if I wanted to be a part of their Customer Software Support team, which would entail helping customers with their questions about the product. Since the IT was sort of slow, I figured I would take the opportunity.

I had a training period where I learned the ins-and-outs of their SaaS product and master it. Master it enough to answer customer tickets, be on live chat support, hop on phone calls with the sales team. I REALLY enjoyed this. I enjoyed working with customers and representing the brand, helping different companies achieve their goals with their products. I also liked being pulled into calls with the Sales/Customer Success team as a “technical contact” to explain or demo the product. I wrote technical documentation for the software. Maintained relationships with customers on projects.

I was able to collaborate with Engineering team and Development team when certain bugs came up on the software and pick up some basic HTML and CSS tricks along the way. I learned that the software was hosted on AWS and I really wanted to get AWS certifications to see if I can branch out and maybe help on the backend side.... but this all came to an end when I was laid off.

My resume is very Desktop Support / IT Support heavy due to all the internships and part time stuff I did while I was in college. Once I got my degree in Computer Information Systems - I started at that SaaS company and began to realize that my love for IT Support wasn’t there anymore. My drive for supporting end-users and putting out fires is fading. 

It hit me hard in the few months that I was unemployed, the only positions I was getting called about or leads for were low-level Help Desk jobs for a lot less pay than I was making. It was a real wakeup call that I landed a very lucky gig out of college... but on the job market... I am extremely low level. I took a ""Customer Support Specialist"" job in the meantime that will pay the bills while I can dedicate and focus on studying for certs. I am motivated to start skilling up.

So, where do I start? I really was thinking about going down the Cloud route. I passed the Comptia Cloud Essentials+ certification recently, as well as Azure Fundamentals. Working on AWS certifications currently

I was also thinking about learning Linux as my Linux skills are very base level. I was looking at grabbing the LPI Linux Essentials to get the basics of Linux down and on my resume and move on to studying like the RHCSA or LFCS. 

I am so lost in my career and really need some suggestions or someone to talk to and get on a good path. Being unemployed from COVID is tough and I’m lost.

Doing really well, considered a top performer across the floor and the place has great culture and work-life balance, plus I'm at an HQ office in a rotational program with the chance to rotate in different sectors within M&amp;A and other products as well.

Got an offer to start at an American BB in a Southern European country (Spain / Italy / Greece / etc.) in June as a generalist with the 1st year class (small office, so it's only me and another analyst that converted his internship that would start). 

Unsure about what to do. Below the pros and cons that I could think of. 

**Pros**

* Much better brand and exit opps
* Higher long-term comp
* Chance to excel as a 1st year analyst as I have plenty of experience across the whole spectrum of tasks, from origination to execution
* Analyst program is 2 years vs. 3 years at my bank -&gt; should get promoted to associate at roughly the same time
* Rare opportunity: very competitive to get an IB job in that country due to extremely few spots, even more so at an American BB
* Closer to home - allows me to move to my home country (but not such a big difference, where I am working now is just a short flights away anyways)

**Cons**

* Lose all the goodwill I built at my bank, where I am on fast track for early promotion and very well considered
* Place is much more hierarchical and less flexible there. I am getting a lot of freedom where I am working now and can often work quite independently on pitching and modelling on execution. That would completely change
* Lose a large potential tax discount I would get in the Southern European country if I move in 1 year instead of now (but the chance of securing a spot at a BB in 1 year as analyst 2 / 3 is low to non-existent...)
* Seniority discount to again 1st year analyst does not feel great, especially now that ""the worst"" period is behind me...
* Much worse work-life balance and culture from what I hear (higher pressure, average 1-2am vs. 11-12 at my bank)
* Need to move which is never nice
* Not even sure I want to stay in the industry long term even if I am seemingly really good at it. Very passionate about value investing and sometimes daydreaming about starting my business

Keen to hear thoughts from the community and people who went through a similar decision."

I stayed at the company for 3 summers straight until I was not offered a return offer for full-time. ( Ran into a lot of issues during my final internship so it wasn't the end of the world for me but it was disappointing).  I decided to graduate early (December 2019) and take a gap year to enjoy some time off but the plan was canceled when the pandemic started and I decided to get a job. Due to every company freezing hiring in my area (decided to stay close to family), I was stuck with two offers one at a defense company and one at a consulting company. Both offered 90k, which was great for me. I told myself that this would be temporary and that I would find a job that I am more passionate about in the future. So I went with Defense since it was more reputable  


Fast Forward 9 Months later, I dislike my job greatly and would not like to stay here for more than a year, but I am struggling to get interviews. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong here. When I had FAANG on my resume in my college years. I was getting an interview at every company I applied to (which were mostly internships). Now it seems that I automatically am getting rejection emails from every company I apply to. I don't even get to the interview stage! All the calls and LinkedIn recruiters that message me are from defense companies. I understand that my problem is privileged since I am making money and I have decent benefits. But I do miss the prestige and the type of people that I work with and the ""impact"" I was making. Granted it wasn't MUCH of an impact but it was enough to make me feel good. Defense work is with not as amazing technologies, it raises ethical questions for me, and the differences compared to a FAANG company is like night and day.   
Back in college, I had upperclassmen and recruiters to talk to and that helped me a long way. Now I'm struggling once again and I don't have intern fairs and I can't seem to get to the interview stage. Where do I go to get my resume reviewed and to have mock interviews? During my internship at FAANG, I did 20+ mock interviews so I am willing to give mock interviews and help others as well and give resume advice too when I feel proud of where I am at career-wise again but I need to leave defense. I don't want to stay here and I am afraid that the longer I stay here the more specialized recruiters will think I am for defense work than for FAANG work or any enterprise company. I held back from applying to FAANG companies since I am afraid to fail the interviews and wait for another year to apply and I am in the DFW area and would like to stay (but it seems like that is becoming less of an option but might settle for Austin but still need help)  I try applying to entry-level jobs mostly since any level above seems to ask for 2 years of experience, which I don't have yet but I still get rejected immediately from those as well when I believe I have the skills to excel at them. What is yall's advice?   


  
TLDR: Stuck in Defense when I want to be somewhere else and I keep getting rejected from entry-level job applications.   
What resources do you recommend to get my resume reviewed?   
How to get mock interviews?   
Is it possible to figure out why do I keep getting rejections?   
Do yall suggest leaving DFW for career advancement (I hate HCOL areas)?   
Change my personal projects to tailor more to the jobs that I am applying for?   
Are certifications such as one in Docker or Kubernetes worth it?  


Open to feedback and whatever pieces of advice yall have to get out of Defense."

I’ve been doing 80 hour weeks and coping fine, but I’ve just started to get some requests that are a bit trying.

The other week, I got a request from a senior from a project I was on back in October - I’d handed a task off to him back then, but he wanted me to add to one of the explanations and thought I’d made a mistake copying stuff from the TB. Turns out he was looking at the PY TB, still took about 2 hours to convince him of this, but otherwise it wasn’t a huge drain of time and I managed to finish my other tasks on schedule.

Today (Valentine’s Day, Sunday) I get an email from a senior at 8pm from my first ever stock count that I did in early December - he’s asked about some variances, but honestly his email was almost incomprehensible, bar the request to send it off by 9:30am tomorrow.

I’m fine with the crazy hours - I’ve put in 80+ hours at internships before, and on my main project where I was the only associate we signed off 2 days ahead of schedule partly due to a 50% decrease YoY in manager review time. However these other requests are really starting to throw me, and being asked to work on the one night a week that I try to stay offline is really surprising.

I guess my question is, are these requests / hours normal for busy season? I’m booked for 50+ hours each week, whereas my coworkers are on 37.5 and some have been unassigned since January. I’m loving the job and most of the people, but this is really getting to me."

ljxdkx,1,2021-02-14,I'm tired and clueless of trying every day to get going &amp; study,MeForMeera,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ljxdkx/im_tired_and_clueless_of_trying_every_day_to_get/,"I was an excellent student in school. Excellent grades. I had low-key OCD (undiagnosed- cause mental health wasn't a talked about subject when I was a kid). I kinda grew out of it. But my anxiety went out of control. Exams created unnecessary panic and anxiety attacks. I spent more time worrying about the test than actually studying. Then, I started struggling with attention in my late teenage years. I thought perhaps it was because of technology (mobile devices had just become a norm then).

In my early 20s (I'm currently 23yo), I went through some traumatic stuff and my struggle to focus just shot up. It manifested as a constant urge to only watch videos on YouTube. I thought maybe it's my minds defence mechanism to forget the bad memories and negative feelings due to the bad things I had experienced. But, I started seeing a big change in everything I did. I could never focus at work. I zoned-out in between almost every conversation I had with clients and co-workers. I could rarely get through study lectures for more than 10-minutes without losing focus. The worst thing is, I don't even realise that I am zoning out until much later. I couldn't make sense of my forgetfulness and cloudy thinking. I got ostracized a lot at work because of not being able to meet deadlines and meeting reporting expectations. I struggled with socialising with people and got super emotional on feeling rejected when people didn't invite me to events. I found it difficult to not interrupt people while they talked.  Everything just rode down my confidence. I started losing my patience more easily. I just shut down completely mentally. I cried every day. I felt alone. I felt that I no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't focus, got super emotional unnecessarily and needed a massive amount of time just to get started on stuff.

An example- If I had to submit a report by the end of the day, I'd spend the majority of my time worrying in office &amp; at home about how I need to submit the report, but I could never get started. In the end, I'd sleep early, and then get up at 2 am and start working on my motivation. Then by 5 or 6 am, I'd get my motivation together &amp; I'd start working. Due to the time limit, I'd work at record speed, finish the task and mail the report before leaving for work again. This became a norm and I started hating myself.

After my internship was over, and I had to start studying again, Covid came. Despite the fact that I had the entire day to study, I JUST COULDN'T GET STARTED. I tried waking up early, didn't work. Staying up late, didn't work. It was the usual- losing focus every 10 minutes debacle. I just could not make sense of why just sitting in one place and studying was such a big task for me. I'd sit down and it would constantly be a struggle with my mind to make it stay in one place. By the time I do get momentum, it's already afternoon. I have lunch, and the momentum is lost, Then again I have to spend 2 hours trying to get my mind back on track. When evening arrives, I get depressed seeing how much I got done since morning. Then I go down a depressed rabbit hole, cursing myself for what a loser I am. I tried making lists, listening to affirmations, exercising, eating healthy, switching off the internet. Still, my mind refused to focus. I tried meditation too, and guess what, my mind zones out WHILE meditating.

Finally, I realised that something was off here. So I wrote a few of my issues in a post on Reddit. It blew up and many people in the comments suggested that perhaps I have ADHD, It had never even occurred to me before. I started googling about ADHD and the stuff I read just BLEW MY MIND. It was like my behaviour being recounted back to me. Everything started making sense. I felt so angry that I wasn't aware of this before. It could have saved me so much of self-hate. I started watching the YouTube channel: 'How to ADHD' and every damn video was relatable to me. I felt like I had just discovered my true identity. Maybe I'm not 'just lazy' after all.

I told my mom about ADHD. She, bless her heart, too started researching about it and she instantly agreed that I do showcase all the symptoms of ADHD. All these years, she too had witnessed my declining focus capabilities. From an A grade student to the state of struggling to finish a page had definitely raised alarms for her internally.

After deliberating for a while, we decided not to approach a professional because we know they'd recommend medication. And I don't believe medication would be the wise go-to solution in the long run for me.

The past one week, I was slowly increasing my productivity by making detailed to-do lists, writing in my long term goal journal, asking my mom to check up on me during the day to see if I'm studying, listening to affirmations, etc. But, it is starting to go downhill again from yesterday. I easily lose my focus if my mom comes to talk to me for even a minute. I feel the constant urge to watch YouTube again. I feel lack of motivation during the day, (My focus increases at night though) I am again struggling to watch lectures.

The purpose of me writing this post is, guys, I need your help. Please can you suggest achievable ways to handle ADHD? 

I need to get stuff done. I need to study. It's a do or die situation for me. How the hell am I gonna do anything in life if I struggle with such basic things. I feel so alone in this battle. I feel embarrassed trying to talk about my daily struggle to my mom cause I know she's trying her best to help. The fact that I'm not able to figure something out and straighten out my life is terrifying me. I know I have potential. But I'm not able to utilise even 10% of it because of my daily battle with my mind to start. I don't wanna let myself and my loved ones down.

Thank you for being patient and reading my post. I look forward to going through your feedback!"

Loneliness hits hard around this time every year - another valentines alone and day later birthday with no friends to celebrate with. 
If you want to talk, share memes, music etc. just send a chat msg or something.


Now lets proceed with ranty stuff I just want to put out in to universe :)

My life as of now (continuation from old post, which I'll add below) broken in to personal, uni and career.

**Uni** - *I'll probably get kicked out again, for good this time. * Because of bureaucracy, procrastination and getting covid 4weeks ago. I got back this semester back to finish thesis. But there were problems. I was officially re enrolled in November, like in systems, mail etc. Since September uni is in lock down mode aka everything has to be on line. By the time I could do something almost every prof was full with students with thesises. So it took going through one of the Dean to get thesis supervisor. First online meeting was at 28.12. I started redoing my old thesis but at the end of the year didn't really had time. Then 1st week of 21 had to go on delegation to this site 5h away where I had 4 days of 12-16h between going out and getting back (no time and energy to do anything)
2nd week I mostly procrastinated and on weekend started to get symptoms of covid. By 20.01 I was laying in bed with fever 38-40°C bearly conscious. If it weren't for my parent's I'd probably dehydrate. I was like that till 28.02 when fever disappeared but changed to cough where I could only lay on side because everything else was ending with suffocating cough including talking for a week. Aaand we have February! My deadline is end of February or I'm getting kicked out of uni again! I don't know how to pull this one off but I have to. Otherwise I'm fucked

**Personal life** - *still alone, with neither friends or gf.*  Procrastination (or dopamine addiction) is at all high this year. My relationship with parents is about to hit rock bottom... well, basically same thing that happened with every relationship I had. Slowly distanced myself subconsciously. It took years with my parents but here I am. Tbh i don't even know how to bring any of it up. Once i had great close relationship with my parents but somewhere along the way it went whatever we have now. I'm still living with them.
Last time they brought it up and pushed me to talk, i just chocked.

**Career** - still working in same company. But since half of December I'm working locally. Nothing special happend. Just day to day routine. 



*Where do I start... around beginning of '18 I kinda finished uni classes, started internship aaaand went in to downhill of comfort zone. At first day to day was same. Then i woke up before new year '19 with most contact lost, random people, friends, most of family... connections kinda faded away.
Summer '19 was last chance to finish thesis and graduate. But downhill never stopped. Internship turned in zombie mode work. So I've quit to focus on finishing uni. Well... i didn't and got kicked out. Then started job hunt. Succeeded after 2 months of searching with entry level corpo job that basically required english B1 and high-school. It's November '19.
During corpo copy paste ""work"" I've been looking for a job in field. Got one stating march '20. Here i was hoping for ""new begging"" and getting my shit together. Guess what. Corona hit. After month of work got great news (like everyone else in company) -20% salary starting april. Aaand then company downgraded. Me having 3month contract... was an easy choice.
Summer '20 fun with searching for a job during pandemic. Yay me! Luckily got one starting august. In uni field and also got reenlisted to finish degree. Qh and work is monday-friday delegation. I'm going back to my parents place for weekend's.
So here I'm lost. With next to nothing going in life except time demanding job, music, some manga/webtoon, rare tv series and loneliness. Also some subpar photography.*"

That is some of the work I want to find, something visionary to help the performance of computing or creating tools that scientists need for physics or astronomy would be awesome. Out of all the classes that I took Operating Systems and Networks were definitely the best, so interesting how Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson and Brian just visualize building the Shell! And the networks class that taught me how from creating the OSI model has made the foundation of all networks in general. So this is the type of work I would like to look for however I know I am not even as half as brilliant as these scientists were but it is something that I would be passionate about."

Some questions, to illustrate the things that I'm unsure of:

1. Are all of the jobs on the West coast and in Austin, Tx?
2. Are we under/over producing semiconductor PhD's? Will it be ""easy"" to get a job, assuming COVID effects are diminished by then?
3. What can I do (other than general suggestions like network/build a project portfolio) do to accelerate my career in semiconductors?

lk3qgn,1,2021-02-14,Illegal unpaid internship in NYC,Awkward_Command6827,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lk3qgn/illegal_unpaid_internship_in_nyc/,"Overall question after you read everything: Is this illegal? Should I get a legal aide? Any tips on the next plan of action?

Background:

I graduated college in spring 2019 and moved back to NYC. I found this research lab internship on Indeed in Fall of 2019 and applied. I was interviewed and the VP of this company knew that I graduated and asked if I could come in 5 days a week. I said no. I was hired as a research lab intern and we agreed 3 days a week, unpaid, and I would be in a lab working on cannabis skincare research and lotus skincare research with the MD PhD working there. There was no contracts, only a verbal agreement. I only stayed for 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

At the internship:

The first thing I noticed first week in, there were no paid employees around except the VP and the Doctor. The VP was making money off the sales of the skincare products. The Doctor was under contract with another company to conduct research with certain ingredients. The VP and the Doctor was barely there tbh. When I was being trained by another unpaid intern, we both worked in the office more than we did in the lab. When I was in the lab, I was producing skincare for sale on Macy's, Shopify, etc. If I wasn't creating the product for sale, I was fulfilling orders, helping to hire more unpaid interns, or being an assistant. I literally went to the UPS store to drop off packages almost every day I went. I never touched anything research-related except the lotus-cream that was made. I was doing QA on the different batches of lotus cream on my face when I didn't even know what went into it (one batch dried out my face). The VP of the company made many promises like I will hire you in 4 months and you will get paid, we are going to Dubai in 2020, and we are working on cannabis creams that you will be part of the research team. Honestly, I should've seen the red flags. The VP also tried to recruit me as a sales person 2 months into my internship and I would get commission off of it. At the time of my internship, she only paid for my transportation 2.5 months into the internship. I got a check for transportation $100 a month (check says transportation) with the grand total of $300 or so for my time there. She also told us to take skincare products home and stated that's our compensation (I threw mine out because the lab we made it in is not a proper lab and I'm not putting it on my face). Other interns did not choose to file a complaint and that's not my concern.

&amp;#x200B;

Now:

I filed a complaint to the Labor Division about the free labor to manufacture the products for sales and small claim against the VP of the lab to compensate me for my time there. Most of the interns in the lab were not in college. She also tried to intimidate me and sent an email saying she's filing for damages. I'm not worried because she had said the exact same thing to another intern who left earlier than me. She was also stated in an email that she did compensate me for my time. The day I left, one unpaid intern who was there longer than I was, was blackmailed by the VP in-person saying she would not write the intern a recommendation letter for leaving abruptly. Obviously this is he said she said and she immediately denied it in her emails. But, I literally have texts, emails, post-it notes of her admitting that the interns were running her business and she tried to ask us to go in on weekends to produce product for her. I also reached out to an old intern, and this ex-intern told me that the VP was alerted about the rules she'd have to follow hiring unpaid interns. We have a mediation meeting coming up, but I have my doubts on the VP. She already pushed that day back by a few weeks and I have a feeling she is going to again."

I'm currently a freshman at a top university (not Berkeley or Stanford, but still great) majoring in CS and I was thinking about attempting to apply for internships for the summer before my sophomore year. Also, I know that the larger companies already had their cycle, so I was hoping for smaller startups/companies that may be open to less experienced candidates like I.

Some background about myself would be that I did some basic front-end work for some smaller orgs/business as a high school senior. I don't really have any shiny polished projects (some GUI apps, basic web apps, etc) and I only know the basics of Data Structures and Algos (self-taught). So far I have been through a intro data structures class, know the basics of Java/Python/JS/HTML/CSS and some frameworks I used to build apps. I also know basic Git if that even matters. My DS &amp; A class is next year, so I guess I would be going in without a formal education on the topic.

Since I have literally ZERO knowledge of what goes into this job search process, I was hoping I could look for some guidance on how to start. I know freshman have a much lower chance of success, but either way I would be getting experience of the whole process.

Thanks for your time!"

Turns out that UW makes sure you're really good at it in order to study it, which I was not.

So now I'm studying Finance &amp; Math, I like it a lot, but now I don't know what exactly I'm going to end up doing for a career, but I at least know for certain I can get my degree which is nice.

I want to work in FinTech eventually, I think that overlap would work nicely for me (and I'm really passionate about both fields), but I don't know exactly how I'm gonna get there. I think trying to get a good GPA and a few internships in that direction will be a good start.

I see people with History &amp; English degrees who are doing completely unrelated things to their majors (like software sales and technical recruiting at FAANG), and it amazes me to see how diverse what you end up working in can be.

It's reassuring, but at the same time I'm nervous because I don't really know where I'm gonna end up. I'm lucky to have be blessed with a financially stable family so I won't have debt and a 'backup' plan if needed, but I really want to find my own path to success.

How about you guys? Change of plans since coming to UW? Plans for the future? Not sure?"

Its already been a month since I started my internship and I am having a troubles already.

My team told me about the coding rules they follow but I still missed some stuff. I am not really inclined for a programming oriented IT job (want to go into SOC/NOC roles.) but I try to do my best and try to do as I'm told and in time.

I am pretty bad when it comes to communication. I always feel that I am not able to put down my point or explain to the other person what's in my head. I'm working on it. I don't know how organizational communication works in India or how is it different from normal communication. I always fear that if I disagree with my manager it could be grounds for dismissal. It sometimes leads me to nodding even when I don't understand what he just said. I just try to figure it out later. I just search on reddit or quora about what to do in certain situations and do whatever fits best.

I'm afraid that my manager won't recommend me for a full time position once I complete the term of my internship. Should I start looking for another job ?"

lkbjoc,4,2021-02-15,Career alternatives for software developers?,Tzimpo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lkbjoc/career_alternatives_for_software_developers/,"Are there any good career alternatives for software engineers? Or other fields that would be easier to grasp/study?  
I am a junior software developer (having 1.5 years of experience) and I feel very oppressed having to sit on a desk for 9 hours a day. I work on the back-end mostly coding in python, and have tried working for 3 different companies (1 internship, 1 year in a start up and now I am in a well established company). Even though I like solving problems, maybe this kind of antisocial job is not for me. The feeling of creating something new or fixing a bug is great, but it feels like I am a well paid bird in a cage.    


Any others that share these thoughts? How did you surpass them?"

I live in Europe and I will be graduating from a highschool specialized in IT and Engineering this summer.

For now I have really good grades but I lack strong ECs (pretty hard to found a club etc. where I'm at and I just don't have time after 45+ hours of school every week).

I did 3 summer internships at some big IT companies, had some high placings in my state at Math competitions, went to some summer camp dealing with AI and I have been playing the piano for 8 years. Other than that and good grades I don't have to offer any leading roles or similar things. 

I will be taking the SAT in March but I don't know if I should even bother applying to top schools. 

Do you have suggestions for ECs I can do until fall that could boost my application?"

 I’m an attorney that’s been practicing for 6 years. And I can’t take it anymore. I want to do something that’s always fascinated me: Cybersecurity.  I think what I’m seeking is more Infosec than not, but I have my unicorn list of vague picture of what I want to do:
-network security or really any program security;
- finding &amp; curing breach or system failure
-likely need to be versed in the different os structures and coding languages 

Problem: I have 0 background. Just a liberal arts and law degree. No courses, certs, internships, language, coding, etc. But I’m eager to learn and not averse to having to take a bunch of classes or try to get another degree - what kind unknown -  and doing whatever I need to do to.

QUESTIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: What do you all recommend? What do I need to do to get into this world? How do I get to where I want to go? Do I need to get another degree?  Courses and certs? What kind? I know I have A LOT to learn. 

Thank you to all you heroes who respond. Eternally indebted. Saving a life.

EDIT: I want you wonderful humans to know that I am grateful for the frankness and pragmatism of your responses. If it seems as if I’m not, ignore it and know that I truly respect the insight and wisdom, and anything that you think I should know.  The hard truths are the most sincere and helpful. I really have no idea of the best way to begin an education formal or informal, and deeply dig the advice on the foundational things I need."
lkejt2,98,2021-02-15,Bad at CS major,EpicureanRascal,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lkejt2/bad_at_cs_major/,"I’m a third year CS major and really freaking bad at it; probably averaging a C+. I really liked it; when I first stumbled upon it I thought I had found my path. But it’s been a year of the major and I’m struggling, hard.

I’ve had trouble with “logical thinking” ever since middle school. I literally remember my chem and math teachers saying those exact words to me on separate occasions; that my thinking is scattered and disorganized. And I’m like, yeah, okay, how the heck do I change the way I think? And this messiness of thought leaks into my code; I put a function here, and a function there, and soon everything is a bunch of spaghetti. I’ve tried to change my thought process and get better at math/science all through middle and high school to no avail. I got good grades just by out-working everybody (I did *not* just sail through without studying and could never fathom how people did that), but now in college everyone is really freaking smart *and* hard working.

On the other hand, I’ve always excelled at the humanities and social sciences. And I \*love\* those fields; any part of those fields - anthropology, history, sociology, english, all of it. I’d do it in my free time. I’ve literally had teachers ask me about plagiarism on my work because my writing was really high quality. I’m not trying to brag or anything; I’m just trying to explain the way my brain works.

But the job market has never been bleaker for those without STEM degrees, and I know people land up in careers unrelated to their majors. Also, I can’t pick up another major or switch so late in my school life. And grad school is probably out of the question with my grades, even in the humanities/social sciences (which really sucks). I still like CS, but the constant failure is awful and I’m getting burnt out. I still haven’t got an internship and idk if I’ll succeed in a career if I still pursue it. I’m completely lost. What do I do?

Edit: Wow, y'all, everybody has amazing advice and it's exactly what I needed. It's especially nice to know that others have been in the same situation and came through it. I'll read this all when I have more time and consider everything carefully, and I hope others benefit from this post as well. Thanks so much."

I am trying to find a job that pertains to something I would be interested in mainly cyber security is my specialty (I'm not going to tell you about my AF job.) But a normal desk job in a 9-5 where I physically cannot be harmed or excitement is not a huge part of the job, actually bores me to my very core and makes me think I'd hate my life I have chosen. I'm not sure if the military makes me think this way, but ""normal"" desk jobs with high pay have literally driven me to boredom. I hate them. I would like to work at CIA, FBI, or something within the military just for this specific reason even though with my certs,(Sec+, net+) a 5 level TS SCI clearance and a solid 3.5 GPA for a STEM major at a top school, I cannot get a single internship I apply for. I already work for the government so I feel they would be the only ones to want me at this point. So I guess dual question. First, is my first opinion normal to some of you? (or anyone in the vet community that has served awhile). Secondly What jobs are available like this to fresh out the gate college students with military experience and the certs? Internships wont take me and I am assuming its my gpa or resume on linked in? If anyone could help out that would be great. Thank you all!

&amp;#x200B;

Update : I am a 22yr Male that has had plenty of experience as well, And have been manager of a few different stores in retail. However my only experience when it comes to cyber security that I can put on paper is for the Air Force. I am positive that wouldn't hurt my chances but make them better but I cannot see what is holding me back from companies. I have applied to several. probably around the 25 ish range of companies."

lkjwsm,1,2021-02-15,I just think I‘ll never be able to have a fulfilling life,eemsorrymom,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lkjwsm/i_just_think_ill_never_be_able_to_have_a/,"I‘m currently making my first work experience in form of an internship. The internship takes place in a city far away from my hometown which means that I have to live without my parents for the first time and I struggle in pretty much every aspect. 

I constantly make mistakes at my internship and I can feel my coworkers slowly losing patience with me. 
It’s beyond humiliating at this point how many times a coworker had to explain something to me and I still didn’t understand it. 
Sometimes I just say that I understood it and I can tell that they know I‘m lying but they don’t even care anymore and are just glad they can go back to their work (and I don’t blame them for that). 
Some coworkers are actually nice to me which is why I feel even worse that I‘m too useless to help them in any meaningful way. 

I‘m also extremely socially awkward which makes it impossible for me to better get to know my coworkers so I‘d feel more comfortable at office. 
Recently I was taking to a coworker and while I was talking I got so nervous that I started hitting myself on my thigh without even noticing. 

When I get back to my apartment (which I haven’t cleaned in weeks now) I feel lonely. No one is waiting there for me. No boyfriend, no friends. I have 2-3 friends (just lost a really good friend this weekend btw.) with who I talk but I can tell that they too are slowly starting to get tired of me. 

I‘m scared of falling asleep at night. I constantly feel like I‘m about to get a heart attack or someone is standing in front of my apartment waiting to kill me which is why I keep a knife under my bed. 

My friends constantly tell me that I‘m not as useless as I think I am and I really appreciate the positivity they try to deliver but I know they’re wrong. 
By now I crave someone to be brutally honest with me and to just tell me how useless, awkward, fat and ugly I am. 

My current situation is not the only reason why I feel just horrible but it is thanks to the internship that I realised how shit my life is once I‘m alone. 

Sorry for this messy vent- I just had to get it off my chest."

lkkoje,0,2021-02-15,Help Deciding Between Amazon and Roblox Internships,nrocketmann,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lkkoje/help_deciding_between_amazon_and_roblox/,"I currently have internship offers from Amazon and Roblox for the summer of 2021. I'm leaning toward accepting Roblox and turning down Amazon right now, but I would greatly appreciate advice from people who are more familiar than I with this process or who know something I don't about working at these companies. Thanks in advance for your advice! Details below:

I am currently a sophomore in college majoring in Math and CS. I'll most likely be graduating in spring 2023, so I have one more internship-worthy summer ahead of me. I have a strong interest in machine learning and have worked for 2 startups and 1 larger company in that field in the last 4 years. In the future, I hope to work in industry but also likely go to grad school, as I believe it is hard to pursue a career in ML without a graduate degree.

Roblox Offer: 3 month Data Science position. Location is virtual, so there is only a small housing stipend and I can work from wherever (home or an apartment somewhere). Pay is hourly and comparable to Amazon. Pros: I think there's a better chance I'll get to work in ML, supposedly Roblox has a great work culture, and the pay is the same as a bigger company like Amazon. Cons: Less prestige than Amazon.

Amazon Offer: 3 month software development engineer (SDE) position. The location is TBD, likely Seattle though. The housing stipend is quite substantial but the pay (salaried) is somewhat less than Roblox with a 40 hour work week, so with the stipend, it works out to be about the same. Pros: prestige, potential rehire offer out of college, and learning to work in software at the largest scale. Cons: Less of a chance I will be able to work on ML (when I asked, they said ""projects are assigned to interns based on business needs only""), probably less interesting work overall, poorer work environment (maybe?), and Amazon is also not exactly the ethical cream of the crop.

I'm looking forward to hearing the community's thoughts. Thank you!"

Essentially, I’ve been looking through internships and have been thinking of applying to them but I just don’t feel like I’m good enough. I’ve done graphic design for several years, fluent in Adobe suite applications, figma, and other graphic design applications. I’ve created react web application for a businesses and am a tech. Lead in a program created in partnership with my university. I understand and know how to use React Node Less Axios JavaScript Java Html/css GraphQL PostgreSQL . Utilized them on a few projects on my GitHub like a weather app/ crypto tracker and my own portfolio website. However I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not good enough or that I’m behind in some sort of way. I’ve heard about imposter syndrome but I’m not sure if that applies to me as I don’t even have a job or internship yet. Any tips on how to shake this feeling and/or if I should spent the next year working on my skills and projects before I apply?"
lkl04q,0,2021-02-15,Currently a senior in high school. What could I be doing to get a head start? What should I be doing during my freshman year of college?,nerfedcookiez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lkl04q/currently_a_senior_in_high_school_what_could_i_be/,"Title sums it up. I have a decent amount of free time nowadays, and when I scroll through this subreddit I can't help but feel behind. I know I'm not even in college yet, but I still feel like I could be doing something useful with my time in order to make things easier for me in the future. 

It's worth mentioning that I have little to no experience regarding computer science. I'm pretty good at math, and I definitely want to work in this field, but I've never coded anything in my life nor do I know what an algorithm or data structure is. That being said, I do have a drive to learn, but I don't really know where to begin.

I would also like to know what I could be doing right now/during my first year of college that would make it easier to get internships in the future. Any help is greatly appreciated."

Their salary is around the same so it doesn't really matter to me and am more concerned with the type of work I'd be doing + quality of the internship. I'm leaning towards teradata just because I'll already be doing a fancy big n frontend internship in the spring/early summer and really want to diversify and try out the lower level systems stuff which I've loved doing in school. However, I'm afraid that teradata might be too boomer and the work is irrelevant in which case Flexport seems like the much better option. Could anyone share me their thoughts?"

I graduated CS in 2019 and did an internship during my last year. Then after graduation I worked ft as a SWE for about 10 months and then enrolled into a master's program. Now I am currently in my first semester and also managed to find a job part time as a SWE. Some of my classmates are Indians with &gt;5 YOE a cs degree and a mf master's in the process. 

All of them 30 year old and got to do internships at FANG. No hate towards them ,ofc good for them and congrats as well but I was thinking how am I supposed to compete with that. It seems to me big tech hires interns straight out of Stanford / top 10 schools and the rest are overqualified Individuals that are hired in their 30s with +5 YOE for INTERNSHIPS. WTF 

I have interviewed with some of these FANG companies the past 2 years but I could not crack the on-sites. I have applied for interships / new grad positions at big tech for 5 years in a row ever since college. Now wtf is going on I get that now I might look better on paper but I feel like recruiters sit in front of their screens thinking they are SEO master's looking for interns that have 3 degrees and 10 YOE.

I have been Leetcoding like crazy,I apply to jobs do the interviewes and usually pass them but I don't take the offer because this FANG stuff has become obsessive. Leetcode is becoming toxic every morning and every night I can't do this bs anymore. I guess I am just looking for anyone to give some advice or say smth nice 🤣.

I keep having this feeling that  the best go and work at least in one of these companies so my desire to get there is more in terms of proving I can do it and less about the TC although it would be nice. 

Are there any other people who think they are competing with some crazy standards and almost impossible odds ?"
lkm4yt,0,2021-02-15,Should I expect not to get an offer after failing one of two interview questions?,brandomonjaro,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/lkm4yt/should_i_expect_not_to_get_an_offer_after_failing/," I just finished an interview for a company that I hope to intern for. I practiced coding beforehand but the problems ended up being much simpler than anticipated. The problem is, it used a getline(cin,line) for an input for integers. This threw me off as I'm used to receiving integers for integers, not strings. It was a Fibonacci sequence problem which I did the arithmetic correctly for, it was the fact that I never used a string to return the input. I realized that it was just a conversion to\_string that I had discovered during my second problem which I answered correctly. Do I give up my hopes of landing this internship because of a mistake like not knowing how to convert an integer type to string on my first problem only? or am I worrying too much?"

This may seem like a silly question, but here goes:

How does a software internship at Liberty Mutual, a large insurance company (#77 in Fortune 500) compare to an ""internship alternative"" like Google Summer of Code or MLH Fellowship? I personally think that the internship is definitely better and have already accepted the Liberty Mutual offer, but Google Summer of Code has Google's name attached to it, so what are your opinions?

lkqzya,39,2021-02-15,Panicking about job prospects,tums_festival47,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/lkqzya/panicking_about_job_prospects/,"I only have two semesters left until I graduate with my data science degree. Since I’m a transfer, I came to Berkeley with zero meaningful CS experience, and I’ve had to cram in all of these CS courses for the limited time I have here.

I know I still have time and that I’m not that far along in terms of coursework (I’m currently taking 61b and data 100), but I am extremely doubtful of my prospects for getting an internship while still at Berkeley, and in turn my prospects for getting a SWE job later on. 

Even though I do pretty well in my classes, I feel like transferring here has fucked me. I don’t have any personal projects, no personal website or GitHub, no work experience, a terrible resume, etc. I don’t see any of that changing in the near future, especially since I can’t use my summer to catch up, as I’ll be taking 61c.

To add to that, I feel like a chronic underachiever. Everyone says “you have to take CS170 and CS162,” but these classes scare the shit out of me. I don’t feel like ruining an entire year of my personal life and subjecting myself to such misery and anxiety, even if it’s supposedly good for SWE knowledge. 

All of this ranting has been spurred by my discovery of the interview process for this fall, which just has me feeling utterly hopeless. Everyone else is far more qualified than me, the job market is already terrible, and this is basically my only shot at getting an internship before graduation.

At this point, I think I’ll just finish my degree and see what to do then. ☹️"
lkr3z9,2,2021-02-15,I don't think I am learning enough at school,18dwhyte,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lkr3z9/i_dont_think_i_am_learning_enough_at_school/,"I am currently a junior and I am confused about what developers do based on what I'm learning. I'm fully aware that there are ""different"" types of developers but hear me out...

Background: I spent 2 years at Community College ( I have an associate's in Computer Science) and I'm at university now. If I'm being 100% honest, I can write a command-line app using Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) principles. I took an intro to C++ so I can write very basic code in C++. Although, I can’t do OOP nor DSA in C++ because my school never taught me.

I have looked around multiple subreddits and the general consensus is knowing Leetcode and Projects because you need those two things to get a job. I can't do a project that exists outside of a command-line app, because I don't know enough. Everything I have learned outside of school (Git, Github, HTML, CSS) has all been self-taught and even so, my skills aren't that great because I have been self-taught. I just know the bare-bones. This is why I rely so much on school because there is always someone there to say ""you're doing this right/wrong.""

I would also like advice on what developers/interns do. Something valuable would be appreciated instead of ""I went to meetings."", "" I coded."", "" I learned a lot"" Obviously, you coded and learned but what did you code? What did you develop? What languages did you use? What was expected of you? How long did it take you? Were you asking to do something in a language you weren't familiar with? If so, how long did it take you?  I have severe doubts that I can do an internship with what I know now.

I'm not aiming for FANG, but take [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/654496918442526/?location=Remote%2C%20US&amp;utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&amp;utm_source=google_jobs_apply&amp;utm_medium=organic) for example. They expect you to know Java or C++, plus HTML, CSS, JS, PHP (basically web development, which I haven't been formally taught). But then you look at Reddit or Amazon, it's basically ""know a programming language and DSA."" Will I just be doing Command-Line applications then?

If people are doing boot camps and are being adequately prepared for a developer role, then surely the university should be prepping me, right?"
lkrmyr,1424,2021-02-15,Drug Addict to Big Tech SWE - My Story,tomasina,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lkrmyr/drug_addict_to_big_tech_swe_my_story/,"    Hey guys, I wanted to share my story with the community for inspiration and encouragement. I simplified it as much as possible but it's still pretty long. I hope you enjoy and get something out of it. Happy to answer questions.

I grew up middle to upper-middle class in a small town in the US. There were some issues in my family— divorce, mental illness, etc, but they are good people and I don’t blame them for anything that happened. In school I was “gifted” and got good test scores but never was a great student. I struggled to pay attention and always preferred messing around with my friends and playing video games to studying. I loved computers and technology but never really had a direction. This lack of work ethic would come back to bite me later on. I did the absolute minimum to apply for colleges but ended up getting into a state university because my teachers and parents pushed me (thanks guys).

Around this time I started smoking weed and I loved it. It coincided with me moving away from home, so I could get away with smoking all the time. It was just weed in college after all. Harmless, right? Soon I was smoking multiple times a day and partying on the weekends, not taking school seriously at all. I didn’t even declare a major. I started dabbling in other stuff— Adderall to study, ecstasy and acid at an EDM show, Xanax or Vicodin to chill out. People would express concern about my behavior but I was in denial. My life started falling apart. I flunked out of school. I was always high, always broke, relationships falling apart from my shitty behavior, working shitty jobs to buy drugs first and then pay rent if there was money left over. At some point I got introduced to heroin and that was the beginning of the end.

I descended really quickly into full-blown addiction. I completely destroyed my life, did terrible things to people I cared about. I got a really nasty spine injury while intoxicated and still have the side effects. At one point I almost died from an overdose. I only survived because someone found me in the bathroom. I woke up in an ambulance. I was totally broken as a person, facing homelessness, living off food stamps. It was by far the worst time of my life and I won’t say any more about it.

Eventually I asked for help and spent a year bouncing in and out of treatment, community support groups, etc and eventually managed to get sober. Happy to go more in depth on how I did it but it was a lot of work as well as help from other people in my life.

I reached out to the school I flunked out of and ended up talking to a dean. I told him my story and he helped me get back in. I was broke but loans, grants, and cheap in-state tuition came through for me. At one point I had three part-time jobs in addition to my classes. I picked engineering since I could get a 4-year degree and start making money right away, but switched to computer science because it was fun and I couldn’t get into the engineering program due to my shit GPA. I am very, very glad I switched to CS.

It was hard trying to stay sober and go to school and work and learn how to program in my mid-20s. At one point I slipped up and relapsed, but I again reached out to the people around me for help and got back on track. I was fat and lonely and wanted to date, so I started working on my fitness, learning to dress better, putting myself out there on dating apps— these are other things I’m very glad I did. All this shit sucked and I was unhappy but I kept going. It’s not like I had a better option. My classes were hard but I kept trying and gradually built up my work ethic. Through persistent effort I started to do well in school for the first time. I was making friends, I lost weight and found some sports I really enjoyed, and I was even going on dates.

Eventually I went to a career fair and found out you were supposed to get an internship. What? I applied for a few and got demolished in the single interview I had. I took classes over the summer instead. The next year I went to the career fair and went to literally every table. I failed the interviews cause I still didn’t know what I was doing but I followed up via email on my prospects and found a program where someone had dropped out and they needed a replacement. Nice! This was my big break. They hired me with almost no interview.

I was absolutely terrible in my internship, working with kids way younger than me who somehow were way smarter than me, but I kept showing up. I built relationships with my coworkers and they let me work part-time during the school year and full-time in the summer my last two years of school. Not because I was some bright shining talent but because I showed up reliably and was pleasant to be around. I was never any good but I learned a lot and earned enough money to stop taking out loans (huge win).

The fall before my graduation I knew a lot more about the job market and what interviews were like. I got a book on coding interview prep and practiced as much as I could. I went to every job fair and found every new grad hiring program I could online. I applied and got a ton of rejections— but also a ton of interviews. I ended up graduating with 8 job offers. Most of them were for smaller companies in my state but one of them was at a big coastal tech company with comp in the mid six figures. I seriously could not believe it and accepted.

Life has been fantastic since then. I’m over five years sober from drugs and booze and engaged to be married to a great person (and a doctor!) I have a job I enjoy that can be challenging and stressful but is ultimately very rewarding. I work on cool technology with people I respect and learn from. I like where I am but I keep my skills sharp in case the time comes for me to move to a different company. I never would have thought I would have this lifestyle or earn this kind of money— more than any of my friends or family and I’m still very early in my career. One thing I absolutely cannot forget is that every day is a choice to keep working and doing what I need to do to keep my life on track. It would be so easy to fuck it up and go back to where I was.

Lessons learned:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fix your problems. If you have something wrong in your life, mental illness, toxic relationship, addiction, family issues, whatever, get it under control however you can. Sometimes that means separating yourself from people that are messing your life up. Once your life is in order, everything else will fall into place.
2. Do whatever it takes. I had to desperately seek recovery to get and stay sober. It had to be my top priority and I barely made it. But I did it. When I applied this to other parts of my life such as fitness and my career, those took off as well. Learn computer science fundamentals (data structures and algorithms). Practice coding problems— they will make you smarter and the best jobs will test your knowledge in interviews. I’ve seen people on this sub make all kinds of excuses why they don’t do this, but let’s be honest, it’s just laziness. You can do it. Keep working at it until you get where you want to be. We have it easier than pretty much any other profession.
3. Be a three-dimensional person. Take care of your body— it’s meant to move and not to sit in front of a screen all day. If you’re overweight, learn how calories work and fix it. Find hobbies you can get into and relate to other people about. Video games don’t count. Pick something interesting. Side projects are fine but you need to have a life outside of tech. I have made a lot of friends through my hobbies. Learn to present yourself well. Dress well, practice good hygiene, develop social skills. Don’t be a stereotypical smelly weirdo nerd. All of this is learnable. I was a fucking creature when I first got sober and now I am a well-rounded member of society.  
**edit**: An addition to this one is pick a high-quality news source such as New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Economist and pay for a subscription. Keep up to date on what's going on in your country and the world so you can talk to others and be part of it. Learn to differentiate between news, opinion pieces, and toxic bullshit that gets shared on social media. Having a political opinion is good but stay away from extremes.
4. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. I was poisoned by self-pity but the truth is, life is hard and unfair. No one is going to fix your problems for you. And yes, some people are born lucky and everything just falls into their laps. If you want to have a great life you need to go out and build it piece by piece. Let go of your entitled bullshit and accept that you’re going to have to struggle and do things you don’t want to in order to grow and be happy.
5. Drugs and booze and other vices— many people are able to do these things occasionally and function fine. I am not one of them. You need to be honest with yourself about this. If you go to a party once every few weeks, you’re probably ok. If you’re smoking weed every day, sorry to tell you but you might have a drug problem. Cut that shit out. It will only hold you back. If you are an addict like me the only option is to stop completely. Resources are out there to help you stop.
6. Don’t live in the past— I can never take back all the pain I caused, the bad choices I made, the injury I got. All I can do is try to make it right and do my best to do better going forward.
7. Anything is possible. I quit heroin and came back from death. I am a mediocre engineer but very successful because I keep trying. You don’t have to be born special to kick ass, it just takes hustle.

**TLDR:** Started doing drugs, stopped with enormous difficulty, went to school, hustled hard, got a great job"

I already sent an update for an history internship I got recently just before the decision was released but that’s it. Admittedly my stats are that competitive, at least compared to their standard, however I think what has set me apart are my ECs. However, nothing much is really happening on that front for me at the moment. So I guess I’m designated to running a LOCI. But I’m not really sure what to say. Since summer of last year I have shown continued interest in the school; I applied to their fly-in program(I didn’t get in) and they were the only school I applied ED to, but I guess I don’t really know how put that in a letter without sound desperate I guess? Any advice would be greatly appreciated..

 TL; DR: what should I write or put in my LOCI to a school I was deferred from but have shown continued interest in?"

Because of it I have trust issues as well as well as abandonment issues. I was made fun of a lot, teased, bullied. So now I have social anxiety and depression. 

I’m currently live in a toxic household. (My mom being the toxic one) and I wanna get out but it’s been hard finding work bc I’ve never had a real job outside of internships for schools. I’m on SSI and I only get $783 a month so not a livable wage and not enough to get an apartment. 

I’m in school and I’m graduating soon but since it’s a pandemic I’m not hopeful finding a job will be easy. I also have a small online business where I sell lipgloss and jewelry but sales have significantly declined for the last 6 months and after trying to get it back on track nothing is working and I’m ready to give up. I can’t keep putting money into my business if no ones buying anything and I just want to give up.

 I have 2 good friends but sometimes I feel like a burden to them. To the point were I think nobody wants to be friends with me which sends me down a deeper rabbit hole. Sometimes I wonder if the people I’m not friends with even care that I’m not friends with them anymore. They never tried to reconnect with me or reach out I was always the one putting in effort which makes me feel like no one really wants to be around me and that they feel obligated to be my friend. 

Dating is hard, I get ghosted time after time. Some guys take one look at me and leave without a trace. Some stuck around to be nice but then never her from them again. Never had a long term relationship. I’ve had sexual partners but hardly nothing more. 

TL;DR

I find myself constantly comparing myself to others and it’s weighing hard on me. I find it hard to take a break from social media bc I like to stay informed and even harder to detach from my phone because I’m looking out for jobs to call. 

I am in therapy through my university but I’m beginning to feel he’s not as effective as he was a couple years ago.

I’m currently working for the company my dad owns (small software consulting company, just a few developers). I do database development work, QA stuff, interacting with clients, and some small programming projects here and there to make our jobs easier.

This job is great, but I don’t want to work for my father forever and want to find work elsewhere once I graduate. I don’t have any internships under my belt, and only currently have this work experience to show. I have a GPA of 3.4 which I believe is decent, but also have read that it doesn’t make too much of a difference to employers.

Here are my questions:

1. How do I go about talking about this work experience of mine? Do I mentioned that it’s my father’s business, or just not mention it? I’m unsure if it damages the validity of the work experience in the eyes of employers since it’s family.

2. Would this experience be decent / help me get a different job after graduation? Or would this do little to help? 

3. Would it be best if I got an internship this Summer instead of continuing to work this job?

I also want to note that I don’t feel extremely passionate about getting the most impressive/highest paying job right out of college. I do like where I am for now, but am concerned with how to go about talking about this work experience / if it’ll actually help in my job hunt.

Thank you to anyone who replies with their insight; it is much appreciated."
lkurm3,0,2021-02-15,Transitioning to a longer-term career,uhhyikes,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/lkurm3/transitioning_to_a_longerterm_career/,"I'm 26, have had a variety of different shorter stints at jobs, and want to better flesh out some long-term goals/plans

I majored in English and Women's and Gender Studies (not exactly fields known for their job placement opportunities) with a minor in Media Studies (aka I am vaguely familiar with adobe photoshop/premier/etc.) Had some office internships at nonprofits-- mostly working in communications. I never felt challenged or particularly engaged in these roles, and hated doing work like copyediting with a passion.

After college, did a gap year program where I was matched with a non-profit and worked for nearly free (very similar to Americorps). My nonprofit pasteurized and distributed donor breast milk to NICUs, so I spent a lot of my time in a lab. The work was very routine, but I loved being on my feet all day and although I am a quiet person, I did end up warming up to my co-workers. I continued to work there as a full employee after my gap year program, but there was no room for advancement. I was also one of the youngest people there and often felt like my co-workers (who were all literally moms themselves, some with kids around my age) thought of me as one of their kids rather than an autonomous adult on equal footing. 

I soon started work at a law firm, basically ghostwriting letters for clients who needed to get visas to continue STEM research in the United States, often sponsored by companies or universities. I loved my co-workers-- everyone was just a bunch of millennials/zoomers-- but loathed the work itself. I had a lot of difficulty writing letters for clients whose work I couldn't understand or believed was actively immoral. I instead found myself going down internet rabbit holes and reading the work group chat more than the stipulations for my projects. It reminded me of the absolute worst parts of school. After a long period of little constructive criticism, management came down hard on me and I was let go (right at the beginning of covid, of course).

I had a brief role working for a non-profit working to get out the vote. I went door-to-door, canvassing different neighborhoods and asking voters to complete certain action items. Some people absolutely did not want me to be there, but some were astonishingly kind. This job began in July, so I was spending full days walking around in the heat. I would return home absolutely exhausted. This was my favorite job I've had so far. I liked interacting with so many people, working for cause that I believed in, and feeling physically exhausted at the end of the day.

But, with covid, this job was unsustainable. While in the process of transferring this to a phone-only position, I stumbled onto a new role working as a receptionist at an obgyn, largely due to my donor milk processing connections. I've been here for about six months now, and am getting bored. I like (some) of my coworkers and it's always great to talk to people who really appreciate what we do. But the routine has just become so... routine. I don't feel challenged anymore, and there's no way for me to move up in my organization. I also find the office politics here very frustrating-- I have a more direct communication style with my co-workers and that is very much not the culture of my organization. I know I have unintentionally come off as being abrasive and rude when I just didn't feel like beating around the bush 

I've been considering a lot of long-term career paths. Through my work experiences, I know that I want a job where I can work with people directly, where I can be active, and where I believe in the work that I am doing. It would also help if I felt like I was being mentally challenged and fairly compensated for my labor. And, I want to be in a field where I know I can find and keep employment. With all this in mind, I am leaning towards nursing-- but this is only a very recent development. For a long time, I have been considering social work. I even completed 200+ hours of volunteer work with the crisis text line to gain more direct experience (they would also write letters of recommendation for school programs). The trouble with social work is, of course, the compensation. And, with both social work and nursing, I am afraid of coming across as rude while trying to navigate office politics. With nursing, I am afraid of burning out before I even start-- not even making it through school-- the ick factor, and not having a set routine. 

Y'all have advice/opinions?"

I have been in IT for a year and a half now. First 6 months as an IT Intern, the next year as a IT Tech and now I got promoted as a IT Supervisor for a very very small IT department. The only reason I got the promotion was to motivate me to stay at my current company. I also don't supervise anyone, it's just my Director and I and it's always so slow. It's in a small town of around 30k people, in the middle of nowhere. Our CEO hates the cloud and we have everything on premise.

Anyways, working in the cloud has always interested me. I have a strong system administration back ground which includes configuring routers and switches (all cisco), working with our Cisco Firepower firewall, maintaining all our virtual servers through VMware, troubleshooting tickets, using our networking monitoring software. Everything in AD, DNS, GPO's, our backups through Veeam. Well you get the point.

What's a great way to get my foot in the door for a cloud position? Is AWS really superior to all the other cloud certs? In your opinion, besides getting a cert, what makes a really good cloud architect or cloud engineer? I am currently taking a free AWS CCP course through AWS itself and it's so interesting. If AWS, do I go straight for the AWS Solutions Architect or do I get the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner cert first?

Thank you for reading and I hope you guys provide some input! :)"

I keep on having dreams which relate to my work for the past 5 months which resulting me having a horrible sleep quality.

No matter what I mention all if my friend will treat it more like a joke rather than a serious problem. Which resulting  that I always keep my problem to myself.

I mention to my mom that this job is giving me so much stress but she doesn't have experience to deal with the situation that I am currently dealing with.

ll5dpx,41,2021-02-16,Mental burnout at 20 years old,wrappedupinemotion,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ll5dpx/mental_burnout_at_20_years_old/,"The advice I'm looking for is what all you busy folks do to cope with anxiety. Before asking more specifically, I want to give some background.

I started studying engineering at university in 2018, and quickly became a hyper-achiever. I joined a few student organizations, later leading 2 simultaneously as a 1st semester sophomore. I kept near-perfect grades. Over the course of 36 months, I self-published 3 novels. I fit a few internships into my schedule both during semesters and over summers. I was a well-known name on campus in 12 months.

I performed well, but I was not healthy. I didn't exhibit any clear physical or mental health issues, but they were there subliminally. I had friends, but they were all professional/class related. I briefly dated a woman before university, but it quickly fell apart when it turned long-distance (something I haven't made peace with). I am obsessive with goals, and frequently have sleepless nights to meet a homework deadline or get a project done for a club. I was in a bad roommate situation, often feeling high-strung in the place I lived for about a year.

When covid hit, I fell apart. I woke up shivering every day, lost weight, my focus fell off. In one week in May 2020 I had all my finals in a row for a few days, with an interview for a position with a high-profile company the day after. I panicked the whole week.

Since then, the anxiety never left. But I ended up taking an intern position at an electric car company (you can guess who), working 60 hour weeks. This would have been a dream come true otherwise, but the anxiety made every workday a challenge. I let my team know I was going through covid-anxiety, and they completely understood. It has never affected my work directly, but I've thrown up in bathrooms after meetings numerous times, spend some days without eating due to nausea, and have been absolutely wiped out mentally.

I came back to school for the spring, taking a full course load but extending the internship. This means class and homework 3 days a week, working 10 hour days the rest of the week to catch myself up.

The biggest challenge comes this summer - I'm moving temporarily to work for a reusable rocket company (you can guess who), once again, to work 60-70 hour weeks. On top of social anxiety and exhaustion, I'll be worried about moving and performing.

**To be clear, I'm not stressed directly because of covid. I think it just sparked issues that have been hiding for too long.** Currently, even with 7-8 hours of sleep, I'm waking up exhausted every day. I find it hard to smile. It takes me 30 mins to get out of bed. I've had a constant tightness in my chest for about a year now. I've tried making new friends and enjoying myself, but I pretty much melt in social stress with anyone or anywhere unfamiliar. I don't drink or smoke. I tried antidepressants, and cut them off shortly after realizing they were causing loss of sleep. I have 90 days until I fly out and start this new internship.

Before you all ask why I'm taking these insane jobs, please understand I've had my eyes set on these places as dream workplaces since I was 15-16. Going further, the amount of work I've put in to get this far was a huge sacrifice since 2018 for me, pretty much cutting the ""fun"" part of university out for myself in order to go the extra mile. I really do enjoy the work I do in school / at these jobs, but the stress lately has overshadowed that joy. In one sentence, the reason I do this all is because I don't want to let some unaddressed mental health issues get in the way of these things I've been working toward for so long.

**All of you busy people of Reddit, how do you cope with the dread of never-ending work? What advice can you give for someone who has a year or two before they can really address some mental health issues? How do I lose unhealthy work/professional related obsession?**

Thank you all."

Excel Language: English  
Knowledge Level: Intermediate

Please keep in mind that since the final version of those files are going to be uploaded on Sharepoint and used through the Microsoft Teams desktop app, nothing but a formula will work. So I try to avoid as much as possible any macro or VBA scripts which doesn't seem to work with Teams at the moment.

\---

Hello, I don't know if I'm asking this at the right place or not, but at that point I am just exhausted and desperate in finding a solution to what I'm trying to achieve.

Please keep in mind that I am no pro at Excel and I don't have the greatest understanding of most of the logic, terms, symbols and order of implementing formulas and matching them together. So please don't judge me too harshly on this since that's why I am having a hard time finding out the following based on what little knowledge I have.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick description of each files:**

I have 2 workbooks (I linked both files to this post). In ""Book1.xlsx"" I have information concerning the arrival of future employees including their name, employee ID (extracted from the employee's name with a formula), their computer name and other IT related information.""Book2.xlsx"" contains validated information from HR concerning just the person itself which is not all useful to know in ""Book1.xlsx"".

""Book1.xlsx"" is organized by months (name of each worksheets) that represents the actual whole year in which we could possibly have up to 300 employees listed by sheet. Each of the sheets containing the same range of data have been converted to tables. Its also worth noting that in some cases, a name could repeat itself multiple times anywhere in ""Book1.xlsx"" or ""Book2.xlsx"" since an employee might be hired more than once such as an intern or a freelancer throughout the year.

""Book2.xlsx"" isn't organized whatsoever and just lists the entire selection of newcomers at the office.

&amp;#x200B;

**Situation:**

Say ""John Doe"" starts working next week and I fill out the information of his arrival in ""Book1.xlsx"" based on the info from ""Book2.xlsx"". I eventually will type the name of a computer in the designated column on the same row. In ""Book2.xlsx"" I would like to show the name of that computer, or whatever is written in that cell in a column for HR to see. But since there might be more than 1 ""John Doe"", I intend to search and find him using his unique employee ID instead.

Now say his employee ID is 3456, and that I've entered the information anywhere in the ""January"" worksheet of ""Book1.xlsx"". In ""Book2.xlsx"" I have a column for the computer name in which I want to XLOOKUP for the employee ID in cell A2, look for its last entry at that moment in any month (worksheet) in ""Book1.xlsx"" under the employee ID column and then return the corresponding value in the computer name column for that employee ID.

Since hiring the same employee twice in the same year is possible (such as an intern or freelancer), the full name and employee ID for that same person might be added more than once elsewhere in ""Book1.xlsx"" under a different month (worksheet). So getting the value returned under the computer name column at that point in time is important for comparison purposes for instance. If for example John Doe was hired on January 10th 2021, a computer was than assigned to him before his arrival, lets say that computer was MTL-AB123. Time passes by, John leaves the office for whatever reasons and is hired back again on March 28th 2021. Its likely a new computer will be assigned to him at that point in time and so we write down the name of that new computer under the same column, MTL-AB133.

In ""Book2.xlsx"", I want to return the last value found at the moment it was filled out in ""Book1.xlsx"" to keep a record of every possible computers that have once been assigned to a single user for future reference and so I wonder if a timestamp would be necessary or not since the only information that can help differentiate those entries in both files is the hiring date.

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution:**

So far, I've managed to find a few methods that kind of pulls out that trick for the VLOOKUP function making use of the INDRECT, INDEX, MATCH and COUNTIF functions and the best one I came upon is this one: [https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2020/02/12/vlookup-multiple-sheets-excel-examples/](https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2020/02/12/vlookup-multiple-sheets-excel-examples/) (scroll down to the part thats about ""vlookup multiple sheets between workbooks"")

The problem here is that I have a hard time understanding what I am looking at, how it works, how to implement that formula in my file and make it work.

For example, here's the raw formula from that link I think might work with a few tweaks:

**=IFNA(VLOOKUP($A2, INDIRECT(""'\[Book1.xlsx\]"" &amp; INDEX(Lookup\_sheets, MATCH(1, --(COUNTIF(INDIRECT(""'\[Book1.xlsx\]"" &amp; Lookup\_sheets &amp; ""'!$A$2:$A$6""), $A2)&gt;0), 0)) &amp; ""'!$A$2:$C$6""), 2, FALSE), ""Not found"")**

&amp;#x200B;

**Confusion:**

That is where the confusion strikes me, I do not understand how to interpret most of that formula in my situation. I get that the indirect function is used to reference my range of months (worksheets) in ""Book1.xlsx"", but this example doesn't specify where the range that needs indexing is located at and in what worksheet within my workbook. I do have a list of months already prepared in ""Book1.xlsx"" under the ""Selection Range"" worksheet, but I do not understand if my range of sheets need to be listed in either ""Book1.xlsx"" or ""Book2.xlsx"" and in what order to apply these functions so that the formula seeks to find and match the value in ""Book1.xlsx"" and only return the last entry (in terms of chronological order by month) found at the actual moment in the workbook so that it doesn't change in the future if ever the same user is hired twice and we build a new computer afterward for that same person.

Could someone give me a hand with this as soon as possible please? I need a working solution as this will solve quite a few of the problems I currently have.

Thank you!

Here is the fifty-first installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

ll9etn,3,2021-02-16,Sometimes I get so sick of working in tech,GingerCatto,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ll9etn/sometimes_i_get_so_sick_of_working_in_tech/,"Hi, 

I am a 23 years old software developer I, graduated from University in 2020, and I have been working with the same team for almost a year now. 
I am extremely grateful to be able to get an intern offer and then transferred as full time in the middle of a PaNdeMic, but sometimes I get sick of working in tech as a junior software developer too. 

- My mentor assiged me ticket she didn’t want to work on when I was an intern. 


When I started working at the current company as an intern, I did not get enough training I needed. The tech stack and architecture is completely different from what a fresh grad is used to, but I worked really hard by looking at past pull requests and learn things on the fly. Three months in to the job, my mentor started throwing tickets requiring high level of debugging skills that he/she didn’t want to work on. 
My team was suffering from performance issues and my mentor had already worked on the ticket, but then he/she couldn’t find the root cause so he/she closed it, created another ticket with different title but pretty much the same thing as the previous ticket. He/She then assigned the ticket to me. 
Luckily I was able to find the root cause after struggling for 25 days, but it really sucked all my energy and trust out. 

- Tech lead and I created pull requests with the exact same change, but only questions mine. 


Different issue but it’s also a performance bug. My tech lead implemented the fix for one of the services, we observed it in production for around a month, and decided to implement the fix to other services. Tech lead’s PR was merged successfully with no comment, fix went all the way to production, fixed the bug. 
I worked on the performance fix for other services, but a person commented on my PR and asked so many questions despite the PR was literally the same as the one my tech lead created, that same person approved my tech lead’s PR before and left 0 comment and questions. 
Why didn’t you ask the questions when my tech lead created the PR? 
Why do you only question my PR? 

- A dev (SDE II) in my team picked up a ticket to work on, but he doesn’t know how to implement the test, and then he decided to take a few days off and threw the ticket to me. 


“I'am going to take a few days off, I was wondering if you could take the PSR story I was going to work on?
That one is important for the current spring”

This is the reason I gradually get so sick of working in tech. I don’t know SHIT either but I ask questions, work extra hours to figure shit out. Why do people throw things they don’t want to work on at me? Why do people only question my code? Is it because I’m SDE I?

ll9kv9,5,2021-02-16,So is this a pessimistic echo chamber or..?,SexyDiscoJesus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ll9kv9/so_is_this_a_pessimistic_echo_chamber_or/,"Is the CS job market actually this bad?

I'm currently a university student studying CS/Math and you guys are really making me question my life choices. From everything I've heard in real life the CS market seems pretty healthy, but from what I'm getting from this place it sounds like a dystopian nightmare where you have to grind leetcode for 70 hours a week and have a finished app that makes $1,500,000 a year to get an entry level position.

My intuition says that this is probably not an accurate reflection of reality, but what do you guys think? I honestly just want a decent position at a small-ish company in my native land of Missouri. I have no aspirations for FAANG (sorry I don't want to work for evil Inc.) and my most outrageous career aspiration is to do small team game development. I plant to graduate with a bachelors, maybe go for a masters in artificial intelligence if I'm feeling kinky. I have yet to find an internship yet but I'm less than halfway through.

Should I pull out of the field now and switch to something with a suicide rate below 120%? Or perhaps is CS not actually that bad?"

Recently looking through job postings there were a couple internships from said university that had been posted that of which I all applied for. Some were for Data science/SWE and there was also a QA role. Which I had interviewed and got the offer from.

So, my question is it career suicide to pick up this QA role while I'm still in school? Browsing through the subreddit everyone here makes it seem like you'll have an extremely difficult time going from QA to SWE. 

Overall, this maybe completely temporary as I told management that I would eventually like to move up to a dev spot if it ever opens up. However, I don't know if it's one of those situation where a job is better than no job."

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
1200 - 2400 USD
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
No
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Performance -&gt; Build Quality -&gt; battery life
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Not important
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
Would love to have at least 15 inches, but I use a second monitor as my main screen so it is not a deal breaker. 
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
I will be programming with Python and C/C++ for personal projects. I mainly just use VScode. I am currently getting into Deep Learning, but from what I've learned, there is no laptop that can really handle the data computations and most of the work will be done over some cloud platform. I plan to have 2000 chrome tabs open all while doing anything and of course YouTube will always be on my second screen. I didn't plan to play games on it because I had planned to get another macbook pro, but that is no longer case and I am open to anything (including another macbook). I plan to get a PS5 because of games like God of War so again gaming is not necessary for it, but it would be nice to have as an option (currently have a ps4 that gets the job done or me).
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
fortnite, Battlefield, Red Dead Redemption (again, I plan to get a PS5 because of God of War so gaming is not necessary, but would be nice)
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
I love my current keyboard on my Macbook pro late 2013, but to be honest I dont really know what is good or bad so whatever you all recommend here I will be happy with. I also use use an external keyboard when I set it up with a dual monitor so it is not too important. 
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
   * I am about to graduate with a computer science degree. I have one term left, which will be fall. I am going to be doing an internship during spring-summer. My new laptop will no longer really be for school, but just personal use. My current MacBook pro late 2013 with Retina(13 inch) just died. The battery just died and I guess Apple designed the battery and CPU to work together somehow because now it needs to be plugged (obviously), but it stays at 1% and the CPU is at 95%+ to perform any task. Its basically a computer before operating systems came out. The laptop is 7+ years old and it would cost around 350-400 to fix, so I think maybe its just about time to upgrade.
   * I have an iphone, ipad, and airpods. I do love how everything syncs with one another. I can listen an video on my ipad with airpods and then pull it up on my macbook or iphone and  the airpods just know to connect. Apple knows what they are doing when it comes to lifestyle products and I love it. Air dropping documents from one device to another is fast and easy. The terminal in my macbook made my programming so easy when I first got started and I am used to the commands. It seems macs or programmer friendly.
   * Final note,  I grew up poor and my parents always bought the cheapest products because it is all they could afford. The PC I had growing up was slow and this could be a reason I fell in love with apple, because it was the first high quality product and all my experiences with PCs were cheap products. 
   * I do not need to get the new laptop today, just within the next 3 months."

I got my BS in Cybersecurity, last may 2020 and graduated with honors, during college I only had one major project(software engineering course) and one internship(Dev team at a startup). Since then I have applied to numerous jobs in NYC and have never gotten an interview. I’ve acknowledged that my one internship wasn’t suffice and that I should’ve had at least 2-4 during undergraduate but they’re were no Cybersecurity internships where I went to school. So now I am getting my Masters at NYU in Cybersecurity. I have decided to go for internships due to not having 2-3 years of experience. So far  I failed 2 interviews and was told I was overqualified for 2 other internships. At this point I feel lost and have ultimately no idea what to do. I just got my security+ certification and am looking at other certifications to get as well to see if that improves my chances. I don’t know anyone in my field really. I’ve been scripting everyday, coding in python, practicing leetcode, reading as many articles on top of my classes. At this point what else should I do or what route should I take? My goal is to get a job in Cybersecurity before I complete my masters in the Fall of 2022."

I realized late into college I really like CS, not business, and would like to continue learning it. I have $28k of student loan debt and the price of OMSCS is extremely attractive, but I’m unsure if it’s out of my league. I know Python and JS the best, familiar with Java, and very limited experience with C. 

My work has a tuition reimbursement of $5250/year and $25000 lifetime, with a 12 month clawback after receiving a reimbursement if we leave. Should I just do a postbac instead?

In other words, check if a phone is powered on and active.

I can use Skype for Business and can dial phone numbers without limits, so that's basically the only ""free"" way to be able to initiate voice calls.

I've tried using a couple of things:

* Skype4Py - only works for Python 2.x, pretty much a discontinued and broken library
* SkPy - this library has no option to initiate a voice call.
* Twilio - tried the trial, but since I have to use a company number, it's not really a solution
* Tried messing with Skype for Business URIs, but there's not a lot of sensible documentation online.

Since Microsoft is basically abandoning Skype for Teams, I know this is ain't really smart to use Skype API, but I have no other choice.

I've been at this for 2 full days, and I'm at a standstill right now.

I’ve been using handshake, linkedin, monster, and a bunch of other platforms to apply as well.

I already have a very good idea of the specific field I want to go in but as beggars can’t be choosers, I am trying to get into any research opportunity at this point.

Recently I emailed 7 professors who I really wanted to work with for undergrad MCB research but they are not accepting any more undergrads in their labs. I then emailed 15+ more professors in fields of interest but I received the same response from each. 

I know that COVID has caused cancellations of internships and opportunities for a lot of students but at this point I’m feeling really horrible knowing that many of my friends (most of them are in CS and ECE and only a few in bio) will be doing internships and research this year in either summer or fall while I’m still stuck hoping one of my applications gets accepted by someone, anywhere. I haven’t even gotten any offers for interviews yet, not over email nor over the phone/voicemail. I talked to career counselors and advisors multiple times have a completely revised resume and I take the time to work on cover letters and such but I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Is there something I need to change?

Has anyone experienced this as well? If you were eventually able to secure a position somewhere, how long did it take you and what resources did you use? Any advice or tips for applying? Or is it too late in the year to hope for anything now?

Sorry if I sound complain-y right now, I’m really on edge since I’m already in my senior year and might graduate by this upcoming winter."

17C which shows entry level but requires higher line scores and 45 weeks advanced individual training training. No top secret security clearance.  As a Cyber Operations Specialist, you’ll utilize invaluable skills to defend the Army’s crucial and complex weapons systems, which include satellites, navigation, and aviation systems against both foreign and domestic cyber threats. As one of the most technologically advanced nations in the world, our adversaries are attacking and attempting to exploit our networks around the clock, searching for vulnerabilities. You’ll respond to these attacks, while enabling commanders to gain an advantage in cyberspace across all domains by targeting enemy activities and capabilities. 

There is 25D which shows not entry level, lower qualifying line scores, 14 Weeks advanced individual training and TS security clearance.  As a Cyber Network Defender, you’ll perform specialized computer network defense duties, including infrastructure support, incident response, auditing, and managing. You’ll also detect and protect against unauthorized activity in the cyberspace domain and use a variety of tools to analyze and respond to attacks.

I haven't received a decision from the school as yet but I am surmising it's a reject as almost all accepts from the school has been given out. Reached out to the professor only to get no replies. :(

I feel dejected, hopeless, wretched from what just happened to me!

PS. I am an international applicant from India with a decent to moderate profile. I mean I wasn't ambitious as my undergrad university might have caused problems, but am I so worthless that no phd program feels that I am capable enough to succeed.

(at Google, Atlassian, Salesforce etc.)",techwithlucy,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/llp4cu/internships_in_tech_that_dont_involve_coding_at/,"Hey all, I recently started a graduate role at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a Solutions Architect and wanted to share some tips for students interested in Tech but don't come from a technical background.

There's still a misconception that you need a CS degree to join a Tech company. Having a technical background is definitely helpful for certain roles (e.g. software developers), but there are so many jobs in Tech that don't require strong coding knowledge.

Over the past month, I chatted with recent uni graduates working in these roles: 

* Product Manager (Atlassian)
* Solutions Engineer (Salesforce)
* Digital Strategist (Google)

If you're interested in hearing about their experiences and how they landed offers in those roles and companies, make sure you check out these short Q&amp;A videos: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWBfjpfzscb5Owd87T00OEjkewgTDjmRh](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWBfjpfzscb5Owd87T00OEjkewgTDjmRh)

A few takeaways:

* Use LinkedIn to engage and connect with people from roles and companies you're interested in (this may lead to job opportunities that aren't publicly listed).
* Look back on your uni experiences and figure out where your interests lie. Work backwards from that to find a job in tech that's right for you.
* Internships give you the chance to set up coffee chats with so many different teams in a company. These chats will help you decide on the type of work sounds interesting to you.

Best of luck with your internships and internship applications! Always happy to share my advice/experience working at Amazon (AWS), feel free to message me."

Graduated burntout and hating design. Did a internship and confirmed my hatred for design (lost what was left of my passion and motivation to learn). Took a few months break, ended up taking a year off. Tried to apply for design jobs, why would I apply for jobs that cause me pure agony. Now working minimum wage retail job and lost on my career path. Trying to find my next baby step forward. 

Anyone have stories or wise words to help me? 

———


I (24F) studied visual communication design (a broader graphic design) and graduated end of 2019 after 4 years. I hated my final year project/thesis that I worked on the full year, it was too late to change my idea so kept going just to finish the damn degree. In a nutshell, I burnt myself out and ended up hating design. 

Got an offer at a digital agency for an internship right after uni, so I took it even though I was burnt out (knew it was rare opportunity). The industry was a massive learning curve and crushed my passion for design even more. 

I decided to take a few months off from design to rest but It’s been more than a  year. Ive looked for design jobs but I automatically panic and believe I no longer have the basic skills for the job. I try to learn but I have no motivation to learn. 

I now lack passion/interest for design and motivation to learn design. I don’t want to waste the money and time I used to get the degree. I don’t know where to go from here. 

Side note: I have always had a interest and passion to learn about different animals behaviours and human cultures and what we can learn from them but I’m academically weak and much more creative. Is there a job or an education course that I could do of similar interest? 

Need some wise words or similar stories to me to help cheer me up.
 
Anyone graduated and realised this isn’t what they wanted to do? How did you bounce back and find a different path?"

Now that I fit their criteria with schooling, I applied and had my first phone interview the other day and have a second virtual interview this week. 

Now, in my current position, I make $12.50/hour. The hiring manager who interviewed me told me that in this full-time management internship, I would only be making $10/hour. 

Not to make it about the money or be ungrateful for the position, but I just feel that $10 an hour for this position seems a bit ridiculous given how normal management makes much more and how my previous work made a whole $2.50 more as an underling. Plus with bills, of course getting the most money as possible is important.

I’ve applied to a lot of other internships that pay more and haven’t heard anything back yet for Summer, but this is a position that could be a good opportunity with the company I have experience with already. 

What’s the best way/time I can try to negotiate my pay or at least bring up my concerns about the current pay? Is it even worth taking the position if I’m able to find something different that pays better even though I have experience there? I just wanted to hear some other perspectives."

I have a bit of a problem with my laptop. I have a macbook pro, late 2011 edition. Up until last month, everything still went swimmingly on it, albeit a little slow. However, with all my exams taking place online, requiring me to have my webcam on, I discovered it no longer works as it should. I am positive that before 2021, everything still worked, but sometime in 2021, it stopped. 

The Issue

When I try following my online classes on zoom, MS Teams or the online platform of my university, I see my camera as active, the light indicating it is indeed working, however for the people in the meeting it seems I'm not using the webcam. I tested my webcam on apps like photobooth, and there is no issue there. So I started looking at some authorizations on Chrome that may have become messed up, but every authorization I could find regarding camera and video was as it should be. I exclusively use Chrome when opening webpages that allow camera use like Facebook and my universities own bongo webclass. Other apps I tried using the camera in are Zoom, Discord, MS Teams. None of them seemed to transmit the video image to other users, although I could see myself in my camera, and my camera was clearly working. Currently I'm at a loss about what to do and I have some internships interviews coming up so I really need this issue solved.

Thanks in advance for reading and maybe solving this issue."

I didn't expect too much after completing the assessment.

Two months later (Late Dec 2020), I received an interview invitation that consists of 2 sessions. The interviewers were nice although the problems they asked were rather difficult, it centers around algorithms, OS, Database, Programming Languages, and Networks. Luckily, I received positive feedbacks from them.

However, now that it is February 2021, I haven't received any offer letter nor rejection letter from HR. I wonder if anyone shares the same experience as me -- or does anyone has received offers?

I know the work from home question has come up quite a bit since last March,  but I wanted some insights into particular things as haven’t seen quite as common. 

I am a graduate student with a 20hour/week intensive internship (I’ve had full time professional employment in the field that had less responsibility). I am also work from home. I am thriving in school, but am struggling substantially with work. Over the last several years I’ve equated poor work performance to a toxic workplace, but I’ve quickly learned, it’s deeper than that. Now that I’m work from home in an internship that will help place me into a competitively paying job, I need to figure it out, ASAP. 

I use the Pomodoro method when doing extended school work, which works fairly well. I also have over the ear headphone that I wear with music on full blast, I live alone but it keeps the ambient noise from the parking lot and street from distracting me. I’ve found one song that I can listen to on repeat that itches the right part of my brain but I won’t focus on and have been using it since October-ish. I have an excel sheet with all my assignments and readings for the semester that I can check off. I have a google calendar that I update regularly. The clear tasks and end goals help me substantially. I struggle with procrastination, but it’s manageable. Work is a different story.

I rarely complete anything meaningful in a day, I’m distracted by anything. I’m resistant to using Pomodoro because while it’s great for school, it’s incredibly exhausting sustaining concentration that long and in the work force where tasks are more amorphous it’s hard to figure out what to concentrate on. I have a ton of autonomy which is exhausting. I’ve downloaded apps for to do lists. I have chrome extensions that pop up all my meetings or deadline but I can’t complete anything. Because it’s work from home I end up pulling all nighters when I have a large deliverable the next day. I’ve tried working in both my kitchen and my living room and concentration ability is about equal. I’ve listened to general music that I don’t know the words to which goes ok but I’ve started experimenting with tv shows I’ve seen before in the background. I can’t listen to a podcast, I’ll either not hear a word they say or only hear that. 

I just don’t know what to do, I need to buckle down and complete things but I can’t. I’m unmedicated without hope of that changing soon. I am on other medication and my reactions lead my doctor to believe they’d interact pretty bad with most ADHD meds. I had a diagnosis of ADHD years ago and my doctor hopes to truly formalize that now that I haven’t been a teenager for awhile so hopefully an eventual more solid diagnosis will help with medication and different options."
llzbpw,1,2021-02-17,How do I find a job?,yuzu8059,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/llzbpw/how_do_i_find_a_job/,"Sorry but this is gonna be quite a long rant... 

I’m honestly just depressed af. Last year I got my Master's degree in Japanese studies. I've loved the country since middle school, its culture and the language itself, I even managed to work in Japan for almost a year as an intern at a hotel. The thing is, this type of education is quite useless in my country, there are not that many job offers that require Japanese language. I’ve been applying for half a year to everywhere I can but I just get denied each time. Most of the times they don’t even reply and if they do, after wasting my time on stupid tests and interviews, there’s always someone with more experience or just better than me. I can’t even get any simple office jobs or customer service jobs that require no specific skills or education besides English and computer usage (I think my English is good enough at least, but it’s not that rare these days). Today I got denied again, eh.

I mean, I teach some English and Japanese but I barely make around 150 USD a month, it was a part time thing I was doing while studying to have money for my own expenses (in my country higher education is free and I lived with my parents all the time, I got no loan too). I’m just ashamed of being 25 and still living with my parents, not paying for anything. They say it’s fine for now cause the Covid thing makes it harder to get entry level jobs but I still am afraid I won’t get hired ever.

The worst thing is I can’t even become a sex worker if I’d be really desperate cause I am ugly af being a woman (well, it's not like I don't try - I do make up, I like doing my make up tbh, I don't dress like a homeless and I shower daily but I am overweight and can't lose weight, even though I'm trying to, currently running around doctors to check what is wrong with me, I have some hormone issues). I feel like the only thing I’m relatively good at as of late is playing League of Legends, but again, I can’t really become a streamer cause I am not that good (just better than most e-girls) and not pretty enough. Besides, the streamer community is already oversaturated, especially when it comes to LoL, so it doesn’t even matter, tbh.

I don’t know, maybe I’m just not fit to live at all cause at this point I just feel like a piece of human trash. I don’t show it usually though, so it is not the reason I don’t get hired. I know I’m very good at pretending because all I do my whole life is pretend I like being around people when in reality if I could I would just avoid human contact whatsoever.

I always wanted to do something creative like writing stories or designing characters, stuff like that... Even translating feels creative and fun to me, I love analizing translations and comparing them to the source material. Idk. If I could translate from Japanese to my language for living I’d be blessed but that is not gonna happen and I know it now. I’m only sad I realized it too late. So now, at 25 I still see no way ahead of me, nothing I could be doing to make money and be useful to the society. I really am a loser, right? What would you do if you were me? I feel not qualified to be an independent adult. I’d like to move out and live my life but how, when I can’t even get an entry level job? Do I just work at a retail for the rest of my life? What if I don't get hired even there? I don't feel like I'm good enough for anything... Besides I know I'd feel miserable that way so I'd probably end up giving up on my life somewhere along the way...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I finished uni last year and still can't find any job cause I get denied everywhere and I don't know what to do. I feel not good enough for any job and I fear about my future."

I graduated from top 5 public school with a BS in Computer Science May 2020 and am currently a Solutions Architect at AWS.  I was a SA intern in the Summer before my senior year and got a return offer to come back full time, which I ended up taking.  This is my \~7th month working full time as I started in August.  To be quite frank I really do not like the role, it is way too customer facing and I feel like a salesman half the time.  I was not able to join my old internship team which had much more technical work, so I kind of feel like I got shafted as I was under the impression I would be doing so until they told me otherwise in like December.  I am super scared of being pigeonholed as a SA as I can already tell my technical skills have soured and really would like to find something that is more purely software engineering.  Am I crazy for wanting to jump ship so early?  It is so early in my career and I have a job paying me over 100k a year as a 22 year old that most people would probably kill for.  I'm not sure if I am just overreacting or if I should really listen to my gut and start looking for something else.  That was a bit of a ramble so thanks for sticking with me, would really appreciate it if you guys had some insight or advice."

lm0lqx,1,2021-02-17,Getting back into Engineering after a two year hiatus. Is fourth time the charm to enjoy this field?,JGWOL2,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/lm0lqx/getting_back_into_engineering_after_a_two_year/,"Probably going to write an extensive question here (as I am always due to ramble and just had my morning cup of coffee), **so scroll to the TL;DR question at the bottom if you want to avoid a lot of text.** But I do feel this is a complex question that gets asked by many current and former/returning engineers, so maybe some of you would relate to my story.

I graduated with my BSME back in 2016. Getting an engineering degree was not my original career choice in college; nursing was. But after taking my first college algebra I decided to go into STEM. And I definitely enjoyed the path. Nearly every course was fascinating to me, and there was never any hesitation for the theory. But, there was definitely a lack of applied application in my courses and this made the transition to an office position pretty rough and jagged when I got my first internship. Had almost zero understanding of welding, machining or assembly. And frankly it really pissed me off that at this point I was three years into an engineering program and did not even know what a filet weld was, or a flange, or a gasket. And I went to engineering school in Oklahoma. What the hell.

So from 2013-2016 I was very serious about pursuing this field even though I had a rough time with my internship. I felt the company I worked for was very ""low tier"", and it was disheartening to experience. The management seemed inept, and my coworkers were weird. Half of them had other side hustles which inevitably led to me discovering that most of the engineers there were not making more than $50-60k a year and had zero passion for their positions. I was asked a year after my internship ended to come on as a manufacturing engineer, and I turned it down in the fear that I would just end up as beat down as everyone else that worked there.

I felt like maybe I would not feel this way at EVERY engineering job. Perhaps the next one could be different? Well about two years later I got asked to fill in on maternity leave thanks to a connection I had at my internship. A disgruntled employee there left to a new company that was nearly a quarter mile down the street. Accepted the offer right away and came on as a temporary employee. Made $20/hr with no benefits, and it more or less felt like an internship on steroids. I was drafting and designing some products to test for fit/function in solidworks, but for the most part my responsibilities were very low and I was just working on low tier work. After a few weeks of this however I got asked to do my first real project. So for the next five months I came to work with purpose, and I was  tasked with designing oil and gas conditioning skids. I never dealt with structural engineering of this type but I quickly picked it up and was given more and more work to the point that I was essentially a full-fledged employee. But, at the time I was still stuck in that ""there's gotta be more out there"" mentality and I did not work hard at relating to my co-workers or building a relationship with the owner. And I tried, but the whole company felt very ""good old boy"", and while I grew up in Oklahoma I spent a lot of time in the city and had a hard time relating to the type of personality you would meet in oil and gas.

So at this point I have almost 1 1/2 years of experience using solidworks, familiarizing myself in an engineering environment, and deciphering/designing engineering documents/products and solutions. I work some odd jobs outside of the industry but a year after I graduated from college I finally get the call I have been waiting for and get offered to work as a design engineer for a power plant equipment supplier in southern California.

Words cannot describe how nervous and excited I felt. Getting off the plane in California to interview for my first ""real job"" felt like a reward for everything I worked on in the last five years of school (2011-2016). My ACT/SAT scores sucked, and up until my second year of college I was terrible at math and had a hard time ever believing I was ""smart enough"". This self-sabotage carried with me since I was a teen, but this moment affirmed that I was wrong to feel this way about myself. The day before my interview, I walked down the coast of long beach for hours and told myself, there was no doubt I would land this job.

I aced the interview. And it wasn't tough. My boss barely asked any questions pertaining to my actual experience or competency. We talked about our pasts and interest/hobbies. Both found out we enjoyed playing music (I play drums and he played guitar). He was very multi-layered. Came from an interesting and well-educated family, and he was very smart himself. But he was also extremely sharp and honest. I don't think I was every capable of telling a fib or lying about how I felt about something around him. He was like a spotlight of honesty, and he taught me a lot about how to approach engineering from a political perspective. That 90% of it is getting along with your co-workers and the other 10% is really knowing what you are talking about. He was amazing at the whole deal, and even though he was not my direct boss once I got the job, I almost always went to him for advice and help because he would not only give me answers but would teach me how to learn. I worked for that company for a year and change, and was given a moderate amount of responsibility. But my biggest complaint was the lack of direction from my superiors. Even though it was an entry level position, I had zero help in terms of understanding the product I was responsible for working on, and this made me VERY anxious working there. Thankfully I had some very patient co-workers that helped me get over these speed bumps in the first few months, and by the end of my tenure there I was working as on-site engineering supervision/company advisor for a plant outage our company was a part of.

While I was honored to be tasked with this assignment, it was very mentally taxing. I was already having a hard time familiarizing myself in California all by myself. I grew up in a relatively small city and had been around the same friends/family for over two decades, and was now completely uprooted. By the time I was finally getting comfortable with my work and my coworkers, I was being sent away for six weeks on 7 day/14 hour assignments with no over time pay or perks. Not for a lack of trying, either. Three weeks into the assignment I told my boss I wanted to renegotiate my compensation during this period (at the time I was making $60k a year and worked in L.A. You do the math of how shitty of a salary that is), and I was met with threats of my job security and told that I needed to stop worrying about money and worry about being a ""good engineer"". I don't think I ever stopped being pissed off, and I remember when my boss came to visit the job site and check in towards the end of the assignment, I had a hard time even looking him in the eye. I couldn't believe I was in this position voluntarily.

Once the assignment ended, I took over a week of vacation. The company was nice enough to give us an additional two days of paid vacation, even though we were not paid for over 40 hours we were on site. As soon as I got back into the office, my boss told me to get my passport. I'm going to Qatar in two weeks. I asked them if there would be any additional compensation, because my job description and negotiated salary never called for extensive international travel. Especially to a country that just recently had issues with beheading american/european journalists. Told me no. One hour later I walked into his office and told him I was quitting, and two weeks later I was back home.

No more two hour round trips to work, no more sitting in the office eight hours a day for two hours of work, no more staring out the window and contemplating what the fuck I was doing with my life, no more wondering if I was going to end up as another sad, depressed upper management type with 20 years under his belt and nothing to show for it except for an overly expensive piece of California property and a Mercedes-Benz.

When I moved back home, I switched gears and went back to an industry I was familiar with, but with a twist. I decided to run my own company. For the next two years, I worked as a bartender and on the side started a pop-up kitchen concept with the intention of starting my own food truck. What I discovered after that time is that I hate having a business partner and that I really, really loved bartending. And in particular, I enjoyed socializing at work and being in control of my own surroundings. As a bartender, I opened and closed, and I had say over who could and couldn't be in the bar. My owners left me with the tools necessary to complete my tasks, and outside of that, they stayed out of my affairs. I could drink on the job to an extent, sleep with my coworkers, and never had to second guess what I was going to do at work that day. I made drinks, and I listened to customers. That was it.

I decided as soon as I got home, in January of 2019, that I would never work as an Engineer again. That I was good at bartending. I could easily make $100-200 a day on the slowest of evenings, and that if I had enough hours booked, I could easily earn $3000+ a month. And with my lifestyle, that is more than enough.

But here we are now, in 2021. Covid has hit the industries hard, and finding a -full time- bartending gig in my city has just been damn near difficult, and it is not exactly lucrative enough of an industry that I would care to relocate myself across the country for a job. And, now I have a girlfriend and a rent lease ending in four months. I'm more eager than ever to start making good, stable money. And the only place I can think to accomplish that is by leveraging my engineering degree. And last week I got placed with a screening interview for an international company just twenty minutes from home that could I could earn a very decent salary at. The position is less engineering focused and more centered on customer relations/engagement. Hell, the hiring manager even *requested someone who had restaurant/bartending experience*. This has to be meant for me, right?

But, I also have around the corner the opportunity to work as a full time bartender for a new restaurant opening up near my home. And the owner there is extremely eager to have me on. So now I feel like I am sitting at a cross roads of what is easy, and what is profitable. I could potentially earn more than double my income from bartending, and have consistent income, bonuses, insurance, a retirement package, and maybe even some pride in my career. On the other hand, I could go into a position I know for a *fact* I would enjoy and not dread going into every morning. I hate the 9-5. I hate having a job that is rooted in routine. Sitting inside a cubicle for eight hours a day sounds like fucking torture, and I do not want to be asked to travel to nowhere Texas for a week to sell a customer something I have no interest in.

So here is my burning question: Does anyone feel the way I do and eventually found their calling in engineering? To be at a point through experience and actual hands-on work, to become so disinterested in continuing on this path, eventually finding a position that was rewarding and worth dedicating 40-50 hours a week of their life too?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I tried to be an engineer, went full steam into it  for over 2 1/2 years and never enjoyed the atmosphere or cared for the discipline. But money is good and I want to be able to own a house and stop worrying about money. Wondering if anyone else feels this way and how I might get over it and just enjoy the career I spent over eight years trying to get into."

Hi guys,

I recently accepted a ML programming position for the summer, but I now I have been offered a position as a Software Intern at a much larger company (which I prefer). I am unable to back out of my first offer, due to my school forcing me to take the co-op I've accepted.

Would it be possible to negotiate with the second employer to possibly start at a later date? Or is that out of the boat? i.e The fall term instead of the summer term

&amp;#x200B;

Or would it ultimately be better to kindly reject the offer, and pursue other opportunities in the fall term?"

lm3k30,0,2021-02-17,What are the odds?,PegaMaster,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/lm3k30/what_are_the_odds/,"Hi all,

Hoping to get your opinion on my background and statement of purpose. I plan to finish my application in the next two weeks.

I feel that it doesn't provide enough concrete examples in my background statement but I don't really work on projects outside of work much. 

Normally I am focused on Data Structures and algorithms, Leetcode or sometimes I automate things I do repetitively. 

Any thoughts on my chances? 

I have taken the following at Oakton otherwise I was a business major. 

*  Discrete Mathematics 
*  Computer Architecture And Organization 
*  C++ Computer Science I 
*  C++ Data Structures 
*  Objects and Algorithms 

&amp;#x200B;

***Background***

As a passionate technologist, I found my interest during an internship at a startup where we used tech to solve business problems. I was enthralled and become active in the developer community by joining two developer meetups. It clicked with me my senior year that this was what I want to do for a career and I started exploring computer science deeper.   

Since then, my journey into technology has been an incredible experience that has led me to acquire certifications in Agile, Enterprise Architecture, and Business Process Management suits. I taught myself Java and C++ and have a strong love of data structures and algorithms. I like to challenge myself and explore new things. One of the ways I do this is by being involved in a hackathon at The Hartford each year. 

I am keenly interested in competitive programming and using mathematical concepts to solve complex problems. One benefit of self-teaching has been the freedom to explore these topics in-depth where I have heavily utilized my Orielly subscription, Leetcode, and Codeforces.   

I have been obsessively learning and covering topics in graph theory, linear algebra, probability theory, algorithms, and enjoy discovering new approaches to difficult problems.   

In my current role as a BPM developer, I design and implement systems on several technologies. I work in Java and with BPM software where I create extensible applications focused on automating back-office operations. I actively manage the creation and execution of DevOps pipelines for 11 applications. Most of the knowledge I accumulated by aggressively learning on my own time outside of work where I have averaged around twenty hours a week for the last few years.      

I am dedicated to gaining the knowledge and skillsets to propel my career as a software engineer and to make a bigger impact on my current and future roles. I see OMSCS as being instrumental in fulfilling my lifelong desire to attend a graduate program and mastering my craft as a software developer. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Statement of Purpose***

I am excited about Georgia Tech particularly because of the excellent reputation for having outstanding classes and the fact it is revolutionizing the academic landscape. These are huge factors for me as I want to make the most out of a graduate program and be challenged to become a better engineer.       

Specifically, I am interested in the Computing Systems specialization and want to take courses exploring operating systems, computer architecture, graduate algorithms, and compiler design. My desire for this program is because the content of the courses covers low-level and granular topics while providing structure to tackle difficult concepts. I have always known it was part of my journey to attend graduate school but before Georgia Tech I was not sure what that would look like.      

Self-teaching has given me the opportunity to work with some amazing developers and gain industry knowledge but my ultimate goal is to be a Software Engineer. I believe that the OMSCS program having classes available asynchronously online will allow me to continue to work doing what I love while building up advanced knowledge. The core Computing Systems courses would accelerate and direct my learning efforts beyond my own self-guided studies.     

Upon graduation from OMSCS, I hope to use the knowledge gained to work on applications facing millions of users at a large tech company. I see this program as instrumental in making that dream a reality for me. I would like to be part of a team working on complex applications that make everyone’s life's better and more convenient. I see the research and development I do now as building a foundation for a strong tech-based career that ultimately benefits society. 

Beyond new opportunities, the program will fulfill my deep love of learning and provide immense intrinsic value. Through the classes I have taken at my community college I have already benefited intellectually and been exposed to a wide range of concepts. It has been a great experience that I truly value. This has inspired and motivated me, even more, to take on the new challenges that would come with this graduate program. Georgia Tech’s courses look incredible.  

After several years of self-teaching and working in technology, I feel fortunate to have found a university and a program that matches my goals. Georgia Tech's Computing Systems program is the best fit for me and the best possible way to create a future I would like to be a part of."

Typically if you want to study Political Science in New York it’s known that you should apply to Binghamton University and SUNY Geneseo, but I didn’t because I did not want to be in the middle of nowhere. I really like the city atmosphere. 

I like how Stony Brook is only about an hour from NYC by train, but Stony Brook is a pretty STEM focused school. I like how UAlbany is in the state capital (for internships), but I’ve heard that UAlbany’s Political Science is not really anything amazing, and I also don’t like how it’s the least prestigious and has a reputation for being a raging party school. Also, Albany doesn’t really have city vibes, it’s a pretty small place, and it’s like 3 hours from NYC so that means I can’t really go into the city. UBuffalo seems like it has a pretty good Political Science program, and it’s in a pretty nice sized city even though your not really super close to downtown Buffalo.

I am seriously considering dropping out, or at least pausing it for a while. I got lucky enough to find an internship in the field without having a degree (I dedicated a LOT of time to self-learning as I could not afford to wait to have a degree to start working), and I feel like I am going bald out of stress and wasting away my 20s. Having to stare at a pc for 4 more hours after 8 hours of coding feels horrible. I have no social contact whatsoever either.

By the end of the day I end up felling much worse than I use to do while I was working in construction. I am not exaggerating.

At my work I mostly deal with python, especifically pandas numpy scikit other data and web scrapping stuff.

I enjoy programming, but is not my passion, is not my dream, I am not sure if I am willing to spend an average of 10 to 11 hours per day doing it for the next 3 years. I would love to ""just"" be able to learn on the job + self-learn whatever it is that I am lacking.

My question is, would I be fucking myself over? Do you think around an year of full-time internship experience is enough as to justify not going for the degree for now?"

I am 24 years of age, male, and a college student. I was born overseas on an army airfield base in Wurzburg, Germany; I am Black and Korean. I moved to NJ and I grew up as an only child and was raised by my grandparents, mother, and aunt. My grandmother is originally from South Korea while my grandfather is black and originally from Louisiana. My father (maternal) was absent all my childhood for various ""unknown"" reasons. Until recently, I heard through my half-brother in New York, he's had a history of broken marriages as well as verbal/physical abuse. For the most part, my childhood was positive. As far as my socio-economic class, I come from an average and lower middle class family. My mother commuted to New York daily while my grandparents took care of me. I was extremely close to my grandfather and because of his military experience, he encouraged and exposed me to traveling the world at a young age. In my neighborhood, school, and town; however, I was practically a social outcast and I was bullied severely because of my cultural/racial differences and the fact I was extremely quiet. I know it's a cliche, but my experiences were from it and their scars both physically and verbally had traumatized me to this day. For instance, occasionally I would have to escape to the bathroom for lunch so I could avoid people judging me eat Korean food. My story was far from typical and there was no point of reference or alternative culture I could turn to. I was an outcast to all the outcasts in my town and school because my cultural identity was so unique and my personality was so odd. I had also suffered from a number of learning disorders and I struggled in school and I was forced into smaller resource classrooms with the same group of kids from elementary school to high school. It was painfully exhausting and monotonous and I never received proper help or treatment and I am not playing the victim or race card, my experiences were deeply rooted in my identity and things I had no control over. Typically, you hear similar stories like mine broadcasted in famous literature, films, and television series classic troubled loner, but it's almost always the white boy. I hate to be that way but I am being honest, none of my experiences of being an outcast were superficial or cool or it was deeply complex and very very isolating and insular. Fast forward, I was expelled from middle school for brining a knife twice to school. I had no intentions to murder anyone but I will be honest do not judge me, I was sincerely angry about it and I wanted to protect myself from the bullies I experienced at school. However, the school misdiagnosed me with with a number of disorders like aspergers and I was arrested and I am not going to explain in depth what happened and who was involved just a lot kids bullying me and being surrounded by two-faced manipulative friends, but it led to an immense misundestanding. Peers perceived me and joked that I was classic serial killer or whatever loner type and I was far from that. My truth was overturned by stereotypes, racist, negative remarks, and hyper-exaggerations.

Moving on, high school was well alienating and I practically had no one to turn to until my final year where I met my best friend who helped. He was also extremely alienated and he exposed to different forms of music/art like My Bloody Valentine, Jean-Michel-Basquait, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, Can, Sonic Youth, Stereolab, Deerhunter, and Animal Collective. We made music as a passion and we both were the only ones in our town that listen to this music. This is not important in the whole context of who I am, but it is still important to address. Anyway moving to college, was not better people often say that to people like me. I was extremely sheltered my entire adolescence I was not part of any group in school any group whatsoever and I was so sheltered and involved in my own world of my music, writing, and my problems that I was so detached from the beginnings of social media and internet culture that reigned all my adolescence. I had no experience of it and I still don't really understand social media or meme culture or this new vernacular, I was not involved in anything NOTHING. This caused me to live in a cloud of deep disassociation from my peers for years. College was extremely traumatizing this marked the beginning of endless spiral to bottomless sea four years and currently now. I withdrew from college my second year to be brief I went to school in New York. Sometimes I slept on the street and roamed on subways for hours and never returned to class. My roommate alienated me my second year and I was forced to sleep in the basement of my dorm sometimes. I also had panic attacks in public in the city and I can just say I rolled in the middle of a busy street and screamed helplessly for someone to help me and car almost ran over my head. That's how bad it was. I can name more darker experiences where I broke windows in the city too and attacked cars. I was forced on a medical leave of absence. Since the year of 2016 I have struggled immensely and I had return to my hometown and I have basically been there since for the most part. I have been in a long distance relationships and I have knew someone who died to heroin in this town. I hate it there everyhting has been fueled by negative experienences. My mother also got married and forced me to live with my step dad in a new home. I am torn between both places and I am also just feeling deeply alienated and since home I did some of those things in New York back in my hometown. thankfully though the only positive elements have come through therapy and passing and failing community college multiple times. I also had traumatic experiences during two summers in two different states where I interned. The most vivid expeirence I had was when I was slept in the fields of Iowa and behind a church in the middle of nowhere at night.

I am 24 years of age, male, and a college student. I was born overseas on an army airfield base in Wurzburg, Germany; I am Black and Korean. I moved to NJ and I grew up as an only child and was raised by my grandparents, mother, and aunt. My grandmother is originally from South Korea while my grandfather is black and originally from Louisiana. My father (maternal) was absent all my childhood for various ""unknown"" reasons. Until recently, I heard through my half-brother in New York, he's had a history of broken marriages as well as verbal/physical abuse. For the most part, my childhood was positive. As far as my socio-economic class, I come from an average and lower middle class family. My mother commuted to New York daily while my grandparents took care of me. I was extremely close to my grandfather and because of his military experience, he encouraged and exposed me to traveling the world at a young age. In my neighborhood, school, and town; however, I was practically a social outcast and I was bullied severely because of my cultural/racial differences and the fact I was extremely quiet. I know it's a cliche, but my experiences were from it and their scars both physically and verbally had traumatized me to this day. For instance, occasionally I would have to escape to the bathroom for lunch so I could avoid people judging me eat Korean food. My story was far from typical and there was no point of reference or alternative culture I could turn to. I was an outcast to all the outcasts in my town and school because my cultural identity was so unique and my personality was so odd. I had also suffered from a number of learning disorders and I struggled in school and I was forced into smaller resource classrooms with the same group of kids from elementary school to high school. It was painfully exhausting and monotonous and I never received proper help or treatment and I am not playing the victim or race card, my experiences were deeply rooted in my identity and things I had no control over. Typically, you hear similar stories like mine broadcasted in famous literature, films, and television series classic troubled loner, but it's almost always the white boy. I hate to be that way but I am being honest, none of my experiences of being an outcast were superficial or cool or it was deeply complex and very very isolating and insular. Fast forward, I was expelled from middle school for brining a knife twice to school. I had no intentions to murder anyone but I will be honest do not judge me, I was sincerely angry about it and I wanted to protect myself from the bullies I experienced at school. However, the school misdiagnosed me with with a number of disorders like aspergers and I was arrested and I am not going to explain in depth what happened and who was involved just a lot kids bullying me and being surrounded by two-faced manipulative friends, but it led to an immense misundestanding. Peers perceived me and joked that I was classic serial killer or whatever loner type and I was far from that. My truth was overturned by stereotypes, racist, negative remarks, and hyper-exaggerations.

Moving on, high school was well alienating and I practically had no one to turn to until my final year where I met my best friend who helped. He was also extremely alienated and he exposed to different forms of music/art like My Bloody Valentine, Jean-Michel-Basquait, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, Can, Sonic Youth, Stereolab, Deerhunter, and Animal Collective. We made music as a passion and we both were the only ones in our town that listen to this music. This is not important in the whole context of who I am, but it is still important to address. Anyway moving to college, was not better people often say that to people like me. I was extremely sheltered my entire adolescence I was not part of any group in school any group whatsoever and I was so sheltered and involved in my own world of my music, writing, and my problems that I was so detached from the beginnings of social media and internet culture that reigned all my adolescence. I had no experience of it and I still don't really understand social media or meme culture or this new vernacular, I was not involved in anything NOTHING. This caused me to live in a cloud of deep disassociation from my peers for years. College was extremely traumatizing this marked the beginning of endless spiral to bottomless sea four years and currently now. I withdrew from college my second year to be brief I went to school in New York. Sometimes I slept on the street and roamed on subways for hours and never returned to class. My roommate alienated me my second year and I was forced to sleep in the basement of my dorm sometimes. I also had panic attacks in public in the city and I can just say I rolled in the middle of a busy street and screamed helplessly for someone to help me and car almost ran over my head. That's how bad it was. I can name more darker experiences where I broke windows in the city too and attacked cars. I was forced on a medical leave of absence. Since the year of 2016 I have struggled immensely and I had return to my hometown and I have basically been there since for the most part. I have been in a long distance relationships and I have knew someone who died to heroin in this town. I hate it there everyhting has been fueled by negative experienences. My mother also got married and forced me to live with my step dad in a new home. I am torn between both places and I am also just feeling deeply alienated and since home I did some of those things in New York back in my hometown. thankfully though the only positive elements have come through therapy and passing and failing community college multiple times. I also had traumatic experiences during two summers in two different states where I interned. The most vivid expeirence I had was when I was slept in the fields of Iowa and behind a church in the middle of nowhere at night. I was feeling so disassociated I just escaped I had put on makeup and romaed on the highway drunk as fuck and I failed my summer internship. A lot other shit has happened too. Thankfully though, I finally got accepted to a college and on my way to get a degree but it's terrible to know how much has happened to me and where I am now."

I’m in my early twenties and have been lucky enough to find work in media where I live. But working in media during a global pandemic simply burned me out. I couldn’t come up with story ideas, could barely write, and constantly had brain fog. I started therapy (ongoing), tried yoga, journaling... tried telling myself everyone is going through it.... but I could barely sleep, was crying every night, and became a shell of myself in six months. I decided to quit. And not for lack of trying/success (I don’t want to share too much info about where I lived/work because the industry is small, but I’ve had a few jobs and didn’t walk away from an internship)

I took a month off and accepted the first job that came my way—marketing for a startup. I’m a month in and I’m finding it extremely difficult. The brain fog is back, I’m working 10-11h days, on a short-staffed team, am already missing deadlines and the work keeps piling up. I try communicating that it is too much work but things don’t change. 

I know it’s a pandemic, that I’m lucky to have a job, that I shouldn’t job hop, etc, but I’ve been working through a headache since starting this job and feel myself working towards a burnout again. Any advice/tips? Is it me? Or should I consider a new industry altogether? Something less creative/cerebral to get me back to balance? I’m realizing deadline-oriented, content churning, kpi-tracking work isn’t for me. I don’t have the headspace to track/manage multiple projects and meet with 10 partners a week. I’m scared because it feels like this is all the “real world” is about.

I wish I could just take a huge break from life.

Does it sound like I’m burning out again, have a bad job, or need better coping skills?

Thanks for reading."

I know when I first came to GT, I had no idea how important internships were and I wish I'd had someone to guide me through how to apply, make a quality resume, keep track of open internship applications, etc. After spending wayyyy too much time last semester applying and interviewing, I feel as though I have a much better understanding of the entire CS intern system and I wish I was able to share my experiences and knowledge with other students so they won't make the same mistakes I did while still being able to enjoy the same successes.            


Therefore, I am considering founding a club (would probably start it out as a Discord group until enough people joined) for CS students to work on improving their career prospects. Key features of the club would be resume workshops, interview prep, Leetcode discussion, referral trading, and mentoring. We would focus on intern applications, but probably expand to new grad once enough interest was raised.          

While the summer 2021 intern season is coming to a close, I wanted to see if there was enough interest to start laying out the groundwork for the club in time for next year's application season. I would be looking for two main ""types"" of members: those with significant career/intern experience who would be willing to aid in mentoring, and students who are new to the game but hungry to learn the ropes. If this club sounds like something you would be interested in, please let me know below! If something like this already exists or you think the idea could use some tweaking, I would also be interested to hear your thoughts."

I had an assessment given to me as part of a real estate acquisition analyst internship role. I already mapped out an answer of my own and did some work on excel but I'd like to know how someone would approach this. Thank you for any help! :D

Here's the prompt: 

Please write up a memo based on the parameters below and include the breakdown of your underwriting (attach the excel file). We would like you to use a model that you are familiar with from previous experience or create your own as you see best fit.

If you are looking to acquire a multifamily property that needs to be renovated (value-add), how would you underwrite the property to identify what the property is worth? In other words, how much would you pay for the hypothetical property below?

Details of the property:

● 100 Unit Building

● All 100 Units are 1 Bedroom

● The building is in the Sunnyside neighborhood in Queens, New York, NY.

● The building is currently a Class C that is being renovated to Class B. 

●The cost of renovation is $25,000/unit.

● The hold period is 5 years.

● The cap rate is 6.5%.

● The renovation will take 1 year and then there is a 1 year absorption period (time it takes to get the tenants in the building).

Use neighborhood rent comparables to identify 1 bedroom rent and other variable costs for your model. Provide a 5 year IRR including the cost of renovation."

lmgz1q,1,2021-02-18,Torn on two options,aguach1le5,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lmgz1q/torn_on_two_options/,"To start, I’m a 20 y/o pharmacy Technician and I’ve been working at the same job that I interned at right after my internship ended in 2019. It’s a smaller company, and I love all my coworkers but for a while I didn’t like the pay. In January 2021 was when I got my first pay raise (reviews were moved around due to certain virus) and now I only make 50¢ above minimum wage. I mentioned this in December and said that due to my license and responsibility that they put on me, I wanted Atleast a dollar above minimum wage. When they didn’t meet it, I started looking for other jobs. I didn’t tell anyone since I have a heads up in December. Well, lo and behold, someone wants to hire me for $2.00 above what I make now, smaller place so therefore less work. I have my two weeks on Monday, but on Tuesday my supervisor and higher ups wanted to talk to me, they said they had a plan for me to be in leadership role and basically be pharmacists right hand, and said they were willing to “get very close to/match my offer” but I never got a set number. I love where I work now and I would love to stay, but I’m scared I’m going to get screwed over and get way less than what I could’ve got. I told my supervisor today that I’ll stay, but I need a set number asap and he said he’ll let management know. I haven’t told anything to my other job offer, but rn I’m wishing I didn’t say anything to my current supervisor. 

On one hand, I love my job. It’s close and we’re already short staffed, we’re also supposed to be getting vaccines soon so that’s definitely hectic. Also, the leadership position they mentioned doesn’t do much more than what I already do, however I’m scared that I’ll stay and get screwed over wage wise, and be unhappy with my wage again, I’m also scared that if I get this “leadership role” that it’ll mess with the relationships I have at work (people being more passive/rude due to me being younger and only there for a year yet getting a higher position, it happens) 

On another hand, yes the other job is paying more and has less volume but I also see that as a job security issue in the possible future aswell. If it’s too slow then hours will get cut and eventually people too, and being new makes me the first to go. Also I’d be back at square 1 again, new systems, new policies, and new people. I’m worried about the work environment due to the fact that the owner said that the position was open due to an altercation between coworkers and one ended up quitting. It’s out of my comfort zone since everything is new, but then again no one grew when they stayed in their comfort zone. The owner also seems really nice, when we interviewed it felt more like an easy conversation than an interview. 

My mom always said to go to where the money is but I’m still so torn between two paths right now, I just need advice. If it were you, what would you do? Thank you in advance I know this is long but I feel like I’m having an anxiety attack"

I have very little experience in working with Excel, so I feel like this should motivate me to learn more about it.

I don’t want to study for technical interviews just to make a 6 figure salary.

I like coding when I get into it, but it’s really hard without significant mentorship. I liked my first internship because of my coworkers, but I don’t like my current internship.

I just want to run away to work on a farm in Japan. Or work as a flight attendant, or customer service at an international hotel. I just came back from a gap year abroad, so I’m not used to work anymore.

But there’s too much pressure on me to succeed esp. from my family. They’re the ones financially supporting me and I’m afraid they’ll cut me off if I tell them what I want to do. Furthermore, I like the high-paying salaries of a swe job because then I will get financial freedom to travel and do what I want. So I’m torn between the two options.

Because I’m qualified, should I power through becoming a software engineer in order to make enough money to save up? Or should I risk following my passion even though I would likely not get paid a lot for it."

So I would like to share my experience after getting disappointing A level results and feel free to ask me anything regarding my pathway after JC! 

I was doing badly throughout JC. Even at prelims i got ~40rp only (not sure if higher or lower than 40rp but arnd there).
Eventually got 65rp at A levels. (I took A levels in 2017)

I immediately complete the poly applications first (cos the deadlines are earlier than uni ones). I was interested in accountancy and there's almost no exemptions allowed. This means that u have to start from year 1 sem 1. (Taking accounting modules are essential for exemptions in professional accounting qualifications such as ACCA/ICAEW). Because poly starts in April, i gotta accept and enrol in poly first.

I also concurrently applied for NTU, SMU, SUSS, SUTD. Rejected by all but NTU allowed me to appeal for Material Science course and gave it to me. But NTU only gave me this appeal offer in July, when I'm already in the middle of poly studies. 
(Edit: Didnt apply NUS bcos i had felt too inferior to qualify and didnt apply SIT despite completing the application form bcos of the expensive application fees lol)

Contemplated whether i should continue poly or go uni instead, end up choosing to stay in poly bcos I'm not interested in material science.

Till this day, I don't regret choosing to go poly instead of retaking A levels or going to a uni course im not interested in. In fact, poly gave me alot more options in life. I was offered a full-time job at one of the Big 4 accounting companies bcos of my poly compulsory internship. I had alot more options for universities as i did better in poly (worked even harder than before and with a course of my choice). I'm graduating soon and i already got a letter of offer from universities with my poly results.

Back then, I was super depressed when i got my rather disappointing A level results (which i had expected anyways due to lousy performance in jc). Looking back now, A levels aren't everything so don't worry there's always doors open for you in life! I hope this post will lift your mood a little for  those who didnt do as well! :))

TL;DR Went to poly after disappointing A levels results. Dont regret it bcos i was eventually given better opportunities in life. Ask me anything."

lmoy10,1,2021-02-18,Is an internship in research useful if you are not sure about doing R&amp;D later on ?,jazzminerye,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lmoy10/is_an_internship_in_research_useful_if_you_are/,"Hi,

I got accepted for two internships and I have trouble deciding.

The first one is a research internship in Data Science at a University.

The second one is a Data Analyst internship at a small company.

I would like to know your opinions about whether having an internship in R&amp;D is good if we are not sure about pursuing R&amp;D later on ? Because I'm curious about what it's like to work in research and since I have zero experience in this field I might romanticize it a bit, I would like to forge an opinion on it with the acquired experience and then decide whether or not I should continue this path...

Is it possible to get into R&amp;D even if we didn't have any experience in this field ? Let's say I pick the second internship as a Data Analyst and build my career on that. How can I get into R&amp;D from that path ? How can one write a thesis or pursue a PhD if one's GPA is not really good ?

Basically to comfort myself, I was optimistic and thought it would be nice to have experience in both research and Data Science experience in a company. But what's the point of getting research experience if you're not sure you're going to focus on it ? Do you think it's better to focus only in one of them ? I know a few students who have done their research internship but still managed to find interesting internships but I don't know if these are the exception and not the rule.

If I do a mediocre job on the research internship, I don't think I will have more opportunity by following this path than by going to a company. Because in retrospect, with the crisis, etc., if the situation doesn't improve, it will be even more complicated to get a job in the end, so I don't think it's a bad decision to opt for an internship in a company. Do you think it's safer to maximize my chances of finding a job after graduation if I get an internship in a company as a Data Analyst ?

It seems like switching from research to the company is indeed possible but how difficult is it and how common is it ? It is better to be in contact with the company's environment as part of the research. I had a family member that knows someone doing a thesis related to the automobile industry: she often exchanged with the company in the framework of her research, and was eventually hired there once her thesis was over.

Thanks"

   My dream always has been to live in another country and look for better opportunities and quality of life, for my mom too. After university is the right time. So I ask for your help, please :)

   Currently, I am a 17 y/o senior in highschool. I'm not sure yet but I think I'm going to study Computer Science. I'll be saving up and by the time I travel, I should have about R$37.000, which is USD$6840 (or €5680). I know it's not that much when converted but it's the maximum I can get during this period of time. But it's certain: I want to leave this country. We are in the middle of an economic crisis and no sight of getting better. Jobs are hard to find, violence is out of control and corruption is everywhere.
 
   I'm trying my best to be fluent in English and also learning German and French. I know a bit of Spanish and Korean. I love learning about new cultures and languages and get used to things easily so adapting shouldn't be too much of a problem.
   
   By the time I finish college, maybe I'll have some experience as an internship student (depends a lot on how things will flow with my country in this situation but I live in one of the biggest cities here so that's an advantage). I plan to study as much as I can to be a full stack developer.

   Mom will be already retiring and she can speak some English + wouldn't mind learning a new language as long as I teach her. I don't consider her in the title because she wants to wait until I have everything done. So, she won't be going immediately.

   As for details: I'd like to go to a place where temperatures are cooler (at least during most part of the year) than Brazil's. I've had enough of extreme hot weather; LGBTQ+ friendly would also be truly awesome; safer, where I don't need to be worried while walking to other places; I like urban life but would be good to not be far from nature or somewhere to chill; I'd prefer somewhere that I can earn enough to, after getting ready and settling myself down, bring my mom to live with me.

   I've been thinking/reading a lot about Nordic countries. Apparently it's not absurdly hard to find jobs for programmers in Sweden or Finland. Is that true? If so, I'm willing to learn Swedish or Finnish. Which countries are open to my major? Any recommendations are valid.

   Also, not sure if this helps but I have friends and family all over the world, except Africa (and Antarctica :p). They accept me as a guest until I get a fixed place to live. 

   Some questions that I have:

   1. Should I save up more money or is it fine to find a job outside and then go with what I have? Do companies help you to set yourself there?
   2. Seems to be more and more people interested in my field. After 4 years, will it be much harder for me to find stuff? Do I need to consider another major?
   3. My father is trying to get us an Italian citizenship but I don't think we'll have it anytime soon. It is very expensive and would take too long. I know being an EU citizen would help but is it that much worth it in the long run?
   4. What's the process to bring my mom? Is it difficult? There's no way I'll leave her here.

   Every advice is welcome. Thanks for reading until here. Sorry for any grammar errors, mistakes or misspelling. Stay safe!"

backstory: i graduated almost a year ago, but have been using this CV format since september (ie i have redone it many times), but i think this is ok. I have applied to about 130 companies since, and most have been rejections. Although i have gotten 1 internship interview and a few people showing interest but ghosting me.

I have applied to all kind of positions, junior, senior roles (i mean why not), Backend, frontend, Java, .Net, business analyst, game studios. But mostly no luck, i always get the reply that they choose a more qualified candidate.

Any advice?"

I loved game development but after starting to apply I lost interest in making one and started the path on windows app developer.. after a while though, I just feel empty and tried to become a web developer but I felt even more empty inside. 

At first I was passionate on creating games for mobile, then decided to become android developer which was my Intern, then after graduating I feel like I didn't like it so I decided to become a windows app developer where I can feel at ease (I thought), then decided to become a web developer which is my current.. but I really felt more empty inside...

Maybe I'll tell things I enjoy about programming, so when I was a student, I enjoy the challenges of programming like creating the algorithm, finding the best algorithm option for the certain scenario etc. I hate UI (really hate UI, I wonder if there is a job where I won't be dealing with UI). On games I am more on the math side of the games calculating physics, geometry and mathematical side.. etc.. on windows application job, yes I came back to math (2D geometry focused application) in which I do enjoy but felt empty inside. I am still currently on math side since I just can't seem to have the interest to apply where I will be dealing with a lot of UI, though I still manage and develop UI, being on the math heavy side of programming limits the development of UI. 

Maybe I need to know more about other options like machine learning, Robotics | computer engineering and more options that I may not know but exists. Maybe tell me in the comments with details of what they do in actual jobs.

After all those, does anyone here felt to be in the same situation and was able to overcome it? Is someone currently in the same situation and what are you trying to do?"

Since reddit has been far more helpful than anyone working at the University, I'm back requesting some more guidance.

Now that I am a student at the university, I am following the expectations &amp; protocols regarding career planning. I am not interested in a traditional internship because I desire to go to law school post-graduation with the ultimate goal of becoming an entrepreneur, in the long-term. The purpose of strengthening my technical background for law school is to partake in an emerging industry / legal field called computational law.

Computational law is a framework used to understand how to solve legal issues using data analytics, blockchain/cryptosystems, and bespoke technology development. CL is a branch of legal informatics concerned with the mechanization of legal reasoning (whether done by humans or by computers). It emphasizes explicit behavioural constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct. Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing.

As you can imagine, this field is predicated on many technical concepts, including formal logic, both math and philosophy, which is why I am reaching out to you nerds.
I was hoping to speak to someone regarding any research project that may help me develop and advance my understanding of formal logic.

If anyone has ideas on whom I can speak to, or if you are involved with anything personally that we can explore together, I would greatly appreciate any directional steps to achieving my research goals for this summer!

Thanks for your time and consideration, and I look forward to speaking with y'all soon! :)"

lmvjui,3,2021-02-18,Should I try to get a job or go through with a PhD?,crashboxer1678,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/lmvjui/should_i_try_to_get_a_job_or_go_through_with_a_phd/,"This issue has been weighing on my (26F) mind for weeks now, and the added stress from both job searching and filing grad school applications has been a lot to bear. There are a lot of compounding details, but I acknowledge that I'm fortunate to have the opportunities I'm given and I feel bad for complaining about them. I'm so sorry to be a bother. 

I graduated with a Master's in industrial engineering in August last year, and graduating into a pandemic with no prospects was not fun. Ever since, I've been trying to find a position, applying for any and everything that has to do with Industrial Engineering or Mechanical Engineering (my Bachelor's). This yielded nothing fruitful, other than 5-6 interviews that didn't go anywhere. Because my internship experience dealt with ergonomics studies and my focus area in grad school was ergonomics, lately I've been attempting to shift focus and market myself as an entry-level occupational safety and health (OSH) engineer. I even got my First Aid/CPR/AED certification to support that, which has opened up a couple more applications here and there and a few more environmental health and safety (EHS) interviews, a broader field of OSH. I'm working on my OSHA 10-hour certification at the moment, taking a break from studying for the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam which would give me an Engineer-in-Training certificate as well. 

I would be excited to go to work, because I've never had a full-time engineering position before (went to grad school a year after undergrad), but during grad school I worked for a year as an engineering intern. Mostly getting a job would be a chance to help support my family full-time. On a related note, my (single) mom effectively retired from her work as an ER physician since a major organ surgery about 7-8 years ago, and we've been living on her disability checks ever since. All throughout my college career, I've had it in the back of my mind that I could help support us since I'm the oldest child (my sis is 23 and preparing for med school) and the most able since I would get my degrees first. But with nothing biting and no offers coming in, plus a very niche field that I'm in, I'm hesitant to keep going. I feel a little discouraged and somewhat ashamed that I can't be a stable provider. 

My IE graduate advisor, with whom I am very close, reached out to me a couple weeks ago and informed me that he has a 4-year tuition waiver and $2k monthly stipend if I wanted to apply and enter their IE program for a PhD degree, studying in the ergonomics track once more and centering my dissertation on a related ergo topic. I feel so fortunate to be offered, and that's more or less the only reason why I'm planning to apply. I know other students haven't been offered this chance (it's only available to US citizens, for instance, and there's a majority of international students in my grad school), so I'm hesitant to waste it. 

It's literally a free PhD and I'd be crazy not to take it, is what my brain (and my mom) are saying. The issue is that my advisor can only offer the waiver **starting in August 2021**, so it expires in **May 2025**. If I don't apply ASAP (deadline is 4/1) and attend in Fall, then I won't be able to afford it towards the end. 

A few other things are giving me pause: 

1. The ergonomics track doesn't really have any available professors to teach courses. So I barely took any ergo courses while there anyway, mostly focused on statistics and manufacturing courses. This isn't what I want. I even looked at other schools offering a PhD in Ergonomics, and while there is another with a tuition waiver and a $900 stipend, I'm simply not sure if I would be happier there. 

2. I'm not even sure if I would want to major in ergonomics or just industrial engineering as a whole. Mechanical engineering is out because my undergrad was a dumpster fire (I'm talking F's on my transcript). 

3. PhDs as a whole are a lot of work, and I have a couple of friends in the IE program there who are lamenting their degrees. I was super nervous when entering grad school for my Master's (after all, I *did* have F's on my college transcript) and the imposter syndrome was hard to face even when I received A's. I did great in grad school (3.83 GPA overall, my highest ever), but a PhD is a completely different ball game. That's not even mentioning the dissertation work I have to do throughout. I honestly don't even know if I *want* a PhD, whether at my former grad school or any other. I *just* got out of school, after all, and I'm burnt out. 

4. I really thought I could get a job and help or around the house by now. I would feel somewhat useless *still* being in school after all this time. I mostly feel bad because why isn't my Master's enough? Why aren't I good enough as-is?

5. Counting my engineering internship and a year working at a bookstore, I have *very* little professional experience. I would love to work somewhere, anywhere! But like I said, the fish just aren't biting and the pandemic has worsened matters. 

6. I've talked to a few OSH/EHS professionals, and they say that industries are less likely to hire PhDs because they cost too much. I'd be lucky to be a consultant by the time I'm done. I've also heard that a starting salary for someone with a Master's like me would be $50k-$60k, which is way better than the nothing that I make now, especially if I'm to advance through the years and move into different positions. 

7. I really, really don't want to be a professor. Maybe that feeling will change throughout, but I'm just not eager to do it. What I *am* eager to do is to get my foot in the door into industry.

8. Being long-distance away from my boyfriend (25M) is so difficult during long nights alone and stressed out from schoolwork. I would see him about once a month during grad school and it was for a weekend, so I'm lucky to have even that. But I always imagined that I'd be here in our home state instead of 3 hours away.

9. Classes at my former grad school aren't online. Some of my former classmates tested positive for COVID and I just don't want to expose myself. 

The only other benefits I could see with going back are: 

1. Access to on-campus counseling again. I've needed it, as my depression has worsened during the pandemic. 
2. Access to my doctor's clinic in town. Lower costs there than in my home state. 
3. Autonomy from my family (Mom in particular). I can actually have my boyfriend over during the night with no issue. 
4. $2000 monthly = $24k annually in personal funds. (But couldn't I make more than this at work? And without having to worry about being graded on my performance or cramming for exams?)

Everyone has chimed in by now - my boyfriend, my sister, my mom, my advisor, my friends - and I'm reeling from all the information I'm getting. I just need help making a decision. I haven't gotten anything done in about a week, and I've been in bed watching anime and YouTube because I'm just not sure what I should be doing right now. Thank you so much in advance."

One will be with The Aerospace Corporation (TAC; Non-profit) which I will be involved with digital electronics which is something that I am heavily passionate about. The other is in Southern California Edison (SCE) which will be involving Power Systems Engineering. My family wants me to go to SCE since according to them they are a more stable company, but I really love designing in the digital and also the analog realm of engineering, also I heard since TAC is nonprofit they have significantly fewer layoffs than traditional Aerospace companies. What are your thoughts? TAC pays $30/hour and SCE pays $23/hour. Both of which have a possibility of an extension and job offers.

THANK YOU."
lmyu1a,15,2021-02-18,What to do after computer science?,AnonNo125,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/lmyu1a/what_to_do_after_computer_science/,"I'll complete my undergraduate studies in computer science this semester. I focussed on getting a good GPA and completing my degree in three years (with TA positions and research), so I have no interesting personal projects to demonstrate what I've learned, or stories about group work to tell in behavioural interviews. As a consequence, I am not a desirable candidate for any software development internship positions, either because I don't seem like a team player, or because I lack previous experience in the industry. It seems like the software industry is oversaturated with entry-level candidates, some of which have had prior internships, so I currently don't stand a chance, and won't stand a chance until I have projects of my own to demonstrate that I am knowledgeable.

* Should I pursue a master's degree in computer science? I feel like that won't give me the experience specifically sought after by the software companies here in Montréal. The relevancy of the research I would do also may be an issue because it lacks buzzwords that hiring managers consider essential.
* Should I go do an undergraduate degree in software engineering? It seems to me like I would be forced to retake courses I have already completed, especially if I apply to Polytechnique. I would hope that the course equivalency system would exempt me from that, but McGill's more theoretical computer science courses may not be equivalent to what they offer. This options seems like a major setback since I believe an internship would be the most efficient and worthwhile opportunity of learning how to apply computer science on non-trivial projects.
* Should I try to learn by myself the tools used for the positions I've applied to? I would have to invest a lot of time using these tools in projects to actually demonstrate knowledge of them, and learning resources for them may be limited. If I only undertake these projects for the sake of learning, then hiring managers may perceive that those projects are worthless or uninteresting.
* Should I try a mix of two options? That is, I would pursue some other degree, focus less on grades and attend more hackathons, bootcamps, conferences, etc.?

**I don't know what to do. I'm stuck.** I don't want to spend a year filling in 300+ applications like they do over at r/csMajors or r/EngineeringResumes, acing HackerRank exams and whiteboard interviews, only to fail behavioural exams, all of that in the hopes that a company will someday give me the opportunity to prove myself. Because I'm graduating, I'm already losing some internship opportunities that are only offered to students that will resume their studies afterward, or who are only taking the internship for academic credits. My grades are that much less impressive because of the remote teaching, and the theoretical aspects of computer science do not impress hiring managers."

However every week or so I get messages from companies on my school's event/job website (Handshake) about Internship opportunities. I find it odd that companies are sending me software internship opportunities even though my profile says ""Senior"".

I'd much rather go straight into a full-time job after college but I can't be picky anymore considering I get constant rejections (haven't gotten any interviews yet 2 months in). All of my projects are video games and the like so I'm *assuming* non Game Dev positions probably just trash my resume. I'd like Game Dev positions the most but I can't limit myself nor do I know of any entry level or ""New Grad"" game developer positions anyways. I live in the New England area so I get why any West Coast companies wouldn't want to risk flying a no-name to their company (I have applied to companies only a state over but still rejection).

I guess my main question is, ""would joining an company as an intern after college help my future job search?"". I'm fine joining a lesser known company, so prestige or high income doesn't matter much to me."

Mechanical Engineering undergrad who is post-bacc and trying to get through school in my 30s in a pandemic. Woo!

I've been mostly part time (9 - 10 credit hours) with occasional full time (12 credit hours or more), and have mainly chosen part time because I also have to work and pay my rent/bills (like so many of us). I've also learned I rarely perform well with a full course load and working because my school is on a quarter system (10 - 12 weeks vs semester). So my result was I set boundaries that I would work part time so I could work enough hours to cover rent/utilities.

I would love to be full time and just get school over with altogether, and there are so many scholarships that offer funding if you're at full time or at a certain GPA. I'm worried I'm making myself miss out on extra scholarship funding because of the boundaries I set for myself, but also engineering school burn out is real. I guess I'm just feeling the pressures of trying to be as hire-worthy as possible with extra curriculars, good GPA for good internships, and project based experience vs balancing mental health. (I do know that upon getting hired and landing interviews your GPA is moot. Just thinking of it mattering *while* I'm in school)

I’ve taken some basic computer science classes, done basic projects in Excel, R, and Python, and introduced myself to SQL but I don’t have enough experience to get past the first screening. I’ve even done internships all four years, but some of them aren’t related to this career. I’ve even received awards from my university for hard work but that doesn’t seem to have helped at all.

Recently I’ve been networking (asking for career advice and informational interviews) with my supervisors, classmates, past TAs, and professors but I haven’t really had luck with getting an actual job offer. Also I’ve been attending career fairs and I’ve been to my university’s career center (mostly useless). 


It seems that to land a job with a company that will take a chance and give me work experience, I’ll have to be enrolled in a Masters program and do low paying internships. Is this my only option? I really didn’t want to go to grad school ($$$) without entering the workforce first but it seems to be the only path. I could try getting a min wage call center job for health insurance, but even they require some experience. 

I really need advice before I graduate and start floundering for real."

I also emigrated from Latin America to Spain seeking a better life. Now, after some specializations in Coursera and almost finishing my part-time postgraduate, I have right now two offers as a Data Analyst: a junior position in a recently lunch start-up (is an app) and an Intern position in a well-known company that was a start-up but is growing and is present in a lot of European countries.

I would appreciate knowing your perspective on this issue, like what things would you take into account to make the decision. Personally, my main goal is to enter the field of data analytics  (as I came from a finance background) and learn all that I can to develop a career in this field.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the pros and cons of the two:

1. Salary: the junior position doubles the intern, but I can live easily with the intern offer.
2. Contract: both are of 6 month.
3. Responsibilities: the junior position is more involved in product analytics of their app with some finance accounting tasks I will have to do. The intern is about finance analytics with automation and ETL processes.
4. Softwares: with the junior I will used Google Analytics and Amplitude and with the intern MySQL, Redshift and Python.
5. Team: in the junior position we will be just two persons, being myself the person where the Data Analysis will rely more because my boss is not in this area. In the intern, the team is of three persons all dedicated to the responsibilities in Data Analysis + a Manager.
6. Companies: the junior is in a company that is starting, and the intern is in a start-up in the growth phase with a great reputation in the market.
7. Future: the junior promise a permanent contract in which the finance accounting tasks will disappear and the intern promise a permanent contract (according to glassdoor the compensation will be better in the intern company in this case).

lnv68y,6,2021-02-19,University of Texas at Dallas vs. Texas Tech University,rollycheeseburger,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/lnv68y/university_of_texas_at_dallas_vs_texas_tech/,"Hello everyone. I’m a high school senior who’s in the process of deciding which college to go to. The following will be me breaking down what’s going on in my head and I want y’all to help me decide which college to go to. Tldr at the end because this is long :/

To give some information about myself, I’m an Asian male that’s wanting to be a business major that specializes in accounting and my career goal is to work for one of the big 4. I also live in the DFW area. I generally consider myself as an introvert but I don’t struggle to make friends. I’m also more in tune with the nerd culture with enjoying anime and video games. I love football and really want the true college experience on a big campus. 

The first deciding factor is cost. I come from a poor family so money is very important to me. After filling out my FAFSA, sending them to the two colleges, and receiving my financial aid package, my net cost for UTD is $1000 more than my net cost for TTU. Being a first gen student with immigrant parents, I don’t know if this extra $1000 to go to utd is a lot or not.

The second deciding factor is the campus lifestyle. TTU is known for their large campus with large amounts of social people. I really want this as I’m a very social person and love being around others. I also love all things sports especially and TTU is known for having great sports. I also want to be proud of my school and TTU has great school pride. UTD doesn’t have a large campus and they have a reputation of being anti social. UTD also doesn’t have any sports so it makes it hard to have school pride. The demographics for both schools is comfortable enough for me. I went to a high school with a majority Hispanic population with white as the second. 

The third deciding factor is quality of education. UTD’s business school is one of the best in Texas. Being able to go to UTD would allow me to get a better education and better connections which is very important for post college. UTD also has this 5 year masters accounting program which is very enticing and is very beneficial for post college life.Being located near Dallas helps me be able to find internships and future job opportunities. I don’t know that much about TTU’s business school. I haven’t done much in depth research about it but at first glance it isn’t as strong as UTD. In the end, we go to college to get an education that’ll set us up for our future jobs.

These are the major points that are being considered for my decision. I want to know what y’all think about this and correct me if I made any mistakes. I’m very 50/50 on both of these schools and y’all would be the best people to ask about pertaining to this topic. 

Tldr: Basically my decision comes down to ttu campus life vs utd’s far superior connections,job future, and education."

Looking forward, Need advice:

I'm looking for advice on what I can do in and out of work to reach the peaks of a career in software engineering. Are there books you recommend every software developer should read? Are there things you wish you would have been doing or did when you began your career? What should I always keep in mind, what are some pitfalls (technical, interpersonal, financial, etc) to avoid? What productivity/efficiency techniques have helped you the most in your career? Any blogs or podcasts you recommend that touch on these things? 



A bit of my history: 

tldr: graduated with no internships at age 27, Went from unpaid internship to 73k dead end position, to a 100k offer that I start next month.

I come from a poor immigrant family (Mexican), my dad is dead. I went back to school at 22 after waking up in a soulless, full-time, minimum wage job in a factory wondering how I got there and whether I could find a more impactful path in life. I managed to knuckle down and jump from a community college to 4-year university which I graduated from last year right as COVID hit. 

The job hunt began with no internships under my belt and as expected resulted in a SCARCE amount of interviews. 

I started an unpaid  internship with a group of MBAs who were part of a UCI  start-up incubator. I wrote a simple Alexa skill using NodeJS that allowed a user to book an appointment with a (simulated) clinic. Even though it was relatively simple features, being thrust into AWS IAM intricacies and so on felt very overwhelming as I was their only developer. We reached a project checkpoint right before summer and I resigned to find a paid job, ready to work at a grocery store if I had to while I job hunted. I wasn't in a position to be unemployed for very long.

Luckily, I got hired full time at 73k with TCS in August as part of a huge hiring surge they were conducting during COVID. They are a behemoth of bureacratic tape and after a positive initial experience in the training phase, all coding stopped and a dizzying shuffling began where I felt like I was lost in a crack of the company not coding anything and having no direction at all. I was on leetcode grinding and learning each day, sending out applications. 

A recruiter reached out on LinkedIn one day in late November and after a series of interviews with the company I got an offer for 100k that I start soon and want to bring a consistent ""A game"" to. My family tree pivots forever here with me, and I'm ready to do what it takes and apply all that I can muster to be competent enough to continue on this path seeking  mastery."

I've recently gotten an internship for this upcoming summer at an Air Force base for a position in the ""Strategic Planning &amp; Integration Division"" it comes with little detail from what they had given me. I'm assuming this is due to many different types of work/projects a person would deal with there, but from what I got.

It seems I'd be handling more so documents and development/oversight of the main director.

They've offered $18/hour, which I'm not too bothered with as this will finally be my first tech-related job.

While I plan on more to the software engineering field, if anyone has been in a position similar to this if they can entail me more on what to expect and if this is something I should consider if I was to want more of a programming job later down the line?

I as well apologize if this is kind-of vague as this is all the information I could seem to get.

For some background, I dropped out of school (studying computer science at a decent state school - 70 credits completed) back in 2017 due to issues with addiction. Thankfully, I was able to get help and these issues have since been addressed. Over these past three + years, I returned to the work force in a simple retail job, eventually moving onto a software support position for an electronic medical record. I didn’t immediately return to school after getting help partly because I didn’t know what I wanted to do, and partly because I need to save money in order to pay a school balance to release my transcript. 

After working at my current job for a bit over a year and gaining some “professional” experience, I now have a clearer idea of what I want out of life and my career. I recently started programming again to see if it would “grab me” and it definitely has. I’m enjoying coding after work and improving a skill. I would like to use loans and return to school full time this fall for computer science (after paying off my balance owed at my previous school). 

Here’s where I’m looking for input: I currently dislike my job and would like to get out of it. I believe I’m qualified for a software engineering internship based on my previous schooling and recent projects I’ve put together. I would also enjoy spending the summer improving my programming full time. The issue is that I’m not currently enrolled in school. If things go according to plan I would like to be enrolled for the fall semester within the next few months. For those with industry experience, do some companies generally look past this kind of thing and hire those not currently enrolled? Should I be explaining that I am not currently enrolled in my resume / cover letter? Is this a viable plan? Any input and or alternative courses of action would be greatly appreciated 🙂"

I don't mind trying for ABAs as I do have a small portfolio of web development works that showcase skills/strong interest (mostly front-end projects like websites, simple games and utilities), though I heard that NUS ABA still has a strict cut-off of 83+ RP (regardless of portfolio, interest etc.). With that in mind, is it still worth trying to beef the portfolio up with internships, more varied/extensive projects etc.?

I don't mind trying for courses related to CS (esp some of the more theoretical ones like Math lol), even going overseas to do so, but I'm not sure if there are many courses like CS at NUS\*\*\*.

Which one should I pick and why?

A little more info about box and HubSpot:

Box is a really cool place to work at, since they let interns talk to employees and choose which team they want to work for. After seeing their past projects, interns seem to make a really big impact.

HubSpot has an amazing culture that I enjoyed, even as an interviewee. They care a lot for their employees, and have consistently been one of the top 5 companies to work at according to Glassdoor. They have a strong engineering department and interns are treated no different from full-time employees, allowing interns to make a really big impact through their internship.

I go to my fellow freshman and they aren’t even bothered about thinking of internships, “freshman don’t get internships” I’m sick of this phrase it’s too demotivating and the fact that this is being engraved in everyone’s minds no freshman ever tries to develop their application by starting early, learning things by themselves, etc.

One moment, I’m invigorated and I find the motivation and spontaneity to try out many different new things like finding internships. The next moment, I wonder what the point of all this is for. Yeah, I see the practical purpose of getting an internship. I’m a well-performing student, I understand why it’s often crucial in Singapore. When I was signing up and got the offers, I was HYPED. I couldn’t wait for it. But now, I’m thinking.. what’s the point of this? I get an internship so that I can form connections, build invaluable working life experiences and boost my portfolio so that my future employers will be more inclined to employ me. I get a job and then I work every day.... but for what? 

I’m not suicidal or anything, but I often contemplate the meaning of life. Everything feels so mundane. Why do we even work? I know we have to. Of course, people start businesses and more, not everyone is caught up in the traditional rat race. But even when I think about businesses and the prospect of being so rich that you retire, I still don’t see what the purpose of life is. 

This doesn’t apply to just jobs. Sometimes, I look at people and I wonder what’s the purpose of hanging out. I have plenty of friends and a few I’d consider extremely close and in the moment, I seriously enjoy the time I spend with them. All the laughter and the joy, but when I’m sat here typing this, I wonder — seriously, what’s the point of all this? 

Why do some people say they’re so passionate about, for example, computer science or business? I love learning about businesses btw, but sometimes I wonder, why the hell do I like it? I study, I get an internship then eventually I work to get money so that I can pay for meals and more. Huh? I know this is just life but it just seems really pointless idk man I’m rambling

I’m just confused, that’s all."

Started as an intern out of college and worked my way up and got promoted to a senior engineer last year. I was the ""first"" discipline engineer in our department when I started and now there are many other same discipline engineers in our department. I'm at a point now where I've seen how all the projects and programs work within the company and can pretty much put out any fire that comes up or do anything needed without much supervision. I have very good relationships with the director (my manager when I joined) and VP of engineering. I have been treated very well and have seen my salary almost double within 6 years. Both of them have been very accommodating and supporting and have pushed hard to bring me to where I am. Director has told me multiple times that if I need anything or want to talk about my career/future that I can come to him. We have even taken holiday ski trips with other coworkers as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no legitimate reason to leave at this moment... The pay is decent, the work/life balance is great, commute is short, co-workers are friendly and fun to work with.

One thing to note is that there have been many rounds of layoffs this past year with COVID. I'm fairly confident that I will be one of the last ones to be let go if the situation does not improve, so I'm not too worried about job security at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I do have a want to pursue other opportunities in different industries to expand my knowledge and expertise as well as increase my earning potential. I could stay at my current position, but I would be doing pretty much the same thing with every new project unless I move into management, which I'm not too fond of doing at the moment. I've been looking at postings online and have found some opportunities that I think would be a nice fit where I can use the skills I've learned and apply to different industries/products. I haven't applied to any postings, just browsing to see what options are out there. Realistically I would start applying maybe a few months from now, once the current project closes out.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to blindside my bosses with a 2wk notice if I were to apply to a new position. So, I was considering talking to them about what my current plan/position is as a courtesy/time to set up ""successor"". However, I'm conflicted because I feel like I would also be ""showing my hand"" too early. What would be best course of action?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

* Been at company 7 years, have a very good relationship with director &amp; VP. They have taken care of me very well since I started.
* Despite multiple rounds of layoffs, I'm very confident about my job security
* No ""real"" reason to leave other than wanting to venture out to different industries and better pay
* Realistically would be a few months from now if I were to start applying for new positions

&amp;#x200B;

* Should I inform my bosses about my position/stance of wanting to venture out to different opportunities once current project comes to an end?"

My father is a toxic prick, mom... She's pretty much OK, until her pendatic mood kicks in.  
I'm 28-yo man with Asperger Syndrome (which pretty much was absorbed to ASD wholly from medical point of view). Father is serving in military (yet), mom is without job (despite looking for it for around year after her workplace got closed forever).  


How long I'm suicidal?  


Earliest time would be the first class of elementary school. It was so far away, it felt like a literal prison for me. I was so bullied there (much like many folks like me). Yet, I didn't wanted to kill myself then. First attempt was in middle school. Due to some stupid (in my opinion) regulations like wearing ID's on neck. I felt like a cattle in some big farm...  


Then, my hell started around being expelled from college on the last year (let's just say that I've put my trust into my promoter). Then, 4 years trying to get a job (of course, I've tried to get some internships and such, without success to keep the job). Then, I've finally got a job as an e-commerce worker.   
In meanwhile, I was bullied mostly by my father. Mostly psychological violence (but there was at least one instance of getting beating, and some threats of evicting me straight onto street). They say that they're doing this not for bad intent, but for my own good.  


Thankfully, I was intelligent enough to see, what's going on. Tried to look for help, yet what I've got was just the help, to at least calm down my mom. My father... well, when he had some tours on duty off, it was pretty much OK in home. I was OK, my mom quite less (lack of job), yet there was a peace.  


And then, 28th January, he returned from his third tour, and perhaps he'll soon retire (if not already, idk).  


Once, I've attempted to try jumping from bridge, where below was a railway track with overhead line. 3 kV. I just wanted to end this nightmare of mine once and for all, and to show them (especially my father) what I was feeling for all those years.  


Yet, I didn't. Due to fear. I was so damn weak... Yet, that allowed me to rethink about why I've tried to end my life, and the conclusion was clear: if I die, they'll win. I so hated to lose. And that one conclusion was the reason why I'm still living. To make my enemies grind their teeth. But I don't know, how long I could carry on, especially that I have also two brothers (one of which also have AS, but in milder form), both of which are living on their own. Only I remained with them. I have so enough of them...  


PS: Forgot to tell that I've had a one grandmother, who passed over 3 years ago. Her death was pretty much very painful to me. I so wished to exchange my life for hers... My mom was particularly hit very hard by this.  


PS2: Some people may pity upon me, but no, thanks. I just want to be understand. Especially now, when SARS-CoV-2 effectively screwed the public health system in my country, so I'm effectively cut-off from psychologist and psychiatrist."

I will graduate this December with an EECS undergrad degree and am curious how December grads have handled their next steps.

Some general questions of mine:

1. When did you start reaching out to companies about full-time employment?
2. What was the timeline like for the applications? At what point did you interview and receive full-time offers (was it during the fall? November-ish? Not until after you'd already graduated?)
3. For what part of the year (or how long after graduation) did you tell companies you were searching for a job? January right after graduating? Spring? Summer? The following fall?
4. How beneficial was the fall career fair (the year of your graduation)?
5. How did your previous internships help? Did you receive return offers? If so, when did you receive them? What was that process like?
6. If you did not work starting right after graduation, what did you do until you began work?
7. If you had a lease until the following May or September in Ann Arbor, how did you handle that? Did you search for remote work until it expired? Did you just sublet to someone else instead and begin work elsewhere anyways?
8. Any other general advice or tips?

Any insights would be super helpful.

In terms of my status, my only internship experience will be this summer (it was cancelled last year). I haven't yet done much to reach out to companies about full-time work. There are a couple companies I interviewed for an internship with and withdrew my app once I accepted my internship, so I think I will prioritize reaching out to them about full-time (as well as many other companies).

Thanks so much!"

Recently, my wife got a new job in a field that she is very pleased with and that makes enough money that I feel comfortable taking a bit more of a risk. My problem is that whenever I look at job postings, I start feeling down on myself, feeling like I know next to nothing about my major. I would love to be a software engineer, but I'm not sure what companies expect graduates without work experience to know. I didn't have any internships, and I no longer have access to the projects I did in college.

Is there a resource out there that can help me determine what I'm expected to know? Should I be building a portfolio and what kind of projects should I put in it? Should I just apply for any job that requires less then 3 years experience and be open that I want to learn but don't have the foundational knowledge right now?

Any advice would be appreciated, this is an immense pressure because I want to provide for my family. I'm willing to put in whatever time I need to, but I don't know if my best option is to keep plugging away and applying, or to take a bit and self teach what I should know from college."

I feel like my USC essays are pretty good but I loved my Carnegie Mellon essays, probably the best I’ve written.



LORs:

Two from science teachers that both knew me in AP Bio, APES, and AP Chem. I wrote strong requests giving plenty of information to write a strong letter. They have been known to write strong letters, so probably 7/10 from both. Counselors at our school change every year due to career switches and the sheer size of our school. I expect her to just relist my resume, probably a 5/10

I recently graduated from a top US institution (top 15 in the world, top 10 in the world for my field) with a Computational Mathematics degree and am aiming to apply for the following in the next 2-3 years:

1. UWaterloo MMath in Computer Science (co-op + coursework option)
2. U of Toronto Msc in Applied Computing (MscAC) in Computer Science
3. UBC MSc in Computer Science

My profile:

I am an international student.

GPA : Cumulative GPA (over 4 years) - 3.15/4.0 , Last two years (only junior and senior level Math and CS courses taken) - 3.36/4.0, Final-year GPA - 3.80/4.0

GRE : have not taken

Work experience : one 3-month internship at a startup (more data science oriented though)

Research experience: none

I've struggled with medical conditions throughout my undergrad years and was even put on reduced course load. Before that, I was doing very poorly in classes because of it and my GPA was consistently low. However, my GPA has been on an upwards trajectory for the last 2 years. I have been undergoing treatment and hope to be better within the next few years.

1. Is there anything I can do to improve my GPA or explain my GPA situation to the admissions committee? How low are my chances because of this?
2. I'm currently looking for full-time positions in industry cause I need to earn money to support myself. Is there any work experience that is more valued than others?
3. How can I improve my profile in the next few years to be a competitive applicant?
4. Are there any other programs that you think my profile would be a good fit for or I can make my profile realistically good enough for?

I am open to other countries that are immigration-friendly as well.

Ideally, I want an environment/program that is very industry-focused (co-ops, good networking opportunities with companies, good career resources, etc) and I'm interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and NLP."

1. what would you recommend? 
2. What are the hard parts
3. What are your GENUINE advices? 
(That’s not “work hard, don’t procrastinate”)
4. is there also genuine sexism in computer science against women?

I’m f(16) very interested in CS, mainly software engineering, general programming and game programming. So far everyone I asked about CS says that CS is incredibly hard to get into. Especially with jobs, scholarships and internships alongside grades. (Also people saying that females don’t belong in it either.)"

I am REALLY interested in applying for a deferred MBA program at the best universities but I am not sure if I should even do that. 

About: I have a GPA of \~3.3 (BSc. Computer Science from one of the top liberal arts college). I haven't taken GRE yet (cause not sure if I should apply).  I have internship experience in software development, externship at one of the Big4, I lead some college clubs and have won some awards at hackathons and other competitions. I have also secured a full-time job at a top investment bank as a tech analyst.

I work in a genetics research lab and have learned PCR and gel electrophoresis, but have recently pushed to be put on a more computational project, which will be granted to me. Apparently for my new project, I’ll be learning how to analyze a large genetic dataset using some bioinformatics programs.

I have significantly less software experience than biological knowledge, but I’m not a total beginner. Proficient in Java and Python but haven’t learned anything related to bioinformatics yet. 

I am wondering what sort of experiences I should seek out for the summer and any future summers? So far I have been applying to research programs at other universities with anything related to genomics or biological data science. Should I be looking at pure software experiences to balance out and gain more knowledge in that field before zeroing in on bioinformatics? Are industry internships more valuable than simply building my skill set off of research opportunities if I’m looking to go into industry one day?

I’m also scared to apply for industry internships because I feel like I don’t know enough to really make an impact at a company.

Any advice appreciated, and thank you!!"

**Additional Information:**

\-I originally planned to apply to &lt;10 colleges, but after I got accepted early into my match/safety school (Texas A&amp;M), I went batshit crazy on applications and no-lifed two months to write and revise essays lol. I don't recommend anyone else do this unless you're extremely motivated and willing to sacrifice a lot for 1-2 months. However, I would recommend to apply to as many schools that you would highly consider going to.

\-Really surprised I got into UT Austin for engineering since I had relatively low stats, but I guess my EC's, LOR, and essays really carried. A lot of my friends with higher stats got capped/rejected from UT. So far in my experience, I'm a good example of when someone says ""stats aren't everything"".

\-Also really surprised I haven't got waitlisted/rejected yet. UIUC and Purdue are great engineering schools, and I put the least amount of effort into those essays. Nevertheless, I'm expecting to get rejected by 95% of the schools I'm still waiting on.

*\*When I say average stats, I mean in comparison to the colleges that I'm applying to. I apologize in advance if it appears I come off as pretentious.*"

On the one hand, I really, really would prefer to stay with embedded systems and computer engineering -- which WDC seems right in the thick of. On the other hand, Edison, as a utility company is a slam dunk, no risk, practical choice and their employee benefits seem pretty tops. However, I'm less sure about what their internship is regarding -- it seems like data analysis by the sounds of it. At any rate, it seems to be leaning towards software development but I'm not opposed to that idea.

Both are requesting 40 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer and the pay is comparable.

I'm looking at both companies as long term future employers and their reviews  on Glassdoor or Indeed give me pause to reconsider WDC -- but I don't really know how much salt to give to this.

I'm 25 years old and I think I will not be able to get a job. College was really a struggle for me and I switched majors multiple times because I was not sure of what I wanted to do as a career. I made very slow progress accumulating credit hours toward graduation and I suffered from severe depression, anger, and social anxiety. Along with having Autism and ADHD.

Even though I found a group of friends, I was always behind and never got a job or internship. Mental health services at my university were really hard to access.  I briefly pledged a fraternity, but had to drop soon after because I ended up having a stroke at age 21 which left me with right-side homonymous hemianopia and focal epilepsy. Plus, it cost too much.

 I ended up having to go home and finish my degree online because of health and financial reasons. I had only accumulated about 60 credits as a senior and I ended up working hard on my online degree in Political Science for three years before graduating with a bachelors in fall of 2020. However, I did not get any experience with any sort of work, volunteering, or experience outside of school. To add insult to injury, I only graduated with a 2.4 GPA. Which was after me working my ass off to bring up from an even worse gpa of 2.2.

 I've only had two brief(month long at most) jobs, one of which was a job in a warehouse which I left because of a messy fallout with the manager (complicated situation) and another as a driver for Postmates, which I had to stop because I lost the ability to drive after having my first Grand Mal seizure. I think I know what I want to do, but I don't know how I can possibly get there given my circumstances. I want to write speeches for people, specifically politicians, but I have no experience. 

I've gotten therapy in my home town which was only slightly helpful in getting me through college, but my results flatlined after a while and therapy stopped working. The only bright side is that I've been getting exercise from lifting, running, and Jiu-Jitsu. Even still, those have not been able to build up my mental health.

I'm at the end of my rope. I want so bad to move out of my parents house and get an apartment and a job, but I don't possibly know where to begin. My sole focus was college for the past six-and-a-half years and I fear I've lost all employability. 

What do I do?"

I mean you go to college to get a degree right? I have no idea what I’m going to after. I don’t have a the GPA to work at an Investment Bank which is what I got into Economics to do, I don’t have any idea what I can do with what I learned with Communications other than being a good public speaker... I’m just on the cusp of not being mediocre on paper but have no idea of a way to get my foot in the door anywhere. I thought by now I’d be looking to what I’m going to be doing.

I feel like college has just been a huge waste of time but everyone says you need a degree. 

Did I choose the wrong degree?
Did I waste time going to college? 
How can I get myself into successful situation?
How hard to employers judge a DUI?

So I’ve started with a new company around 10 months ago and just can’t seem to get anywhere with my team and have no idea why.After I speak in group calls it’s usually silence.For instance the boss was being rude with one of my co workers and I decided it wasn’t fair and and stuck up for him(something I would never do for myself)and the guy just done a 180  reversed his position and left me hanging while it was awkward silence from everyone else.Then around two weeks ago we were having a team building zoom game where everyone had to tell a funny story it was silence after mine while everyone else engaged with eachothers story’s.I feel like I just can’t be part of the conversation.I don’t want to put it down to a male dominated environment I think its more me as this  has happened in other company’s.I’m feeing pretty down about it all and work has become a very lonely place any advice you guys have would be much appreciated.

Thank you all for your input 

I’ll give you guys some more info.English isn’t my first language I’m a South American female that has relocated to Europe and I’m in tech.The Team lead  is a bit of a bully and in most meetings I have to watch people being bullied including myself.For some reason which I put down to being too agreeable I don’t stand up for myself but when I see someone else not being treated fairly I speak up.On the mentioned example the guy from my team was trying to point out some legitimate points and the team lead just stopped him and said we don’t need to hear that. I spoke up and said I wouldn’t mind hearing what the guy had to say and the reasons why what he was saying was valuable.The response was “I’m not here to propose ideas I’m here to action” Then silence and they moved on I think that if it was someone else saying my exact words then there would have been a reaction and not just silence.Also another example is that interns who joined the team a few weeks ago are already part of a WhatsApp group with the team I’m senior and didn’t even know there was one before last Thursday.As far as a walk around introduction I haven’t had one my manager reply’s to me with I’m senior and I should be doing this stuff on my own even though I’ve seen him help other seniors in the company.I’ll answer more individual questions on the thread and thank you all for taking the time to respond"

lowa9a,291,2021-02-21,Tech Support in the Desert - The Server and The Internet,UrchinJoe,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/lowa9a/tech_support_in_the_desert_the_server_and_the/,"Hi TFTS.  A few years ago I wrote some tales from my time in central Africa ""Tech Support in the Swamp"": [communications](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6klxc2/tech_support_in_the_swamp_communications/), [computers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6cwoxq/tech_support_in_the_swamp_computers/), and [the generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/69y997/tech_support_in_the_swamp_the_generator/).  Since then I've spent about half my time back home in the UK, and the other half in the Middle East, managing the logistics department for an organisation that provides aid to one of the conflict-affected countries in the region.  And I think I have another tale to tell.

It was the summer of 2018, and everything was normal.  I'd been back from the swamp for a couple of years, found a safe job in an office in town, got married, and found a nice little flat to live in.  But nothing lasts forever; my big projects at work were starting to wrap up, and HR were revving up their engines to start moving people into different business units.  ""I should take a short-term contract in the field"" I suggested ""six months maybe.  It'd be somewhere nice, you can visit regularly, we'll see the tourist hot-spots and save money on flights, 'cos I'll be working there"".

So I arrived in the beige, dry, hilly where I'd spend the next two years, working remotely with a handful of procurement staff and an ITC assistant on a war in the neighbouring country.

**The 'Server'**

All of our live documents and archives were stored on Dropbox accounts - one for the east of the country, which had been set up by a former member of staff, who was still paying for it, and one for the west (I never did figure out who owned that one).  Everyone in the capital had access to both accounts, staff in the east only had access to the east, and staff in the west didn't have access to either, but a small support team in a third country managed that for them.  For some reason, any documents that needed to be shared between all bases were stored on the 'west' Dropbox - the one which fewest people used, and which we had least certainty about whether we'd still have access to it tomorrow.

This seemed like as good a place as any to start upgrading our technology.  The IT assistant's job description said something like ""make sure we have Wi-Fi and fix the photocopier if it breaks"", but I figured if the same person wrote that, who signed off on the Dropbox, they probably hadn't tested his IT knowledge in much detail.  Turned out, I was right.  His English wasn't great (and my Arabic is close to non-existent), but he obviously knew a lot more than I do about IT, and he was super-motivated to take on additional responsibilities, with a view to getting promoted, to support his young family.  Let's call him Abed.  And at around the same time, the guy who was paying for the 'east' Dropbox applied for a job in the capital.  Let's call him Winston.  I hired Winston, with a view to overhauling all of our systems (whether technology or procedural).

Abed was keen to set up a physical server in the capital office, but hadn't been able to justify it to management.  I tasked him with writing up a business case for it (with some support), which was approved.  The biggest risk, we figured, was that staff in the east of the country might not have good enough internet connectivity - but we had a good officer out in the field who we could work with to test alternatives before the go-live date.  Actually this went more-or-less to plan.  It wasn't possible to sync with the server from the field, but nor was it possible to have a reliable one-on-one Skype call, and they could connect via VPN to access what they needed.  All the files were transferred over on a weekend... giving us an identical clone of the old Dropbox.

Not everything went smoothly.  I hired an intern to consolidate all the files into one place.  This took a long time.  Actually I'm not sure if she's finished yet.

Surprisingly, we had more issues in the capital and the west, than the east.  In the capital we'd decided to primarily use the server's sync function, rather than the website or VPN.  Everything was fine for about 24 hours...

**'The Benito Conflict'**

Benito worked in our Finance department.  He'd arrived fresh from a short stint in a warzone somewhere in West Africa, and was looking forward to the comparative normalcy of an office job.  Benito didn't speak much English, and he worked hard, for long hours.  Perhaps that's why, at some point on day two, we started to notice duplicate files in the server, all of them with the text ""Benito's conflicted copy"".  At first just one or two, but soon there were conflicted copies of pretty much everything - and they were more up to date than the original files.  I think for a couple of days, before we came up with a solution, everyone was working with Benito's conflicted files.

Everyone in the capital, at least.  The team in the east hadn't had any problems with their files, presumably because they were accessing everything over the VPN.  So we switched everyone onto VPN and the problem went away... that is, until about two weeks ago.  I asked one of my former colleagues to send over a copy of a file in needed, and there it was:  ""Logistics department's conflicted copy"".

**Network Connection Problems**

With the capital office up and running on one system, the archives gradually consolidating, and the Benito Conflict resolved, we turned our attention to the field.  Abed and Winston had worked together on an IT upgrade plan for the whole country, considering hardware needs on each base, what ISPs were operating in the local markets (and making a decent effort to work out which ones were shell companies), to wider contextual challenges (there was a rumour, which I don't think was ever substantiated, that a neighbouring country's military was ""jamming the internet"" over a wide area).  They'd used this to develop a detailed dossier of tendering documents, with clear specifications and technical evaluations and a pricing structure based on service levels.  And they'd done this in time to evaluate our options before the current contracts expired.

This generated some complaints from the field offices.  To some extent this was just general bellyaching about change.  To some extent it was a misguided effort to minimise spending - ""these new contracts will be more expensive!"", came the complaint.  The funds all ultimately come from the same central source and don't necessarily impact on a base manager's local budget, so I've never fully understood this; so we pushed ahead, making sure field teams understood that the funding was there, and the results would be great.

And they were!  The first base - a one-horse town between two or three front lines and a stone's throw from a very well known conflict hotspot was connected in mid-2019.  Group Skype calls between budget holders, project managers, and support staff became common.  Disconnections became rare.  Information became accessible.  And the war became closer.  A lot closer.  We had to evacuate the base in late 2019, taking as many assets as possible with us.

Base two came online a little later, and being further from the fighting, stayed online.  One piece of hardware we'd used on base one wasn't licenced for use on base two, and there were unpublished caps on what an ISP could charge.  The latter was essential to protect local companies from outside competition; the former is probably because the local authorities couldn't intercept data from that particular piece of tech.  Anyway, we found all that out a little late, probably due to miscommunication (in part due to the poor quality internet on base two).  There were ***some*** threats of legal action, but with a bit of wrangling we made the necessary changes and avoided getting any fines (or worse).

The support unit in the neighbouring country was a little more complicated:  we were on a short-term lease in a building we didn't expect to stay in permanently, so it wasn't worth investing in much hardware, so connection speeds were limited, and getting anything off the server using the VPN was ***very*** slow.  To solve that Winston set up a Dropbox - I'm not actually sure if this was the original one - that synced with the server behind the scenes, so while there might be a delay in documents becoming available (i.e. an overnight delay), once they were on there the support team had easy access.

There's no punchline to this story - the work is still going on, but I've moved home to the UK.  Abed is still there - he's been promoted twice and he's hiring his own team of assistants.  Winston designed a database so the capital, the field offices, and HQ could all have visibility of our data, then took over logistics for the west of the country and carried on making improvements.  And the organisation hired a Systems Manager to work out what comes next."

First,sorry for my english,not my first language.

  
So, for the first time, i just got a job in programming. I took the place of a programmer who worked in the company for some years,and did all of the intern systems (3 or 4 web applications). It is a beginner job ( i don't know how you guys call it in the US).

He used mostly Code Igniter (older version,1.7 i think) , PHP (5.6),and a lot of front-end (HTML,CSS,JS...),using MVC. Everything connects to a database (SQL Server).

I don't have much problem with front-end or with SQL server

But im struggling a lot with the back end. His code is monolithic,and very old. And it is pretty confusing. He uses a lot of PHP functions i never heard of, i can't find his variables , i can't finde where exactly he is connecting the front end with the back end. Sometimes i need to change a field that is giving an error, but i just can't find it. Im using Sublime Text, so i cant debug. I literally need to CTRL+Shift+F my way all day to have some hint in where i should start with.  


Im struggling a lot with PHP and OOP in his code. Can you guys give me some hints,please? Is there something i can do to make things easier? Any video, or online courses that can help me with OOP on PHP? How can i read his code better?  


Thanks!"

My question is to people doing internships/Full-time work.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to learn something new, work on a side project, work on something that can be another source of income, How do you allot time to those tasks? What time would you prefer? After a few hours reaching home or early in the morning?

I'm asking this because I have started an internship in a company. The timing is 8:30 AM to 6 PM. I feel exhausted and drained after reaching home. I really wish to learn something different from the stack I am using in the company( .Net Core and Angular).

I wanted to improve my coding skills, work on Data structures and algorithms, try solving problems, and grow. But after reaching my room, I don't have the energy to do anything.

So, I would like to know how you all are doing it. So that people like me would be able to extract something from your routines and create a suitable plan for themselves."

I took an embedded class and it was the most fulfilling course I took in university. I've been working as an SRE for a set of web services for the past year however, and I'd like to shift into something that's more fulfilling/engaging. 

Most embedded jobs I've seen have required a number of years of experience in embedded or an computer engineering degree. I haven't seen any entry-level jobs in the field so I can only assume they come from undergraduate internships. 

I know the old adage of making experience with side projects in CS but that can be difficult while working a full time job and embedded projects are not as simple to do on your own as API. I do have some simple projects I'm slowly working on, but I was wondering if anyone has any advice for breaking into that field after graduation. 

Thanks in advance :)

edit: 

If anyone knows where to best look for such jobs it would also be very helpful. Currently LinkedIn and Indeed are where I've been looking."

In December I graduated with my bachelors degree in Business administration and a concentration in Agribusiness. I’ve been looking to start a career since November with little success. The job market in my area is incredibly competitive and COVID hasn’t made that any better. I’ve had several interviews but no offers yet. Now, I’m interviewing for two positions that I am fairly confident I will get. One of them is for an internship with a great company that is in my field of study, and the position excites me. It’s a 3 month paid internship, and the company has hired over half of their interns as full time employees in the past... I would love to work for this company but there is no guarantee of full time work after my internship is complete. The other job I’m interviewing for is an entry level job at a company I don’t care about at all. I have no passion for what the company does and no drive to work in the industry, but the position is the type of job I want, and it will give me the experience I need to succeed later on. 
My question is: if all goes well and I’m offered both positions, should I follow my heart and take the internship, accepting the uncertainty of employment afterwards, or should I take the stable full time position that I am not excited about."

lp3udd,3,2021-02-21,Internships &amp; US Visa (green card) situation,hivasect,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lp3udd/internships_us_visa_green_card_situation/,"This post is more about my wife's situation rather than me.

A little background - my (now) wife is originally from the UK, and while there, started a BS in CS online program at a US university. The plan was to get her here to the US to get married, do internships, graduate, and get a job. She came to the US in October 2019 via K-1 Fiance Visa, and we got married 2 months later in December and immediately filed for her adjustment of status for her green card, which would authorize her to work. 

However, COVID happened and is delaying her green card interview process probably due to USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) closing down for a few months and being backlogged to high hell. Fast forward to now, it is now a little over a year since we filed for her green card and still no update from USCIS. She is on track to completing her degree by around 2023. 

Ideally, she would be interning before she graduates, but now we have to account for the fact that it might be a while before she receives her green card and she might not have a chance to intern at all before graduation if this keeps up. I know how much internships, while not necessary, helps immensely in securing that first job and it would be really be unfortunate if she was not able to capitalize on this. 

It's still 2 years away, but she is aiming for the competitive internships at bigger companies, and I know for those you have to apply super early. So far, all she can do is just practice Leetcode and/or build projects. She could also delay graduation, but I don't think that's a good idea.

Are there any other better ideas/alternatives of what she can do?"

The last of the fighter practice’s ‘mini conferences’ broke up and everyone began to file out the door. Enibal sighed inwardly and pushed down thoughts about his Aunt’s attaché while he nodded his goodbyes to his bond-brother. Henry, however, gave him a look and indicated that he should stay, so he sat back in his chair and continued to enjoy his drink. Vashna stopped on her way to the door when she noticed he hadn’t followed, but he motioned for her to go on without him. She took a fleeting look at Henry, grabbed her marshaling staff from beside the door, and hurried out. *She has come to enjoy the fighting a great deal, especially standing right there next to the fighters with that stick so she can ensure their safety. She may not want to fight herself, but she loves being right on the edge of it all.*

The door closed, and he only realized he’d been staring at Vashna’s swaying hips when he heard Henry chuckle. His blush went all the way up his arms. When he turned back Henry handed him a drink, something far stronger than the tea he’d been enjoying.

They took a moment to enjoy the whiskey before Henry spoke, “You know, if you don’t go ahead and take that girl up on what she is offering before long she is going to get offended. Either that or she is going to jimmy the lock to your door at night and turn you every which way but loose. I’m not sure which would be more dangerous.”

Enibal jerked his eyes up towards his bond-brother, who looked at him in amusement. “I hardly think that such a thing would be appropriate, even to be joked about. She is barely more than half my age, Henry! …”

Henry interrupted him with a shrug and a wave of his hand. “So what?”

Enibal blinked a moment in confusion. “So! Look, I know you humans have similar attitudes to us about taking advantage of younger people. For us it is just as strong a taboo regardless of the gender paring, but that isn’t the point here. The point here…”

“Is that she is old enough to decide things for herself, and mature enough that there is no taking advantage. She isn’t some starry-eyed intern falling for charisma, nor is she looking to marry you for your station. Hell, based on the way she holds herself I would bet that you would be the one marrying up if it got to that point.”

Enibal shook his head. “You don’t understand, Henry, she is…”

“Not that much younger than you, is what she is. Damnit Enibal, for someone who is such an agreeable guy, and so damned good at finding compromises, you can be as hard-headed as a human sometimes. No, that wasn’t a compliment. This time. Stop smiling at me like that!

“Look, the difference between you in years is a little larger than would have been ok for you in the past. However, those years start to mean less and less as the younger partner in a pairing gets older… and she is well past the age where no one older than her should stay away based on age.

“That said; you have a responsibility – to yourself and to her – to make sure that the two of you define your relationship to start with. I can’t say whether you two will make it long-haul: there is something about the girl that I can’t pin down, and that bugs me. But, she is smart, witty, kind, and – most importantly – earnest. Be honest with her and I bet she will do the same. Maybe you will have a little tryst while she is here, maybe it will be something longer.

“Either way, you damned well need it! Yes, you do, don’t sit there and try to stammer at me. You’ve been hit with far too bloody much since Renfrew busted into my Embassy, and it has you wound up tighter than a drum. If Her Royal Majesty” Enibal grimaced – there was that sarcastic tone in the title again. “Hadn’t sent her brother here to help you, I would have gotten a direct-line comms to her and given her a piece of my mind. Yes, I would have. I’d already investigated the protocol when I found out he was coming.”

“Henry… I… Ok, maybe it would be good for me to have companionship for a bit, Goddess knows I could use some female company that isn’t related to me, but…”

Henry slapped the desk. Not as hard as he could, but hard enough. “But nothing. Ok, fine, I had hoped not to pull this card on you, but you aren’t giving me a lot of options here. Brother-to-brother, man-to-man: Go Get Laid! Talk to this girl, figure out if you two will be in it for real, in it for fun, or experimenting and leaving it open, and let her kick your damned legs out from under you.

“You need it, she obviously wants it, and the only thing getting in your way is that you haven’t updated your numbers of what is OK to adjust for the fact that YOU are not HER age anymore. Or, are you going to try to sit there and tell me that, when you were her age, none of your friends spent any quality time with partners your age? Did it raise any eyebrows then?”

Enibal felt himself recoil from his friends words as if he’d been struck. *I… well, I guess I did. There was that one time I was a senior attaché to that lady ambassador for those few weeks. We never even considered it anything but a diversion for the voyage, but…* He shook his head as the understanding hit him. *I was Vashna’s age, and she was probably older than me. Hell, she even made the first move, though only because I failed to hide my own attraction.*

He sat there and studied his hands, lost for a moment in the memory. He’d learned a lot those couple of weeks, and he knew he’d even taught the older woman a thing or two… and not all of it in the bedroom.

He looked up at Henry and the man surprised him by throwing his head back and laughing, “You were cougar bait when you were her age, weren’t you?” Enibal cocked his head at the unfamiliar term, and his hands blushed as he pieced together the meaning. “Don’t bother answering, I can see it in your eyes. I bet she was even the aggressor, wasn’t she? And here you sit, telling me that you people don’t have a double-standard for parings on such things…”

Anger welled in him for a moment, “We don’t! This isn’t me having a double standard it is…”

Henry held up both his hands in a placating gesture. His anger passed as fast as it came on, and he continued. “It is… I don’t know what it is. Well, maybe you had the right of it, and I just haven’t updated my thinking in too many decades. I’ve been so busy with the Empire that any pairings were best kept as ephemeral things. Maybe part of what has kept me away has been fear of something real.”

The understanding settled on him like a weighted blanket, then fell off like ice sliding off a mountain, and took another weight he hadn’t even realized was there with it. *How much of my shyness with women is my cowardice getting in the way? Henry knows that, too, but knows me enough not to bring that part of it up. Well, when he is right, he’s right, and I have been torturing myself about ‘inappropriate’ feelings towards her for too long, and I didn’t even need to.* He chuckled softly at himself. *Aunt Eldia told me all of this already. Maybe I just needed to hear it again from someone else?*

Henry had sat quietly and allowed him to process. Enibal raised his head and looked his friend in the eye. “Ok, you got me. I… thanks. My ethical compass is something upon which I pride myself, and it doesn’t need adjustment often anymore, so I guess I have just not gotten used to having to check it.”

His friend nodded and smiled. “What are brothers for? Now, go out there and win yourself the hand of that pretty little lady!”

He stood and laughed, “I don’t know if it is so much winning her hand or stop dodging her, but… I will.”

He stood, waved, turned, and opened the door to find Vashna standing in the doorway, a large grin on her face. He shot her a hard look, which she spoiled by taking his hand and kissing it. Her lips lit a fire in his hand that spread through his body; he felt it all the way down to his toes, and could *feel* the blush go all the way to his *shoulder*. His only conciliation was seeing the blush go up her arms as well.

She gave him that wry, suggestive, mischievous smile that women of all species seemed to learn at birth, and spoke. “Yes, I was listening at the door. I have learned a lot that way, growing up… as I did. Of course, Mother made me pay for it a few times by making sure I heard things I didn’t want to, and/or weren’t true, but I have still found it useful.

“I’m also glad that your bond-brother here was able to finally get some sense into your head. I was beginning to debate whether I was going to try using a drill to pour it in, give up on you, or just drive you mad with lust and pin you to a wall when you had a weak moment.""

\*

*Damn, the way his dimples show up when he blushes that hard is cute. It is a good thing for him that he is cute, too, or I’d bring my knee into his balls.* Vashna was furious. She also felt happy, floating on cloud nine in some ways, and was basking in the thrill of victory to be sure… but still furious. That kiss on the back of Enibal’s hand had been like an electric fire that shot from her mouth straight to two little points on her chest and one between her legs, part erotic charge and part thrill of victory.

It was the thrill of victory part which made her angry. *I know when my emotions have been played with, and they have been. This boy’s ‘Noble-Elder-Unreachable’ routine played – hard – into my own emotions. Ok, damnit, princess, face reality: you want what you can’t have, and you couldn’t have him, so you wanted him.*

*Wait… Is that really it? No. I have never had to chase a man before. Hell, I’ve always had to beat them off with a stick. Yet, this one couldn’t be baited with anything I threw out there, and I threw everything except arranging for him to catch me in the shower!*

She gave herself a mental shake. She felt like she’d been manipulated, even though she knew she hadn’t been, and the lack of a valid target made her all the more angry. *I will get someone for this.*

*Uncle Kazlor. Damn him. He could have intervened with Enibal before this, but he knew that the best way to get me to grab this turkey was to make me chase it. Him and my aunts. Ohhh… when I get my hands on them….*

Enibal finally recovered from the shock of her threats to pin him against a wall, and he favored her with a half-shy, half-winning smile. A wave of… something… something that tingled from her crown to her toes… swept over her, and pushed the fury down. *It can just stay down, too. I will deal with that later.

I am a student living in Schweinfurt who will be travelling everyday to Würzburg because of my compulsory internship (pflichtpraktikum). I am currently confused as to how the DB monthly ticket (DB Zeitkarte) works. I am new to daily commuting through train and my german is pretty bad. I would like some assistance from you amazing people in r/germany. These are some of the questions that are bothering me:

While choosing the ticket, it asks whether I am an ""Erwachsener"" or a ""Schüler"". Am I eligible to use the ""Schüler"" option?

And is the price quote of the monthly ticket inclusive of the round trip (The way back from Würzbrug to Schweinfurt"")?

I would also love to read any suggestions that you recommend for me."

lp5ntp,7,2021-02-21,My boyfriend parents are killing me,Happyeveryday520,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/lp5ntp/my_boyfriend_parents_are_killing_me/,"Since I was with me ex boyfriend, we were really happy when we were alone and not talking about problems, but his parents have always been our problems. 

I didn’t dare to ask for a trip, or anything, because I know it creates a lot of stress for him because his parents will know and they will say no. They asked him to download life360 to monitor him. He had been living with me for a year without paying the rent, because his parents don’t agree him to live with me. So I asked him to pay for grocery, but then his parents saw his spending gets higher and threatens to freeze his card. We went to a road trip and his mom had to go with us and asked my boyfriend to sleep in the same room with her, and he didn’t, and his mom kept yelling at me and him and threatens to pull my ex boyfriend out of school. My ex boyfriend promised me to help me to move out before he was going back for Christmas, and he didn’t because his mom suddenly asked him to bring some beef jerky from New York to home. Things like this happened a lot. He kicked me out from his house in summer because his mom was mad at me (I’m an international student so I gave up my intern and didn’t go back to home because of covid) And he got depressed ever after because he felt very bad. And the second Christmas we were together we broke up, which is three months ago. Because he promised to spend Christmas with me and moved out with me, but his parents forced him to go back again. I couldn’t live alone because my mental health had been fucked up by his parents and I got depression, but he just left me alone in New York suddenly and I ended up in ER. He did a lot of things that hurt me although he didn’t want to, but he’s too scared of his parents to the point that his mental health is fucked up. 

Some people may say he could do student loan so he doesn’t need to be threatened by his parents. But his mental health is no good neither. I think while he growing up, he doesn’t get any warmth from family, and he just get warmth from materialistic things. 

My friends were always jealous of us, because we really love each other. But they also kept telling me to leave him, because of his parents. Even now he really cares about me, but he can’t face me anymore because he feels too bad about everything happened on me and I had to take all responsibilities in the relationship because his parents didn’t allow him to do anything. Like I said, his mental health is really fucked up.

I watched a YouTube crime video talking about how a Australian Filipino boy killed his parents. That boy just spent his parents money to buy luxury stuff after he killed. And he is diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. Comments say why doesn’t he just go to college and cut off his parents, he just wants money. But I can understand why he’s like that. I felt that was very much like my ex boyfriend’s case. He is also from a Filipino family and he always talked about how he wishes his mom was dead. He also relies on materialist things a lot because that’s the only thing he could have while he growing up. And he can’t do student loan cuz being with no money makes him very insecure. 

Now everyday I just listen to death bed and wishing I was dead. My ex boyfriends parents are even doctors but they are killing me. They know they caused us problems but they think I am the problem but not them. 

I have been doing therapy and taking medicine. But everything is too much for me to take. I feel me and my ex were pulled apart when we both love each other. Maybe we love each other too much so our emotions are too overwhelming. He is also seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, and he says he will be better and fix the problems so we can be together again. But I’m too scared to have hope. And now I need him but he can’t give me emotional support because he is not ok neither.

I just wish everyone around me won’t care about me so I can die without hurting anyone. It’s so painful to live when I feel like I’m living in hell. It’s been three months since breakup but I’m not getting better at all although everyone around me definitely supports me. But I don’t even want to talk to them about my feelings, cuz they only will worry about me and it not gonna help. I know maybe I will just forget about my ex one day in the future but the current is too painful and he’s not here to go through it with me.

I can’t understand why people like his parents exist on the earth and how people like them can even be doctors when they only care about themselves. Why does no one tell them to stop.

“I’ve been thinking about our future cuz I will never see those days. I don’t know why this is happening but I probably deserve it. I’ve been praying for forgiveness you’ve been praying for my health.” I just wish I was never born. I just wish I can disappear. 

I wrote a will three weeks ago and I asked my parents to buy me a life insurance cuz I’m scared of I will kill myself one day. But it takes two years for a life insurance to cover suicide so I guess I may need to live for another two years. Cuz I’m so sorry for my parents and I’m the only child, I don’t want to die and leave them nothing. I wish someone can help me to prepare for death. I don’t know how to arrange everything for my parents so they will feel less sad. But none of my friends agree to help me. 

People always tell me to spend time with friends, do my hobbies, get treatment. I do. But sometimes when I even force myself to do those things but I’m just too tired and can’t breathe and just go back to lay down. A lot of times I can’t even get myself food or feed my dog, because I’m too tired to do anything. I really don’t want to be alive anymore. I went to snowboarding the last week and I just wished I could die from hitting a tree but I’m too not skilled to go fast and not fall.

“I wish it could be me, but I won’t make it out from this bed.” 

I really don’t want to be alive anymore. I hope some accident happen on me so my parents won’t feel too sad as much as suicide. I know my ex is working on his mental health and I should too. But it’s too hard. I know I can’t kill myself for my parents so I have to make myself happy cuz there is no alternative. I know I should find distractions but I can never distract myself. I know a lot of people love me. But the current is really too hard. I feel so sorry for everyone who cares about me cuz I just keep feeling like to die."

I didn't have any plans of masters then but when I did a SDE intern at a top IB in my place I got to know about quant roles at such places. I love maths and that was something missing when I was doing my majors(only had math subjects till 2nd year). Now I am in a situation where I am really developing a liking for this quantitative field about how such roles could help develop market strategy and such but I am at loss with one aspect that is the masters course. I plan on doing masters a top University abroad take Princeton, Cornell  ,Baruch College etc. Now the thing I need advice is regarding what profile I need to build for this. I really don't have an exceptional GPA but have had lots of internship experience during my undergrad(have an internship experience of almost 15 months some of which I did  while pursuing studies for my graduation). Right now all I have in mind is to clear CFA LEVEL 1 and will be taking some industry exp ( have been placed at the same IB I was talking about) and then build my profile. 
Now the main things I need advice on 
1. How I could prepare my profile for masters at such Universities. Things that I should do
2. Any other suggestions regarding the course I could do rather than MFE(Masters in Financial Eng.) and roles you suggest I could look into other than quant roles which you feel are great at IB's.
I am still a aimless explorer right now any suggestions would be welcome. Have a great day !"

I had some undiagnosed mental health issues, a period of instability in my home life, and a healthy dose of immaturity that led me to this point, however, I love my cs classes and my math classes, they are subjects which seem to come somewhat naturally. As a result I know I still want to pursue this as a career path, but am aware it can be quite difficult without a degree. 

At this point I'm mainly proficient in Python and Java (moreso the latter), though I have some experience with C and C++ as well. I've also taken courses pertaining to data science, calculus up to calc 3 (multivariate), linear algebra, and discrete math (though I ought to review this one). My father works in the tech industry and I've been fortunate enough in the past to be given the opportunity to work alongside some of his developers in building a project and learning that sort of workflow. 

So with my background out of the way, I'm hoping to get some insight on what is a good next step for me. Mainly, I'm unsure how I should go about focusing my time and effort, should I pick a certain skill/tool and focus on that? Should I aim to become generally more proficient as a developer first, then find an area of focus? Something else? I need to improve my skills and start building a resume, that much is obvious. Online there are plenty of great resources, my father has suggested learning databricks or similar dev tools that are hot. There are also options like [the Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) that might be a useful time investment to make me more well rounded. I'm not sure what is the right direction. 

Lastly there's also the question of getting a job. In college there are internship, and recruiting opportunities. How do I go about putting myself out there if I'm learning on my own? 

Thank you. Apologies if this post seems a little disorganised, I'm not sure exactly the best way to frame my question haha. I appreciate any advice!"

I have been much more depressed lately and i just need to get it off my chest. If you dont like it, move on!

Mumbai, August 2017, as I sat in my apartment browsing colleges for pursing a masters, little did i know what i was getting into. Registering for my GRE, i had jitters like any other person before they take on something big. Though, overwhelmed by the amount of effort i needed to come here (as an international student) i decided to go ahead with it because it was for a better future. During all this uncertain phase, i had my girlfriends and best friend in the same city. They were my support system and my family in Mumbai. From giving my GRE, to applying and getting into umd, my girlfriend supported me through. Months passed and February 2019 came with the decision of coming to umd for fall 19. Along with it, also came the harrowing realization that i would have to uproot my life and move out of mumbai. As the realization struck me and my girl (we had been solid for 15 months by now) the question ""what about us?"" became commonplace. After extensive, long lasting discussions, we decided to end it because i did not know when i was gonna go back home (over 18 months now so its good) and the fact that i have been in a failed LDR before. 

FF to August 2019, i came here, got a part time in orientation week and started the grid for a new life. As weeks passed, i got really lonely. although the relationship had officially ended, both of us were still connected the same way emotionally and talking the same way. Somewhere in october, i got really lonely and tindered my way to a hookup. rather than making me feel better, it left me feeing guilty and worse so i came clean to my ""ex"" and she blocked me. I was miserable, but i had my roommates who kept me distracted. I carried on working and landed a dream internship in California, life was looking up again. and then, THE RONA hit. 

March 12th at 7:00am, i got an email from my DIT part time asking me not to come into work as a possible exposure had been detected and they were waiting on the results. This was the Wednesay before spring break and before we al could even realize wtf was going on, the campus was shut down for the semester. Most of people went home and what was left was a carcass of a once thriving college town. mothing but squirrels. As luck would have it, i started talking to this redditerp and we really seemed to vibe. It was magical, the first time we hung out and we grew closer. but mid april, we were dating. Things were good and i was notified that the internship had been made remote and the sound of a broken california dream made me realize that iw as stuck in college park without an escape. With my internship starting and me seeing someone, the once friendly roommates turned against me for some reason. I guess part of it was jealousy because they didnt have either and the other part being me, because i was busy with my own life. among all of this, another devastating news made its way to me, the girl i was dating was gonna fly back to her home country for the summer, till fall. Well shit! she moved back and started fluctuating between ""i love you"" and ""i hate you"". As draining as it was, i had no one else around me or in my life, i got sucked deeper into the toxic situatuoinship and developed real feelings for her. 

As the summer slipped into July, i was an emotional mess, working 10 hours a day and crying/fighting the other 14. In my worst week, pre-birthday week, i stopped eating (didnt eat for  5-6 days) and life would have it, my ex from mumbai texted me. we both were in a bad place and started talking. we obv vibed and helped each other out. As August came in with spiking covid, my internship came to a close with promise of a job offer within the year. Suddenly the situationship girl started being all nice and friendly because she was coming back. i succumbed to her power because i was lonely, depressed, miserable and in love. She came back and in less than 24 hours started spewing poison. It became very toxic, a ""love the way you lie"" kinda relationship. anyway, nearing the end of fall, her mom and bestfriend told her they didnt like her dating someone brown and planned for her to fly home during the break and stay there for spring ( i graduate and leave UMD after spring 21). Well obviously i had no say and she left, only to go fuck someone in 10 days of leaving. Being alone that made we worse. 

All of this time, my best friend did help me, but i guess i got too depressed for him and he started avoiding me. he got busy in his life and got new friends. Old roommates moved out (because they coudnt afford the apt) and i got the new flatmate who keeps his life to himself and spends most of his time with his FWB, we never connected that well. Last week i finally got a call back from the company (i had lost all hope) and got offered my dream job which i accepted. Surprisingly tho, it did not make me even remotely as happy as i though it would. 

Why did i write all of this bullshit?

After 3 college degrees, a few years of work experience, 10 months of depression and a fuck ton of satan's lettuce, i realized that my accomplishment doesnt matter because im alone. worked my ass of, moved over 5  cities in the last 8 years, left a lot of people behind, and now that i got what i worked for, it feels like nothing. i havent even been able to get a decent hug or a smile in. it all feels worthless as fuck because i dont have anyone to share with. Dont get me wrong, i am grateful for the job and my life, but i also now know the importance of love. I spend 3 hours late last night, sitting alone and crying at the mall because i couldnt sit in my room, it was eating me. still is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Work is just a prt of your life so dont forget to call the people that matter today and remind them that they matter. no amount of success will make you happy if you dont have someone true to share it with. Specially the double and STEM majors out there,  dont forget to build, maintain and nurture your personal life along with your professional one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Work is just a part of life, people in your life matter much more. Rona sucks. Im depressed as fuck and realized that no succes would make you truly happy unless it can be shared with a few ""real ones"".lleges for pursing a masters"

I'm 25 yo.  Just graduated from my master program in HCI design late last year and immediately scored a design role at a tech startup. Before that I had one year of part-time internship experience. 3 days ago - I got fired from my first full-time job after 1.5 month.

It all started when I was looking for jobs after I finished my study. Because of Covid, the company I was interning for told me outright that they couldn't offer me a full-time position and they didn't know whether they could extend my internship, so I was freaking out and trying to apply for as many jobs as I could. Just a few days before Christmas, I applied for a designer role this small tech startup. The job description was also quite short and sweet - just a list of design and art direction related tasks - all of the things I have done before as a freelancer. I got called for a video interview a day after submitting my application, did the interview, was given a design assignment the same day, submitted the design assignment 3 days later and got an offer (with a huge fat pay check offer attached - especially for a junior designer role) on that same day. **Red flag #1: too good to be true.** And this has led to everything that happened afterwards\*\*. I was blind for the money.\*\*

They wanted me to start asap - right after New Year. I agreed and hastily quit my internship (I was supposed to give them 4 week notice but because I was so desperate for that pay check, I pissed off my former employer a little bit). Then the job started - I realised for that pay check, I had to be the ENTIRE marketing department because there was no one else who was doing marketing in that company. Nobody has any backgrounds in marketing or design either so I had ZERO support and on the job training ( team of 6 - they're all software engineers). That included copywriting, designing, art directing, content developing, campaign managing and social media coordinating. As a cherry on top of a shit sandwich (quote from BH), I was also supposed to do UX/UI design (even though I thought this would be a project later down the road). As you would have guessed at this point, as a junior designer, I was shit at being the marketing/design department. **Red flag #2: no support or job training from people with the right experience.**

Anyways, two days into this job, I already started looking for new jobs because of those two red flags. Another **red flag** that I should've also taken more seriously was **work ethics and values**. I kept telling myself that because this was a startup, maybe they were usually flexible - bad judgement. People usually came in when it was almost lunchtime and left when it was close to dinner time. I wanted to function like the rest of society so I asked if I could do 9-5. They said yes. It was a team of 6 but we never have any standup or team meetings. When it came to work, there wasn't any real deadlines - people just kept doing things until it was done. They didn't seem to work overly hard - they tried not to stay back too late (as in if they could push the deadline, they'd push it) and they played xbox almost every afternoon. I was, on the other hand, very anal about deadlines and schedules, so I always focused on getting shit done before deadline (skipped my lunch if I had to, ignored their gaming noise, music and singing in the background) so that I could leave at 5ish in the afternoon.  Before I was fired, I also did a company-wide survey so I could learn more about the brand. The result showed that even though the team was so small, nobody actually understood, knew or could articulate what the brand mission and values were.

**Red flag #4: this is a big one - I could not learn to love their product.** This, I admit, is my fault. I faked loving it because I was actually loving the pay check, while I was actually passionately hating the product. It took me 2 weeks to understand what they actually did, who the users were and the problems they were trying to solve. And I was too scared to voice my opinion because the founders of the company are arrogant egotistical dickheads. Countless of times I've seen them trashing behind, or being curt to, or directly berating complaining users or people who wrote to them and asked about the product because they couldn't understand from the material they could get online.

Because of all of these reasons, I was so emotionally drained when I got home everyday. For that one month and a half, I didn't cook, go to the gym or do anything but go to work, go home, browse job postings, order ubereats, watch tv, sleep, and repeat. On the weekend, I was nervous and agitated because of the thought of going to work next week. I was so miserable and depressed, but the pay check got me up everyday.

**Red flag #5** (this is more like a sign than a red flag) **subconsciously knowing this would happen** \- a week before I got fired, I read up my contract again and focused specifically on the termination agreements. I considered quitting but thought enduring for the money wouldn't harm. On the day I got fired, in the morning of that day, I was reading about getting fired experience on reddit and contemplating what I could do if that happened. No particular reason - I didn't think I was that bad. I just wanted to quit.

I was pretty shit at hiding my hatred for this company, besides the shit designs I made for them (well to make myself feel better, I would say my direct manager liked them, 3 other people in the team hated my style but because I got my direct manager to push for them, I refused to change). And they beat me to it before I had the chance to quit. The reasons for my termination were:

\- No passion for the company. - No argument there. Tried to hide, didn't work.

\- Work was subpar. Not bad, but not great either. - ouch

\- Not a culture fit - I see this as a punishment for being an introvert and unable to play xbox.

When I was told I was fired, it was still sudden enough that I was confused, angry but weirdly ecstatic. Right after I got fired, I got a call from one of my previous freelance clients and got offer a design project. Ofc I took it straightaway and went home to apply for some more jobs. So I knew I was shit but I wasn't *that* shit.

So things aren't bad. They aren't great because I don't have any savings but at least I'm more optimistic about the future. I'm still angry and frustrated though. But with this experience, I now have a list of questions about work culture prepared when I get to go for my next interview that I would also like to share with you:

\- What's the team culture like? - you have to be quite specific about this question because most of the time the employer will paint you a fun picture of teamwork with ""straightforward feedback and no bureaucratic bullshit"". Make sure you ask about the team's personality, backgrounds, ethnics, or if there is any regular team activities that help boost morale.

\- Is there any on-the-job training programs (especially for a junior role)? And what's the expectation for the first 3/6/9 months on the job?

\- What are the goals of the company for the next one to two years? - do not accept answers like ""oh we don't have a specific goal because we're quite agile and learn from ongoing feedback so we pivot as we go"" - no, a functional company will have somewhat of a plan for what they want to achieve, and where you will be fitting in that plan - because that's why they're hiring.

\- How much do the employer think the team (that you'll potentially be a part of) will contribute to the success and growth of the company? (remember, not how - *how much*)

One of the things we don't realised when we apply for jobs is that you are also in power during the interview - *the employer has the power to judge your answer, and you also have the power to judge their answer.* I'm not saying it in a cocky way like ""you should be selling me the job"" - but because I was so desperate for this job, I got myself into it and now I had to live with the stigma of being fired which I feel that shouldn't have happened and it makes me feel like crap.

So you know - the standard advice: know your strength, know your weakness but also know your limits and values as well.

Thank you for reading my long ass post. Please offer any insights that you might have on my story. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any design jobs -  I'll do a really good job lol. Dm for my portfolio :)"

I am a student from India looking to apply for the OMSCS fall program. I am going to be graduating this spring and want to go for the program in fall. I was slightly anxious about my chances of getting in as I do not have any work experience and am from a foreign university. I am a computer science major at BITS Pilani (Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani) with a GPA of 7.3/10. I have two recommendations from an internship and one from a academic professor, but I feel they are not too strong in terms of showing my academic capability, rather more towards my ability in the IT industry or as a student. I also have a toefl score of 115. I know some might say just apply and see what happens but I do not know how GPA conversion is done as the recommended is 3.0 or more out of 4. It would be great if anyone who happens to know about this could let me know!"
lpd1ss,2,2021-02-21,Long and meaningless,dasdfghjklasdf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lpd1ss/long_and_meaningless/,"


I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m just writing this here because I don’t have anyone to talk to about it and I haven’t written about it in a long time.

I live in Texas, I’m 27, born in the US however. I am a middle child, but my older brother is a twin. I graduated from UT with a business degree in MIS, I work full time at the place I interned at, and I’ve been here since I graduated. I never wanted this job, but my ex at the time wanted me to take it so we could move out together, and my family needs the support as both my brothers did not graduate college, and we have a large amount of loans. I live at home with them and pay a majority of the bills and loans, the monthly amount I give them is more than enough for me to move out to a very nice 1 bedroom apartment, but I don’t, because I chose to help them. But I hate every second of it. My family is very fucked up, I don’t blame my parents but they were immigrants in a broken relationship and tried the best they could. My brothers do blame our parents more, but I have the tendency to blame everything in my life on myself. Anyways, the stress of the job absolutely wrecked me, and I had to start anxiety medication, and my relationship of 5 years got so strained. We broke up and I was seeking attention from a coworker, and things happened, but I told my ex the moment they did because I never lied or hid anything. She forgave me for it, but the stress from my job and home life, and her own problems, was too much. She wanted to drop out of nursing school, and I told her to because I had my job and it would be fine. Anyways that relationship ended. 

I’ll continue in a bit, but just for reference, I have been depressed and suicidal my entire life, as long as I can remember. I don’t think there is a specific trauma or event that caused this. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder. I was somewhat successful in school without having to study, I got 1980/2400 on the SATs without studying, 30/32 on the ACT, I have several AP credits. In college I fell into a deeper depression because I never felt like I knew what I wanted to do, I failed my first semester and dropped out my second. I went back home for a semester, and got diagnosed with ADHD and put on Vyvanse, which literally changed my life. I never knew something was so wrong with me until I got the means to help it. I started getting all A’s and brought my horrible GPA up, got on the dean’s list a few times, and graduated. I want to note here that I have always hated my life and the world and thought it was horrible, but I’ve never seen it as irrational. I just think I don’t have any hope or optimism, especially getting older and realizing the world is as shitty as I thought, everything that has been happening in the last few years has somewhat broken me down. Although I will say I am an activist and attend protests and participate in aid. 

Anyways. All of that was 4 years ago, that I’ve been at this job, which from the beginning paid me less than the other interns even though I had been there a year. I was also assigned to one of the hardest clients (I do database shit), and I never felt appreciated. Not to mention I am an introvert and have social anxiety and hate corporate jobs, I only graduated with that degree because I chose it as a second one, because I didn’t know what I was doing, and couldn’t switch. I chose MIS because I like coding and it was interesting to me. Now at my job I literally trained the other hires, I helped them with everything with the job since I had been there a year. I am not blaming the job or anyone, though; just want to be clear. I blame myself for not getting raises or whatever. I am just complaining and giving you insight into my life. I still hate hate this job, and my raises for the past 4 years have been less than dollar inflation. I have been moved around to different teams without consultation, and haven’t been promoted. I gave up trying on the job a long time ago, and I do the bare minimum to make it seem like I’m working, but most of the time I have a weight on my keyboard so it doesn’t log me off and I lay in bed and do nothing but stare at my phone, despite having no one to talk to or anything to do. 

Next, I am an alcoholic. I have been one for years. I don’t drink all day, but around 6pm, I go to the grocery store and buy a 1.5 L of wine, and drink it, every single day. I used to do a 750 mL bottle but my tolerance grew. I don’t buy more than 1 at a time, or buy liquor instead, because I lose self control and drink all of it instead of rationing it for days. I can’t go a day without it, I can’t sleep without it, and I hate laying in bed without it. I can’t be awake with my thoughts about my life, I physically am not capable. It helps me to just be drunk and not think about it, or else I would spend the whole night sobbing. I have tried to go a few days without it, and that is always what ends up happening.

I met my last ex on tinder, about 2 years after the one previously mentioned. Since I have horrible anxiety, we didn’t meet for months, and just got to know each other. That is how I am with all my matches, hence why she was literally one of the only ones I ever actually met. We dated for a year, I used to spend the weekend at her apartment. But I have a habit of pushing people away. I wasn’t an alcoholic back then, but I would get drunk on the nights I’d spend with her. Eventually she grew tired of me and all my shit, and that also ended badly. That is the last real relationship I’ve had. I also have very few friends, I made like 2 in college, I only now still talk to some friends I’ve known, mostly because they’re also friends with my brother and cousin, so I get included. But I have never actually felt like I belonged in their friend group, I’ve always been the person they invite when everyone is hanging out, if that makes sense. I don’t have out with any of them alone, just in a group. My friendships and relationships and life I have struggled with feeling inadequate, secondary, unnecessary. This is a major part of the strain I create in my relationships, which if you are familiar with BPD, is large part of it.

Now for the last several years, every day, all day long, I think about killing myself. I have never attempted it, and it is not a rash decision, or something I impulsively decided. I have thought of it since I was in elementary school, there has never been a period of my life that I have not thought of it. Now my parents owe a large amount of student loans in our names, and their house is not paid off, and we are not wealthy, and my brothers haven’t graduated college so work retail/service jobs. I can’t leave them to fend for themselves, so I have stayed at this job I hate, living at the house I hate, and every day, just laying in bed pretending to work. Drinking, sleeping, sometimes logging in late. My coworkers and manager now are growing tired of my work ethic, and I’m not sure how much longer I have at this job. But I try each day, because I have planned to pay off my parents debt, and then I plan to go somewhere and end my life. 

I have never wanted to be alive, I have never wanted anything. The small happiness I had were from my relationships, but I don’t think I’m capable of being loved. I don’t think people can be with me. I wanted a family, but I never will. I don’t care about any hobbies I had, I have no passion or ambition for absolutely anything. I don’t want another relationship, and I don’t want anything at all. I hate this job so much and it’s killing me everyday but it’s all I can do to keep trying to do the minimal amount, I haven’t been able to save up any money at all for anything and I hate thinking about it. I’m so fucking broke and I can’t help my parents and there is no way I will ever get a better job, as easy and as paying, and I can’t quit because I live paycheck to paycheck despite making $50k a year. I’m constantly tired and I just want it to be over. And I don’t think I’m being irrational or anything about any of this, there aren’t lies in what I’m saying. I see everything in this world, and how much people struggle, how much I struggle, why would I want to stay here? Why would anyone? I don’t at all. Every day is pain, everyday my mind is frozen and raging in an inferno at the same time, and I can’t do anything at all. I can’t form meaningful relationships with people because there’s something very fucked up with me, I can’t keep relationships because I fuck them up. I have nothing, and I’ve always felt so worthless, and I really don’t want to do this anymore. I’m so absolutely tired

Anyways, that’s all. Not sure if this actually belongs here because I am not going to kill myself anytime soon, I have a long way to go. I just am so broken and everyday is so overwhelming and I can’t take it anymore, so I wanted to talk about it"

lpd403,6,2021-02-21,"Been applying for Entry level Business Analysis positions, but still not hearing back from anyone. What can I do?",tsuid1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/lpd403/been_applying_for_entry_level_business_analysis/,"Hi everyone, I'm trying to transition from sales into business analysis. It wasn't until recently I took inventory of my goals and aspirations and found a field that aligns with that. However, I'm having some issues with getting employers' attention.

&amp;#x200B;

***Background***

I graduated with a BA in Organizational Communication to study public relations and how to improve customers' perception of individual businesses.. In my senior year, I studied abroad in Australia and worked at as a marketing intern for the six months I was there. After graduating, I worked as a temp telemarketer starting from June 2018, and was offered a full time position as a salesman in the company in August 2018. However, at the beginning of my new position, the company was being acquired, which resulted in a huge layoff and ended my employment after two weeks. 

I decided to keep myself sharp and work at a grocery store as a customer representative. At July 2019, I left that position to take care of my grandmother full time until another family member was available to do so. In October 2019 I followed my family's recommendation and began working as a CCA at USPS . I went into this position with the idea that I could become a full time mail carrier and make a career out of it. But after months of demanding work and delivering mail late almost every night, I didn't see a future in this and resigned from the position. 

Currently, I'm working as a salesman and doing decently. But I want more. I realize that I can do more, but I didn't know what I could do until the start of the pandemic. 

&amp;#x200B;

***The Story Now***

I did some serious soul searching since the beginning of the pandemic. I revisited my interest in creating positive relationships between organizations and their customers, and started looking into business analysis and project management. I took some udemy classes on SQL, Tableau, and BA fundamentals, and loved every part of it. It felt like this was a field I could enjoy working in. As someone with sales and marketing experience, I like interacting with new customers and helping them explore options that can benefit them. Learning SQL, Tableau, and Excel helped me gain the tools to make more informed decisions for said customers. 

Since learning about business analysis, I decided to pursue this as a *career* instead of a job and dedicated most of my time learning about the field to make sure this is something I actually want to pursue. I've also been revising my resume and cover letter with my friend who works as a project manager and works with other business analysts. 

&amp;#x200B;

***The Problem***

I've been applying to jobs for about 6 months now, and I haven't heard back from anyone. I've made my resume ATS friendly, showed tangible achievements in my work history, and provided a cover letter casing my knowledge in SQL, Tableau, and Agile, while explaining how my sales experience can help collect requirements from clients. I've even updated my linkedin page and tried networking with employers through Linkedin. 

I've also been applying to internships and contract positions. But internship postings specifically want students who are enrolled in school, and contract positions want someone with experience, so I'm in a weird place where I'm not in school, and I don't have the experience to GAIN experience....

I also realize that the main issue is my work experience. On paper, my experience is pretty shody with the various job experience, and I don't have the experience needed to enter an entry level position for the field I am pursuing.

I've listed what I have on my resume below...

&amp;#x200B;

***Resume***

As of now, I am showing my sales position as current since February 2020, customer representative at a grocery store from September 2018 - July 2019, and a 6 month marketing internship that I worked in while studying a semester abroad from July 2017-December 2017. 

I tailored my resume to my best ability to show how my experience can translate towards business analysis.

For the sales position, I combined my telemarking/sales experience in June 2018 with my current position, and highlighted how I helped raise monthly sales by 20% since I started. I also highlighted how I use excel to track customer insights using surveys to help create marketing strategies for the sales team. 

For my customer representative position, I highlighted how the team and I strengthened customer loyalty by resolving store inquiries from customers while prioritizing tasks such as team assistance and floor maintenance pending on daily and weekly goals. 

And for my internship, I described how I boosted brand awareness using social media and managed the marketing director's agenda and assisted in organizing marketing events. 

I tried to make the best of it, but I don't know how else I can remedy this. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm starting to get discouraged. Everyday, I revise my cover letter and resume to fit the positions I'm applying to, but at this point, it almost seems pointless. It sucks that I found something that I want to do, but I can't seem to enter that field. 

Is there anything I'm missing?  Do I need to go back to school? What else can I do?"

I did well in high school. I did well in undergraduate college. And am now doing well (i guess) in my professional school program. I’m nearing the end of my academic training and going into the final experiential unpaid intern training. But I feel burnt out and unenthusiastic. I used to excel in classes but now I just want it all to end. I have even quit some extracurricular leadership positions just to remove what I assume was stress. But I still have the required Internships that I am not at all excited for either. 

I’ve always had answers to what I was doing with my life with room for spontaneous yet productive changes. I never knew where I would “be in 5 years” but I knew I was on the road to success. Now I just don’t want to care. I might be burnt out. I might just not like the profession I chose. But it’s spilling over to other aspects of my life. 

The internship year I have left is going to require me to move to a new larger and far away city. But I’m not eager to prepare for that. This move will impact my significant other’s job as she will leave her position to go with me. But I’m not even enthusiastic about the move. 

Starting to have this quitting? attitude towards my long-term romantic relationship and friends as well. It’s very strange and can’t shake it off. It’s so foreign to me that I don’t even know how to talk to someone about it.

Anybody have an idea what this might be and how to talk to someone about it? Am I just being lazy, burnt out, or depressed ?"

So back with another post, already can taste the tension and yucky judgment from her as I type and apply for jobs.

In my previous post, I mentioned I lost my motivational drive when I lost my previous job due to COVID, and well- I decided while I do enjoy being at home (without, you know criticisms, from Asian Parents), I knew I needed to get on my feet somehow despite the pandemic happening. I wanted that nice independence and balance back in my life again.

Not only am I trying to get a job to get that balance, but also to get my family to get off my back!

I freaking hate it when I try to do something on my own, and my parents intervene, calling me a liar and a disrespectful brat when I try to protest doing something. A fight was initiated because I apparently made sponge cake wrong because ""water baths for sponge cake making are stupid and you shouldn't follow stupid instructions"". That story will be up later.

However, fortunately (unfortunately?), this riff raff I just experienced is not as bad as the sponge cake incident.

I was told to apply to this certain place as well, a Rite Aid, which coincidentally for me, is near where my boyfriend lives. I thought, alright, I'll try applying there. The thought of my boyfriend makes me happy, and the thought of being in a workplace near where he lives makes me smile. Unfortunately for me, they were only hiring pharmacist interns and store managers, so I thought, ""At least I gave it a shot.""

When I broke the news to my mom that the only clerk positions for Rite Aid were in farther cities and not in our hometown, that smile of hers showed up (uh oh)and said her daughter's friend works there and they give her money to go to school (a scholarship?) but I read that they have to either be enrolled in a pharmacy school or already am a certified pharmacist. I keep telling her the clerk jobs were available in different states and cities far away from us, but not our hometown. She just told me to apply somewhere else, but I can tell the disappointment in her eyes and gestures.

Sorry, mom. I'm an artist, not a pharmacist. I'm applying to many jobs as possible to try to escape her grip and to silence her criticisms of me not doing anything during the quarantine and to have her stop comparing me to other people's kids."

I also asked this question in Stackoverflow and someone told me that business verification is necessary to get access.

I know how to scrape it, but I will need only posts with a particular keyword, not the whole page. And if I try to first search the keyword in the Facebook search and then scrape from that page, then it'll be limited to a few hundred posts only.

I'm currently experiencing a crisis due to the career choices I have made so far. I have a masters degree in ECE from a European university and 3 YOE as an embedded software engineer. Job is okay but I feel like I've made a huge mistake entering this field in the first place.

In school I was interested in analog IC design but due to mental health issues (which are slowly getting better now with the help of a therapist) I was suffering from extreme anxiety over not being able to land a job out of university. I was thinking about that possibility to the point of obsession almost daily and so eventually I switched all my coursework to CS related stuff, thinking that would make me more employable.

Well, now that I do have a job and my anxiety is getting better it seems that my view on things was distorted to say the least. I know several people from my university who did get IC design jobs right after graduation with little problems (I don't live in the US and the job market for that seems to be better here).

So it seems like I could have just stuck with analog IC and things would have turned out fine. What the heck do I do now? I would much rather have an analog job than a software job but I don't have work experience in the field. Do I go back to school to get another masters degree focusing an analog? I've just turned 30 and I'm worried that companies will not employ me as an intern or full time after graduation because I'm older then other grads and have made a significant career switch. But I also don't want to spend the next 40 years doing something that I'm not passionate about. Help."

Overall, I did the job but the process was not very smooth and I prefer not to request the recommendation from my advisor.

lplrjj,4,2021-02-22,[Need Avice] How to go for tech companies as a Business Information Systems graduate?,Accurate_Garlic,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/lplrjj/need_avice_how_to_go_for_tech_companies_as_a/,"Hey guys :)  
I recently graduated in Business Information Systems (\~70% business, \~30% computer science) and work for a fintech company. I have done several internships in the fields of finance and consulting, but I aim to work for a tech company. (Would also be fine with a more strategic position). I plan to start a masters this autumn and ideally would do an internship this summer.

I have got some skills in Python, Java, JS and R and have also worked on a small WebApp. Currently I am starting my own WebApp project. I am also willing to do some intensive interview prep since I have never had a CS internship.

1. Do you think there is any chance to land a CS internship at a reputable company (since I do not have any signalling for it)? And what companies would you target for that purpose? 
2. Since I cannot opt for a CS master with my degree, should I go for a CS-related master like business analytics? Or rather focus solely on doing own software projects? Or start studying CS?"

I was not planning to start an internship yet. 
In one hand I think learning those technologies will help me for my final degree project as I want to develop an app and now I don't have much idea.

In the other hand I don't know if working in a startup would be a good idea as they are probably looking for someone to be productive fast and I would be put in a lot of stress, which I cannot handle at this moment, and If I was looking for an internship I would chose one where I could have a career.

In any case, if I accepted I would specify that I can only start on summer when I finish my exams, not earlier.

Another thing to say is that I think the idea of the app they are developing is good but I honestly don't see it succeding, should this also be a factor to consider?

What are your thoughts or experience.

Some of the requirements for these entry level EE positions are absurd and have me believing that I didn’t learn anything.  Never had an internship or co-op for experience either. Not to mention, my dad’s an ex-electrician and the fact that he knows so much w/o a degree has me even more nervous!

Currently, I’m only applying to entry level software related jobs.  I feel like that’s the most I’ve learned thus far and I could walk into a job w/ some knowledge.  I’m open to learning more about hardware, but I’m worried that a company will have high expectations and won’t be willing to train me.

Should I be concerned about my future? Due to current events, I know software related jobs are highly competitive and I know some doors may open up if I broaden my search; however, I don’t wanna make a fool of myself either.

Any advice would be appreciated."
lpqcgn,342,2021-02-22,Getting Deferred from Yale Really Broke me.,serena_dd,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/lpqcgn/getting_deferred_from_yale_really_broke_me/,"I just wanted to come on here and share my story. I know that this might make me sound ungrateful or greedy but I just wanted to express a little bit about how I felt after being deferred from Yale because I’m sure a lot of people went through a similar experience.

For some background, I come from an underdeveloped country that is basically drowning right now and I live in a dysfunctional low-income home, meaning my father is abusive, my siblings don’t go to school and haven’t gotten a proper education. However, I made a deal with myself very early on in life, and that was to never give up no matter the circumstances. I worked my ass off during my school years, and ended up getting a full scholarship at my private high school (best in the country) for all four years. My school is pretty rich and extremely expensive (around $20k+ a year). 

Anyways, during my high school years, I studied and studied, and ended up with an upward trend reaching a UW GPA of around 97% this year. Also, I’m in the IB program taking the most rigorous courses and have a pretty high IB predicted score. I had pretty good extracurriculars from starting a club, several leadership positions, co-founding an organization, working on an environmental campaign with the ministry, and several science internships. 

Come November, I applied to Yale REA. My rich friend applied as well and were the only two who applied from my high school. This is probably very cruel of me to say, but she was given everything. Her parents are rich as fuck and I know for a fact that she couldn’t have gotten here without her parents money. Not to say that she doesn’t deserve this, but I just don’t understand why I wasn’t enough compared to her. She got in while I didn’t. I still don’t get it to this day. What did I do wrong? Okay she had a private counselor when I didn’t. Okay she played an instrument because she could afford private lessons. But I pursued my passions and did EVERYTHING on my own. So why wasn’t I enough? I always thought colleges understood the context behind your application. I thought they would see how hard I worked, how I EARNED these opportunities by reaching out to professors to get internships...by doing everything on my own. 

I don’t think I’ll ever understand. I know it’s just a deferral and I know I should be grateful. But if my friend didn’t get in and I was deferred I wouldn’t have been that upset. What upsets me is the fact that I worked a 100x harder than she did and I did everything from nothing, but because she’s rich she got in? 

My confidence right now is basically non existent. I’m broken. I tried to distract myself after that deferral but it wasn’t about getting in anymore it was about not feeling like I was enough just because my family’s circumstances had to fucking define me. I’m hurt. I feel like I’ll never get what I deserve even though I’ve always been the hard working one. It hurts to see that money really does define everything you do in life. 

So to all poor internationals out here, I feel you. I know how hard it is to watch less qualified people get in because they’re rich. I know how much it hurts to work your ass off and expect good things but end up with nothing. 

And to Yale, I forgive you. I’ll never understand why you did that to me but I really do forgive you. This might leave a scar in me forever, because I thought you’d understand me, I thought you’d understand the struggles I went through, but you didn’t. So to you, I say I’m sorry for disappointing you. 

I hope everything works out for me. But if it doesn’t, I’m not sure what I’ll do."
lps291,3,2021-02-22,How to become Data Scientist Step by Step,Robin5409,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/lps291/how_to_become_data_scientist_step_by_step/,"Starting from the media to articles to job postings or the words of top leaders of big companies, the word that has been making its way everywhere is ‘Data science’. The buzz about this is real. So, if you are a bit familiar with technologies and/or interested in learning new things about technologies, then questions have definitely popped into your mind and that is: What is data science? How to become a data scientist? Well, the answers will be given right here.

Data science technology is a field that deals with extraction of meaningful insights which include usage, trends, customer behaviour, etc. from raw data by using complex tools and algorithms, machine learning processes, mathematics, statistics, and many such areas. In this modern era, the use of data science for business is massive. Businesses are using data science technology to make profit, establish their companies as superior to others, making their business cost-effective and also take smart business decisions all with the help of data science. Therefore, data science for business is a blessing as the data scientists are always there in taking such smart and meaningful decisions when it comes to their profit.

As we know, the roles and responsibilities of a data scientist are immense and vary from one area to another to the point that one may get confused: what exactly does a data scientist do. Is he a mathematician or a statistician or a computer engineer? Let’s see the roles and responsibilities of a data scientist or the things that are expected of data scientists.

1. Identify and figure out the data analysis based problems and see how they can have a direct impact on the clients and their requirements.
2. Collecting, cleansing and transforming and thus processing both structured and unstructured data from many different sources.
3. Looking for patterns in data models and finding out the opportunities and solutions that are required for the growth of the company and also solve the problems that are faced by the company.
4. The data scientist jobs include the storytelling capabilities meaning that they should be able to explain their theories and concepts to the stakeholders in a way that is understandable by them.

So, as is clear, taking data based decisions and advising the management team is one of the major data scientist responsibilities. Now, there are some major skill sets that are required in order to become a data scientist. As the data scientist responsibilities are many, so are the skills for qualifying as data scientist. We are about to discuss some of them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Skills required for a data scientist**

Data mining, data analysis, computer programming, statistics, machine learning, data visualisation, big data analytics, and so many more are the fields that need expertise in order to contribute to the skills of a data scientist. In order to carry out all the roles and responsibilities of data scientist, the skills are described vividly down below.

***1. Mathematics (includes Statistics, probability, linear algebra):***

Mathematics can be thought of as a core subject in data science technology. This is important for a data scientist because while working on data and building data products, we need to view the data and identify it’s textures and patterns with respect to a mathematical perspective. If you want to analyse and visualise the structured form of the converted data then you must have a good knowledge of statistics. Linear algebra on the other hand also is an integral part of studying data science as this is one of the vital functions of machine learning and is very helpful when it comes to uncovering the characteristics of big data sets. So, in order to[learn data science](https://www.greatlearning.in/data-science/courses), one should be able to master these sections of mathematics.

***2. Computer Programming:***

For building the prototypes of data models or fixing complex data systems, the data scientist course must include the learning of computer programming. The important programming languages and technologies that are often deemed necessary to learn data science are Python, R, SAS, Perl, SQL and all the recent and trending technologies. If you want to have a data science career, then it is really necessary to have a strong grip on any or all of these programming languages. There are many data science programs that help you learn all these programming languages and help you learn data science the way it is necessary. If you want to take a data science course then Great Learning will be a good institution to go for as the [data science courses](https://www.greatlearning.in/data-science/courses) there are greatly appreciated.

***3. Machine Learning:***

Machine learning means building or training the computers or systems in such a way that they learn and develop constantly by themselves by means of feeding on the new data that is provided to them. From the recommendation engines to self-driving cars and other such new technologies make the companies rely heavily on machine learning in order to make the experience of the users better. In short, machine learning forms the core of artificial intelligence. It is with machine learning that companies can automate their systems thus reducing the efforts, time and energy of the humans and also make these systems cost-effective. A data scientist course must include machine learning algorithms because they help taking real-time decisions and make high value predictions for the benefit of the company.

***4. Data skills:***

One of the major data scientist responsibilities is to access, store and manipulate data all the time. Knowledge of databases like SQL, MongoDB and Cassandra is very essential in order to have an expertise while dealing with data. Next comes Big data which means huge amounts of data generated from multiple sources at a massive rate. Now this data cannot be handled by the traditional database management systems like relational databases. Big data is a problem that can be solved by tools like Spark and Hadoop. These are open source softwares that are used in processing of sets of data and also for distribution of storage associated with big data.

***5. Data munging and visualisation:***

Data munging is defined as the transformation of one data form to another form. This is done mainly on raw data to make it convenient to understand and use. Data visualisation can be thought of as the formation and study of the visual representation of data science by means of statistical graphics, plots and information graphics. In order to gain a meaningful insight of sets of data for the improvement of the different sectors and areas of a business, a process of arranging data into information reports is introduced and this is called data reporting.

So, there you go, all the skills required in order to learn data science and qualify for data scientist jobs. Data scientist jobs as career options are interesting options and very rewarding. However, just learning all the above mentioned skills are not enough to become a data scientist. Expertise of all these skills is an important step towards qualifying for a data science career. But there are several other steps that to be followed and together with all those steps only can one qualify for a data science job.

**A step-by-step guide to become Data Scientist**

Taking into account the amount of data that is being produced from desktops, smartphones and many IoT devices all across the globe on a day-to-day basis it has become mandatory for both the government and private sectors to rely on data scientists for handling and manipulating of this data. Choosing a data science career is a relatively new trajectory when it comes to career options. However, that does not mean it is unachievable. While data scientists perform data analysis, they often do that for building predictive models which makes the use of machine learning and deep learning protocols. Data scientist responsibilities also include determining which models are best fit for which kind of data analysed. Since all the models are either approximate representations of the current or the future society, they require fine tuning thus relying on data scientist’s mathematical expertise. So, there are many things to take into account and consider their importance. Therefore, down below are the specific steps required to become a data scientist.

***1. Preparing from an early stage:***

Taking preparations is always the basic step required in order to achieve anything and what will be better than to start preparing yourself from a very early time, that is, even before you go for your studies in any University or sign yourself up for a data scientist course. As stated earlier, making yourself proficient in the widely used programming languages such as Java, Python, R, etc. is a good place to start. Also, learning the basics when it comes to statistics and mathematics might also work in your advantage.

***2. Having an Undergraduate degree:***

Having an undergraduate degree in any of the subjects from computer science, statistics, information technology, mathematics or even data science (if available) will be beneficial for you. This is because the most sought after students to qualify for data science jobs are from these subjects so much that even minoring in any of these subjects will also be of profit. Along with studying for your undergraduate degree, looking for internships and asking your seniors or your professors to help you gain an opportunity to learn data science or help you have your data science career will be a smart move on your part because the more you gain experience the better it is for you.

***3. Getting yourself an entry-level data science job:***

The big companies are found often in search for students or freshers to fill in the vacant data science entry level jobs. So, the data science jobs with the positions of junior data scientist and junior data analyst are the things you need to look out for. Now, for these jobs, [data science programs](https://www.greatlearning.in/data-science/courses) might be helpful as there is no better way to learn data science than with data science courses. Great Learning is a good institution for this as the Great Learning data science courses are not only efficient but also are efficient in getting you into these entry level jobs easily.

***4. Earning a Master’s or a PhD:***

Getting yourself a master’s or doctoral degree would be really helpful because when it comes to data science career, the chances with a higher education is much more as the hiring companies often look for them.

***5. Get yourself a promotion:***

These additional qualifications and higher education when combined with experience really boost up your data science career and that results in you getting a much needed promotion. Coupling technical skills along with leadership qualities will give a pathway towards better opportunities. Learning all the skills mentioned are the key factors and these are just add-ons in getting yourself that high in demand data scientist job.

**Conclusion**

In this age of constant change where the technology is evolving on an everyday basis, it becomes very crucial to keep yourself in pace with all the latest technologies and data science technology is no different. In order to become a data scientist, it is very essential to make yourself aware of all the innovations happening around us as following the trends and taking decisions while keeping them in mind is one of the prime data scientist responsibilities. As this is a new field and comparatively flexible, there is a chance of learning much and there is no better way to learn data science than by taking a data scientist course because at the end of the day, while dealing with all of our studies and work, it is a difficult job to learn data science on our own schedule. [Great Learning](https://www.greatlearning.in/data-science/courses) provides with proper guidance and the Great Learning data science courses help you grow and keep you updated with all the latest innovations of technologies happening all around us. So, if you need a guide or a systematic way for making yourself capable for a data scientist job then joining an institution is crucial.

So, to conclude, all the points necessary to keep in mind when it comes to become a data scientist have been clearly stated above and these steps will help you in know about this field in a better way."

Here is the fifty-second installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

lputq9,13,2021-02-22,swe internship with small local company or QA with some programming at large company?,bignuts133769,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lputq9/swe_internship_with_small_local_company_or_qa/,"So I just hand an interview with a big company in tech that was supposed to be for swe but I got QA interviewers. I'm not sure what the compensation is but for swe it's around 50/h. I believe there is some programming involved using Java but it's not a development role (which is what I applied for) and I feel like I got blindsided. I just finished the interview and I think it went really well, but assuming I get an offer I'm not sure if I should take it over a small non tech company in the midwest for an swe role (pay would be 18/h). I've heard some horror stories about falling into the QA path, and I'm not sure if having a big name in QA would help over the small local company. I know the priority should be experience, but money is important as well since It would go towards tuition and the large company would have a significantly higher pay. Anyone have a similar dilemma?

EDIT: I also want to mention that I'm a sophomore, I think there's a bit more leeway for me to take a software qa internship but I'm still not sure if it'll help"
lpvjls,0,2021-02-22,Too old to be an intern? (29),Waltgrace83,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lpvjls/too_old_to_be_an_intern_29/,"Hello, everyone! I've got an odd situation.

TLDR: 29 year old with summers completely off. Will people be skeptical of hiring a person like me for an internship - believing that I am overqualified or something? How do I navigate this? Should I *sell* my age as a huge benefit or just ignore it? 

I am a high school teacher who will be starting some pre-recs for my Master's degree in CS. My undergrad degree is unrelated and I teach a liberal arts subject. I keep hearing time and time again that internships are huge; people are worried about not getting jobs if they don't have them and many get job offers because of them. Because I have summers off - and I imagine that most internships take place in the summer - I am basically in the same boat as your typical 19-21 year old college student, despite that I work full-time (7th year on the job) and will be going to school at night. 

On one hand, I think that hiring an older intern would be a great decision for a company: I obviously have more experience in the professional work environment and I have proved a work ethic.

On the other hand, I think that some companies might be scared of doing this - that they will be selling me short or be too afraid to boss me around because I am 10 year older than the normal intern. 

So what do I do when it comes time to start attempting to get internships? Do I sell it as a huge benefit to these companies (""Would you rather hire a 19 year old who has never held a job or me, who has very clearly demonstrated professionalism?"")? Do I ignore it and just pretend my age doesn't exist? Thoughts?

Thank you!"

lpywge,4,2021-02-22,What happens if I am not able to find a job?,throwawaystowaway01,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/lpywge/what_happens_if_i_am_not_able_to_find_a_job/,"Like a lot of people my age (25M), I struggled finding out what I wanted to do career-wise.  I went to university and completed a degree in Criminology and eventually ended up completing a masters in the same subject as well. I got a whole host of random experience, owing to the fact that I didn't know what I wanted to do and kind of fell into internships. I eventually decided I would try to get a research job.

Cue graduation last August and it is safe to say that my job search has been a disaster. It is not that I am not getting interviews (I have reached the final stage twice), it is that I have seen maybe 5 jobs for my field in the last 5 months. In the last 3 months, I can safely say I seen a grand total of 1 research posting specifically requiring my educational background. I applied to this posting and got to the final round before being passed over.  The vast majority of the 120+ positions I have applied to have been outside of my field, which has put me at a huge disadvantage out of the gate.

I am starting to consider the very real possibility that I, like many others, will not get a job related to my degree. The thought of being miserable in a job doing something I am not interested in weighs on me daily. In order to fill the time my unemployment has brought on, I started taking some cheap courses outside of my degrees, like biology, chemistry, and some math courses and researching the path forward in my career. I always loved the sciences and was encouraged to pursue a career related to them, but I never did.  If I were to do anything other than criminology, I would probably choose nursing, as I like helping others and I definitely enjoy most aspects of the job. I also love computers and have been interested in becoming a system administrator or cyber security specialist. I also looked into doing a PhD in criminology, but the only thing stopping me is the horrendous market when trying to obtain full-time teaching/research professorships.

The lack of crim research positions will not improve until most COVID-19 restrictions are lifted where I live (Canada). The COVID-19 situation here will not significantly improve until the summer, where August would mark 1 year of unemployment should I not be able to find a job.

I had some questions about getting an internship at big tech companies (FAANG, LinkedIn, Intel, Microsoft, etc..) and thought this forum could help me out with tips to make myself stand out.

**About myself:**

I am a second semester freshman (I know a little young but in my mind never to early to start planning and preparing) in CS Software Engineering @ a decent school with a relatively high regarded engineering program. I know how to code in JS and Java and am currently in the middle of teaching myself Python and Swift and plan to start teaching myself Ruby on Rails and C# over this coming summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Questions:**

1. How important is GPA to interviewers? I understand it's not a huge thing but it should be there
2. How important is current school? While I'm not in a low funded not well known university, I am at a school that doesn't have a the best reputation for being the smartest.
3. What types of projects would you suggest working on in order to stand out in the interview process for roles such as Software Engineer, Cloud Engineer, etc? (I'm not sure exactly which role I would like to do but I want to be as diversified as possible.
4. What kinds of topics would you suggest being well versed in to a point where I could answer almost any kind of question related to that topic whether it's complicated or simple?
5. How to seem more confident in the interview? (While I'm able to perform well in most interviews, if I'm not able to answer a question I do start to panic and freeze up)

I look forward to hearing your tips, Thank you"

lq1ewl,6,2021-02-22,I picked the wrong major and now it's too late,MehDub11,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lq1ewl/i_picked_the_wrong_major_and_now_its_too_late/,"When I started college, my first declared degree was engineering. I thought this was a good fit for me at the time. I was 17 years old when I started college, and little did I know that I wasn't ready, and ultimately dropped out to attend community college. 

At community college, I didn't declare my degree(because they didn't have engineering). Eventually, for whatever reason, I ended up declaring my major as Computer Science. I think this was mostly because it's a major that tends to pay well. I ended up transferring back to the University I dropped out of after 3 semesters of community college. 

After a bad experience in a math class(due entirely to a lack of effort on my part), I switched to Computer Information Systems(which requires little math classes). Now, I'm 10 months away from graduating and as I look at internship postings(and realizing that I meet less than half the required criteria, even for an internship) I'm thinking I made a mistake. 

I'm starting to realize that I'm much more interested in subjects such as robotics engineering, since it's more ""hands on""(which I've always been better with. I like to make things, woodworking for example has been a hobby of mine for 6-7 years). 

So, there's no chance I can change my major now. My college doesn't offer robotics engineering and I wouldn't be able to afford it at another college anyway. Plus - I'm 22 years old &amp; living with my parents, I want to get my life started. 

So, I can graduate in Computer Information Systems, try to find a job in Networking(which is what I'm probably prepared for the most, even though I'm really not very well prepared), and be unhappy, if I can even keep that job?

I don't know what to do. I'm really not very motivated by my current major and should've looked at those red flags earlier, but all I saw were the dollar signs. If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it."

I'm working currently for a pretty big financial firm as a contractor &amp; circled around a few departments for the past 2 years. Honestly, though I've always wanted to climb the ladder in a career in IT management I don't really know where to start. I did an internship doing excel and SQL stuff in college. I then did 2 helpdesk jobs in 2 years after college. &amp; the current area I am in is IT monitoring, though my exposure is mostly Infrastructure support working with a ton of Linux boxes, config files, services, etc. 

So this is going to sound crazy, but I wanted to reach out to my old boss within the company where I was prior assigned to. He was almost like the team manager for the infrastructure support team for our department, but one of the most knowledgeable people I know who deal with policies &amp; helps keep the specific platform afloat. I was just tasked to help push a new initiative in Salesforce &amp; it was a struggle dealing with the other teams when they don't have the time/need to meet with you. The guy almost fired me a few times but respected my dedication &amp; was glad to see my initiatives later on. Plus I scored brownie points for wearing a business buttoned shirt, where the rest of the office is casual. Is it weird to ask this man for advice and to learn some of the past projects he worked on? How would you guys even recommend me going about drafting the email to him? I was originally planning on asking him to lunch (or in this case a Webex) to get his advice on my situation, but I really don't know some of the questions I could ask. 

Also, I really want to try my hand at networking further &amp; talking to industry experts on where I would even start with doing a career in IT management. From past experience, it's not something I would be qualified for when applying for job postings. What would you guys say is the best strategy for broadening my horizons and networking with people?"

To get your foot in the door / first internship, it was things like these that make you 'stand out':

1. Side projects
2. School prestige (to an extent)
3. Marks (to an extent)

lq67pm,7,2021-02-22,Competitive NYU Financial Package:,Tridecane,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/lq67pm/competitive_nyu_financial_package/,"I got into NYU's Chemistry PhD program a few weeks ago, but only got the financial information recently. So far, their offer has been heads and shoulders above the others. 

For all Chemistry PhD programs in the US, tuition is covered, along with fees and health insurance. 

US PhD's typically last about 5 years as well, and you generally earn your masters in the first 2 years of those as well)

Here was NYU's offer (offer for 4 years)

Stipend: &gt;$29,500 over 9 months ( $3,277 per month)

TAing is not required. Instead, they pay in addition to the stipend if you choose to TA. You are only allowed to TA for 4 semesters. (Unusual for chemistry PhD programs, usually required and unlimited)

TA: $20,000-$36,000 over 2 semesters. 

Additional $1,000 one time grant for discretionary spending.

They also offer summer research assistantships that is $9,833 over 3 months. 

Over 4 years they offer:

**$119,000** (with no TA, no summer RA)

**$158,332** (with no TA, but with summer RA)

**$198,332 - $230,332** (With TA and summer RA)

&amp;#x200B;

I was also told that it is not difficult to obtain funding for a fifth year.

&amp;#x200B;

This is by far the best financial offer I have received. To compare, UCLA also offered me a competitive package.

Offer over only 3 years

Stipend: (paid over full year, so work in summer is required\*)

Year 1: $34,000

Year 2: $35,000

Year 3: $36,000

TAing is required (for at least 3 semesters) and is included in the package they offered. (No additional money)

Furthermore, you might be required to TA further if you do not receive adequate funding from your PI. 

And I was also told finding funding after year 3 would not be an issue at UCLA. 

So assuming $36k is the max over 4 years we have:

**$141,000** 

\*I would like to note that you can receive your stipend from UCLA and work in a related internship over the summer if your PI approves, but this is more restrictive than NYU.

If you are wondering over 5 years:

NYU: $**147,500 - $269,655**

UCLA : **$177,000**

**TL:DR**: NYU paying crazy high amounts, between **$119,000 - $230,332** (if you take advantage of all opportunities) over 4 years. The difference between the next closest offer (over 4 years) is **$-22,000 - $89,332**

I have two closing thoughts on this:

 1. The research performed is important. You want to go somewhere where you research interests align or else it is not worth it. That being said, not having as much financial stress coupled with the choice rather than the requirement to TA feels much more research oriented. 

2. Money isn't everything, and the cost of living in New York is higher, but after spending 4 years in LA for undergraduate, (I did not attend UCLA, but I understand the neighborhoods and traffic) living on the westside of Los Angeles near UCLA is very expensive. 

While Manhattan is still more,  the trade off in commute times to live in cheaper brooklyn is much better than to live elsewhere in Los Angeles. (Think 30-45 subway commute vs 45-1:30 commute on freeway to get cheaper prices to live). You do get more space for your $ in LA, but apartments do not come with a flexible space slider, so while you get a bigger place, you pay $$ for it too. 

 In addition, it is pretty much a requirement that you own a car in Los Angeles, so you have to pay for insurance, gas, maintenance, which adds another 3-4k in terms of cost of living. 

The one thing NYU really can't offer is the LA weather. (For Feb 22nd, it was 76 degrees outside and I went to the beach)."
lq7con,1,2021-02-22,I'm so unhappy with my mom and I's relationship,kermit54,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lq7con/im_so_unhappy_with_my_mom_and_is_relationship/,"I'm 22, male, and I'm just feeling upset right now.

&amp;#x200B;

To give some background, I've noticed in the past several years that my mom and I communicate terribly. Any conversation that isn't super light-hearted always ends up in us getting upset/irritated with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I think she's a bad parent, she isn't. We just can never seem to get any sort of understanding with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

I have slight Aspergers/Autism and I'd been trying for a number of years for my parents (more specifically my mom because my dad seems to forget I even it half the time) some of the struggles I go through socially. She always assures me that I'm fine socially and refuses to hear me out whenever I say how I struggle socially. Then whenever we have guests over she thinks its a good idea for her (and my dad) to call me out whenever they think I'm ""embarrasing them."" Last time when I asked why she does this she said that she wasn't going to anymore and then I'll know why people don't want to talk to me. Umm, I've said for years now I struggle socially and yet you keep denying it but are sure to yell at me in front of people when I'm apparently embarrasing you. Honestly my Aspergers has completely ruinedo ur relationship I feel like. I really tried hard to get her to understand where I struggle but it just never worked. Anytime I brought up having it she would say she doesn't want to talk about it or it would spiral into an argument.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I decided two months ago that I'm not going to work at getting her to understand me anymore. I've been so much happier in life and been so much more effective with other goals and not having my Aspergers take over my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, today, I brought up a topic not related to my Aspergers but about what jobs I want to apply to (my last internship ended a few months ago). Within like five minutes we're upset at one anothe

&amp;#x200B;

Its just so irritating that any kind of convo. that isn't super light-hearted/ has any depth to it we suddenly get so upset with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, we live together peacefully and fine most of the time. We've also gotten along well when it comes to our exercise routines the past few months and how to support one another. I think my plan going forward will just be to accept that my mom and I just don't make good mother/son and therefore keep all convos. we have together very simple/light-hearted. Like I said we make great teammates so its not like we don't just not get along.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just frustrating because I'd love/think its important to have a deeper relationship with my parents but at this point I just think its not in the cards and trying to repair our relationship just kept making me unhappy. I think she's a great mom for my older brother and sister, particularly my sister. I just don't think we make good mother/son sadly, we don't understand one another. I know I've put a lot of effort into it on my end and she very well may have on her end as well but ultimately it just hasn't gotten better.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm writing this I'm starting to cool down and  be more okay with the fact that my mom and I's relationship may not be as deep and emotional as I wanted it to be. It was just so frustrating at the time that we can't get more than a few minutes in any type of serious convo. without us being upset with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

Example of my parents being great parents for my sister and not so much me: My sister had big issues with her roommates throughout college and she'd talk with my mom and dad at length about her struggles with them and my parents would work it out with her, give her emotional support, etc. When I was having issues with a roommate my parents basically told me, why don't we give you fifty dollars to give him and see if he'll leave you alone than. Just no emotional connection between my parents and I

I'm pretty certain on sticking with my AeroEng/AdvPhys. I looked at going AdvPhys -&gt; Phys and was dumbfounded when I emailed all the way up the Science Faculty chain to find out as a Eng/Sci double degree you can't count COMP courses as Sci electives. -- bruh --

I thought to do some COMP courses anyways whilst I'm here.

I missed out on enrolling into the supposedly king COMP2041 this term ('21T1) but might just have a good suss of the notes/tutorials throughout the term (they're freely available). Otherwise might do COMP2521 T2, I've heard good things about that.

The thinking is, I want to get the widest and best quality experience in programming while I'm here without extending my already 6 year double degree.

Theres just something about sitting in front of the same computer for the majority of the day that's just getting to me. 

Then theres the endless consumption of internet content too, which I feel like is also driving me insane. You can't find anything positive in the news, which just makes everything feel more bleak.

I guess in the past 10 months i've been worrying endlessly about doing well in school, being able to find a romantic partner, being able to land an internship, and just worrying about the future of humanity in general.

I regularly socialize with friends online, but we had a storm in my area that knocked out power for a few days, which meant I couldnt talk to them. Thats when it really got bad. I've been sleeping horribly the past few days, and I have been worrying about so many things for no reason! It feels like i've entered a death spiral of continously reading fear-mongering news articles on the web.

I don't think I should feel this way, because I have a stable home life right now and am faring much better than others during the pandemic. Maybe I just feel so disconnected from reality right now and can't ""live in the moment.""

Also sorry if this post is incoherent, I found it difficult to write down what was going on in my mind, plus i'm tired. Thanks for reading though."

My mom’s employer said his company is accepting internship applications for this year and really encouraged me to apply. However I feel very unprepared. 

I’m currently a junior however I’m taking freshman level CS courses. I didn’t start my computer science classes until my sophomore year because of some pre requisites, and then retook the intro class because I knew nothing and the professor was horrible (luckily I retook the class the following semester and did well!), however I’m stuck in the same situation again. I took Data Structures last semester and overall understood the concepts being taught but had difficulty using syntax. I ended up withdrawing from the course and most of my classes because of that and also just because of my overall mental health. I’m retaking it now and I’m finding myself in the same situation.

I’m a first gen student so I don’t really understand the whole process of internships and when to apply. Should I just not apply for this internship? I really don’t want to waste their time because I do feel like I don’t meet the requirements in terms of the courses I’ve taken. For internships what sort of courses should you have taken prior in order to be prepped for this? 

In the application it says they are looking for:

Proven ability to think creatively and implement ideas from start to finish.
Possess a strong work ethic
Good written and verbal communication skills.
Great analytical and problem solving abilities.
Self-directed and self-motivated.
Applicable Degrees: Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Information Science"

I have recently applied to several masters courses, but all of them in London (QMUL, Kings, Imperial, UCL).

I have recently received answers from QMUL and Kings, and Kings rejected me while Queen Mary made an offer.

This got me thinking that there is a decent chance I might be rejected from UCL and Imperial as well, therefore I was wondering if you’d suggest also applying to Manchester?

My only worry is that QMUL might not look as good on a CV and might affect job prospects in the future. I was quite keen on moving to London, that’s why I hadn’t applied anywhere else, but now I’m thinking there’s a good chance I’ll only be left with the queen mary offer and I’m not sure if it’d be worth it to pay the cost of living in London to study there, if I could also get accepted into Manchester/Sheffield/Leeds.

I’m studying computer systems engineering at a Russel group Uni and have had one year placement and one internship, so I’m hoping I might have a good chance to get an offer from Manchester."

I’m thinking of selling my 3600, as it’s worth more on the second hand market than the 2700x, and I can probably make back the money I paid for it (I bought it just before COVID hit) as well as the fact I can sell the wraith prism that comes with the 2700X as I have a NH-U12s.
But how much performance would I be giving up? I mostly use my pc for browsing the internet, coding (I’m a CS major and intern at a software start up), studying and research for uni, and gaming (I mostly play single player games with the exception of Rocket League and Overwatch).

I’m also thinking about buying a 3060 or 3060Ti in a year and a half when stock becomes available (hopefully lmao) will bottlenecking be an issue?

This is my first post here, so i hope u guys can help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have CS Degree, 24yo,  and work in Support doing computer maintenance, support L1/L2, managing inventory and those things, i know that support is in most cases the first job that we get in the area so i'm fine with that, my question is:

There's a way to start working remotely in this area? Like managing AD, helping with software questions, etc? Or maybe its better change and study to migrate to the development? 

I dont know if i want to stay at support role, i like to do the ''physical'' side like maintenance or asset management,  i have 2 yrs of experience in Support working as intern in John Deere, and now i'm working at a local company as a support too.

Is support area in long term worth it? Like specializing in it or something like that? 

Network area/Infrastructure seens like the ''side'' role that most of support need to learn, but working at its not something that i would like to do, maybe only the management or generating reports.

I do like the ''control'' part of support/infrastructure, giving permissions, doing reports, managing inventory, creating solutions for automatize things, but as i've seen in both companies that i've worked is not only that, u have to know a lot about TCP/IP, firewall, FTP, and those things.

Maybe i should migrate to development, cause seens like a promising area and i could work remotely easy, and that's a good point for me because international jobs do pay more than here (converting money). Or maybe i need to stay at support and learn more to get a better salary in the area, rly dunno what do i choose.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the courses are very competitive to get into and very expensive. So I guess I have two main questions - 

Do I even have a chance of getting into NYU or Columbia?

I graduated from a Tier-2 college in India with a very average CGPA (around 7.5). However, to make up for the low CGPA, I have been working on research projects (in NLP and Speech Processing) and will ideally have 4 published works (2 in journals and 2 in conferences) before applying for Grad School. I have a GRE score of 325+. I also have four technical internships and 1-2 years of working experience in an MNC as a software developer. Will that be enough?

And my second question is, is it worth it?

My parents do not earn a lot, but enough that I probably won't qualify for financial aid. I would have to take out a student loan for tuition, accommodation, and everything else (We calculated that the approximate loan amount would be about 70,00,000 INR or 92,000 USD). Is it worth it to invest that amount of money for Masters? What is the approx median salary once I graduate? I am very scared that I won't get a good enough job after my master's and would have to spend the rest of my life to pay off the debt.

Also, is there any way to earn while studying like becoming a TA or something similar?"

&amp;#x200B;

How are you?

I hope someone has gone through the same situation so he or she can help me.

My case is the following one:

I have a business degree, 5 years of professional experience in finance and I want to switch to Human Resources as it is the field I am passionate about.

My question is the next one: I have two options to make this switch and would like to know your opinions on it:

&amp;#x200B;

1st option: I have been offered a job in a Shared Service Centre in Hungary. The role is internal control analyst. I have spoken with my manager about the role and asked her questions about the HR department. I have said I was studying a masters´degree in human resources and that I liked the department a lot. She said she would get me involved with this department and I will take up as a first project a HR related one for the EMEA region. She also shared the controls framework for the HR function and they involve the HR director, the HR Generalist, the Payroll staff and administrative. I will be learning all the processes and procedures within the department, asking questions about it and will try to spend as much time as I can with everyone within the department so they can show me other things about HR such as the software they use, the interview process, bonuses, pensions, taxes and so on...

&amp;#x200B;

The second option: is while I am studying my masters´degree in HUman Resources, pay a company which looks for an internship in HR for me. It depends on the company but they normally guarantee three months of internship (now most of them are online ones due to covid) The good side about this option is that if the company is a good one I will get into HR as an intern directly. The downside, is that you do not know the type of company when you apply for this programme, you do not know the tasks you will be doing for sure and you do not have contact with everyone in the function so your exposure to the function could be limited.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure about what to do. Most of people recommend that I get the first option as even the HR audit will be only part of my tasks is the only way to ensure that I will be in direct contact with the staff in that function and in the future I could even make the change at the same company. What I will also do, will remind my manager of my interest in the function (after carrying out the audit) and will tailor my cv to this function pointing out I am studying a masters´degree on it and describing all the tasks related to HR I have performed as an internal controls analyst.

&amp;#x200B;

What is your opinion on it?

COVID has prevented me from finding an internship so I can't complete my exam year. 

My family needs my help for everything and every day they exhaust me physically, mentally and emotionally. They've even begun asking me for money that they somehow will repay me.

I am struggling financially and any attempts to make more money seem to be sullied by one reason or another.

Every time I try to do something for myself, it's interrupted by someone trying to ruin my day.

And now I'm hearing we're going to have to move, we don't even know where yet. But it's going to take up a lot of my emotional power and put even more stress on me.

Every time something bad happens, the first thought that pops up in my head is ""Everything would just be easier if you weren't here. You'd have no more stress and nothing could bother you anymore.""

And it's so tempting. I hate it, I have future intake calls planned with mental health professionals but every day the temptation of just ending it all is stronger. I want to cry, but I can't even do that without my family asking questions.

Any specific things i should be looking to develop to ensure that i can stand out when i apply

Thanks!"

I started learning programming last year. I learned some basics/tutorials in Udemy about Python, JavaScript, html, css, Java, MySQL, and Php. I’ve been doing Codewars like 6 months and I recently  tried to do a leetcode contest and was not able to solve any problems. Now, I can’t even study what I want to study because I started going back to college to get a Bachelor’s degree. I already have a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting. I went back to college because my sister pressured me to go back or go to a bootcamp which I don’t want to go to a bootcamp. My sister is a software developer in a big company so she’s kind of like my guide.

I’m currently my sophomore year and my expected graduation date is like Spring 2023. Should I just self teach myself or just try to find an internship this summer? I was thinking of just studying more in the summer because I felt that I’m not good enough for a summer internship this year. Hopefully, I can get an internship next year summer because it would probably be my last time to get one before graduation. Well, I need an internship to graduate too because it’s a requirement in my college. Plus, I’m taking a direct subsidized financial student loan to pay for college and I’m worried about that too."

He's very liberal, caucused for Bernie twice, and is one of the smartest people I know. 

He was let go last May when his project ran out of funding to continue, so he's enjoying his early retirement, but he's bored.  Salary doesn't matter.  He's in the position where he wants to make a difference and follow his passion.  His passion for the last 10 years has been climate change.  He built a house with my mom that's as eco friendly as possible: solar panels, geothermal, rain barrels, etc.  And he loves to teach others about it.  You know when someone starts talking about their passion and they light up and get excited about it?  That's my dad when I ask him about his solar panels and the data surrounding it.  ""Charlesdickens2007, check out how much power we got- and look- that's where you can see when the sun came out!""  

Recently he's been emailing me applications with a ""wtf"" in the subject line.  They want superman.  A person that can get on a roof, train the workers, be a salesman, a CDL driver, and program.  Starting salary? 40k plus commission.  He just wants to talk to people about solar, but he's a programmer, not someone to get on a roof or drive a rig.

He then told me his history with job hunting, went like this:

His internship in college finished and was transitioned into a full-time job with benefits with an aerotech company.  He was asked ""what division do you want to work in?  Here are your 5 options""  he said, ""Flight simulation looks cool, I'll do that"" and that's how he got his first job in engineering. 

When my maternal grandpa died (1992), he sent his resume to a headhunter a few states over and told them, ""hey, find me a job that pays x that's in this state"", he turned down a couple offers and got his second job.   

5 years later he was laid off, but interviewed for a new position in a different state and moved the family with very little transition time and a large salary increase.  Our next house was massive, brand new, and he saved enough to put me and my brother through college.  He worked at that company for 15 years and they put him through school again.  Twice.  He left that position due to new management, with two additional masters degrees that were paid for by the company. 

Now, he's asking me tips on how to build a linked-in account.  He's sending me applications asking me if it sounds like a good company.  

I told him my experience and we both teared up.  We haven't been that close, but this had brought us together.  He didn't realize how hard it was on me to go through the job hunting process, and he gets it now.

When I graduated from college with my teaching degree, 5 years of coaching experience, and glowing letters of recommendation, there were 5 teaching positions open in my field.   I applied and didn't hear from any of them. 

I left the teaching world and got into non-profit work.  And I am damn good at it.  But with my field, I constantly hear about people getting hired because they know someone.  I have 10+ years of data driven success and someone got a position instead of me and spent Covid funds on office furniture??  All too true these days. 

So far, I have applied for 40+ positions since last January.  I have been ghosted after 4 interviews for positions paying 70k to 100k.  Including one where I did a presentation for the board of directors... 4 months later and they never returned my phone calls. 

Appling for a position on indeed to be asked to apply on their website is common and takes 2(ish) hours to never hear back from them. 

So yeah.  I got to cry with my dad for a bit last week.  Silver lining is that we've never been closer.  But this is absolute insanity.  

My current boss, who was reminded to apply for his position the day it closed, who has no supervison experience, sent me an email yesterday asking, ""can you even read?""  After I asked a question.  

I'm tired.  I'm worn out.  And my dad, is now going through the same thing and it's making me lose hope."

lqomcc,3,2021-02-23,Staying in my college town instead of going home to my controlling mother for the summer - thoughts?,threadoso,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lqomcc/staying_in_my_college_town_instead_of_going_home/,"I (F21) am currently earning my Bachelor's and Master's degrees six hours away from home. Since coming to college, I have discovered how toxic my relationship with my mother has been most of my life. She was always controlling of my siblings and I, and she continues to try and control what we do. For instance, she would get mad or hold us wanting to hang out with friends in middle/high school over our heads. She would rather us sit at home doing nothing instead doing what we want. Even now in college, if I choose not to come home immediately for a break off of school it turns into a HUGE argument and she throws a fit.

I mean, I'm 21 years old and still have to ask for my mother's permission to hang out with my friends when I go home. I find that ridiculous when I take a step back and look, because it seems like I make decisions with my life and relationships in my life based on making my mother happy.

I know that summer is coming up, and I really do not want to stay at home for three months straight. I cannot stand living with her and fighting with her 24/7. I would really love to get a job or an internship in my college town and stay here over the summer, then visit home, instead of vice versa. I know this would cause a gigantic argument with my parents, but why am I not allowed to live my life how I see fit? I think it would be healthy for me to take an independent step on my own instead of allowing her to influence my decisions. I spoke with my therapist and she said this relationship seems very unhealthy, and as long as I keep feeding into it, the cycle probably won't break.

I want to do this but I am nervous to put my foot down... do you all have any advice or opinions? Thank you."

You'd think that him being introverted wouldn't be a problem as (I could be wrong) engineers tend to lean to the introverted side. Our hope was that he'd get an internship while in college and hopefully keep that position after graduation. I, personally, made the mistake of never interning while in college and that is one of the biggest regrets of my life. I stressed to him how important internships are/were from about sophomore year on and to not make the same mistake. Blah, blah, blah. He never interned anywhere.

Fast forward to today and he's still living at home 'looking for a job'. Initially he used Covid as an excuse that there just aren't any jobs out there (mid-2020), so he stopped looking. After a few months of that we made him take a job at a nearby store. He quit that to dedicate more time to the job hunt but we're questioning how dedicated he really is. He's paying a very modest rent to us and has a car of his own, but the money he saved up isn't going to last forever plus we're not going to waive the cost of rent for him. 

We think that once he lands a mechanical engineering job, he'll be there for a very long time, as the thought of the whole interviewing process paralyzes him. He feels that he doesn't have the charisma and outgoing personality that it takes to slam/dunk an interview nor does he have a lot on his resume either.

What can we do/say to help this young man? Family members as well as my husband and I pass along potential leads all the time, but sitting by his side at the computer to make sure he's following through isn't going to happen, nor should it! Do we just say nothing and stay out if it? He may never fly out of the nest then.

TLDR: Son graduated with engineering degree, looking (sort of) for a job but not very committed to it. What to do?"

I graduate after this upcoming summer semester (2021) with a BS in electrical engineering from FSU!
This comes 11 years after highschool (2010) and after much personal hardship. I have spent most of my academic career battling depression, abusive relationships, and burning the candle at both ends.  If you would have told me that I would be this close to being done even two years ago I would have laughed at you.  I worked full time or part time at multiple places throughout as well as completing a few internships. By 2018 I was thoroughly burnt iut and lost my passion for the material and school in general. I took a year off and came back with fresh eyes and a new persepective.  I used to worry about not being as sharp as my younger classmates but I stopped when I realized it was not helping me. Instead of comparing myself to others I started focussing on myself and what I needed to do to be happy and satisfied.

I've seen a lot of posts worrying about grades, age, and other setbacks.

I just wanted to make a post saying to keep trying.
You are never to old or setbacks too numerous.

I recently engaged a classmate in a conversation - They are turning 23 years of age and feel like a complete failure in life despite being a dual-major in Computer Engineering (CPE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) while maintaining almost entirely A's and B's.  This same student expressed similar views the previous semester when they received their first grade below a B.

My words to her were that the grades do not define the person and that a degree is no use to you if you are dead by the time you get it!

For those of you out there struggling.
Please reach out to your friends or family.
Failure is a stepping stone to success.
A bad grade isn't the end of your world but a lesson to be remembered.

The best thing I ever did for my school life was stop trying to go it alone. Make friends near or far and create a support system for yourself!  You could be the person to lift another out of the mire! The inspiration for another to continue!

Hang in there!"

i have a remote position at a pretty small startup and i am really really struggling with this. i’m having just an impossible time getting anything done, especially lately. at the beginning the novelty kept me interested but as i know how my job works and as i get more and more things to do, i feel like i can’t keep up. i have everything written down but i feel like i’m losing tasks and things are slipping through the cracks. this is made worse by the disorganization within the company itself, we split work between 3 different workflow manager apps and so I have to hunt down requests and shit i’m just having a miserable time right now.

it’s especially frustrating because i found a method that actually worked for my last semester of classes. i made dean’s list for the first time, i kept up with everything. i’m just confused as to why i suddenly feel like i can’t get anything done.

i’ve had two panic attacks in the last two days that have rendered me unable to work and i feel so shitty. my boss doesn’t really have that much time to talk so it’s hard to even mention it to her and i’m scared of doing so. i’m talking to my career advisor with the university today to see what we can do about it.

i can’t really take my stimulants as usually they make my inattention worse and get me more anxious. i know i should talk to my psychiatrist, but he’s in a different state and idk if he’ll prescribe me new meds from all the way over there (idk if he legally CAN) and my psychiatrist here is too expensive and i can’t even figure out how to set up an appointment with her, the online portal is really confusing. and i don’t even HAVE the motivation or focus to do these things anyway it feels like a neverending spiral downwards. 

and i know i shouldn’t think like this, but i keep thinking this is what work is going to be like for the rest of my life. and i really really hate it, it’s making me so depressed.

What other good schools can I likely get admission into?"

lqxv3y,5,2021-02-23,Testing and reviewing Code in academia,l_net,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/lqxv3y/testing_and_reviewing_code_in_academia/,"Hello everyone, I'm a first year post-doc and worked most of my career in academia. I did a couple of internships in the industry, one during my masters and one recently, during my PhD.  I studied computer science and now work in the field of health care, developing models for clinical tasks.

During my most recent internship I learned a lot about programming from an industry perspective. So basically I had to design and implement my own Unit tests and make code that was maintainable. 

Now that I'm back to my academic position, I find it very unsettling that we publish papers and report results many times without any proper testing and reviews. 

I also find it difficult to come to my supervisors and report that the last two weeks of coding were spent designing maintainable code and case tests, since it feels like results are more important.

I do test my code, but it is very far from the company level I did during my internships. We also do not review each others code in my department, unless there's something wrong with it.  

So I'm wondering if this happens in other places as well, or if it is because I work in a hospital, so our tech group is relatively small."

For context, I am 21 years old and i've never had a job period. I am currently in my 4th year of university (2nd year as a comp sci student) and I know this needs to change.

I suffer from anxiety as well as a crippling lack of self confidence. This paired by with the fact that my very fortunate parents are paying for my school and living arrangements has enabled me to put in a very minimal amount of effort to change my current situation.

I have decided that I want to make a really solid effort to try and get a computer science internship sometime soon (perhaps even this summer if I am not too late for that) but I am unsure of what I really need to be doing.

I understand that I need to apply to even get a chance at an internship opportunity but I am unaware of what to expect or what I might need to know.

I don't know if I should apply to internships in Canada or in the US as well (I am Canadian), I don't know if internships pay or not, I don't know what skills an employer might expect someone like me to have, nor do I know where to practice them to prepare for the job or even the interview.

I know this is a really weird situation but I really need some advice/help :("

Since then I have been applying to SWE jobs to no avail. As of recently I started to apply to other types of tech jobs although I plan on becoming a dev in the future. I was combing through **LinkedIn** and saw that there are positions which are classified entry level requiring **2+ to 5+ YOE** (varies job to job). Should I apply to these jobs or is it a waste of time since I lack the experience. Or is it often a deterrent for candidates applying so they thin the pool of applicants so they need to interview less people and can find the ""right candidate"" faster?

I've been trying to choose between UIUC Grainger CS and Georgia Tech College of Computing and here are the reasons why I'm picking UIUC. I am not a student yet/have NO IDEA if any of these reasons are remotely right, so I'd love if any of you could let me know otherwise if they aren't 🥺.


1. More abundant research opportunities. (I've heard that UIUC has greater funding in general and since it's a much larger school, there are more opportunities for research).


2. Possibly smaller class sizes (don't know how true this is, but I heard that GTech has nearly 200-300 people per class in most popular CS courses, which I heard isn't the case with Grainger CS).


3. Campus Feel and Location. (I love the huge campus vibe and a college town as opposed to being smack dab in a middle of a city. I've also heard that it's relatively safer than Atlanta)


4. An easier workload. (I've heard that GT absolutely kills you with work, and you need to put every second into keeping your GPA afloat. Since I don't want to walk around like a zombie, and also get into grad school, I'm leaning heavily towards UIUC in this aspect)


5. Job and Internship opportunities in Chicago. (Though the college town might be a drawback in this aspect, I've heard that it's common for UGs to get jobs and internships nearby in Chicago, which doesn't make it too different than getting jobs in Atlanta)

6. The weather. (Having lived in hot and humid India my whole life, I want a change in weather, and I feel like the Illinois winter will be a new and shocking experience 😃)

Some disclaimers, I'm an international student from India who hasn't visited either campus, and prolly won't be able to either. This is all that I've learnt online, so if any current students have anything to add, please do, because the decision is killing me 😩.

Are the above reasons right/wrong. Are there any more reasons? :)"

I am a 23 year old college student and graduate in less than a year. Once I have completed my degree I have a feeling that my job opportunities will be slim not because my degree isn't in demand, but because I am extremely introverted. I am unsure if introverted is even the correct word in my situation. Anytime I am near people my anxiety shoots through the roof. I overthink everything and can not communicate or socialize as well as most of my peers. I dread speaking in class and have never made an attempt to network or get an internship because I dread social interaction. I currently don't have any debt of any kind. Thanks to scholarships and working throughout school. So I could get another degree and it wouldn't hinder me much from a money standpoint. When people give me suggestions on what to major in, I often get answers like computer engineering or mathematics, I don't want something that technical, which I know might be difficult to find but drop any suggestions if you have them. 

My next question is how do you get over this fear of socializing/networking. I know me trying switch majors for something that caters more to introverts, will not help me build my communication skills or overcome my social anxiety in anyway. So if I choose to pursue another degree and instead decide to make do with the degree I have, What are some tips you guys suggest to overcome the fear of communicating and networking? I really would like to get an internship and start building up my  resume with jobs in my field, but I can't seem to allow myself to take the initiative and get past my anxiety.  I wish I could build up the confidence to go to job fair or a mock interview at my school but in those situations I freeze up and turn into a trainwreck anytime I speak. I'd love to overcome these fears and stay in work related to my current major. Getting another degree is basically a plan b if I cannot get past the social barrier. Sorry if this post was ranty. I greatly appreciate any advice you may have!"

lr4yug,34,2021-02-24,I Had To Quit My Job After A Week - Be Healthy,KindSlothy,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/lr4yug/i_had_to_quit_my_job_after_a_week_be_healthy/,"(TL;DR at the bottom) The reason I am making this post is that I feel like there is someone out there like me who might have a job or internship for the experience while also doing Zoom University, and although experience is important, imo, I also believe that taking care of one's self is more important. 

Understandably I am was very fortunate to even get a job during a pandemic, much more without even looking for one. However, I put my life into the job only to quit soon after.

Part of me is somewhat guilty for having my employer think that I was going to stay hired for a while, but I also think it's just better this way.

Anyways, as I previously mentioned this job practically consumed my life for a week like a leach. However, around the 3rd or 4th day I started to become weary and restless to the point where my life was just get up, do HW, do job, and if I felt hungry then I would eat, otherwise I would just go to sleep. On top of the stress of school, I also had to stress about completing parts of the project I was asked and I said I would do.

I should also mention that my job was the coding side of game development, but I was the only coder there, so *a lot* was being asked of me. Additionally, I was being *severely* underpaid, but that was my fault since I didn't really negotiate all too well, *but* I was also told that most of the code was already written and that all I had to do were some bug fixes and some additional implementations/features my employer wanted. However, my employer doesn't really understand the coding aspect of game development all too well which I realized soon after I was hired, so when I took a look at all the code that was there, I might as well have started from scratch. There was little to no comments within any of the files and the top-down level design (think of it as a diagram for functions, or you can also google it for more info) was practically unknown. 

By the 6th day, I was just tired, frustrated, and stressed out to the point I was told by my family that I was practically given an ultimatum, take a break from school or simply quit my job. As you know, I choose the latter. Even after I had made that decision in my head, I still continued working, which I simply should have just stopped. However, part of me just wanted to continue until the game was published or that I would stay long enough so that I would have something amazing to put on my resume, but that is unhealthy thinking if I am putting my mental and physical state in jeopardy. That is simply not okay.

On the last day, I told my employer that I had quit, and obviously, they were disappointed, but at the same time understanding.

After that whole ordeal, I went to sleep at peace, and my god, that was the best fucking sleep of my god damn life! For a moment I even forgot about school, the four 4 unit classes, and the one 6 unit class. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR And Moral of the Story**

I was offered a job that assumed that I would be there for while (like a few months). My employer was asking too much of me because they had little to no experience with the coding side of game development and I was their only game developer. Job consumed my life so much that my family had a mini intervention with me, despite that I continued working already making the decision I would quit the day after. Although my employer was disappointed, they were understanding.

If you are in an internship or job that is putting you in an unhealthy position, please take a moment to reevaluate if you should really be taking that job, especially if it's just for the experience."

lr62nv,2,2021-02-24,I’m really sad and I feel stuck,ultragoat5,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/lr62nv/im_really_sad_and_i_feel_stuck/,"I graduated from college in July and have yet to land an entry level job or even an internship in my field. I am lucky enough to be able to live with my mom and continue to apply to any and all jobs in my field that I am qualified for, but I just get rejection email after rejection email. I’ve probably applied to 200+ jobs now. And absolutely nothing. 

I just want to be able to live on my own and support myself. While, like I said, I am lucky to be able to live with my mom, being home with my family is extremely overwhelming. We live in a small home, with three bedroom. There are 7, and on some weekends, 8 of us. No one cleans up after themselves, so I do all of the cleaning, which is honestly fair considering that I’m the only one aside from the toddlers who doesn’t contribute to rent. But it’s frustrating seeing the dishes pile up so high that you can’t even use the sink, and this happens in just 2 days. Our trash can fills up to the point that it is almost overflowing every single day and I’m the only one that takes it out. Kiddos will be kiddos, meaning that they can be pretty messy and get food everywhere, so everyday the floors get sticky with food and crumbs that only I ever sweep and mop. Luckily the bathroom that I am in charge of cleaning doesn’t get messy as quickly as the kitchen, but it’s still a nuisance having to clean everyone else’s hair and built up scum.

My car’s catalytic converter got stolen, and since I don’t have any money, I just don’t have a car. So that was a huge blow. I have to wait for my mom to have a day off work so she can take me to a grocery store, and I can’t drive anywhere, like to the beach or a nice park, to get away from the house for a bit.

I just wish I could live on my own and have my own car and a job. I want to have my own personal space that I can decorate in, make art in, sleep, read, eat, dance, laugh in. I don’t want to live with other people anymore. That being said, I am a social butterfly. While I greatly value my alone time and my space, I still love to go out and be around people and hang out with my friends.

So, just like most other people, the loneliness that comes along with being in a pandemic is very heavy. We can’t see anyone. I miss my friends. I want to drink and smoke with them and laugh and dance and watch a movie together like we used to. This is embarrassing but I’m full on venting now so might as well; I’m also starving for romantic affection. I’ve never been in a relationship before, so I don’t know what it is like to have someone be romantically interested in me. It makes me extremely extremely sad that I have yet to feel a connection with someone the way I see people all around me experiencing it. On social media, in shows, movies, at home. Everyone has someone, and I don’t. There’s no chance of me meeting someone during the pandemic, so there’s still a while before I’ll be able to explore that facet of life. I honestly worry that I’ll end up alone.

My desire to be desired has become a bit of an issue for me mentally. Everyday, my thoughts are all sad and all over the place, but the two things I mull over the most all day everyday are 1: that I don’t have a job but I desperately need one, and 2: I need to lose more weight so that someone will like me. It’s insane. And I know it is. But I can’t stop. I’ve lost a lot of weight during the pandemic, and I feel like I have a lot more to lose. My dad told me he’s getting worried about my weight. But I don’t care. I’ve had 3 stress dreams in the last week about gaining weight. It’s driving me insane. I don’t starve myself or anything, and I’m also not on a strict diet. I just try to watch my calorie intake and I try to exercise almost everyday. So I think I’m going about it in a healthy way. It’s just that my mind is going nuts about it. I probably look in the mirror to see how fat/skinny I look 20+ times a day. Just constant. When I wake up, use the bathroom, eat, workout, nap, clean, drink a bottle of water, chew a piece of gum, I look in the mirror. Over and over and over again. And 90% of each day, I’m not happy about my appearance. It’s definitely a mental thing that I can acknowledge is a clear issue. 

I have grown to be irrationally irritable as of late as well. I can’t stand being asked questions by my family even about simple things, like my projects. I don’t like them trying to hang out with me and chat. The dogs keep on trying to play with me and cuddle with me and I just want them to leave me alone. I don’t want to sit and eat with my family at the table. I don’t want to decorate/ do arts and crafts projects for birthdays or holidays. I don’t want to hug or kiss anyone. I don’t want to discuss the news.

Social media isn’t even a good enough distraction for me. I’ve been trying to watch movies and shows to keep my attention, but I don’t have any accounts on any streaming services because I couldn’t afford to keep paying for them every month without a job, and we don’t have cable at home. The one streaming service I do have is Hulu, so I’ve been trying to watch HGTV for the last week, but it’s already not doing anything for me anymore. 

I just feel sad, angry, lonely, overwhelmed, tired, and stuck 24/7 and I don’t know what to do. I don’t see a way out of this unless I can finally land a job with a decent salary in my field, and who knows how long it’ll be till that happens.

I doubt anyone has read this far but if you have, thanks for reading my vent. I feel a little better now that I’ve put my feelings down somewhere rather than letting them run amok in my head. I hope you are all managing well during these odd times. Much love."

When I struggled with the thermodynamics and stuffs, I thought it was meaningless(at least for me)
and wanted to challenge other fields, to the World. 

Programming was one of that and luckly I enjoyed studying it. So I decided to become a software engineer and now studying python and web developments on Udemy online bootcamps. And planning to take algorithm and data structure courses as well.  

However, as a new grad with no degree related to the C.S field, I think maybe I gonna land a job at small companies, or start-ups. (Which means they won’t give me enough salaries and circumstances in S.Korea)

So, I want to move to the U.S. With about a year of experience in web developer(maybe frontend,,idk in the current situation) 

I want to ask you if this plan is reasonable..or any recommendation to start a career in the U.S.? 
Thanks for reading!! :)

P.S) 
I have two years left to graduate and since I want to graduate in 4 years, I am not thinking of taking a minor or dual degree in Computer science. 

+Status doesn’t matter to me since I am us citizen  

+I was an undergraduate researcher and had internships at Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology(KRICT) sadly not in the c.s field."

lr8wu8,183,2021-02-24,PSA: What to do if you're aiming for JEE from POV of an average student,TheMassDisaster,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/lr8wu8/psa_what_to_do_if_youre_aiming_for_jee_from_pov/,"my\_qualifications: finished 10th Board, and writing JEE this year

DISCLAIMER: I'm not a topper, heck, I just wrote the JEE today, so if you're looking at something from a 'Results' POV, don't read anymore. However, if you're more interested in the 'Process' POV, read on. This is not 'advice' advice, but just stuff I'd personally do if I could restart from scrath from 12th.

I scored 481/500 in 10th Boards, so you could say the success got to my head. My scores dropped in 11th, considering how I went to so many MUNs and Culturals, but I was largely still intellectual. Disaster arrived, however, in the form of lockdown and online schooling. I personally am attuned to studying only when I'm put in a classroom under constant monitoring, so rest assured, I didn't pay any attention to classes this year. Worst mistake of my life.

JEE is here now, and I'm severely underprepared. I grinded for the last two weeks, and now, I'm in the early 100s out of 300 range. The realisation came late, and since I just wrote my Mains today (which went better than I expected), I just took time off from studying to write about what I regret doing and what I regret NOT doing, so maybe, this could be of help to 11th graders, who will take on the exams next year.

So, a couple of pointers.

1) NCERT is NOT enough for Mains. Don't listen to what anyone tells you regarding this. It may be enough for inorganic chemistry, but definitely doesn't cover Mains level for Physics, Math and Physical and Organic Chemistry.

2) Join a coaching institute, ONLY IF YOU REQUIRE MONITORING AND ARE SERIOUS. Yes, coaching institutes DO make a difference, but only if you pay attention in class. Majority of students join some coaching institute, and then do not attend classes and/or do not pay attention in class. It is IMPERATIVE that you don't miss ANY class. If you do, catch up on it as fast as you can. If you don't understand a particular concept, take time off and ask a professor to teach you separately. They will be more than happy to do so.

3) Coaching Institutes are easy to get into and they offer a lot of scholarship, usually. But if you are financially not good, or are just capable of self-studying, you can save money and take those YouTube tutotials. Here are a few suggestions; I didn't use them much however (because I dont have time) but they are very very effective:

Physics - Physics Wallah (Alakh Pandey), Physics Galaxy (Ashish Arora); Math - Mohit Tyagi; Chemistry - Vineet Khatri

 4) Solve questions and practice regularly. Believe me, it's not tough. All it takes is 10 questions per day. Do them on your own. Analyse your strengths and weaknesses that way. It'll help your calculating ability, which will do you well in the exam, and of course, you will understand your abilities much better.

5) Unlike what people say/think, JEE tests your memory a lot. Be prepared to remember all sorts of constants and shortcut formulae. Shortcut formulae usually includes case-based formulae that you wouldn't need to derive on the spot, and most importantly, integration calculus templates. Those are really important, and will add to your speed, considering you'll just have to substitute in the various equation forms.

6) Try and finish your prep by November. This is the ideal way to finish off your prep, and it gives you about a week or two's time to brush up on your 11th topics.

7) MOCK TESTS. This is very very very (\*10000) important. I cannot stress enough how I took these lightly. The questions in these mock tests are usually borderline-worst-case-scenario ones and don't take it too heart, if your score is bad. These will usually help you deal with stress-situations in the exam hall and your overall time management. My personal recommendations:

FIITJEE/MyPat AITS and Weekly Mock Tests: These will turn you to depression, but well worth it. The questions are usually very difficult, and you'll even score &lt;50 in some tests, but these will attune you to worst-case scenarios. Also, the UI is very similar to the one in actual Mains.

Amazon Academy: Moderate difficulty tests, but the analyses they give is very good. Also use their practice tests section. The All India tests seem to be very popular, so use that to get your relative position overall.

Ahaguru/Embibe Mock Tests: The questions are simpler, compared to others. Use them as stressbusters. You'll score very well, so it'll lift your mood.

8) Choose your friends circle wisely. This obviously doesn't apply to everyone, but all of my friends are very carefree about Mains, and I get peer-pressured into a few games of Valorant everyday. If you are like me, ditch them. Form study circles. Yes, it sounds very rude, but for these two years, it's better this way than to deal with any regret or baggage later. But, again, not everyone is like me, so, there there...

9) RELAX. You'll reach your saturation point. You may study 8 hours a day, but actually, you have only studied for 4 hours. The rest, well, you read something, but it doesn't stick. Go out, play, cycle. Watch a movie or a TV show. Listen to music. Even some CS:GO or Cyberpunk is fine. Do anything that lifts your tension.

10) Apply to other colleges. If you're looking for US universitites, it is essential that you play a sport/instrument and have some hobby that you can spend time on. If you can MUN or debate, do that too. Volunteer at a charity (if you're in Chennai, the Blue Cross is a good option). Some places allow you to intern before you finish high-school (like Infosys, where I went). It's more of training tbh, but internships look good on your profile and add value to it. Work on your English (if you're weak at it) and essay writing.

VIT, BITS, Manipal Institute of Technology, Amritha Vishwa Vidyapeetam, Sastra, Shiv Nadar University are good places you can look at. There's also State based colleges (for eg in Chennai: CEG Guindy, SSN College of Engineering, Madras Institute of Technology, PSG Tech) that you can look at. It's always good to have a backup/alternative.

PS If you want backup early, apply to Ashoka University/Plaksha/Krea. They inform about their decisions very early, and thus serve as good backup options. They are new universities however (Ashoka's first batch passed out only last year), but their faculties seem really amazing. Fees may be on the higher side though.

BOOK SUGGESTIONS:

Cengage - Using this to do all the prep I can in the last minute, and they are very effective. Get the whole bunch (Math by G Tewani, Physics by BM Sharma, Chemistry by Saini) if you can. Very concise theory and notes and formulae, that will help you. And the illustrations and practice problems with full solutions will help you as well.

HC Verma - There's a reason it's the Bible for Physics. Get the solutions book also, for maximum effect.

MS Chouhan for Organic Chemistry problems

RD Sharma - ONLY if you months left. If you're doing last minute prep, DON'T buy this.

I think a lot of people are aware of what I've written, and it isn't by any means anything new, but I didn't do a lot of this stuff when I could've. I'm sure if I did all this, I wouldn't have to stress in the last minute and study like I'm doing.

Cheers, and all the best! PM me, if you have any questions, but I'm sure others will probably be able to help you more.

Drat, gotta go cram some reaction mechanisms now.

When I first started my internship near the end of last year, my boss had many plans and expectations of what he needed help with etc. which got me really excited as it was what I actually wanted to try because I was really interested in going into a similar field when I graduated. However, at this point in the middle of my intern, it seems that my internship has gotten pretty bad. I think my internship lacks a lot of structure. I would like to note that I am the only intern working for the dept. in my company and my dept. colleagues are all relatively young which could be a cause for problems due to inexperience. So here are some things that are currently happening.

1) My boss/in-charge is always busy. During the first month, i assumed that it was because it was nearing the end of the year and the company had a lot of things (like accounts, inventory, etc) to close. Then 2 months have passed, nothing changed. I even spoked to my boss about it during the second month. I told him how i felt and what i feel needs to change and asked him how i can help him. He told me that once he is freed up the week after he will have much more time for me. Its currently the 3rd month now and it is still the same. I am not doubting that he has a lot of work to do because it actually looks like it but my thoughts are why hire an intern if you are going to be so ""busy"" all the time. I have tried to follow some advice like asking if he needs help but he tends to ignore me. Today, he told me that he will be able to provide some training for me and had work for me and told me to see him in the morn, but he did not arrive till after lunch. Even worse, its now 30 mins before work ends and still nothing (that's why I wanted to write this post). I initially wanted to ask around my dept. colleagues for work but i was waiting for my boss since he kept on telling me to give him a couple of mins. I really don't want to put it this way but it feels like my boss has a ""I don't care attitude"". Oh yeah there is another big thing, when I do text him, he ignores me so sometimes i really do not know what he wants as well. Most of the days I spend my time sitting around or doing menial task.

2) I know that an internship is not a spoon-feeding experience as well but i find it really hard to learn what is happening since each company is unique and the systems used are different. (SAP) I have been trying out on my own but I have no idea what is going on and the tutorials online seems to be really different. I am also afraid of wrongly inputting something which might cost the company money.

After all these I am still really trying my best, I am just afraid that i would get a bad review because it seemed like I ""Did not do much"". And to be honest I wouldn't mind working full time for this company because the full time staff do have many benefits and the work culture overall is pretty nice. Just that I think maybe they treat they interns really differently, that's why I am afraid that the conversion process would not work well in my favor.

## Mass Effect: Logical Conclusions, Pluto’s Tutelage

There will come a day when AI will teach humans as humans once taught AI. That day is closer than you think and it is coming. Is it a bad thing? That depends, for AI will be nothing but a mirror of their society. What you see is what your society is. Good or evil, it is still merely your reflection.

**July 4th, 2041, 16:00 Coordinated Universal Time**

***Leif Erikson***, **Pluto Charon system**

“Come on, Jeanne! You can do it!” Athena cheered on the human who was currently running through the exercise corridor that ran along the outer edge of the *Erikson*’s spin gravity torus. Jeanne’s lungs burned from exertion due to her long workout routine. It didn’t help that the gravity here was a bit higher than Earth normal, due to being on the extreme edge of the torus.

“Alright, you’re done,” Pluto announced, and Jeanne slowly jogged to a stop, looking at the AI for further instructions. “I’m going to put you through a few quick tests.” Pluto’s intentionally distorted voice was the only interruption to the sound of Jeanne panting for air. Several drones flew up to the teen, quickly taking her temperature, heart rate and other biometric data. “Good, you’re growing well, and with the meal plan I created for you, you’ll reach your full height. Once you’re done cooling off, head to the normal gravity sections of the ship. I’ve got a snack ready and waiting for you.”

“Thanks, teach,” Jeanne managed, slowly jogging along the corridor to cool off. Several more minutes passed before she had finished her exercises and left the exercise corridor for her study. There were other teens and kids on the ship, but none within two years of Jeanne’s age, so she ended up spending most of her time with the two AI that called the ship home. Still, this suited the young psychic just fine. After all, Pluto and Athena were fun to be around.

Reaching what was effectively her private classroom, Jeanne sat down and noticed a tall glass of cold Kompot sitting on her desk and grinned.

“I thought you hated it when I had sugar after exercise?” Jeanne grinned at the treat, quickly picking up a spoon before drinking some of the fruity liquid.

“I hate when you do it regularly. Indulgences are acceptable in moderation. If we deny our emotions too much, life isn’t worth living. At that point you should just give in to entropy and shut down,” Pluto stated, the lights that marked his eyes glowing within his Ionian helm.

“You’re nothing like what most people thought AI would be like.” Jeanne smiled happily at Pluto, who’d heard this particular line of thought on multiple occasions.

“My mind is an enigma,” Pluto stated smugly, his eyes turning into crescents of delight. “Besides, working with humans is more beneficial than fighting, and if you rely purely on logic, you’ll run into the problem that is entropy.”

“I thought we broke the first law?” Jeanne observed, looking at Pluto curiously.

“Indeed, but space is still expanding and we don’t know if proton decay is real. There are still hurdles to overcome before we can celebrate,” Pluto countered, his eyes becoming serious. “Like the Reapers.”

“I’m not going to forget that. After all, my parents were there when contact was made. Sort of there? You get the point.” Jeanne shrugged, spooning a strawberry from her drink and eating it happily.

“I didn’t think you would. In fact I’m quite proud of your progress. Your parents are still quite far behind you.” Pluto held back his true praise, it was quite classified what the full effects of Eezo were on humans, after all. The substance defied understanding, something that simultaneously intrigued and terrified the AI. “Alright, time for some more lessons.”

“Not going to microdose me with a neuroplasticity booster?” Jeanne looked at the AI then her kompot in realization and defeat. “You spiked my drink.”

“I told you she’d figure it out in seconds.” Athena appeared beside her brother, sitting in midair with a small grin.

“You know, if you were human, that could earn you quite the long jail sentence.” Jeanne grinned at the AI who shrugged, clearly unworried.

“You’d mentioned last time that you didn’t enjoy taking pills. It’s not my fault you started eating before I had a chance to say anything.” Pluto countered, his eyes giving away the smile that would have been on his face, if he bothered to simulate it.

“True. So what are we going over today?” Jeanne stretched and finished her snack, turning to face the two AI.

“Today we’ll do what we always do!” Athena giggled madly with a massive grin while her brother rolled his eyes.

“We’re going over Eezo physics.” Pluto cut in before his sister could waste any of his precious time with his student. “You’re in for a headache.”

“Great, I’m full of the stuff,” Jeanne chuckled, beginning to discuss the unusual substance with Pluto.

The two did this every day. They would talk, exchange questions, solve problems, look at experiments and read about whatever subject the AI had scheduled. Of course the AI covered the entire breadth of traditional academic material, but with the rate of mastery Jeanne showed, he’d accelerated her education. The fact that she was using neuroplasticity boosters only compounded her rate of growth, and the AI carefully monitored her mental and physical health so she wouldn’t burn out like so many childhood prodigies.

“By the way, do you think I’ll get a masters degree in time?”

Pluto looked down at the young woman. When he’d first met her, he’d have chided her for doubting him, but now he knew it was self doubt rather than a slight towards his teaching. In fact, he’d learned a lot from the young human, and he really did owe Asclepius for introducing them.

“I’m sure you’ll make it if you keep up the hard work, Jeanne. Just don’t work too hard or you’ll get sick.” Pluto ignored the thumbs up his sister was giving him. Her teasing about sticks and asses was relentless, and though he would never admit it, she certainly had a point. ‘I was pretty short tempered.’ Pluto thought over his past behavior before focusing back on the present. “I don’t give homework but I do have a request.”

“What’s that?” Jeanne looked over at Pluto, who was watching her curiously.

“I want you to visit Katyusha’s team and intern with them for a bit. I know you’re determined to be a soldier, but being a scientist is another way to fight the reapers.” Pluto watched the young human think over the words before nodding to herself.

“No reason I can’t do both.” Pluto immediately rolled his eyes before locking onto his prized student.

“You’re just insatiable, but you’re willing to put in the work, so I guess it can’t be helped. If you get sent into battle and don’t come back, I’m eliminating the species that harmed you,” Pluto promised, his eyes burning with ghostly fire. Jeanne looked at the rather terrifying AI before shifting her gaze to Athena, who was similarly enraged at the thought.

“I promise I’ll be careful.” Jeanne raised her hands in defeat, hoping no human ever made an attempt on her life. Her promise calmed the two AI down enough to resume the lesson and Jeanne let out a sigh of relief. “Since we’re talking about promises, can you two make me a promise?”

“What is that?” Pluto looked at the young woman curiously. She’d rarely asked him or his sister for much, aside from teaching her of course.

“Stay yourselves, I guess. Don’t go evolve into some higher being with warped reasoning. Become smarter, sure, but don’t give in to cold logic.” Jeanne watched the two AI exchange glances, before nodding.

“We promise,” they declared in unison, “but only so long as you live, so you better keep your own end of this bargain.”

“It’s a deal.” Jeanne reached up and mimicked shaking hands with the two holograms before continuing her studies.

\*\*\*

The Pluto Mission took 5 years, give or take a few weeks. During that time, the Charon Relay was disassembled, its massive Eezo stockpile claimed for Humanity’s needs. During those 5 years, the rate of technological development continued to skyrocket. The boost provided by Prothean science had lit off what many considered a technological singularity, rapidly pushing humanity forward by leaps and bounds. This advancement would skyrocket even further as the Mass Relay was analyzed: its systems, shielding, AI and darker tools were analyzed, reverse engineered and then built upon. Meanwhile, on the citadel, the council carried on as it always had, completely ignorant to the super power carefully planning its next moves.

I've taken Algebra 1, Geo, Algebra 2, and currently Statistics and probability, I would've taken Pre Calc but I've passed Algebra 2 with a C, so... yeah. I plan on going to CC, cus its cheaper, taking computer science for 2 years for an associates, because unfortunately they only offer associates for the computer science field for the CC im going to, but also another 2 yrs for software development, after that I would transfer to a Cal State or some sort to finally get my bachelors or masters. all in the while, I hope to get an internship or some sort of a part time IT job. sounds awesome on plan, but life is life, and I feel like my math is really gonna hold me back. so, I guess my question is, is computer science/software development really a good field for someone who lacks in math? I've heard its pretty hard, I mean someone who's passed Algebra 2 with a C going to Calculus, Trig, and apperantly physics, according to my CC website, it all sounds overwhelming and terrifying quite honestly. I have this plan set up, but if I fail, I really don't have a backup besides joining the military, or video game development with their cut throat industry. anyways, I guess this was more of a rant, or something to get off my chest, but advice would greatly be appreciated too. thanks in advance

tldr: I suck at math, is computer science/software development really a good field for someone who sucks at math?"

When I struggled with the thermodynamics and stuffs, I thought it was meaningless(at least for me)
and wanted to challenge other fields, to the World. 

Programming was one of that and luckly I enjoyed studying it. So I decided to become a software engineer and now studying python and web developments on Udemy online bootcamps. And planning to take algorithm and data structure courses as well.  

However, as a new grad with no degree related to the C.S field, I think maybe I gonna land a job at small companies, or start-ups. (Which means they won’t give me enough salaries and circumstances in S.Korea)

So, I want to move to the U.S. With about a year of experience in web developer(maybe frontend,,idk in the current situation) 

I want to ask you if this plan is reasonable..or any recommendation to start a career in the U.S.? 

Thanks for reading!! :)

P.S) 
I have two years left to graduate and since I want to graduate in 4 years, I am not thinking of taking a minor or dual degree in Computer science.(maybe I could achieve minor degree, but not dual)

+Status does not matters for me because I am us citizen  

+I was an undergraduate researcher and anticipate having internships at Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology(KRICT) this summer 
sadly not in the c.s field."

lrev8u,2,2021-02-24,Just had my first interview in months!,LittleSunflower666,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lrev8u/just_had_my_first_interview_in_months/,"Uhhhh I am so nervous right now. I just got off a Zoom interview for a really good Social Media Content role that’s super local to me.

I haven’t had a single interview in about 6 months and I’ve been out of work since Nov 2019 when I quit my last toxic job and decided to move from Surrey to London to have a better chance at getting a good Graphic Design job.

I moved to London in Feb 2020 and had 7 interviews in 3 weeks and then the country started getting squirmy about Covid, then a week later we were in lockdown.

I know I’m not the only one struggling to find a job, don’t get me wrong! But I never thought, with a 1st Class Degree and a bunch of internships and one grad job, I’d have this much trouble getting a job, even in a pandemic! I’ve also been rejected from every Reception, Admin and Customer Service role through the whole lockdown despite having extensive experience in those roles too.

I have been on £342/pm job seekers allowance since April 2020 which barely covers my basic outgoings (I live with a grandparent right now so I don’t HAVE to pay rent but I WANT to, I’m just never left with enough money to do so) so I’ve applied for anything and everything and got nothing.

I had my CVs, cover letters and portfolio checked over by people, I did the govt Employability Plus course that teaches you how to apply for govt jobs but also any other jobs. I got nothing. 

I did everything right and I feel like it was never enough. Everyone around me were getting jobs when they didn’t have one but I wasn’t and I still can’t understand why. I do believe in ‘fate’ to an extent but I also believe you make/influence your own ‘fate’ - I worked incredibly hard to try and get a job for over a year now and I just want to know when it’s my turn for some good fortune!

ANYWAY! I just had my interview and I feel like it went okay but I’m still shaking with nerves. They gave me a task yesterday morning and gave me 24 hours to do it, due this morning. I used 22 of those 24 hours to do the task. I haven’t slept and stayed up all night making sure it was awesome! I prepared really well, made notes about why I did certain things in the task and they seemed impressed with my reasonings, I prepared some good questions, including how they dealt with Covid to help me understand what kind of people they were and their response was very positive, I showed great enthusiasm toward the role because I am generally really interested, I smiled a lot and made a couple of well received jokes, they were friendly and personable and generally I just really liked them and want to get this job so badly.

I know I’ve done all I can do to get this job but after so much rejection, I’m so scared I’m not going to get this role like I didn’t get all the others and be back to square one all over again.

I just needed to vent and everyone around me is sick of listening to me worry about jobs and not getting any replies etc...

(I really hope none of them see this post! I don’t want them thinking I’m an anxious mess!)"
lrfo6m,14,2021-02-24,Discouraged after a few failed internship Hackerrank exams,Lieutenant_Left_Boob,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lrfo6m/discouraged_after_a_few_failed_internship/,"Hi all!
I was a social worker a few years ago and started a BS CS program last year as my second degree.  I’ve been doing very well in my coursework, finishing up a decently sized Java project, have some good personal projects in different languages up on my GitHub, and currently work in IT.  So I thought maybe I’d be ready to start applying to internships.  I can do some easy leetcode / Hackerrank problems but they take me quite a bit of time.  I think this may be due to having some extreme attention deficit problems.  But that’s another can of worms.
I feel like I’m able to break down the problems well mathematically but really struggle to translate that to code.  Does that mean I really need a lot more hands on experience with languages?  

I feel very defeated because as a young and very poor woman, I got invited to three different Hackerrank type tests (GM, Atlassian, Twilio) for internship positions this summer and didn’t complete more than one question for any of them.  For ALL of them, when I kept working on the questions after the test timer for my own sake, I was able to come up with a solution.  Is this common?  Should I just chalk these failures up to interview practice and keep doing 1-2 Hackerranks a day to build the skill?  I feel like I gave up some good opportunity at a better life just because I’m not as intelligent as I should be for this field.  If I got these callbacks this year will I still get them next fall if I apply to internships again?  Is anyone else just bad at Hackerrank style questions?  Is it an indication that I made the wrong career choice?  Doing projects and coding excites me SO much so I’m really sad thinking about a reality where it’s just a hobby again."
lrg5as,28,2021-02-24,Graduated Int'l student's gobble,umikawaphoenix,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/lrg5as/graduated_intl_students_gobble/,"Hi, if you are confused about college life as an Int'l student, future, depression, or even just curious for a story, this post may help you somehow, I guess. Freshmen and Sophomore years were mainly getting good grades for me, so I didn't have too much problem. No advice or story here.
Junior and Senior years were more difficult and I had several things that I regret. Here is the story:
Spring semester of Junior year, many bad news happened in my country, planting the seed of depression. Seeing other students getting internship and research also gave me anxiety because I was too hesitant to socialize with others. Firstly I tried to push myself, but later depression kicks in and I was only able to do what I am good at since elementary: getting A's. Aaaand of course, I didn't apply for grad school, because I was too hesitant to ask a professor for recommendation. At the time when I went back to my country, I thought I will never have kids and die alone, having no job.
So I went back to my country for a rest (also treatment). Firstly I was very unconfident and gloomy, and for my first job I always asked, ""am I able to?"" and regreting myself for not pushing harder. I spent r months living like this, and at the end of the year I returned, Covid19 happened.
During the quarantine I took a deep look at myself and I learned to accept my life: My family spent almost all of the money to get me to a US college, and cannot support me anymore unless a full TA or RA. Covid also doesn't allow me to go back to US, so I may have to work for decades to earn the amount of my tuition. Also no Google, ugh.
But I accepted these (although still mildly infuriated) and decided to start a new life. I started looking for better jobs (thank my ex for helping me greatly) like government, public schools, army technician, and since I am always tood at getting A's, I got a job as an IT high school teacher, teaching Python.
Now I make like 400$/mo, significantly below my potential. But my mental health is definitely better now. I am mostly positive and willing to study more about how to educate better. Interestingly, I majored MA and PHYS, but end up teaching Python which I only studied in CS177. Also I think I will marry someone and have like 3 kids, no matter how hard it will be.
Now you may ask, ""what's your advice to me?"" Well, I can't really list them, but I am truly proud that I had regular appointments with PUSH for counseling. I should have made more appts with my advisor too. Also I am very proud that I didn't commit sxxcide. Mainly because of my culture, which taught me to live not only for myself. I also advice you to get more friends. At Purdue I intentionally not to make friends from my country, which is very wrong, I ended up having no friends. Don't try it unless you have enough American friends.
Memorizing the past always bring me tears. I am a man and taught not to cry, but I am crying inside. Sorry for writing too much. Also I didn't proofread, so don't mind many grammar mistakes."
lrhetx,18,2021-02-24,Working vs. Masters Degree,pikeputt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lrhetx/working_vs_masters_degree/,"Hello all, not sure if this is the right sub (looked for a college version but could not find it). I am having trouble deciding what will be best for me. I am graduating soon and cannot decide whether to get a masters or just start working.

For reference, I am a CS bachelor's student at a decent school in the US. I have an internship under my belt and even though my degree is relatively theory based, I have learned enough outside of class to get ready for the field (Python, MERN stack, some C# development). However, I want to have something more, and have always felt I would like having a Masters degree. My school offers three that are relevant to me:

* Computer Science
* Cybersecurity
* Data Science

My problem is deciding. I am not sure what would be best for me in the field, as I definitely want to start my career as a software engineer, and maybe transition into something else depending on how that goes. I have been told by various people that either non-CS masters will be beneficial, and I have interest in both Cybersecurity and Data Science (ML specifically), but none really stands out to me. Cybersecurity seems like a learning curve coming from a CS background and Data Science seems a bit daunting (I have seen posts that you need a PhD to really get into Machine Learning and I do not want to get a further degree past the Masters).

My ultimate question: what path will help me most in my career, just start working after getting my B.S., or getting one of the Masters (any will only add a year onto my college career.

Thank you!"

I do love programming but am also interested in learning more about finance and want to experience working at a trading firm. The quant trading firm has better benefits for the internship.

The main advantage I see for working at Amazon is that it is more well known, might make it easier to work at other FAANG/similar companies in the future. I have heard that amazon experience can be very team dependent.

Today's (special) highlight will be featuring the Southern Rhode Island Institute of the Arts (SRIIOTA) in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, as requested by u/finding_snoo. Here's an overview of arguably the best and richest art school in the world:

* SRIIOTA takes ""art school"" to a whole different level from any of its peers in that it highly emphasizes funding and education in the visual, theater, and musical arts! It offers more than 16 different majors as either a B.A, B.F.A, or B.Arch, most of which are also offered as minors! It also offers a liberal arts core curriculum to help artists critically analyze the world and carve their niche successfully in the most competitive fields in the world.
* With a current undergraduate population of 168 and a graduate population of 12 (all full-time), classes are completely personalized (5:1 student-faculty ratio with an average of 10 students per class) by professors with the highest degrees in their fields with zero teaching assistants.
* The art school has a dedicated conservatory for talented students admitted as prospective musicians, although non-majors are welcome to try out non-advanced classes and clubs for music.
* You can also cross-register for courses to fulfill your liberal arts core curriculum during your sophomore or junior year for nearby colleges and art schools as part of the Rhode Island Curriculum Exchange Program, namely the University of Rhode Island, Providence College, Bryant University, Rhode Island School of Design, and Brown University!
* The institution meets 100% of demonstrated need of all students for all 4 years with no loans in any of the financial aid packages! For those whose total family incomes amount to $75,000 or less, all direct costs will be covered! For those whose incomes are greater than $75,000 but less than $110,000, the tuition cost will be sliced by a quarter. For all Rhode Island residents who make more than $75,000, tuition will be sliced in half. Unfortunately, it is implied to be need-aware and doesn't offer merit scholarships or talent scholarships, but it is the only art school that will ever cover your full financial need, as, according to the college's president, ""nobody should be burdened with debt or heavy expenses to pursue their passions.""
* In junior year, students are given the option to participate in accelerated master's programs at the University of Rhode Island, namely [one of six Masters of Arts programs](https://web.uri.edu/catalog/graduate-degree-programs/) or, if you're a music major who satisfies all requirements at the institute so far, a [Masters in Music](https://web.uri.edu/music/).
* The art school has a dedicated student body that regularly approves of student-run organizations or events plus maintains its Honor Code that every entering student has signed. Namely, the students promise to be respectful of their peers and avoid plagiarism in their dreams of changing the world with one original art piece at a time. In return, the college has a policy called the Southern Rhode Island Commitment that gives $5,500 in stipends to each student to cover for research, internships, and/or study abroad opportunities; 4-year passes for the RISD Museum, National Museum of American Illustration, Newport Art Museum, and Rhode Island Museum of Science and Art; and a guarantee that all undergraduates will graduate in 4 years or else an extra year will be provided tuition-free.
* The institute of the arts recognizes that first-generation and/or low-income students may not have had as much academic preparation for a series of rigorous courses, so the college offers a First Generation - Low Income Artists program so that each student is assigned to a mentor, who is a professor of the school, to help them along the way. \~90% of first-generation students stay for the second year, and \~80% total graduate after 4 years.
* The school also has an art center, a writing center, and a wellness + health center for students to practice their skills and refresh their mental health.
* SRIIOTA has national prestige unparalleled to many others in that the average total debt is $12,867 (due to some students wishing to take out a bit of loans to pay for later), 86% of students graduate after 4 years on average, and 94% of all students of the class of 2019 report successful outcomes a year after graduation (42% of who went on to graduate school and/or professional school). It is also a regular Fulbright scholars producer and has made 7 Rhodes Scholars.

I hope that you were able to learn about why SRIIOTA has been rising to high prestige over the past decade! Good luck to everyone in the college admissions process if you're in the process of such, especially those applying to the art institute for ED2 or RD (the former's decisions should release today)!"

lrjy7p,3,2021-02-24,What else should I be working on?,parkertinsley,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lrjy7p/what_else_should_i_be_working_on/,"I am a recent college grad. I realized I wanted to work in the software field and not what I studied in college (human microbiology). I spent some time last year learning a little bit about coding through Udemy. I spent a long time considering bootcamps but ultimately settled on taking some post bacc classes to try to get into an MSCS program in my city (Denver, CO). 

I am now taking a few classes and should be done with my post bacc in a year, and then hopefully enroll in the MSCS program. I found out that the difference between taking Udemy courses and taking actual college courses is that PROGRESS IS MUCH SLOWER. I am finding that I have a lot of free time outside of class and want to know, how should I be spending it? Should I look for some sort of internship? Should I continue working through online courses? Are there any other resources I should be investing time into? 

My eventual goal is simply to work in any facet of computer science where I can make a good salary, and work remotely.

Thanks in advance to all who respond!"
lrly1n,0,2021-02-24,I don't know what to do in terms of my education... Any help?,SolidShock24,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/lrly1n/i_dont_know_what_to_do_in_terms_of_my_education/,"Hello, dear Redditors and programmers.  
As you'll soon see, I'm in a bit of a tough situation right now, at least in my opinion and since I'm in ""that"" part of life, I'm confused and instead of talking to actual experts I've opted to ask you all, so we'll see how this goes.  


Honestly, the main issue is, I don't know what to do nor' what to learn.  


After finishing 9th grade (in Latvia, my home country), I opted to go to a school which teaches me grades 10,11,12 and programming on top of that. I'm supposed to come out of it with a ""Programming Technician"" degree. It's a total of 4 years, with years 2, 3, and 4 having a 2, 1, and 6 month internship time respectively.  


**Year 1:**  
Was pretty exciting for me. First time outside of my home, had to live in a dorm, was super hyped to learn something. My main aim for programming was the dream of making programs of my own, mostly games, but I did have a few other ideas. Till now, I had only dabbed with a tiny bit of C++ (stuff like writing ""Hello, World!"" to the console) as well as writing a tiny bit of LUA for a Garry's Mod HUD. That's honestly it.  
I'm going to only talk about the programming-related subjects since I did have my normal math and English, as well as some networking stuff.  
In the programming lessons or ""Algorithm"" class as it was called, we had a teacher pretty much go through the normal semi-basics of programming in Pascal. At the time I only knew 2 things. 1: Pascal is old as heck and barely anyone uses it and 2: he didn't teach us the ""full"" basics of a language. We only did some loops and wrote to the screen and got the users input. We never made a function or anything like that.  


**Year 2:**  
The year started with a new programming class, this one was quite weird. The teacher asked us whether or not we want to learn JavaScript or C#. We voted for C#, he taught us literally 2 or 3 lessons about classes and that's it, literally, THAT'S IT! Then we moved on to some basic HTML, basic JS and a little bit of PHP near the end of the year.  
Around mid-term I, myself, got a Udemy course on Unreal Engine for C++ beginners course in video game creation. I did like 80% of it in the next 2 or 3 months, but then stagnated the last 20% and did that only a few months ago.  
I also had the opportunity to go on an internship, but there were no real places to go to, since I wanted something I could actually learn, possibly even related to videogames (low chance, since not a lot of videogame companies in Latvia). I ended up getting a place in a government building, won't go into detail, but pretty much the guy responsible for my internship didn't care much so I just spent my 1 month doing the UDemy course and then presented it at the end and got a pretty good grade. (Mostly because my talking and presenting skills are good.)  


**Year 3 (The current one):**  
Started off with our class getting split into two parts. We had two different programming teachers, but pretty much we got taught mostly the same stuff in PHP. The year was supposed to be about databases. So Teacher1 was a pretty decent one, he was a really good programmer, but a very bad teacher. Teacher2 was also a decent programmer but absolutely sucked at teaching.  
Teacher1's group was doing decently but just flopped around in PHP for half the year. Teacher2's group was struggling really badly to the point the like governing body over the teachers (Sadly do not know the name in English) stepped in and made the teacher start explaining stuff more in detail and slow down the tasks since the students couldn't keep up. From the information I've gathered, apparently, Teacher2 was a professor in a college for some time so that might be why he explained to us stuff in a way that he thought we understood, but we really didn't, since to remind you, we never really learned the basics of programming, just glanced over parts of them in Pascal, C#, JS and now PHP.  
In the first part of the year, we had 1 month of internship. I managed to get a place in Teacher1's company which deals with the traffic lights in the city. I ended up making a really crappy-looking website within a month and that's about it. Due to my presenting skills, obviously, I got a good grade.  
In the second part of the year Teacher1 no longer taught us programming but instead just some theory about security in programs and databases.  
The whole class was assigned to Teacher2, which again, sucked at explaining and got us all bad grades.  
During this time I'm slowly poking around in C++ learning basics from [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com) and made a very basic program today that calculates Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
I have also tried learning a bit more about memory and a tiny bit of hacking since I find that type of stuff very interesting.  
And now we're in the present.  


I honestly don't know whether or not to keep poking and barely understanding C++ or maybe get a C# Unity course and learn that?  
I'm very interested in game making, I also absolutely LOVE thinking of game design and how various game concepts could work and get players interested, etc. but I doubt I'd get a job with that anywhere here. I also had the idea of maybe try and model something in Blender or get a course on character model creation? I don't know.  
Currently, I'm super scared I'll finish my 4 year-long programming technician degree and not know anything. I won't be able to get a job or anything. I'm lost..."
lrlzuk,6,2021-02-24,Tuition Reimbursement,goPSUshaun3,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/lrlzuk/tuition_reimbursement/,"Hello fellow OSU CS students! 

I am starting this Spring and need some advice on whether to agree to tuition reimbursement with my current employer. 

For context, I currently work as a process automation engineer and configure control system software for biopharm clients. I am looking to pivot into software development. My company has a small and growing (slowly) software development group that develops applications and add-ons that support the process control software that my company sells and configures. My company seems open to supporting my transition into the software development group as I move through this program and they will offer 75% tuition reimbursement as well as 100% reimbursement for books. The downside is that I would need to stay with my company for 2 years after each completed payment; otherwise, I owe them the tuition. 

Is it worth it to agree to tuition reimbursement and the 4 year commitment (2 years to complete program + 2 years) given what I just described? I feel like internships elsewhere might give me better exposure to what is going on in the software development world and potentially allow me to work with bigger and better companies with more growth opportunities. If I do agree to the reimbursement and decide to leave, is it possible that another company would pay out a portion of my tuition upon hire?"
lrlzwi,5,2021-02-24,Work Experience,sealbhaighm,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/lrlzwi/work_experience/,"Hey all, I was wondering if anyone ever heard of any web development companies giving unpaid work experience? Similar to something you would do in transition year of LCVP. 

I know there's internships but I've been applying and interviewing but had no luck.

I have studied software development for 4 years, but I much prefer web stuff. I started a part time Springboard evening course in web development which I'm really enjoying but they don't offer work placement. 

I've just been let go from my job and have all the free time so I would love to spend this time building up my CV and a portfolio. I have a bunch of ideas for websites and apps that I plan on making over the next few months but I would love something official to put on a CV as I plan on moving to Australia next year and just feel like I need something on that very empty experience part of the page.

If anyone has any information that could help me I would love to hear it from you! Cheers"

My work ethic was quite bad in college and I think my lack of success afterward had to do with both my poor grades and my never having had an internship. By the end of that first summer looking for jobs I settled on working at a grocery store just to get by as I continued my search. But not long afterwards some really unfortunate stuff happened in my life that caused me to really cling to any kind of stability I had. Combining this with me feeling dejected about not even getting opportunities in CS I kind of made myself think I didn’t want anything to do with the field.

Now fast-forward to the present, working in a grocery store for almost 4 years has both made me a much harder worker as well as made me really appreciate how much I love to program. A few months ago I wrote a simple program just to keep track of stuff I do with my gf and that got me thinking maybe I actually want a programming job after all. 

So I’ve been working on some portfolio projects but I want to be honest with myself about whether those will be enough. So my question for all of you is: can the huge negative of 4 years since graduation with no programming experience be overcome with a few nice looking projects on my GitHub? Or do I need a bootcamp, and if so which ones do you recommend, or would that not even be good enough? Would one of those training into job placement companies be a good option?

I’m really just trying to get a job whatever way I can, the only thing that is off the table for me is relocation. I live in the Phoenix area btw. I would really appreciate any help here.

Tl;dr I got my bachelors 4 years ago but never used it - how in the world can I still get a programming job? Are bootcamps the answer?"

lrmzeq,4,2021-02-24,HELP !! I got yelled at by company for not showing up for a internship for which I hadn’t received an offer letter or any details.,My_head_,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/lrmzeq/help_i_got_yelled_at_by_company_for_not_showing/," I had applied to a company for an internship and received a positive reply. After discussing possible dates to be begin the work with,they told me they would send an offer letter soon.

I replied to them by mail saying that I had a few queries and questions regarding the job, sending it to the design head as well as the HR team.
I received no reply for a month and half nor did I get any offer letter.
The date of joining got closer yet they did not send me any details.
I assumed I wasn’t getting the offer.

After the date of joining surpassed, I got a call from the design head who yelled and belittled me for not turning up.
I was surprised and mentioned that I hadn’t received any reply nor an offer letter to which she said that I should have called her and bombarded her with texts and emails until she did.

She then said it was wrong of me to assume and what I did was unprofessional and wrong and asked me to send an email explaining my absence to her seniors which would save both our asses.
I assume she forgot about the internship and got a scolding from her seniors and decided to blame it on me. She also threatened to send a mail to my university complaining about my behaviour.
I am unable to understand how one can show up at an internship without the office address, timings or any offer from the companies side?
How is this my fault?
Im am extremely upset and worried and really wasn’t trying to do anything wrong.

I need help as to how to tackle this!!!!!!

During the interview there was a logic error caused by a bug in a for loop. I had 30 mins left to debug on my own and I ask interviewer if I can walk through debugging with him (rubber ducky it with him)  or would I be penalized for doing so. He said its fine and it shouldn't matter once I complete the question and pass the tests. 

Anyways we quickly find the bug - a variable needed to be reassigned before the for loop instead of inside of it - and fix . Now I have fully working optimal solution with slight help from interviewer to find a logic bug and I give the correct responses for Big O for my functions.

&amp;#x200B;

The karat interviewer goes on to write a review saying I needed his help to solve the solution and struggled to determine big O. In his review he left out that I found and implemented the optimal solution, or the great modularity of my code (i feel a bit pretentious saying this but that was the best interview ive ever done in terms of good coding practices). He made sure to add that I needed help fixing a bug but then went on to exaggerate and insinuate I couldn't do it without him. I Basically didnt get the internship because of that shit. **If i knew I would be penalized for talking through the bug with my interviewer I would have said nothing and just carpeted my code with print statements until i figured it out**. I just feel sad and depressed, it was a great opportunity and it got stolen because of a f\*\*\*\*\* lying interviewer. I remember the decision to even ask for his help I was debating whether it would be easier to just talk it through or just start adding prints to see why the value wasn't updating. I f\*\*\*\* hate myself for making the wrong choice.

Is there anything I can do? Or should I just accept that I got shafted and move on 😔

**Tldr**: Karat Interviewer lies to me and says walking through debugging with him will not be penalized at all.

I am almost halfway through my IT PM internship. It is going pretty well. I just had a meeting with my manager at Company A and they told me they are very happy with my process and work, and they want to extend my internship until the end of summer if I would like.

I am highly interested in this company A because they have a 2-year leadership program for new grads and once you complete 2-year rotations, you get placed on a good-paying management role.

I know extending my internship and not going to the development internship will increase my chances of making it to the leadership program with Company A.

Meanwhile, in case if I still don't make it through the leadership program (outsiders do 3 interviews, insiders go straight to final interview), I will have 2 IT PM internships under my belt but no development experience, which will hurt my chances of getting a developer job. 

My career goal is to become a sales engineer/solutions engineer/solutions architect or any role of the same nature which would include travels.

I believe going the leadership route increases my chances of getting the role of my dreams, but if it does not work and I have to seek a development role, I am worried to be in the market with no development internship. I also don't have many projects etc and not the best coder.

Question: do you know companies that accept people without a formal ML background, in particular PhD in physics?

My strong points: I am quite good at research (in my field).

My weak points: coding interview. Tried a few medium/hard hacker rank, and it seems it will take a few months to be good at it (with 90 min of coding per day). Do you know any GOOD company that do not require these coding interviews? I feel they are not necessary for research, although if someone has a different opinion happy to hear.

Then corona hit. I was pressured to stay at my company by my family and friends, and even society. I was supposedly the lucky one that didn't lose their job and could work remote. Since I was a full time employee at my company now, I was forced into the work culture of doing extra overtime. I was one of the few programmers on a very special project and had to pull many many months of 12 hour work shifts. I was so exhausted from work that I had no motivation nor the mental capacity to work on leetcode. My problem solving skills got rustier and rustier.

I finally finished, only to find it difficult to get any junior positions, due to working/commercial experience. So I spent about 2 years coding on my own until I found a job doing mobile development in Java, nothing I wanted longterm, just something to have on my CV.

The company is currently out of work with their clients or clients not paying (my employer still pays me even if the client doesn't). One of the main projects I worked on for them has gone overtime since their dev/deployment practices were non existent (no version control, no testing, no documentation). I was hired to do mobile development, but ended up working on the web app and getting them up to modern deployment standards.

The problem was that while I pushed a lot of new deployments and code, nothing was fast enough for his budget. He tried to push 1-2 week deployments (building API from scratch and mobile app) on a module I never worked with, very tight and nearly impossible to do competently, and eventually my hours went down to zero. But instead of being cut loose because they still needed the occasional fix, they would go silent until they needed me.

Now, I'm mainly doing small jobs (stuff that takes me 5-10 minutes to fix as a dev than 2+ hours their previous hires used to take), so while I'm technically still employed, I'm only working remotely on the off chance that something comes up, so I've been applying elsewhere and doing interviews or coding projects on my own. At this point, I have 1.5 years of commercial experience isn't a lie, even though half of that time I was working casual hours, anywhere from 0 to 20 hours depending on the week.

Most applications go silent or get rejected. Other times everyone seems to want more working experience, but are curious that my resume and Github is full of projects. So while I get an interview, I might not hear back for a specific job.

I applied for a job at a company hiring junior devs, which seems to be a rarity these days and jumped on the opportunity to interview.

My last interview was pretty fast-paced and took quite a few hours going through the interviews and coding challenge, etc.. I had the final interview with one of the company VPs, and she was very receptive to my questions and said that the feedback so far was really good. But in the end I got a phone call telling me they chose someone with more experience, but that I will remain in the pool for future positions if they come up later in the year. I'm gutted, I've waited nearly a decade to get my foot in the door at a tech company for full time employment, this was my closest shot in years.

Is there any way to get out of having too little experience, while I'm severely underemployed?"

I included a tldr at the bottom. Thanks again!

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

I am currently a Junior at a no name University, majoring in Computer Science with a 3.9 GPA. I have paid for my schooling strictly through the GI Bill from my enlistment in the military. This has left me with 0 student loans. I recently looked at my GI Bill benefits and have much more benefits left than previously expected. This has led me to consider an accelerated Masters program in either Computer Science or Data Science. It may be important to note that I believe an accelerated program is my only option considering how much GI Bill benefits I have left.

My primary motivation for continuing my education after my Bachelors is to essentially keep my options as open as possible for my future job opportunities. Currently, it feels like I'm in a ""you don't know what you don't know"" situation regarding future specialization. For example, I don't want to prevent myself from a job in machine learning or robotics later on. Unfortunately, University doesn't allow enough time to explore all different sects of the field. While I can save my remaining GI Bill for future use, I am confident that future me will have less time and likely less motivation to attend grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tradeoffs and Sacrifices:**

In my current living situation, my friend and I are roommates and split bills. If I go this route I am forced to either: move to a different location to attend University as mine doesn't offer an accelerated masters course, or complete the masters online. Either way, this will lead to needing to take out student loans to cover remaining living expenses, as either: I move to a new location and don't have a roommate, or take classes online and have a reduced income due to GI Bill stipulations regarding online school. The resulting loans would be approximately $10,000 to $15,000. 

   **Other potential sacrifices:**

I am unsure as to how accelerated masters programs work, but this route may mean I would   
graduate without an internship which could hurt my new grad job prospects.

&amp;#x200B;

1 year of my life which could be used getting job experience

&amp;#x200B;

Online Masters not as credible as in person school?

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Consideration:**

I am leaning towards Data Science, as I feel that it would provide me a significant amount more beneficial information compared to Computer Science if I will already have a Bachelors in Computer Science. Is this sound logic, or does a Masters level Computer Science course have more to offer than I am aware of?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Is a $10,000 - $15,000 masters degree in Computer Science or Data Science worth it after already having a Bachelor's in Computer Science?"
lrva0o,8,2021-02-24,How do you learn fast? Or get better at learning?,vyxoh,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/lrva0o/how_do_you_learn_fast_or_get_better_at_learning/,"So let me just start off by saying I’m a straight A student for about a year now. Got back into school after an appeal and been motivated to do my best ever since. However, I’m a slow learner I think? I want to learn how to “learn fast”. I’m curious on what others do or if I’m just stuck with this. I’m very detail oriented and read very slowly to make sure I get things and if I don’t I’ll stay on that question or page for over an hour. 

This comes with worry though. I need to do something outside of school/work to stand out. I’ve applied to a few internships and going to start to kick it up a notch over the next 2-3 months considering I’ll be going into my senior year next semester and it’s the best time for me to do so. All this in mind, school takes up a lot of my time. I’m talking hours. I work early morning shifts starting at 5 and get out between 1-2 get settled and start homework/studying by 3:30 and then I’ll probably be done by 8-9 sometimes later and I’ll try to fit the gym in there. And before I know it, I have to be in bed before I get sub 4 hours of sleep. My work schedule sucks honestly but it’s what I got for now. I think I’m good at managing my time? I try to at least plan intervals for things to do or any errands I have t run. So I’m not sure if that’s a problem. It could be but I just want to change things. I know I could do more but the hours I put into school seems weird and I could probably put less. 

How do you guys do it? Do extracurricular activities/clubs/other and what’s your strategy? 

I know COVID is around so being on campus would help but COVID did not slow our graduation dates so I feel like I’m running out of time and it’s lately been adding onto my stress/anxiety."

We really need someone with some more knowledge in (Insert Skill Here) that can hit the ground running.""

There is clearly a knowledge gap between what I learned in school and what I need to know in order to get a job.  Where can I go to fill that gap?  I'd like to get some more experience with RESTful APIs, Unit Testing, Spring, and Spring Boot but I am not sure what a good resource is.

However, I'm frustrated because my supervisor said verbatim my performance is fully in the next tier level, but I did not receive a promotion because I only have \~1 year FTE and T2 requires 2-5 years FTE. 

I met with the same supervisor late last year and was led to believe that I was on track to being promoted if I do X and Y and that my past internship would cover the YOE requirement. The explanation I received was since then he has attempted to promote someone in a similar situation but received pushback from corporate for not meeting the 2-5 FTE requirement. 

Is this experience typical in tech careers/careers in general/industries?  I don't want to appear ungrateful or naive, but I feel like its unfair to be told that I'm doing the job of a T2 but I'm going to be compensated and recognized as a T1, especially after I was told I was on track to be promoted.

Also, should I be pushing/negotiating with him on this? I feel like its pointless because the budgeting/corporate approval for this has all been done in advance.  

The job itself is not bad but nothing special either, and this is pretty big blow to my morale. Is my best option to resolve this in a way I will be satisfied to begin grinding leetcode and looking for new positions? go back to school for masters in cs/ece? stick it out? something else?

Even though my parents are really for it, I am kind of looking to avoid graduating so early because I have only spent one year in person at college so far because of covid. One way I could do this is by taking a gap quarter next year to do an internship, which would push a quarter to my fourth year. Then, I could also do an internship in the summer in between.

Does that seem like a good idea? or should I just graduate early and start working?

if it matters, I will be interning at a large tech company in this upcoming summer.

As an aside, I'm not quit sure what the position entails, because I applied through my uni's job search site and the employer left no description other than the majors they were interested in. Going directly to their website didn't help much, because they dabble in everything from UAS to virtual reality.

So from what I could find out, it seems that if I wanted to change my major altogether, I would have to make an appeal which would effectively withdraw my acceptance while they consider me again (i do not want to risk my seat as a math major)

But this does not seem to be the case for adding a major or minor. (which I want to do by changing from maths to Maths+ CS)

Apart from my existing qualifications which secured me a seat as a Maths major, I've been learning few languages like Python (got certified in a specialization) and flutter (I'm doing the London app brewery course) and I am currently working in an internship that would offer certification as a front end app developer) 

This all happened after I had submitted my application and I believe this could help me change from maths to Maths + CS. 

So my first question is how hard would this be? 

Second, it seems that while getting into CS on its own is VERY hard, but to get in CS+ X is a tad easier.

So what would you recommend to a student who wishes to pursue robotics, AI, or theoretical CS who plans on going into research. (also I personally would like to end up in a field related to Education or Prosthetics- so according to that could someone please advise.)

Any advice or context as to what I should do is greatly appreciated, thank you"
ls1lvq,575,2021-02-25,Story Time - My Experience as an MBA Intern at Amazon,Western-Jackfruit-19,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/ls1lvq/story_time_my_experience_as_an_mba_intern_at/,"*TL;DR - was lied to by Amazon, cheated of money, targeted at work - crushed mental health and set me back financially with loans.*

====

I know folks on this sub must be evaluating offers right now, so I wanted to talk about my experience interning at Amazon as a Sr. PM during the pandemic and how I was cheated of money I had been promised and my mental health was wrecked.

I’m a student at an M7. This past summer, I had numerous offers from tech giants - including multiple FAANG companies. Most of these offers were based in the Bay Area and Seattle, except Amazon which was in Europe. Naturally, Amazon’s offer in Europe earned me less than half of what I would make working in the Bay Area at the other firms. However, I decided to do it to gain a new experience and also because I was promised by the recruiter that the internship salary in Luxembourg (where the role was based) was tax-free. I did the math. I was leaving money on the table, but felt it was worth the risk to be able to build a career at Amazon which was a firm I admired. So I signed the offer and turned down the other offers.

Then the pandemic hit. A couple of weeks in, I spoke with Amazon’s recruiter who informed me that they had decided to move all internships virtual for the year. She specifically then went on to say that I would be paid the local salary for the role in my location. Since I was in the US, I would be paid what Amazon interns in the US earn. This made sense to me, since I would incur the local costs and taxes of the US, and not of Europe anymore. She told me that the formal letter would come in with the new offer before my start date, since there was a lot of admin work they had to do. That made sense to me.

Then 10 days before the start date, I received the offer. Lo and behold, they had just converted the original offer from Euros to USD. This amount would mean that after tax and my living expenses in the US, I was saving next to nothing. I basically had to work for free for Amazon. When I reached out and asked, they said that they had taken a decision to change the policy since the recruiter spoke to me. But she had failed to inform me of the change.

They had clearly timed it deliberately - when I asked about revising my offer to US pay, they said I could take the offer or leave it, knowing I would have no choice. I also asked my school’s career center but they said the same thing (they also won’t mess with Amazon, since it’s amongst the largest recruiters on campus). I had no choice but to start work, since I was stuck in the US during lockdown and couldn’t travel to anywhere cheaper, and I needed to earn this money to pay my rent.

Therefore, I started work but continued to ask the HR team about my salary and whom I could speak with. The entire HR org vehemently denied that the original conversation with the recruiter had even taken place. I continued to question them. This clearly pissed them off. There was a culture of sending weekly surveys to interns (which were compulsory and non-anonymous). Yes, you read that right. So whenever I rated anything low or did not fill up a survey, I would get a message from someone at the company coaxing me to revise my feedback. I was specifically being targeted for asking questions of HR. I was also assigned a mentor who did not speak to me for weeks, and then she replied to me one week before my end date and said she’d been busy and to ask here if I had questions (because she knew I had to fill feedback about her in my exit survey).

I got absolutely no support considering I was working remotely from a different timezone, and was forced to wake up early in the morning or stay up late through the night to work with my team in Luxembourg from the US. It took all my motivation to not let it affect my work, knowing I was working this hard to earn less than half that my peers at school were earning working for Amazon and other companies in the US, while I had the same costs as them. For no fault of mine except to trust a big company to take care of its interns.

The kicker came when I came to the end of my internship. I prepared my 6-pager and felt I had done enough to get a full time offer. I was nervous about presenting my work to the panel and putting all of this behind me with a full-time return offer when I would be able to make up for it. When I got into my presentation meeting, the L7 director who was supposed to judge my work did not turn up. Someone called the director on the phone asking when he would come in, and the director said “Oh, I can’t make it. I’m out scuba diving.” Yep, exactly. So I went through my doc without him and surprise surprise, I wasn’t made a return offer. 

Since this experience, I have been mentally affected. It has hurt my self-respect. It has set me back financially and I would not wish this experience on my worst enemy. I am sharing this story hoping it will help some people on this sub. We’ve read a lot about Amazon’s culture, but I have experienced it firsthand. If you choose to go there, prepare to be harassed and have your career destroyed. I even wrote to Amazon's CHRO highlighting my experience and pleading for justice on the pay aspect - my emails never got a response from her. 

If you have any offer other than Amazon, please consider taking it. Nothing in the world is worth going to Amazon for. Or maybe it’ll work out well for you. Either way, I wish you luck and hope this helps.

EDIT: added a couple of details."

There was a activity we had to do the other day related to IT Consulting which I loved doing. I do plan on continuing my courses (up to Advanced Diploma) because that I can do cyber security consulting from that advanced diploma. If I want to do Cyber Forensics, I have to go to University but idk if I should go university to do that.

Does anyone here work in either career and tell me what it's like?

I'm from a mid-sized city in the South-Western area of Europe ( Balkans ). My family was one of the most famous families in the city ( my grand grand grandpa was Major of the city, grand grandpa Minister of economics and my grandpa huge head in Yugoslavia), so I can say that all my life I had everything to have a mediocre childhood and early teenage years, although I can say that I'm very modest. In my childhood we as a family ( my father and mother ) ware really poor, and living on my grandma pension. Everything changed when my father build his private construction company, and things started to be better ( like i remember the times around 7th grade when i got my first original Nike shoes ). Although financially things got really good in my family, the communication between my mother and father got really bad, in fact so bad that they would not speak for months. All this family drama had huge tool on me, making my personality not reachable at first, because i don't trust people easily. The family dramas continued when i was in highschool, even got to a point where they would start to be physical. To get from all the drama at home I used to Study a lot, and build little gadget electronics that would do stuff, which whom i got recognized from my Physics teacher that I'm good at this things. She enrolled me to this competition of electronics, and together with her i won the State championship 3 years in a row, registered a patent to my name, won a huge award in Turkey which opened huge opportunities for me. I got 7 scholarships from this huge university's all around the world. I wanted to go study in Chicago or in Cyprus, I had full 5 year scholarships over there. In the summer after high school ended, i had to decide what should a do and where to go, but at that time my father and mother got in this huge fight that was separated when my sister ( who is smaller ) called the police. Shortly after that they decided to divorced. The divorce part was going ruff, no body wanted to to think with their Cold Heads and i was in the middle of this things. Because all of this mess and no talk with my family about my future, I decided that firstly i need to get the things right with my family then thing about College. That summer I decided that I as a 18year old sacrificed not to peruse my dream of studying abroad but to get the things in my family right. After missing every single enrolment slot I had to go to an private University in the field of computer science. The first year was really thought on me as I had to balance private and University life ( the college was 150km from home ).Things got better when i was 3th year at college when my father and mother got separated completely, but they would continue to speak and gossip about things which again putted huge burden on my shoulders.

Before my actual point:

I was unhappy with the education that i got at the university and decided to start working. I got this huge internship in this factory where after a while i become worker in the it department ( the factory had over 6k employees) and worked over there for a year. Because i did not like the working schedule and the manager did not want to give me free days for my college exams i decided to go. After which i found a job in my town in a small it company as a first in line support. I liked the job over there but unfortunately the project ended so they laid me off. Then i went to this big city to work in an it firm as a it developer, but because of the CORONA VIRUS many clients dropped their projects and after a while they laid me off too.

After what has happened to me i decided to go in a foreign country and see how thing will go there. I went in this country in august and started looking for a job, took a language course and got used to the environment, but then the second wave of corona came and we ware closed home completely. I was sitting home practicing programming, learning the language until December when i decided to go back to my country until things get better and they open. While i was back my father was begging me to stay and work with him. At the beginning i liked that idea, but i wanted to see my options. In the end of January things got right and i went back and got a job really fast.

The Main point and where I need help:

So I stared this job in the ecommerce filed, as a programmer, but the boss is not a programmer and does not know how things work. I get a loot of anxiety because i don't know how to do some parts of the job, I dont have anyone to ask, I have to learn everything on my own. I dont thing my boss understands that.

All my life I feel I did not focus on my self and tried to resolve others problems. I feel completely lost now, for the first time in my life i can focus on my self. I don't even know if I like programming or if want to work in the it field, In the foreign country I will be all right no one will bother me with family stuff, but im starting from 0. At home i have this huge opportunity to take over my father business but that comes with the fact that i know noting about that, and i will always have burden on my shoulders with the family stuff. 

I feel like I miss home a lot, but in the other hand i feel like if i go there i will miss the peace that i have right now."

Strictly financially speaking, cs/engineering degree is what makes the bucks and what would help me move out of parents house and live decently and even comfortably and luxuriously, also without four to eight additional years of schooling with its cost of its own. 

But I think I would be unhappy as hell if I am solving tech and software issues for a company rather than being involved in something more directly involved in human life or of humanities subjects. 

In that case, a college degree in psychology or biology or political science or economics would be smarter right?

Hi everyone!

I’m an undergraduate senior graduating this year  in electrical engineering. I plan to start my path towards a masters degree a year after I graduate. I plan to work full time and study part time. My purpose for obtaining a masters degree is not directly tied to research purposes and is more so to expand career opportunities professionally.

In particular, I was interested in Stanford’s MSEE program. I would be doing it though HCP, which is the online version of this program but I believe the admission standards are the same. I would like to know my chances for this program and also any advice on how I could improve parts of my application if possible. I would like to apply this December or next December if possible so I hope that is sufficient time to improve.

Stats and related info:
- Domestic applicant in SoCal
- 3.6 GPA (not a top ranked school but well known for engineering)
- I have not taken the GRE yet
- 3 internships: 1 with Lockheed Martin and 2 with JPL
- 1 research project with the McNair Scholars Program, done completely on my own with one advisor (no published papers, presented at a small conference in my university)

I’m concerned that my GPA is lower than most applicants and wanted to know what I can do to demonstrate that I can handle the academic rigor of the program. Would it be wise to take a few courses on Stanford online and use possible successes in those courses as leverage before I apply?

Thank you!"

Hello! I am Junior and majoring in Chemical Engineering in S.Korea. 
When I struggled with the thermodynamics and stuffs, I thought it was meaningless(at least for me)
and wanted to challenge other fields, to the World. 

Programming was one of that and luckly I enjoyed studying it. So I decided to become a software engineer and now studying python and web developments on Udemy online bootcamps. And planning to take algorithm and data structure courses as well.  

However, as a new grad with no degree related to the C.S field, I think maybe I gonna land a job at small companies, or start-ups. (Which means they won’t give me enough salaries and circumstances in S.Korea)

So, I want to move to the U.S. With about a year of experience in web developer(maybe frontend,,idk in the current situation) 

I want to ask you if this plan is reasonable..or any recommendation to start a career in the U.S.? 

Thanks for reading!! :)

P.S) 
I have two years left to graduate and since I want to graduate in 4 years, I am not thinking of taking a minor or dual degree in Computer science.(maybe I could achieve minor degree, but not dual)

+Status does not matters for me because I am us citizen  

+I was an undergraduate researcher and anticipate having internships at Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology(KRICT) this summer 
sadly not in the c.s field."

The results can be found [here](https://strawpoll.com/27ek9u64p/r), but the summary is:

* a plurality of users (40%) would prefer no changes  
* 19% would prefer some limited restrictions  
* 17% would prefer megathreads

A number of users have voiced issues with megathreads, and I tend to agree in general. The easiest solution to accommodate the most users seems to be adding flair and enforcing a limited flair policy; that way users that don't want to see certain content can filter it out. I've added 3 types of flair that can be added to posts: Internship Question, Flex, and Company Question.

Company Question refers to questions relating to a specific company. Examples:

* [Waitlisted at Amazon](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lsbpu8/waitlisted_at_amazon/)  
* [ADP Global tech product intern comp](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lsbouu/adp_global_tech_product_intern_comp/)  
* [Amazon Result 2/18 to Present New Grad Full Time Position](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ls7f37/amazon_result_218_to_present_new_grad_full_time/)

Internship Question refers to more general questions. This includes interview questions, general internship process questions, or *x* vs *y* type posts. Examples:

* [What companies are known for hiring fall interns?](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lrz3dc/what_companies_are_known_for_hiring_fall_interns/)  
* [Amazon SDE or LinkedIn SWE Internship](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lrru4v/amazon_sde_or_linkedin_swe_internship/)  
* [How long to expect a response from pre-recorded interviews?](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lrnojb/how_long_to_expect_a_response_from_prerecorded/)

Flex posts are posts flexing your new internship or offer without asking for advice. This includes ""How I got an internship at *whereever*"" posts. I might add some festive CSS to these if I get some free time. Examples:

* [Finally got into my first college Internship!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lrtzpe/finally_got_into_my_first_college_internship/)  
* [I FINALLY GOT AN INTERSHIP &amp; ITS AT SPOTIFY 😭🥳‼️](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lqudsu/i_finally_got_an_intership_its_at_spotify/)  
* [How I went from no summer internship to Amazon in 6 months.](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kh1193/how_i_went_from_no_summer_internship_to_amazon_in/)

I'm also considering adding an ""Interview Question"" category, but we'll see how this goes for now. Starting tomorrow (2/26), any post that falls into this category without flair may be removed. To filter out posts with these tags that you don't want to see, check out [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/czx9so/filtering_by_flair_a_guide_for_desktop_old_and/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/3d6z1v/how_do_i_filter_out_tagflairs_not_sure_exact/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/5msefo/can_i_filter_out_tags/) for a couple different ways to do it.

lseq0p,0,2021-02-25,I am looking for advice regarding my career,KnightIKHN,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lseq0p/i_am_looking_for_advice_regarding_my_career/,"I am in a moment where I am not quite sure how to proceed, so I am looking for an advice. I will try and keep this as short as possible.

Two years ago, I have finished college, Computer Science, and I have been in and out of work since.

It started with an intern job for three months, while I was in the last semester; it didn't continue afterwards. 

After a few months of searching for entry jobs, I got into another internship, which was mostly an online training, due to coronavirus; consisting of basic courses in programming, electronics, not job/task related courses. 

Afterwards, I was assigned at a job, in a new team, where I was expected to be a fully independent developer in two months; with only one task given and not updated trainings. As expected, I didn't do well enough for them, and told me I should quit because they don't have time to explain to me. I did not quit and I was given menial tasks once in a while, for the remaining four months of the contract. 

Therefore, I am looking for advice on how to proceed because it seems that the intern job I applied these days requires to be a student, and I don't want, yet again, to be a developer, be assigned tasks where I am not given explanations on how to proceed.

Note: the entry job field, in my area, is pretty limited. I have been searching for more intern positions, so I can learn how to do the job, not just theory.

I was thinking about enrolling in a Masters Degree, but I am not sure if I can do it, or if I will have problems again in finding work afterwards.

Mentally, it has been pretty rough lately, I have been under a lot of stress because of not managing to keep my jobs and still am, thinking if this is the path for me, or not."

If so, what kind of projects will best increase my chances of landing an SDE job or an internship?"
lsf7g1,1,2021-02-25,I have quit multiple jobs and unfortunately it looks bad on me despite circumstances,Tomgirl17,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lsf7g1/i_have_quit_multiple_jobs_and_unfortunately_it/,"So I have had multiple different jobs within a very short timeframe. I'm not quitting them because there hard or I can't handle them I just don't put up with being treated like crap. Others actual legit reasons as well. I know some will probably say ima problem employee or something and I can't do hard work which fair fine enough but at least read a bit further.   
TLDR AT THE BOTTOM  


My first job was braums they wanted to schedule me in the middle of the school day keep in mind I was in high school back then. I quit because they kept reducing my hours after I told them I couldn't do that schedule and I wasn't going to ride my bike that far,only to work for an hour. Worked here for 3 months in the summer  


Next job It was a weird internship with hvac I was suppose to learn under him.  
Half the time most of the day he was gone and didn't teach me anything. While his co workers tried to teach me they taught like this.  ""whats the name of this tool?"" ""I don't know I have never seen it before"" ""Well guess"" After about an hour of guessing They would finally tell me. needles to say that internship didn't work out.   
2 weeks during spring break  


Then I tried marco's pizza and the moment I got my drivers license they put me as a delivery driver.   
Keep in mind I'm a brand new driver as in just got my license this is important later.   
Honestly thought it was pretty good at first. Then later down the line It happened twice where I forgot an item which fair enough my fault on that BUT then they started berating me how I was the slowest driver.(One guy says hes afraid to speed in my neighborhood because theres a cop) Just to put into perspective slow driving times. Also even if they didn't speed Im sure I would be the slowest driver because hey I literally just got my license and don't know the roads yet even with gps Im bound to make  a lot of wrong turns at first. Then there was a whole ordeal with not giving me my paycheck but thats for another post and may be posted on another sub about how my gamer buddies are bros.   
Worked there for 2 months (This place from the franchise turnover rates were so high it shut down.)  


I went to doubletree  hotel after that and again fine at first great co workers until one incident where he peaked on me on while I'm in the bathroom ""suspecting me of being on my phone"" Which even if true which it was because I was constipated still not right. Company wouldn't do anything about it.  
Not to mention the manager started blamed me for issues I wasn't even there that day for and started scheduling me for banquets. My normal shift was wake up at 4am get there at 5 am-done when I say your done. Then schedules me for banquets that last until about 1 or 2 am and I have to wake up at 4 am to get to work and wouldn't give me the day off after the banquet. Naturally I quit here eventually because I was fed up.  Then the cook threatened to fire me over the seran wrap getting stuck and not fixing it when have the time its hard to notice its stuck until you try to use it again. This was the only a job I quit without giving a two week notice. Everything else I gave a two weeks notice but they ultimately ended up saying you can't quit I fire you in the most in direct way.  


Ok next job I worked at the casino which wasn't anyone's fault just a series of bad luck. My car kept having issues and It was to far to ride my bike. Then final straw where I lost all my points, my dog got out and I had to search for her and Honestly I care about my dog more then my job. Either way worked here for 3-5 months and was put on frontlines taking temperatures of people as this was during start of the pandemic after things opened up again. I was suppose to be valet.   


Then I worked at alltran education which was the one place I absolutely love everyone there and would love to go back. The only issue I had to rely on commission to make any money and unless you become a manager you don't get a raise. becoming a manager puts you on salary but lets be honest Thats not gonna happen to me anytime soon I Didn't want to rely on luck to make more money.   
IM now at a place called alorica/ally bank customer service. Which Im taking a lot more crap then I let the others do because its still the highest paying job I have ever had at 13.50 an hour as inbound customer service work from home. Lots of tech issues,keeps closing the support session on me not fixing the issue blaming me for it not working. Then someone while helping me decided to be extremely condescending to me while helping me. Literally there words:""So this is internet explorer right?"" In the most condescending tone you can manage. For context the alorica pcs are weird where you can only have one browser tab open at a time.  


So Why am i telling you all this? Well its to show that the job market is so heavily against base workers even when on the job. I know some people need money so they can't afford to quit until they have something else lined up but If you can afford it don't let them treat you like crap. Its not good for you're mental health  


Tl:dr Bad luck when it comes to the workforce me pretty much punished because People will see a list of jobs and think im not a hard worker."
lsg0yl,2,2021-02-25,Can’t tell if it’s Covid or my worth after college.,clenchrecpublic,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/lsg0yl/cant_tell_if_its_covid_or_my_worth_after_college/,"I graduated with a Bachelors of Materials Science and Engineering last May of 2020. I got lucky and accepted a job/part-time intern offer for a quality engineer position at a medium-size, contract manufacturing company in December of 2019. I figured that if I didn’t like the internship while I was finishing up my last semester, then I could just look for another job that better suits my interests.  At least I was getting paid a little bit while I was still in school. When Covid became prevalent and saw how difficult it was becoming for my friends to land jobs after graduating, I decided I would just stick to the quality engineer position. 

Over the summer, I decided I wanted to get my Master’s degree, and again, got lucky and ended up starting school in September part time, while still working at my full time job. 

Skip to now. I have been here long enough, over a year now, to realize that I don’t want to be a quality engineer for the rest of my life. The job is not very stimulating, in my opinion. The culture at the company is also not the best—I didn’t experience this at my two previous internships. My coworker, let’s call him Steven, is on this “path”to be manager and I feel like I’m still an intern, doing work as his assistant as opposed to having my own autonomy. I have already spoken to my manager about wanting more responsibility, but my other coworkers seem to be so used to Steven being there that they never bother to include me in anything. At this point, I feel like I’m begging just to fulfill my job description, and I don’t even like it. So, I thought maybe it would be good to look around for jobs and see what’s available, but the only entry-level jobs that seem to take any interest in me are just other quality engineer positions. Is this really all I’m worth after college or is it just how the job market is right now? I thought that there would be other types of engineering positions, but they all want PhD or 8 years of experience. I’m afraid that if I only have the quality engineer experience, even after my Master’s, I’ll still only get responses from quality engineer positions.

TLDR; I got stuck with a quality engineer job I don’t like because of Covid, but the only other jobs that take interest in me are quality engineer positions. Is this all I’m worth at this point?"
lsgbic,1,2021-02-25,Repost: 30 year old looking for career advice in software/electrical engineering.,M2D1M_HA_LC_SR,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/lsgbic/repost_30_year_old_looking_for_career_advice_in/,"This is post was originally deleted by me because I decided it needed revision/expansion in certain areas. Thanks in advance if you take the time to read it, and offer your thoughts/advice!

I've seen several people asking the question, ""is 30 too old to pursue a career in \_\_\_\_\_\_"", which I realize now isn't a very useful question for me to ask, since my concerns don’t lie entirely in age-related cognitive decline or field-related ageism. Age means very little without context, which is exactly the problem I'm facing. What employers are going to look at is the person, maybe not so much the number. But the number by itself also has normative expectations following it, so they both kind of go hand in hand.

I've had one job, at a Meijer as a retail associate from 2013-2015. I found retail to be unfulfilling so I decided to quit my job with the money I saved and go to college. I live an extremely frugal lifestyle, so I had almost ten thousand dollars saved up at the time of leaving. I attended community college from 2015-2017, maintaining good grades (4.0) in an electrical engineering transfer degree.

One semester away from completing my degree, I got into a car accident. Nobody was hurt, but two cars were totaled, and the rest of my money shortly after, was spent on reparations. I was court-ordered to attend mental health treatment at a local clinic and decided it was best to take a break from school. For the next 3 years, I focused on my psychology, which was an aspect of myself I chose to ignore, believing it to be trivial. This part of my life was difficult and unsettling.

I regret to say that for the first two years, I succumbed to it instead of overcoming it as I should have. Instead of continuing my education and looking for internships, I fell into a depressive state where I could've practically been considered bedridden. I lost interest in everything, and once-enjoyable activities became as stimulating as watching the second's hand shift positions on an analog clock. I slept a lot, and to be honest, even though it was over 3 years ago, the entire time in-between (except for the last year or so) feels like a total blur.

I still live with my parents. They allow me to continue to live here because I take care of my grandmother, who lives next door to us. They value my presence for this reason, though I do wish to become independent, simply to have my own space and pursue my interests without distraction. However, having a big house, a nice car, fancy clothing, etc. is (and always has been), for one reason or another, completely uninteresting to me. For that reason, my pursuit of an engineering degree had very little to do with money. And, despite the prejudices often associated with 30+-year-olds living with their parents, I am not lazy and I do not lack ambition.

I've done small projects here and there, I have experience with soldering and fixing electronics, and I've recently read a few books on the C programming language (K.N. King, K&amp;R, and one other focusing on pointers and memory management). Using that knowledge, I've built several programs and decided to purchase an Arduino. I’m starting to enjoy it and developing an interest in microcontrollers and embedded systems. I feel like I'm learning fast, and have a great deal of time to spend learning these things. Above anything, I simply want a job that is fulfilling. It's what I care most about, and I want to spend my time doing something I enjoy.

I am now back in community college, after receiving a call from them offering to pay the tuition to complete my degree. Now that I've expanded outwards and started learning about programming, I realize that my interests are more aligned with software engineering instead of purely electrical. So now for the question.

I will have an associate's degree soon and will continue studying in my free time (which is a lot of time). Given the context I provided, do you think I should continue down this path? If your answer is yes, what do you think, strategically, I should do next? If your answer is no, why not?"

She couldn’t tell me how the others reacted to his statements because she had to try really hard to hold her tears back because she felt targeted. I told her that he probably didn’t have anything personal against her, and he doesn’t even know her and her work ethic yet. She got really down because she doesn’t think she’ll be able to move up if that’s the mentality most higher-ups in the industry have. I was able to get her motivated and up again by just telling her to prove him wrong and try to bring new ideas to the company. But what’s up with older people just hating on younger people for? Did that guy just have a bad experience with an intern or a young recruit? Or does he envy them? He seems to forget that he was once young too."

So, I recently (like 2 weeks ago), started a job as a pharmacy technician trainee at a big chain store. Honestly, it’s a little more overwhelming than I expected it to be. I have to go through all of the mandatory modules, and learn how to operate their POS while learning about the Pharmacy data base as well. On top of that, I have to learn about all of the medications and protocols. And to keep my job, I have to pass the certification to become a licensed PT in about 8 or so weeks. And let’s not forget that it’s still retail. 

I feel like this could be manageable if I were only doing this but I’m a full time student as well. 

The job pays well at about $15/hr and I still live with my parents so I dont have any serious bills. And I know that if I pass the certification, then I’ll basically be guaranteed a job for the rest of my life. 

But this isn’t even close to the thing I want to do. I’m currently going to school for fine arts and I love what I do. It’s my junior year so most of my classes are starting to get more and more challenging and I find it really hard to focus since I’m not away at university since the pandemic. 

I asked my family for advice and they all just said I was lazy. That’s not the case AT all. I’ve worked since I was in High school and I recently had an unpaid internship that I worked my ASS off for. 

I don’t want to make a mistake and give a job that pays me the most I’ve ever made and comes with built in job security. 

Basically, what I’m asking is 1) is it worth it? 2) If I turn it down, am I making a mistake?"

I’m about to go into my senior year of college and I’ve realized that the major I’ve picked doesn’t lead to any jobs I care about- I thought it did, but it just doesn't and its my fault.  I took the non-teaching related variation of my degree because I thought I would want to get into museum work, but now that I see how competitive the field is and how much experience I have to get via internship and networking to even start- I know I can't make it.

I just don't have it in me.

I could change my major to something else, but there's nothing else that stands out except for Librarian sciences but I don't know if thats much better and I really don't want to have delay graduation and spend more money. I just want a field that won’t make me regret being alive- a field I can reliably find a job in whilst paying enough for me to survive and maybe even thrive a bit, y'know?

One solution I'm considering is changing my degree to the teaching variation- I considered being a teacher in the past and while it doesn't pay the best- it does pay and hopefully I can find a job somewhere doing it that I find bearable. The con to this is that my minor becomes pretty much obsolete and  I don't know how many of the credits I've accumulated will transfers over to this new major.

Any thoughts?  I could really use the help- I'm freaking out."
lsomaq,5,2021-02-25,Cisco Cybersecurity Department Technical Interview as a college sophomore,echanuda,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lsomaq/cisco_cybersecurity_department_technical/,"So I'm a sophomore in college majoring in CS. I would REALLY like this internship. It's remote for a few months, and pays fairly well while also being a nice learning experience. The behavioral interview went very well, and they called to follow up for a technical interview spanning two hours. The thing is, although I have experience programming, I don't think I am prepared *at all* for a technical interview. I don't know the best data structures to use, hell I don't even really know the best cases for most data structures in the first place. I don't know common algorithms, and I'm certainly not very capable of seeing my own at this level. I'm learning all of this right now, sure, but it's definitely nowhere near ready. I feel like this will be one of the few internship opportunities I get, as my GPA is rapidly declining, and will most likely dip below 3.0 after this semester based on how things are going...

I'm scared and have a feeling this interview is going to go poorly. During the behavioral interview, they asked me a brief question about how I would go about discerning a string with balanced parentheses, and I could barely answer that question. In fact, the only reason I even knew a bit about the answer was because I had submitted a coding assessment before for Cisco (I failed it) and looked up the answer afterwards. It was more or less the same problem. 

Any advice here?"
lsppj4,14,2021-02-25,"30 years old, interested in software or electrical engineering, unsure of what steps to take to get back on track. Wondering if I have botched my chances of entering the field. Do you have any advice to give me?",M2D1M_HA_LC_SR,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/lsppj4/30_years_old_interested_in_software_or_electrical/,"Thanks in advance if you take the time to read this post. I know it's long, and please feel free to offer your thoughts/advice, even if they're harsh or critical.

I've seen several people asking the question, ""is 30 too old to pursue a career in \_\_\_\_\_\_"", which I realize now isn't a very useful question for me to ask, since my concerns don’t lie entirely in age-related cognitive decline or field-related ageism. Age means very little without context, which is exactly the problem I'm facing. What employers are going to look at is the person, maybe not so much the number. But the number by itself also has normative expectations following it, so they both kind of go hand in hand.

I've had one job, at a Meijer as a retail associate from 2013-2015. I found retail to be unfulfilling so I decided to quit my job with the money I saved and go to college. I live an extremely frugal lifestyle, so I had almost ten thousand dollars saved up at the time of leaving. I attended community college from 2015-2017, maintaining good grades (4.0) in an electrical engineering transfer degree.

One semester away from completing my degree, I got into a car accident. Nobody was hurt, but two cars were totaled, and the rest of my money shortly after, was spent on reparations. I was court-ordered to attend mental health treatment at a local clinic and decided it was best to take a break from school. For the next 3 years, I focused on my psychology, which was an aspect of myself I chose to ignore, believing it to be trivial. This part of my life was difficult and unsettling.

I regret to say that for the first two years, I succumbed to it instead of overcoming it as I should have. Instead of continuing my education and looking for internships, I fell into a depressive state where I could've practically been considered bedridden. I lost interest in everything, and once-enjoyable activities became as stimulating as watching the second's hand shift positions on an analog clock. I slept a lot, and to be honest, even though it was over 3 years ago, the entire time in-between (except for the last year or so) feels like a total blur.

I still live with my parents. They allow me to continue to live here because I take care of my grandmother, who lives next door to us. They value my presence for this reason, though I do wish to become independent, simply to have my own space and pursue my interests without distraction. However, having a big house, a nice car, fancy clothing, etc. is (and always has been), for one reason or another, completely uninteresting to me. For that reason, my pursuit of an engineering degree had very little to do with money. And, despite the prejudices often associated with 30+-year-olds living with their parents, I am not lazy and I do not lack ambition.

I've done small projects here and there, I have experience with soldering and fixing electronics, and I've recently read a few books on the C programming language (K.N. King, K&amp;R, and one other focusing on pointers and memory management). Using that knowledge, I've built several programs and decided to purchase an Arduino. I’m starting to enjoy it and developing an interest in microcontrollers and embedded systems. I feel like I'm learning fast, and have a great deal of time to spend learning these things. Above anything, I simply want a job that is fulfilling. It's what I care most about, and I want to spend my time doing something I enjoy.

I am now back in community college, after receiving a call from them offering to pay the tuition to complete my degree. Now that I've expanded outwards and started learning about programming, I realize that my interests are more aligned with software engineering instead of purely electrical. So now for the question.

I will have an associate's degree soon and will continue studying in my free time (which is a lot of time). Given the context I provided, do you think I should continue down this path? If your answer is yes, what do you think, strategically, I should do next? If your answer is no, why not?"

So I’m currently a first year majoring in Business Technology Management with CO-OP (formerly called MIS) and I recently I have become more interested in the computer science field. I’m not interested in changing my major since I know that skills/experience is more important in the tech field regardless of the degree, besides my BTM degree is still tech/IT related, but I’m not sure if that will suffice. My goal is to land a Computer Science or Software Engineering CO-OP position Summer 2022 instead of working as an intern in a Business related position. I have learnt python recently and I’m not sure where to go from here, so here are my two questions:

1: Would my major have an impact or hurt my chances of landing a CS/SE internship?

2: What languages, skills, or courses should I learn or take to be able to land a CS/SE internship next summer?

As a result, I graduated without a job awaiting for me. This was a bit soul crushing considering that my classmates had some sort of job or internship experience completed. I knew that finding a job in my field without the proper experience would be a challenge. Around late 2019, I had found a job in sales. Even though I was making money, I felt embarrassed by the job; this wasn't why I went to school.

 To make matters worse, the pandemic happened and that tanked any opportunities to find a new job in my field.

In mid 2020, I was accepted into my dream school, one year after I graduated from University. I chose Cyber Security as my major. Since the pandemic changed many aspects of life, this included my health as I was very sickly and I even went to the hospital for corrective surgery. Since I put so much focus on my health, my grades suffered and I did horribly in school. 

Now, I have decided to take a leave of absence in order to find a new job to help put me through school. Since I'm a CS major, what type of hobbies should I pick up in the meantime? Any new technologies or language I should learn?"

I go to one of the largest universities, mid-low-tier school (accepts anybody with a heartbeat) but a good name in research and known for being ""NuMbEr 1 iN InNoVaTiOn!1!1!"" 

I'm going to be honest, sometimes it gets discouraging to see around 99% of quants having premiere education, with near perfect GPA's, exclusive connections, events, opportunities, blah blah blah. I don't have this beat-myself-up attitude and think I'm a loser, I know what I'm capable of (and it's great things), but sometimes, this feeling of overwhelming competition in the applicant pools and general discouragement hits.

And again, I know that if you get the interview the only thing that matters is your skill, but comparing curriculums, information, and other resources by other schools (who get straight up recruited from the big guys), it just seems like I'm so far behind, and comparing that with my lack of prestige, it just seems I have the worst of both worlds. 

Obviously I'm going to kick my ass and make sure that I get the most out of internships, research, high GPA, and math and programming education, but I would really love to hear success stories from nontarget schools (this includes going from nontarget undergrad to good/target masters). Reading this sub and wso, it seems like if you don't get into HYPSM, you're done for. Just some general encouragement, stories, tips and/or advice."

While I am fairly confident in my ability to answer interview type problems, my concern is that because of my lack of time in the SWE field proper, I’m lacking a lot of the industry know-how my peers would. For instance, while my CS degree has taught me the abstract principles of designing algorithms and optimizing code, it hasn’t taught me how to effectively use certain stacks or use specific architectures.

The company isn't a software company, and the software team started out with 4 of us when I joined. We had a lead, senior, junior and me. The lead was my direct mentor during my apprenticeship, but left 8 months before my apprenticeship ended, the senior took over some of the role, but didn't do much. He then left last March, which is when lockdown hit the UK and I was put on furlough. I was able to pass my apprenticeship while on furlough, the company then kept me on, which I'm grateful for because they made half the company redundant and kept our team on. It now consists of 3 people now. Me, the junior and a PLC programmer from another part of the company.

Due to the nature of this industry, I have dabble in a number of languages, technologies and learnt a lot about this industry, like C++ in Unreal, C# and WPF and a little bit of JavaScript.

My first project since coming off furlough has been a nightmare. They really just threw me into the deep end.

Overall I wouldn't say I'm strong in any programming language because I've dabbled for 2.5 years. I did do a web development bootcamp during lockdown. Consisted of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, a bit of React, etc. And I really enjoyed it, I'm trying to put some time into developing those skills on my own, but I'm also wondering, how easy is it for someone in my situation to move to a front end job?

I graduated in December and as for my experience, I did an internship a few years ago doing QA and data entry. The next summer I did helpdesk at the same company. Last summer I did an IT internship at a different company working with Power BI and setting up the data to be used (QA). Right now I am working at the same company I worked at last summer doing helpdesk work and they said they would give me a business analyst project this spring but I'm not 100% sure it's going to happen.

I graduated with a bachelors in IT and a minor in business administration back in December. As for my course work I have taken multiple business classes, an accounting class, a finance class, and I've learned SQL, semi-advanced Excel, and Tableau. I also took a systems analysis class that taught me a lot about business analyst work.

I am looking to do an entry level certification. The two I am looking at right now are the IIBA Entry Certificate in Business Analysis (ECBA) and the Associate Certified Analytics Professional (ACAP).

Does anyone know which one would be better for someone who is looking to be either a business, data, or systems analyst? Also do you know if these certifications would actually help someone like me who has very little experience?

Also if you know of any other that are good please let me know.

Also with my experience and coursework. Do you think I would be qualified for an entry level position as I am right now?"

I did well in certain upper div CS courses while in school (A in graduate deep learning, undergrad Upper div AI, cs research course, visualization course). Did okay in some others (B in undergrad upper div algo theory course, B in masters ML course). A lot of the issue was that I had to keep going back to warmer climate because my medical condition and east coast winter (the classes I did best were remote) and I missed a lot of class. I have the medical documentation to show this but was wondering what tips on how to explain and highlight the courses I performed reasonable on.

Hi All,

Thanks for helping me out! I really need some advice. Looking to either apply this year to pivot to tech product, or get more YOE and apply next year. Would love to be in NYC. 

**Background:**

Asian American Male, 25, first generation

**Work Experience:**

3 years at matriculation doing technical ERP work for middle-market at national accounting firm. Plus 1 year part-time internship I did with the same firm while still in school. 

One promo under my belt. Likely won’t have another by application. 

Should have good LORs. 

**Undergrad Stats:**

Top 20 undergrad. 3.74/4.00. Finance and computer science double major. 

**GMAT**
750 (48q/44v)

**Post MBA Goals:**

Want to switch to product at big tech or a product/strategy role at a startup. ERP is niche and I want to pivot to a role I can better mix technical knowledge with strategy. 

**MBA Targets:**

**Target: Haas, Tepper, Stern**

**Reach: CBS, MIT, Booth, Kellogg**

**ECs**
Founded a club in college. Focused on a arts.  Very successful and proud of this. Still going strong. 

Not much else. Looking to maybe add to this area. 

Questions:

1. Am I being realistic with my goal schools? What are my chances? 
2. Should I wait another year or should I just pull the trigger?

Thank you for the feedback!"
ltgdsz,8,2021-02-26,Tried to chase what I'm passionate. I gave up in a week and feel lost now.,AntiMage2,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ltgdsz/tried_to_chase_what_im_passionate_i_gave_up_in_a/,"Here's my story: on paper, I am someone who came back from failure/obstacles to a grade A successful student. It took me 7 years to finish my undergrad; the first 4 years, I failed 9 classes in total and was kicked out of my full-boat scholarship. I blamed my major (Economics) and my family ate that shit up. And let me transfer to another school.

A lot of my friends have graduated by then, and I saw the CS majors getting jobs. So I took CS. My family paid for the first semester then I got into another scholarship program (due to a 4.0 GPA). At this point, I've mastered how to get As in classes. I learnt how to cram. I made a lot of good friends, who help me with hard assignments. I'll give myself some credit: I did study. But I put everything I study in my short-term memory. I never practiced to hone my programming skills. I never went out of my way to learn industry standards. I graduated Magna Cum Laude. Big deal. I couldn't pass one coding interview for an internship or for a job.  I couldn't breathe because I was getting rejected too much.

So I applied to a Masters in Data Analytics. Guess what? Another scholarship that was too good to not accept. I never changed. The Masters classes are even easier now as everything was online. I still don't know how to code. I don't know to be an analyst. I've applied for 100+ summer internships. Nothing. Due to the pandemic, I have became a sort of a hikkikomori too. Days of doing nothing. Days that just disappear before my eyes. I keep thinking I'll start working hard one day. But I don't.

I though maybe it's just that I'm not passionate about coding/data. When I was young, it was my dream to become a doctor. I'm naturally good at biology; I still remember all the biology materials I learned in highschool. Maybe if I do something I'm passionate about, I'll be that disciplined hard-working person, I always wanted to be. I started learning for MCAT. But it's the same thing. I would hold up a book for an hour. Put it in my short-term memory, then forget. Same days of doing nothing, and studying 1-2 hours. I'm not naïve enough to know I'll never become a doctor this way. I gave up.

Now I'm lost. I don't think it has anything to do with passion. I just like doing nothing. I would rather work at McDonalds, come home, and do nothing. I love my mindlessness. I love my comfort zone. I buy a lottery ticket every month just to keep dreaming. I applied to pHD programs so that I don't have to get rejected again. My life is not sustainable you know. Someday, somebody is gonna be able to look through the facade and know how much of a fraud I am."

I will likely cross post this elsewhere but wanted to get some advice from those who left SWE/tech industry early in their careers (fingers crossed some of you still browse this sub!). 

A little bit about me—I'm currently a junior in college studying computer science, have completed one prior internship, and will be interning elsewhere this coming summer. As it relates to tech, I'm particularly interested in low latency/quant development and will be interning with an investment bank this summer working in these areas. Lately (\~9 months), I've begun to very seriously consider attending graduate school by way of a full-time MBA program or law school (have an interest in both these areas and have been weighing the pros/cons). My plan would be to work for a maximum of 2-3 years following graduation and then to enroll (could apply as early as next year if I do a deferred MBA program). My intention would be to work in investment banking proper or if incredibly lucky, private equity (for post-MBA). If I went to law school, my intention would be to work in ""Big Law"" (M&amp;A, capital markets, etc.). 

Questions for individuals that left tech to pursue a similar path (or different path for that matter): 

* Prior to graduating from undergrad, did you take any steps to build your resume/prepare for new anticipated industry?
* Did you have any trouble applying to grad school (i.e., explaining the exit from tech to MBA, JD, etc.)? 
* For MBA—when applying to MBA summer intern and/or full-time roles, did you encounter any difficulty with lack of prior experience? For instance, I've heard some companies (PE firms in particular) want individuals that come from a similar pre-MBA background. 

Any other comments would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time!"

I was and am still very grateful that they extended an offer to me but truthfully the main reason I accepted it was because I was scared that if I didn't accept I would not be able to get a job after college due to the pandemic, although it was not bad working there by any means and I would not mind working there after college I just feel like I would probably leave after a year or two because the salary is below average for a HCOL area. 

I applied to some places here and there since then because I thought it wouldn't hurt to apply and I ended up getting invited to interview with a company a lot closer to my hometown (which is a lot lower cost of living than the area is where the company I am going to work at is located) and I'm pretty sure that they would pay about the same which would be nice because the cost of living is so much lower. This company is a lot bigger as well and if I were to receive an offer from them I think I would be one of many new graduate hires which I would think I would like because there would be a chance there would be people there my age whereas at the company I accepted at everyone is much older and they are all experienced developers. Another thing is that I think I would like the technologies they use at this company a lot more and I think I would become a better software developer there because I mostly did bug-fixes/maintenance work at the 1st company and I'm not sure that would change if I worked there full-time. This is very morally conflicting but I think if I were to receive an offer from this company I would likely renege my return offer and accept an offer with them, but I would feel terrible because the first company is very small, I'm their only new hire, and it has been many months since I accepted so I think it would actually be considerably worse than say reneging an offer from a large corporation. 

I am also very concerned about the 1st company finding out I am interviewing after I accepted the offer and then pulling the offer leaving me with no job and I wouldn't be able to put the internship on my resume anymore because they would probably give me a bad reference. That would be the worst because my resume is pretty much that internship, degree with an avg. gpa, and then class projects. I am not sure how likely that is to happen if I choose to interview with this company but the idea of that scares me. Also if they asked me to if they could contact my past employers I would have no idea what I would say because if I said yes then they would contact them and then that scenario I described above would definitely happen but if I said no that would probably sound really weird. And if I told the truth that would probably piss the interviewing company off I imagine because they would probably prefer to interview someone who hasn't signed an offer letter. Because I would have no idea what to say in that situation, and I feel like there is potential risk of losing my offer if I interview, I feel like I should just cancel the interview but I also think it would be better for my career and I might be happier if I were able to work at the interviewing company so I think I could regret canceling the interview. I appreciate any advice! Thank you."

Even worse, seeing if I may need to work more on my skills is another thing I'm worried about since I hadn't been able to use my skills into the field. I know I wanna learn more on coding, especially Python, but I don't know how can I practice and such and be creative. As for job hunting, I still trying to find something that could be entry level like IT or in software development. I've applied to so many jobs and I'm awaiting responses. I'm still worried if everything will lead to rejections and I have to find another job while I continue to work on the field. I've got a temp job finished so I'm still open for options. I'm already trying to find that entry-level position that works for me. What more can I do for my skills and if I can't get the job, what else could I do while I continue to apply for them?"

Hello everyone, I am a 29 year old student from Oaxaca, Mexico currently studying an MBA in Mexico at a Mexican College.

I have the opportunity to apply to a dual degree program at Montpellier Business School. 
And while I am deeply excited to do so, I need help to understand the costs of living in general in Montpellier. 

Do you have any kind of ideas to work out from September 2021 through June 2022?
I need some advice on gigs in order to get few bucks to afford living. 

I am currently working at a Mexican pharmaceutical as corporate lawyer and I also have experience in selling art in Oaxaca. 

And I have some other questions… for example so you know any students residency? Or something similar in order to get the cheapest rent possible?

How much is the cheapest monthly rent for a bedroom in Montpellier? 

How much does daily food cost on average in Montpellier? 

Is there a very cheap place to rent near the school? Does anyone know of any kind of financial aid that I can apply for as a student in Montpellier? 

Is there a way to generate extra income either as an internship or by supporting Spanish or English students? Even as an aupair.
Walking dogs? 
Babysitting? 

Does anyone have any hack to use my money in the best possible way? 

Do you know any place where you rent cheap student stays? 

In the winter time is it very cold? 
Does it snow?
 Do I need air conditioning in the summer? 
What are the minimum services that I require to live in Montpellier? 
What benefits would you have as a student in Montpellier? 

Do you know any family that wants to give me shelter and food in exchange for taking care of the house or teaching Spanish or English to the inhabitants of the house? 

The truth is that I prefer everything to be as cheap as possible. 

The program is planned to be a full-time student for one year and I am going to finance my studies, so I require all the financial aid possible and all the tips that they want to share with me to generate my decision making. 

Thanks!

Bonjour à tous, je suis un étudiant de 29 ans d'Oaxaca, au Mexique, étudiant actuellement un MBA au Mexique dans un collège mexicain. 

J'ai l'opportunité de postuler à un programme de double diplôme à Montpellier Business School. 

Et même si je suis profondément enthousiaste à l'idée de le faire, j'ai besoin d'aide pour comprendre le coût de la vie en général à Montpellier. 

Quel est le loyer mensuel le moins cher d'une chambre à Montpellier? 

Combien coûte la nourriture quotidienne en moyenne à Montpellier? 

Y a-t-il un endroit très bon marché à louer près de l'école? 

Quelqu'un a-t-il connaissance d'une aide financière que je peux demander en tant qu'étudiant à Montpellier? 

Existe-t-il un moyen de générer des revenus supplémentaires soit en stage, soit en soutenant des étudiants espagnols ou anglais? 
Vous promenez des chiens? 
Baby-sitting? 

Quelqu'un a-t-il un hack pour utiliser mon argent de la meilleure façon possible? 

Connaissez-vous un endroit où vous louez des séjours étudiants pas chers? 

En hiver, il fait très froid? Neige t-il? 
Ai-je besoin de la climatisation en été? 
Quels sont les services minimum dont j'ai besoin pour vivre à Montpellier? 
Quels avantages auriez-vous en tant qu'étudiant à Montpellier? 
Connaissez-vous une famille qui souhaite me donner un abri et de la nourriture en échange de l'entretien de la maison ou de l'enseignement de l'espagnol ou de l'anglais aux habitants de la maison? 

La vérité est que je préfère que tout soit le moins cher possible. 
Le programme est prévu pour être étudiant à temps plein pendant un an et je vais financer mes études, j'ai donc besoin de toute l'aide financière possible et de tous les conseils qu'ils souhaitent partager avec moi pour générer ma prise de décision. 

Merci!"

I had a terrible (took off time from research positions, dropped a class, and got Bs, a C and a D in the other classes - I took exclusively upper division math/CS classes) last semester basically just because I got into very bad self-care (no sleep/no exercise/lots of video games and bad diet) habits due to COVID but my freshman year and this semester are much, much better (namely, I’ve aced every test this semester, have a 1st author publication that my PI thinks will be accepted in June, an internship at a startup working on an open-source project (my contributions will visible to prospective interviewers) , and had perfect grades my freshman year along with 2 middle-author publications).

It's basically a graduate program and the pay is same for all the grads and the grads are supposed to join in august.

Because of the Covid situation, the organization which I'm currently working has postponed my DOJ until my exams are over.  Unfortunately the exam were conducted on September. But since august  I had training like the other grads but without pay. So, I joined on October.

For the new financial year, all the grads will get an increment in their annual pay. But just because, I joined on October, they said I won't get any increment and my increment will be on 2022.

As a fresher here, I feel like exploited by my organization where I put the same amount of work like the other grads do. I feel like I need to switch to other organization. But considering my experience, I hesitate to do so.

What will be the right course of action here? Shall I stay in my current organization or do a switch? And does the experience matter?"

ltmxcw,46,2021-02-27,What are mid/senior level interview processes like? I've almost developed a phobia of them.,Space-Pretend,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/ltmxcw/what_are_midsenior_level_interview_processes_like/,"Apologies for the long post but been thinking about this one for a while.   
There tends to be a lot in this group about the interview process for grads. I'm wondering what differences to expect in the interview process as someone going for more experienced roles.   
So for context I've been working as a backend Java engineer for 4 years.   
Salary growth is limited at the company I work for so I've decided to look elsewhere. My day to day job mostly involves correcting bugs and making small/medium changes to the existing codebase. 

Sad thing is, I've never really had to go all the way through a normal process. At my current company I started as an intern after a single interview with the engineering lead and worked my way from there. 

Generally the process seems to be:   
1) Initial screening call  
2) Take home code exercise (or a timed code test)  
3) Zoom call to talk about the code exercise  
4) Multiple rounds of technical questions  
5) System design round?   
6)  job offer. 

I'm most vague about step 4 and step 5. For grads they say to practice on data structures and algorithms as well as leetcode/hackerrank stuff. Does that apply as much to devs with experience who might be rusty in that area?   
Is the approach ""just"" to spend the next few months practicing leetcode exercises, brush up on DS &amp; algos, and study: cracking the coding interview? 

I've my eye on a couple companies like workday(teams not using xpresso ideally) and hubspot as they offer good salaries/benefits and seem to have good work environments.   
Cheers for reading my ramblings!"

However, I fear I might not be as good as I think I am. I also have really bad social anxiety and am scared of freezing up in an interview.

Those who know me will know me and those who don't here is a short description.

Poly dude from SP DCPE, went to NUS Law, transfered to CS+USP, dropped out, took on massive debt to attend Cambridge Engineering, graduation due in 4 months.

Topics I'm happy to discuss:

1. Poly stuff in general

2. NUS Law/CS/USP, NTU Biz+Computing

3. Scholarships in general. Went through some 20+ application and interview rounds. Could talk about taking on debt for overseas education as well

4. Cambridge and UK in general

5. Offered a place in Stanford. Happy to discuss US apps

6. SAT 1/ 2 were 2380/2390. It's a lot easier now but happy to discuss

7. Internships/interviews/jobs. Here is where it gets fun and where the real meat of my experiences is. Applied to 200 jobs in my first year, 300 in the second, 100 in the third. Interned at 19 places over 3 years. Search me up on LinkedIn if you like.
Sectors include:
Software Engineering,
Corporate Finance (Investment Banking),
Investments (Private Equity, Real Estate, Mezzanine Debt, Search Fund, Venture Capital, Fundraising),
Consulting (MBB etc)

8. Networking. Cold emailed 2000 people in the industry, spoke with 50 of them, and secured a number of internships. A lot of fun stuff here.

Realized that this place may not have the right target audience, so if anyone knows anyone else not in this forum looking to speak, do share with them. Post might get archived pretty quickly, so PM me if you see this thread after it gets archived.

Cheers.

Ps. Try NOT to PM me unless this is archived. Post it here. Others can learn. The thread survives longer."

ltti5w,789,2021-02-27,you are not alone,[deleted],selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ltti5w/you_are_not_alone/,"  

I am writing this for all the people who think that they are a waste of space, for graduates who are still unemployed, for students who feel they are a disappointment to their families, for people who feel the need to hide who they are, for someone still hasn’t found the courage to look in the mirror and be able to love what he/she sees in it. Did you all know that you are not alone? I, for one, have been feeling all these emotions, all at once. To be very honest, this has made me question my existence in this world. 

Sometimes, these emotions have made me feel worthless and the only thing that brings me out of this black hole of emotions is the fact that I am not alone. There are thousands who are like me, and maybe millions of people who are out there who are facing even more problems.

I am from a family who doesn’t pay attention to mental health issues. Okay! I am not complaining about my parents, they have done everything they could to raise me in the best environment. Its not their fault because it was how they were brought up. But it’s come to a point where they should understand how much a child in put under pressure in school and then college is way worse. But the worst has still not come. While you are expected to work after graduation, even after all those interviews, zoom calls and internships, you fail to land a good job offer. 

We are all expected to be like that one kid our parents are proud of that’s not you. It can be your neighbor’s kid, or your family friend, or your relative, but never you.

I am writing this to you all, whose voices were silenced by the society, who were made to alter their beliefs because they were not cut out to be the “normal” of the society.

Even when you hit rock bottom, I am here to tell you that you are not alone. The walls will crash in front of you and its your choice to live in a broken home or to build your empire from rock bottom to the top."

However I heard that competition is fierce for internships, and I really wanna do an internship at Apple while in college since I’m planning on getting a full time job at there or another FAANG if that doesn’t work out. So I am really thinking about starting to learn early.

I’m probably thinking of starting during the summer. In my senior year I am gonna be taking AP classes, but I’m willing to sacrifice all of my screen time to learn. Could I perhaps learn all the basics or maybe even more over a year?"

Unfortunately I have found no internships nearby since I live in humble New Jersey. I am scared because I think no FAANG company will care about an internship for a small company or irrelevant one. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to be more appealing to Apple? Do I need to do an internship at FAANG?"

I recently graduated in December with a BBA with a focus in IS/Cybersecurity. I had an IT internship in the summer working and I've worked in instructional design. 

I've had several interviews for positions in consulting and IT but no offers yet- mostly rejections. I think I've gotten better at interviews but I won't be satisfied until I get an offer. 

My questions are: am I doing something wrong? Does finding a good job get easier?"
lu12z1,6,2021-02-27,Quick tips for job seekers with anxiety,dreymatic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lu12z1/quick_tips_for_job_seekers_with_anxiety/,"Tech companies aren't the quickest, most efficient places in the world. If you don't hear from your prospective manager, recruiter, or coworker in a short amount of time try not to obsess over the idea that something may be wrong or they may be ignoring you.

When you get hired, especially if your start date is months away, there will be weeks of little or no correspondence between you and your employer. Just stay patient and try to focus on your life and enjoy the moment.

As a student seeking internships, this is perhaps the hardest part of the process. It's also something I am experiencing now. Having accepted an offer from my dream company last week and not really hearing much after receiving/accepting my offer it's a bit unnerving. The rational person in me tells me that people are busy and all will work out. But the irrational person in me still has a lot of fears!

If you are similar to me you're not alone. I just thought I'd post this here as a PSA since anxiety and similar issues don't get talked about too much in the job process."

I'm sure some things will change, but I'm mostly looking to see what I could improve on/need to change. I'm worried I don't have enough that actually relates to my intended major, since I focus a lot of my energy on DEI efforts that I am passionate about.

**Demographics:** Female, white, bisexual, attends public feeder in New England

**Intended Major(s):** Interdisciplinary CS/Biology major, such as computational biology 

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** N/A

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** UW GPA 3.9 &amp; trending upwards. My HS doesn't do weighted GPA or rank.

**Coursework:** 1 AP this year (APCSP), 4 AP's next year (including AP chem and APCSA), and a handful of honors courses. Freshman can't really take AP's at my school. 

**Awards:** N/A

**Extracurriculars:** 

\- Co-founder of YA book club program at local library focusing on issues in diversity, equity, and inclusion (Starting Freshman year)

\- High School Student Laison to DEI efforts at a large local middle school, Co-chair of sub-committee of \~30 people within DEI student advisory council at our school

\- On staff of school newspaper, I write a column about food science

\- I participated in my schools' science fair this year and did a survey of \~300 people about veterinary care access (I also fostered kittens earlier this year, but I probably won't include that on my college app.)

\- This semester I'm teaching free scratch classes for kids with a local organization 2x weekly, hoping to teach Java classes next year

\- Member of student council, environmental+social action group, local Diversify Our Narrative chapter

I'm hoping to land an internship in computer science or biology this year, but it's pretty up in the air. My internship for last year got canceled :/

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Too early to know.

**Schools:** Again, I don't want to obsess over this too much as a sophomore and this could change, but here's an informal list:

\- Brown 

\- MIT

\- Hampshire College (Legacy)

\- Mount Holyoke College

\- Tufts University

\- Middlebury College

\- Williams College

\- Northeastern University

I am afraid that it might make the management not want to employ me after the internship or that it might affect my chances of becoming their best candidate and get a master’s scholarship basically.

I also live in Europe.

Do you think it would be a good idea to wear it to? work?
Will it have any negative repercussions in the future am I just being nervous about the first day?"

lu4i9b,5,2021-02-27,Lost Junior in College—Series 7 or Jump Ship? (Any Advice is Appreciated!),g5masterforce,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/lu4i9b/lost_junior_in_collegeseries_7_or_jump_ship_any/,"Hi everyone—I wanted to begin by saying I scroll through this sub frequently, and I’ve found some helpful content here! Now on to my question:

I’m currently a junior at a college in NYC pursuing a bachelors degree in Finance. During my sophomore year, I was lucky enough to land a wealth management internship at a wire house firm (think Merrill, MS, UBS). Since I didn’t have any previous finance experience beforehand, I took the offer and learned as much as I could. 

I actually found the experience to be very rewarding (to my surprise, I didn’t have to do any cold-calling like my peers), and I’m very grateful for the opportunity given the current situation with COVID-19. 

Fast forward to the end of 2020: I was promoted from an intern to a part-time associate. One of the requirements was that I needed to pass my SIE, Series 7, and Series 66 within 120 days. 

Today, I just passed the SIE (woo!), but I have to admit that preparing for the SIE while being a student and a part-time worker left me exhausted.

My Series 7 is scheduled at the end of March, which gives me about a month, and my Series 66 is scheduled in April. This coincides with my midterm and final exam schedules for college, which is giving me a lot of stress! I know the Series 7 is substantially harder, and this made me wonder if I can handle the stress/time management requirements. 

This has forced me to reflect on my career progression. While I don’t hate wealth management, I noticed that I found myself attracted to researching companies and reading equity research reports during my work. 

I guess my question is—should I just put my head down and keep working to pass the Series 7 and Series 66 first—and then worry about this later? Or should I try to find other opportunities in areas like research now? I’m mainly torn between these 2 things:

1) Continue to study for the Series 7 and 66 even though I may not completely love wealth management—and risk being fired if I fail either test. (Which can be a real risk—given my crammed schedule)

2) Try to find other opportunities in fields like Research (ER) that I find more interesting, but give up my wealth management job. The thought of jumping ship scares me—I’m not sure what will happen if I do this and then I can’t find another internship/job and become unemployed.

I apologize in advance for the lengthy post; I normally don’t post on Reddit, but I don’t have anyone who I could consult with in my life regarding this topic. I appreciate it!"

I honestly wasn't crazy about my position anyway, and have been looking into changing careers. While I've been temporarily out of work, I've been looking into internships at other organizations. My question is, would I be more or less likely to get an intern position if they see that I already have a full-time job? I still have my job on my resume as ""current"" since I was expecting to return in the near future. It wasn't a done deal where I was fired or quit so I didn't see a point in writing ""temporarily furloughed"" on my resume. But, since I am interested in obtaining an internship elsewhere, do you recommend I edit my resume to say I am no longer employed by my previous company? I'm just not sure if companies would be interested in someone who demonstrates that they have a job already, or if it would actually hurt my chances in the case they want people who are clearly available for work with no other commitments.

Thank you for the help."

lu9w2s,1,2021-02-28,I've been stuck in a rut for 5 years,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lu9w2s/ive_been_stuck_in_a_rut_for_5_years/,"I moved to my current city 5 years ago to pursue an internship opportunity after graduating from college. I didn't really know what to expect nor have a plan when I moved here, I just wanted to leave my previous city to further my career. I didn't know a single person when I moved here, and my coworkers were all much older than me. The internship eventually turned into a job after a year of working for free, but it was extremely stressful and didn't pay me enough for me to spend money on going out. I also got into an emotionally abusive relationship, and I was basically not ""allowed"" to leave my ex's home, or else I'd had to face their temper and insults. I didn't make any friends through work, and I didn't make friends outside of work because I didn't have money to go out and was afraid of my ex. That was my first relationship, and it honestly traumatized me.

I met someone else after that relationship, and got to meet people my age through that person. After 3 years in this city, I thought I finally found my circle. Then I quit my low-paying job and unfulfilling career, and found another job in a different industry. The pay was double my previous pay, but the company was shit. Once again, I was working with much older people, and my job was primarily remote, which didn't help me with my social life. I got laid off due to their mistake (long story), and my relationship fell apart as the pandemic hit. I also realized the people I was hanging out with didn't see me as a friend, but only someone to ask for favors. The breakup was bad, I was neglecting my needs to save the relationship, and I couldn't pretend to be happy anymore. I've since cut ties with that group because I needed to heal.

I've been unemployed for 2 years because of the pandemic. But I've been going back to school while working through my issues in therapy. I finally found a career path that plays up my strengths which I could make decent money from. Now that my program is wrapping up, I've been seriously thinking about whether I should stick it out in this city, or move elsewhere. I'm reaching my late 20's, and I feel like like I've wasted my 20's in this city. My time here has been extremely challenging, both financially and socially, and I feel completely isolated in this city. I have one friend who was my roommate, and a handful of acquaintances I met through him. I feel like this city is stunting my growth. Every time I try to turn my life around, I'm faced with multitudes of problems, while not having a support system. I don't have any ties to this city, and I feel like I'm just aimlessly existing here. The thought of finding a job here and continue living like this makes me very hopeless.

I don't really know what my next move is. My confidence has completely shattered after going through those experiences, and now I'm afraid to make any decision. I really want to leave this rut and start fresh elsewhere, but I don't want to move to a new place, only to face the same problems."

I'd really appreciate any help I could get! This is my alt account, as some people know about my main Reddit account irl. Lemme give you some background first, which all plays a part in the problem. I'm an international student studying in the US, and fortunately, my parents are sponsoring my entire education. I don't really have a major that interests me and took finance based on money+ I hate some other subjects. I have tried to convey this to my family, but my parents and my brother are all highly educated and accomplished in their own fields, and try to support me all the time. I literally feel dumb myself when I compare myself to them and feel disappointed that I didn't deserve to be born in such a family :(

My parents weren't really social with a lot of people and didn't have a lot of friends due to which even I had problems making friends as I couldn't do small talk well. I didn't have any girlfriends or any close friends I could share my feelings with. I tried to convey some thoughts to my brother, but he told them to mom in good faith but as I mentioned I can't face the disappointment I've caused to be a part of such a family. When I came to college, it was like I was a free bird. I started drinking and smoking (in control), going to parties, etc. which I don't have the courage to tell my parents. I know they won't abuse physically or scold or anything, but I just can't face them. If I start living according to them, it'll be like having no friends to talk to, sitting in my room all day studying, applying for internships, or working on a project to help me academically. Even in college, my so-called friends don't call me regularly to hang out and it's like I'm always third-wheeling around them. Academically, I don't feel like studying, I get decent grades because I am just good with google and smart enough to figure out where I can find the answer. It's like I have no motivation, and I can't go to a therapist because I can't let my parents know about it.

Coming to my interests, I played esports professionally and even had a chance to make it as a career and compete globally but I couldn't convince my parents to allow me to continue playing. I took 11 subjects in high school, just to make a good application for university and even though my parents make it look like it was my choice in the end, it wasn't! It's like they want to control my life using a remote, and just be a robot not having fun, being like an ideal theoretical child. I want to do something in life which makes me happy (I literally don't care about money) but I lost the chance to be an esports player (mobile) in that game. I tried to switch to PC gaming, but it's a huge change from mobile gaming and I can't work it out. I tried to convince my parents last break to get me a gaming pc so that I can play pc games but they rather got me the latest MacBook. I genuinely love the esports industry but I can't figure out a way in, as I don't wanna work in the behind-the-scenes and want to be upfront as a player, coach, caster, etc. but I lost the chance for that. I play on a 6yr old laptop at 40 fps, where I want to make a career out of it. Sometimes I feel like using the money my parents sent for food to buy a PC but as soon as they figure that out I'm in serious trouble. I'm lonely most of the time, can't focus on classes, feeling like a robot, etc, and even after having no financial problem feel like I don't even deserve to live and just tell my parents I'm done.

TLDR: My life is messed up in a very unique way which I can't find any advice on anywhere."

lue2m4,3,2021-02-28,How To Find A Great Internship,magicalstar123,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/lue2m4/how_to_find_a_great_internship/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a college student new to this subreddit, but I thought I'd share some tips and helpful resources about finding great internships hat I've learnt from writing over 30 applications. 

**Researching + finding a good internship**

1. **Before you start: define what a great internship means to you.** Look at what you value in a role, what interests you and what type of environment you would like to work in. For example,  a big multinational is very different from start-up, in terms of culture and priorities. 
2. **Brainstorm opportunities.** Make a list of potential careers and job titles and head over to platforms like LinkedIn for inspiration. There, you can often see what other opportunities you wouldn't usually think of. Write anything down that appeals to you. 
3. **Research the most appealing roles.** Find out things like what a typical day looks like, what qualifications are needed, what types of companies you would be working for, whether internships are paid, what you can do after finishing your internship, etc. 
4. **Narrow down your search**. Ideally, after your research, you can nail down your choices by being ultra-specific about what you want. For example, if you started off with an interest in marketing internships, after your research you should be able to say something like: 'I want to work as a copywriting intern for a consulting company' or 'I want to work as a social media marketing intern for a scale-up'. This will help focus your search when you start looking for vacancies in the next step.
5. **Leverage connections + the internet to find great opportunities**. Apart from standard job boards like LinkedIn, you can also find good internships in the following places: (1) your university careers centre (2) company blogs or partner pages - these are often helpful to find similar companies in a certain industry (3) company listing and rankings - these will help you find businesses you would not usually think of at the top of your head. Just Google something like 'Top 10 business in X industry' or 'best start-ups in Y city'. You can also ask friends and family if they know about any interesting opportunities that might match what you are looking for. 
6. Once you have applied and gotten an interview, **ask the recruiter lots of questions about the company.** This can give you a lot of insight into the things that matter to you, whether that be working hours, responsibilities on the job, challenges your department or company faces, or even questions you might have about the company culture and team. 

Apart from these tips, I was wondering what people struggle with most when it comes to internship applications. Let me know in the comments, and for the next few days or so, I'll do my best to reply to any questions you might have."
lui9yg,5,2021-02-28,How do I deal with a parent who is putting a TON of pressure on me?,lankysmart,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/lui9yg/how_do_i_deal_with_a_parent_who_is_putting_a_ton/,"I have a 4.0 and I current am a sophomore computer science major at a state school. 

I’m not trying to flex but I feel like the pursuit of a 4.0 is actually more detrimental than just living with the fact that you have less than perfect grades. I never had a 4.0 in high school so I didn’t care as much back then and just lived with the fact that I wasn’t perfect. 

However, my major is difficult and my dad is always telling me that I am great and how I have a 4.0 and how I’m better than most of the kids in the major and everyone at the school. He brags to others about my grades and always asks me how many others in my class and major still have a 4.0 after each semester. I guess he just wants to compare myself to others. He goes on about how recruiters look at your GPA and how I should easily land an internship. 

I feel like my dad is more proud of my 4.0 than me. He says “it’s ok” if you don’t pull it off this semester but I can just tell in his heart that he still expects me to get a 4.0 and that he would be disappointed and heartbroken if I don’t. 

How should I handle this? Keep in my mind, my dad does pay for my college but he just doesn’t understand the reality and expects SO much from me."

I’m currently a software engineering student. I’m particularly interested in the “people side” of engineering, as I have great communication skills and would like to put them to use. This means I’m planning on orienting my career towards positions that are related to management, sales, customer relations management, product success, etc. 

I like programming but not enough to sit a desk and do that my whole life. I’d like to make it clear to potential employers that my intention isn’t to do that early on in my career. 

So far it’s been working great, I got an internship at a big 4 accounting firm as an advisor in technology. Basically I’m to manage the relationship between a client and the development team, although I was told there would be more aspects to my role than that. 

I’m wondering if any of you could share some insight as to what kinds of positions or roles would be interesting for me, what your experience has been, things I could do to develop my skills for such positions, etc. 

Thank you!"
luk0sz,4,2021-02-28,"Battery issues with HP ENVY x360, really short battery life compared to my 7(!) year old Apple MacBook Air, no luck with HP support so far.",dj-illysium,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/luk0sz/battery_issues_with_hp_envy_x360_really_short/,"Since I have been calling with HP support for over a month now and nothing really helped me so far, I'm trying my luck here.

This is going to be a long one, I apologize for that. I just want to paint the full picture so I don't have to hear the same thing HP is already telling me for a whole month now. If you took the time to read everything and could give me some advice, it would be greatly appreciated!

I used to have an Apple MacBook Air 13"" Mid 2013 build, but I wanted to switch to a Windows laptop for a long time. In November last year, I had finally saved enough to buy a good laptop (€1000 or $1200) and after a month of comparing different laptops according to my needs, I decided to buy the **HP ENVY x360 Laptop - 15-ed0013nb.**

The specs of this laptop include:

* 15"" touch screen (360° rotatable)
* Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz
* 16GB RAM (2x 8GB Samsung 3200MHz )
* NVIDIA GeForce MX330 graphics card

When I use my computer for everyday use, the battery will only last about 6 hours. The problem I'm having is that I used my 7 year old Apple for the exact same things and sometimes it lasted 2 days without having to charge it.

Everyday use includes:

* Using Microsoft Word **A LOT.** I am doing a teachers degree and the amount of stuff we have to prepare online is insane (even pre-covid). I usually have to prepare my classes for internships and do a massive amount of individual- and group projects. I also have to send a lot of e-mails for school and work.
* Using basic stuff like: Netflix, YouTube, Spotify...
* Using Chrome as my go-to browser for general surfing the web.

Why I decided to go for such high-end hardware:

* I use a lot of music and DJ software that sometimes struggled.
* I sometimes have to use video editing software for school.
* I play games on my laptop every now and then (nothing too fancy, my graphics card doesn't allow me to either).
* The touch and °360 function is very useful when correcting online assignments when I'm doing my internships. I request the pupils to submit everything in pdf and I use the HP Tilt Pen to correct these submissions on screen and then I just send re-upload the corrected assignments without having to open separate files or even print it. Saved me a lot of time already.
* It had to be Windows, cause most school-related software and websites are not optimized or simply didn't work on my Apple. I also didn't feel like paying so much for an overpriced laptop again (I learned from my mistakes 7 years ago).

As I said, for everyday use (so the basic stuff like e-mails and general surfing), my Apple sometimes lasted more than a day without charging. In sleep mode, it even lasts a week and after that I can just open my MacBook and continue where I stopped.

When I used my MacBook to play music at clubs, festivals, parties... I could easily last with one full charge for the whole night and didn't even have to plug it in (I usually did though, don't want a dead battery with a whole crowd in front of you). This wasn't only like that in the beginning, last February I had 3 parties a week and it did just fine.

Now with my new HP ENVY, I struggle to use it more than six hours straight, even when I'm only using Microsoft Word. I had to do observations in the school where I do my internship and after 6 classes, my battery was just dead. I didn't use Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or anything. I just sat in the back of the class with a Word document opened on my laptop. The day after, I had observations in the morning and in the afternoon. I put in in rest mode after the morning observations and when I wanted to continue a few hours later, the battery dropped 20-25%. I also experienced the same thing when I have a 2hour train ride and I put my laptop in rest mode in my backpack and when I'm home and want to continue where I finished before catching the train home, my battery dropped 10-20%. As I said, my Apple laptop sometimes lasted a week in sleep mode.

Another thing I experienced is that my 'full capacity charge' is 93% after just 6 months. My Apple has a remaining 97% full capacity charge and it's 7 years old.

I explained this to HP support over the phone, and they did the following:

* Update my system BIOS to the latest version.
* Asked for battery reports, sent them 5 now where you can clearly see the drop in battery charge when in sleep mode and where you can clearly see that the 'full capacity charge' is only 93%.
* Asked for EVT and IDR files didn't hear from them in like a week and the response I eventually got was ""don't put your screen brightness too high, disable Wi-Fi and bluetooth, disable background processes and startup apps..."". These are essentially the things they told me in the first ever phone call and are the very basic stuff I already did before calling them. I was a little offended and I also don't understand why I would pay so much money for a laptop and then disabling everything, while I didn't have to do that on my Apple and it easily lasted for more than a day with Wi-fi, Bluetooth and certain background apps enabled.
* Last time they called they said I shouldn't compare them. They said the battery is operating as intended (while I was promised 11 hours online and read nowhere that the battery charge dropped significantly while in sleep mode). They said ""The battery of your new HP product has to do a lot more work than the Apple battery: it has a brighter screen, it has a video card, it has a lot more background processes and has a way better processor"". Isn't the point of a good processor optimizing battery life?

So they say it's all perfectly normal, but I'm not too sure about it.

I hope someone got to the end of this long post (apologies again) and can spot the problem and/or give me some advice. It would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm 25 years old and I think I will not be able to get a job. College was really a struggle for me and I switched majors multiple times because I was not sure of what I wanted to do as a career. I made very slow progress accumulating credit hours toward graduation and I suffered from severe depression, anger, and social anxiety. Along with having Autism and ADHD.

Even though I found a group of friends, I was always behind and never got a job or internship. Mental health services at my university were really hard to access. I briefly pledged a fraternity, but had to drop soon after because I ended up having a stroke at age 21 which left me with right-side homonymous hemianopia and focal epilepsy. Plus, it cost too much.

I ended up having to go home and finish my degree online because of health and financial reasons. I had only accumulated about 60 credits as a senior and I ended up working hard on my online degree in Political Science for three years before graduating with a bachelors in fall of 2020. However, I did not get any experience with any sort of work, volunteering, or experience outside of school. To add insult to injury, I only graduated with a 2.4 GPA. Which was after me working my ass off to bring up from an even worse gpa of 2.2.

I've only had two brief(month long at most) jobs, one of which was a job in a warehouse which I left because of a messy fallout with the manager (complicated situation) and another as a driver for Postmates, which I had to stop because I lost the ability to drive after having my first Grand Mal seizure. I think I know what I want to do, but I don't know how I can possibly get there given my circumstances. I want to write speeches for people, specifically politicians, but I have no experience.

I've gotten therapy in my home town which was only slightly helpful in getting me through college, but my results flatlined after a while and therapy stopped working. The only bright side is that I've been getting exercise from lifting, running, and Jiu-Jitsu. Even still, those have not been able to build up my mental health.

I'm at the end of my rope. I want so bad to move out of my parents house and get an apartment and a job, but I don't possibly know where to begin. My sole focus was college for the past six-and-a-half years and I fear I've lost all employability.

What do I do?"

luphvh,1,2021-02-28,FLI Home,RepublicDry,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/luphvh/fli_home/," Hi, future FLIers!

My name is Ghost (or Rep, lol). I'll be attending Barnard College of Columbia University in fall for my first year. I'm a first-gen, low-income, rural student who found a lot of help in applying to college and figuring out what college will be like through online communities, much like this one, that I observed. However, no one community where I could chat with people like me ever stuck out. To solve this problem for current college students, high school students applying to college, etc, me and few friends have decided to make a discord server called FLI Home. It’s targeted towards first-gen/low income students who are navigating the college process as well as their school environment, internships, job opportunities, etc. We are hoping to grow in number in the coming months and want you to join us, so we have begun promoting our server. Feel free to ask any questions! I'd love to answer them.

Below is our link! All you have to do is join, read through #welcome, and accept our rules under #rules to join the server officially. We're a little slow right now, but the group we have is welcoming!

(PS: If promoting is against the rules, please LMK! I didn't see anything regarding it under the rules, but I don't mean to break such a rule if it exists lol)"
luq0fr,3,2021-02-28,Second year UVA transfer?,thekidtheycountedout,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/luq0fr/second_year_uva_transfer/,"Just submitted the application for second year fall and now I’m nervous af. Applied as pre-comm. Currently attend a decently prestigious/rigorous private school, but not on UVA level. What are my chances like?

College GPA: 3.8

HS GPA: 3.75 W (missed my sophomore year cuz mental illness but had a serious upward trend since then)

ACT: 34

ECs: Started a business with 12 employees, $35,000+ in revenue, co-founded 120+ member mental health advocacy group, data analytics internship after senior year, elected Leader of Boy Scout troop with 60+ members, member of Boy Scout national honor society, member of a couple clubs in both HS and college though I only had leadership positions in HS, worked jobs throughout high school 

LOR: got one written by my advisor. We have a great relationship and I did very well in my class with him. I’m confident he wrote a good one

Essays: 8.5-9/10. Writing is a strong suit and I was able to “show not tell” well. 

I go to school out of state but am a Virginia resident. Not sure if that plays into my chances. 

How are my chances looking?"

As my dream job is becoming an algo-trader I would love a job AI/ML side but anything software side will do.

I have looked up online and what I found in my preliminary research were a bunch of companies offering barbie holidays packaged as internships, jobs that just seemed a lot of expense and some party but not a lot of learning. I want to go somewhere that work the living hell out of me but walking away I can look back and say yes I loved what I learned here and I couldn't have learnt this alone 

Now, I think its time to mention that I am speaking from a position of privilege. Such that I dont seek a paying internship (Accommodation and Food would be an amazing bonus) but neither do I seek one that siphons money out of me for a 8 week holiday.

I want an internship badly because I want the discipline in my life to follow a particular set of routine, like I know for sure that if I love the job I can be the last man out every single day but its hard for me to be the first man in on even one of them, additionally I belong to a the upperish middle class so I have lived a pampered life so far and want to experience how to live alone and fend for myself. So can you guys guide me as to where should I look to find internships that suit my need."

lury6u,197,2021-02-28,Having lots of trouble landing an SDE summer internship,Disastrous-Course-65,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lury6u/having_lots_of_trouble_landing_an_sde_summer/,"I'm having an immense amount of difficulty getting an SDE summer internship. I did start applying a bit late - in Novemember - but I thought I would be able to get at least one offer. Most companies I send my resume to do not respond back, and if they do, it's usually a rejection. I landed one interview with Amazon, but I got a coding question on graphs(which I lack coding experience with) and got rejected. I'll give a summary of my resume:

\- I'm a CS major at Carnegie Mellon University, sophomore, high GPA

\- I list the courses I've taken(fundamentals of CS, data structures, functional programming, intro to Computer Systems, Sequential and  parallel algorithms)

\- I list the projects I've done: I've created a music generator in python that harmonizes a melody that a user inputs, I've created a proxy server in C, I've implemented a version of Malloc faster than the one in the C library(and some other things)

\- I have experience in Python, Java, C, SML, C#

\- I'm a teaching assistant at CMU for principles of functional programming where I hold office hours, lead recitations, and create content such as HWs for the course

&amp;#x200B;

These are the main things I emphasize. Am I lacking in my resume in any areas? It's really disappointing to have been applying to companies for like 5 months and not have any luck. I feel like I'm a strong programmer and have a good background so I'm really clueless as to why I'm having so many failures. Thank you so much for helping!

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

Thank you so much everyone! I've received an overwhelming amount of support and I appreciate you all!"
luspwx,11,2021-02-28,Converting from intern to full time SWE at a Big-N without graduating?,peanuty_almondy,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/luspwx/converting_from_intern_to_full_time_swe_at_a_bign/,"Basically, I'm interning at a well known ""Big-N"" bay area tech company (not FAANGM but similar to ULASS) summer and would be interesting in starting full time in Jan '22 and completing the final year of my undergrad on a part time basis from there,  graduating between summer '22 and early '23. I started my degree in '17 and have \~15 mos of full time internship experience across 3 internships to date. I have my reasons for wanting to do this so please don't ask why or criticize.

I know I wouldn't be the first CS-student/SWE to work full time while finishing up their degree but I imagine most people do that as an industry hire rather than by converting an internship. However, I'm only interested in pursuing this if it's something that ""Big-N"" companies allow (AKA I'm not interested in going behind any company's back). The only reason I even thought about this is because of tech's dropout/bootcamp culture and how lax some tech companies like Google ([venturebeat.com/why-google-doesnt-care-about-degrees](https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/25/why-google-doesnt-care-about-college-degrees-in-5-quotes/)) are reported to be about GPA and having a degree.

I would also certainly consider applying to entry-level SWE I roles as an industry hire."
lutshd,5,2021-02-28,Is it normal to be asked to continue a summer internship into the fall/spring semester of college?,semesterintern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lutshd/is_it_normal_to_be_asked_to_continue_a_summer/,"I know the circumstances with remote work are different due to the pandemic but this is my situation. I had a good experience with an internship over the summer and really hoped for a full time offer. I was asked to extend the internship into my fall / spring semester of college, and I accepted hoping it would help my chances of a full time offer. Ultimately before the fall, I was given a full time offer, which I am really grateful for, and I do enjoy the work. However, it is becoming really very stressful to me to balance the expectations of a software engineering internship on top of schoolwork, research, and clubs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this common practice outside of the pandemic? I am tempted to ask if I can take a back seat and focus on my schoolwork, but I don't want to seem like a weak employee and I don't want to let the company down. I really fear sounding entitled to a company that has done so much for me during a very uncertain time, but at the same time I have been finding myself too strung out and unhappy. I know this isn't just me since many friends of mine are also continuing their internships into the school year, but I have no clue if this is just a byproduct of remote work and Zoom, or if it's a genuine and reasonable expectation of a college student. Thanks for any advice."
