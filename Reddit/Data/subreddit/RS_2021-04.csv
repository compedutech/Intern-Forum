mhjliw,2,2021-03-31,"Dose of reality? What's my prospects with good grades in a good school, but 0 extracurriculars?",throwawy115,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mhjliw/dose_of_reality_whats_my_prospects_with_good/,"I'm 3/4 through junior year, and have a high 3.7+/4 gpa in a top 25 US CS program, but can't land an internship and can't get through tutorial hell for creating a side project with the measly amount of time I set aside after schoolwork, studying, exercise etc.

Am I going to be okay after graduation? My Dad keeps pressuring me to push myself harder like where I'm at is not okay and I'm going to be jobless. I aim to work 8 hours a day, but maybe I'm not focused enough during the 8 hours, take too many breaks, or 8 hours isn't enough. Not being able to land an internship makes me afraid I'm not going to be able to land a job (which should be harder?)

CS is my favorite school subject, and I enjoy coding (like in class projects) as far as something productive goes, but this definitely wouldn't be my first choice to spend my free time so all the recruiters asking for passion make me wonder if I'm in the wrong field.

I just don't know what I'm up against/where I stand, so I'd appreciate any financially independent/graduate's thoughts on this, especially if you also job searched on the eastern shore, thanks."
mhjs1j,1,2021-03-31,Why are there engineering internships for grad students and how do they work?,AureliasTenant,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mhjs1j/why_are_there_engineering_internships_for_grad/,"I'm studying engineering at an undergraduate, and I'm applying to summer internships as an undergrad and I'm seeing a lot of jobs that seem to be explicitly call for graduate students (so non-thesis masters, thesis masters, and regular PhD students/candidates), and I find this weird because aren't most engineering graduate students who are in a research program (ie excluding non-thesis masters students) getting stipends to do research? I heard that for a normal graduate student doing research, your stipend increases during the summer because you are expected to do more research and less coursework? Are the recruiters targeting grad students who have funding for research during academic year but not for summer? Or is it because the grad student hasn't progressed passed X number of graduate level courses and thus doesn't get research until X is completed? Is this part of some kind of academic rotation thing where your school/department/advisor/funding source says its okay to get experience elsewhere?

If you know more about this or have experience pls let me know!"
mhjvjz,2,2021-03-31,Nervous about graduating unemployed,allmycircuit5,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/mhjvjz/nervous_about_graduating_unemployed/,"I graduate from my cyber security degree in June and  am a bit alarmed at the lack of entry level or junior positions available. I was going to do an internship last year but the pandemic threw all that out so don't have much I the way of experience other than 3 weeks with my collages IT help desk department. Unemployment where I live is huge and job competition is tough. This being said is it possible to try for a help desk role and move up to cyber security? I really hate the thought of graduating in June with no job and staying without one for the rest of the year. I've networked quite a bit with people in the industry and whenever I go to an event or talk people can put a name to my face which is good, and as a result some managers and directors have personally reached out to me on LinkedIn but haven't made any promises yet."
mhk54d,2,2021-03-31,two different startup questions,rogercraig2,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mhk54d/two_different_startup_questions/,"1) how much does it matter if i work at a startup (around 1-50 employees) vs a company with 100-250/300 employees? i.e. how much does brand name matter with respect to the work i do (backend/data science)?

&amp;#x200B;

2) if i can work at two \[startup\] internships simultaneously, is that legal? or is it only legal if they do not directly compete with one another?"

I have narrowed my schools down to these, and I am having trouble choosing. Cost of attendance for both schools are very similar, so the cost does not really matter here.

## University of Texas-Dallas

* Not as highly ranked as Madison
* [CS^2 honors program](https://cs.utdallas.edu/computingscholars/), essentially a small group of honors students
* Priority registration for classes
* Nice dorms (i.e. I get a room with a closing door to myself)
* Suburb - I'm not so sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing - more quiet (I like quiet) but less things to do without a car

## University of Wisconsin-Madison

* Very highly ranked in CS, well known
* No (useful) honors program, but potentially ""honors in the major"" (for later)?
* No priority registration
* Maybe single dorms, but not guaranteed (I like single dorms)
* City - too many parties for me, but I can just walk around the city and have things to do if I feel like it

I have visited both schools and I don't really have anything going for nor against one or the other, really.

Mostly looking for program quality, internships, and employability after graduation in the CS field.

Any thoughts? Thanks!"

mhmcnp,6,2021-03-31,University Selection for CS in Texas,manafuzer,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mhmcnp/university_selection_for_cs_in_texas/,"Hello, not sure if this is the right place but I'm a Houston based HS senior who is trying to make a college decision to study CS. I got accepted into both Rice University and UT Austin. The cost between these schools is within like 5-7k of each other with Rice being more expensive.

My main points for each side is that Rice is a smaller school that is local (I'm based in Houston) and would likely allow me to leverage more opportunities due to size. They have more individualized processes, classes, and research funding. This is especially helpful in course selection. At UT, it is much harder to get into the courses you want (or need) due to its massive size. Rice is also much better for many other subjects. I'm relatively committed to CS but I would like to pursue a minor/dual major in Applied Math and I have massive interests in Physics and Robotics (alongside CS).

On the other hand, UT is ranked higher, a bit cheaper, and is based in Austin which is a growing hub for CS. My main ""counter"" for this argument is that it's difficult if not impossible for me to do an internship during the school year at either school anyway, so being in Austin throughout the year doesn't make a big difference career-wise as many Rice students also spend summers in Silicon Valley/Austin for internships/research opportunities. Also, if it makes a difference, I wasn't accepted to any honors programs at UT, so I don't get priority course selection or honors courses.

What is yall's take on this? Any suggestions or points to bring up for either side? Any idea what makes UT ranked higher than Rice for CS? I fear it might just be stats that don't matter to me personally (maybe things like diversity or financial aid %) where Rice might be better in aspects that would matter to me (recruitment, funding, class size, etc).

This whole college selection thing is such a headache and I'm so torn between these schools ;("

Due to medical reasons I potentially will not be able to participate in any internships prior to graduating in 2023. This includes remote internships as I currently can not reliably work at any given time. While that hopefully will change, I would like to be prepared in case.


Since I’m attending an online university I’m missing out on a lot of the networking aspects and access to critiques. Most of my classes are mainly self-taught with teachers reviewing and grading with little feed back.


What can I do to build a portfolio that makes me stand out without that experience? Are there specific things companies look for that I should focus on? In my courses they mention the importance of your portfolio but never discuss what makes a portfolio successful."
mhmvqn,1,2021-03-31,Are remote internships legit??,SpaceSmoker,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/mhmvqn/are_remote_internships_legit/,"I’m a Junior in college studying Computer Information Systems. My goal is to do marketing or web/software development. It is kind of hard to get a job without any experience, and it seems that these big companies are picky on who they hire. 

A lot people I know go off to live in a big city and do their internship in person, but I do not have the money to pay for living in a big city (most internships are not paying enough to cover the cost of living). I also can’t do these internships because they are looking for someone with experience.

I have decided to look for remote internships, preferably at startups. Indeed is my source to find them, and there sure are a lot. Startups are what I’m looking for because they are willing to hire ambitious college students without experience because we are eager to learn, and they can pay us a pretty cheap wage.

I was recently offered a remote marketing position at a pretty new startup. The company consists of 1 person, who is the owner. The company is a software company that helps businesses with software integration. It is part time paying $12/hr.

My main question is, are remote internships legit? Are they going to help me land a good job in the future? The reason I ask this is because a few years ago I had a remote “marketing” internship with no pay. I thought I would get experience learning real skills, but my job was to find businesses and call them and try and pitch marketing services that were outsourced. My “manager” didn’t even know that this was called telemarketing, he called it “phone marketing” lmao.

I’ve talked to the guy who runs the business I got the offer for on zoom face to face, and it seems pretty legit. Nothing seems scammy or a waste of time to me. 

Sorry for the long-ish post. But I am just looking to get experience and not have my time wasted doing stuff that won’t benefit me. I’d just like to hear your opinion on remote internships for startups."

mhn7wc,3,2021-04-01,EEB Major Careers,Chaosism,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/mhn7wc/eeb_major_careers/,"I'm a CS major right now, but to be honest, I hate computer science. I'm good at it, and I'll be in lots of debt by graduation, so I stuck with it for a while (up to 281), hoping for high paying jobs. I regret it, I want to do something I care about - I just don't want to be caught working at McDonald's with a degree.

For any EEB majors, current or graduated (or other environmental science majors) - what are job prospects out of these majors at UMich? I'd love to work in conservation, some sort of field ecology, or environmental education. I'd also be open to pursuing academia, if I could afford it. Worth noting, I'll also have a CS minor when I graduate. Will getting a job be a struggle without the privilege of having time to volunteer during college or after? And, if I can't find an internship during my degree, will I be screwed after? Are there post graduation internships, or entry level jobs for those without an internship? If I do change to an EEB major, what can I do to assure I get a decent job out of college?"

mhobh0,12,2021-04-01,(NSFW) I’ve been diagnosed with OCD and still wonder if I really have OCD. The only way to calm myself is by telling myself that I’ll commit suicide before I act on my intrusive thoughts.,Leather_Plant_2582,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mhobh0/nsfw_ive_been_diagnosed_with_ocd_and_still_wonder/,"Long post, but here goes

I’m a 21 year old male who’s a senior in college set to graduate in May and begin a career with a well-paying job in July. For all my life, I’ve dealt with some form of anxiety whether it was social or generalized. This anxiety could be a cause for depression at times, but it was never so severe that I felt like killing myself, at least not until I got to college. I was better at managing it during my high school years and I was able to create some fulfilling friendships and relationships. I played varsity baseball, was at the top of my graduating class, dated a few good looking women, and had some close friends. When I reached college, things took a turn for the worst. During my move in weekend freshman year, I drunkenly shouted a racial slur at a fraternity I wanted to join which resulted in me being blackballed. I realized soon enough that I probably wouldn’t have made it pledging a fraternity anyway, because my grades were atrocious that first semester of college even without being in a fraternity. As a result, I’ve spent the last 3 and a half years watching everyone around me cultivate social relationships and find their niche. While all this happened, I managed to date a handful of girls for a couple of weeks to a few months, each destroying me mentally and emotionally. Not kidding. Around 10 beautiful girls I’ve talked to in my 3.5 years of college I drove away because of my insecurities. These heartbreaks, in conjunction with school stress, not playing baseball anymore, not having many friends, self hatred for making racist remarks, and imposter syndrome all culminated in me developing (what I think to be) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

After completing an internship in 2020, I received a full time offer at the firm for the following year after college graduation. Everything was great. I had my life set, nothing to complain about. So one night, a couple weeks after the last day of the internship, I’m sitting on my couch smoking weed and watching youtube videos like a normally do. (I’ve been a daily stoner since December of 2017) An intrusive thought pops in my head as a result of what I’d describe as a “hyper-awareness of my anus.” The thoughts are simple: “What if you’re sexually attracted to guys? What if you want to have anal sex? What if you never really liked girls to begin with? Maybe you suck at relationships with women because you’re supposed to be with a man.” Now, I know everyone has had intrusive thoughts of many forms before. And I want to preface the rest of this post by saying that I am not homophobic or transphobic. But that night, the thoughts led me to “check” by masturbating to gay porn. Low and behold, I was aroused and ejaculated which sent a wave of anxiety through me. How could this be? All my life, I identified as straight and generally watched lesbian porn or heterosexual porn. The thought of being with a guy romantically wasn’t necessarily disgusting to me, but it was just never something that I thought about because I always loved being with a woman. I had even masturbated to gay porn a couple of times in years past and didn’t think much of it; I just chalked it up to having a high sex drive and being turned on by watching two people engage in a sexual act. After that night, the next month was filled with anxiety and depression. It felt like I had lost my attraction for women and that I was doomed to be with a man and that I would be a disappointment to those around me. I began researching and learned of HOCD, or Homosexual-theme OCD. The symptoms seemed to align with what I was experiencing, but I couldn’t know for sure. And that’s the crux of OCD. It’s a disease of pervasive doubt. Desperate for answers, I decided to see an OCD therapist over Zoom to do CBT. I saw him for about a month, while the depression and anxiety continued to gnaw at me. I finally reached a breaking point and called my parents and said “hey guys, I might be bisexual. I’m just accepting it.” I told my roommate the same thing, and they both were understanding and accepting of me. “Finally” I thought. “This weight is lifted off my chest and I can rest easy tonight before we hop on a plane to Colorado for a little vacation.” Not even ten minutes after telling my roommate and parents and feeling liberated, I sat down, smoked a bowl and felt great. Bam. Another intrusive thought hits me. “What if you fucked a dog in the ass?” At this point, my anxiety skyrocketed because it felt like my brain had broken. How the hell can a single thought get stuck in my head on repeat and I can’t get rid of it no matter how hard I try? I said nothing about it, got on a plane the next morning for Colorado and suffered silently for a couple days while intrusive thoughts and images regarding intercourse with a dog replayed in my head constantly. 

At this point, I was pretty confident that I had OCD. Because if I didn’t, intrusive thoughts of a new theme wouldn’t just crop up after getting over the fear of the previous theme. So while I’m in Colorado, I’m doing my best to be cool but I’m just downright depressed and scared shitless. I began researching OCD, which naturally leads me to reading about other mental disorders. I stumbled across Schizophrenia, and another wave of anxiety and intrusive thoughts hits me. “What if you develop schizophrenia?” For the first 3 days in Colorado, my entire time was filled with my brain switching between thoughts of having sex with a dog and fear of getting schizophrenia. I told myself that I would see a therapist as soon as I got back home, and I called my parents and told them what was going on.

On my last night in Colorado, I was watching youtube videos to distract myself from the aforementioned thoughts. I stumble across a video with Ben Shapiro and a trans woman on a talk show. The thought pops in my head: “what if you’re trans?” Cue another huge wave of anxiety. For the last 8 months, I’ve been stuck on this theme. I abstained from smoking weed the first 4 or so months after returning from Colorado to try and help the anxiety, but my efforts were fruitless. Since January, I’ve been smoking weed daily and I’ve been on a high dose of prozac since October. Things are noticeably better compared to when it first hit me in August, but things still suck. Every day I experience intrusive thoughts related to being trans. “What if you’re trans?” “What if you’re a woman trapped in a man’s body?” “Do you really like your masculine features (beard, deep voice, height)? “Do you secretly want a vagina?” “Do you want to crossdress?” “Are you trans because one day when you were 9 years old and bored you tried on your mom’s high heels?”

Every day is just pure pain and my mental compulsions consist of telling myself that I’ll kill myself before I ever become a woman. OCD is the biggest mind fuck I have ever experienced. I rationally know that I’m probably not a woman trapped in a man’s body because all my life I’ve looked forward to becoming a man and I’ve looked up to the male figures in my life. I even received a formal diagnosis from a notable OCD authority. But doubt just runs through my mind every day and I am so close to the fucking edge. I feel so ashamed to tell anyone (outside of my parents and therapist) about my struggles. I’m scared I won’t be able to graduate and function at my job and I’m scared I’m going to become something I’m not (or am and just don’t know it yet.) If you told me that I could have mental peace if I chopped my own right hand off, I would do it. I don’t know who I am anymore and I’m dead inside. OCD is killing me and I just want it all to end. I want to have peace. I’m in a living Hell. 

Tl;dr
Diagnosed OCD, self hatred, anti-social behavior has culminated in daily suicidal thoughts that leave me wondering who I really am."

I got into Carnegie Mellon now ranked 16th which is pretty awesome. However, Georgia Tech upped the stakes and gave me a full ride, making this decision even harder. 

I’ve poured over the employment reports and they look pretty similar. My profile (gmat 730) seems to be higher placed in the student class at Georgia Tech, which might get me a leg up in getting that coveted consulting internship. 

So with housing and food expensive, going to tech would cost 35k over two years. Carnegie Mellon would be 210k 🥲 so I have to be certain it’s worth the trade off. I’d love to hear any personal experiences with these programs that you guys have to help me out. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

mhqbbz,0,2021-04-01,ucla vs ucb,eeva375,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mhqbbz/ucla_vs_ucb/,"hi so i’m an OOS student deciding between la and berkeley! I definitely wasn’t expecting to make this decision because it’s so difficult getting into either school let alone both but now I’m confused :((( to add, I’m an applied math major in both schools. My parents sorted out the financials and allowed me to go to whichever school I pick 

UCLA 
pros:
- great academics and I heard the community is generally more balanced (ie good mix of academics, social life and activities)
- A-tier food and a family friend told me housing is guaranteed up to junior year
- dorms are a lot closer to the actual campus. my sister goes to Berkeley and her dorm is 15 minutes (by walking) away from the actual halls 

cons:
- I’m interested in double-majoring/minoring in data science but UCLA only has math in data theory,, I heard it isn’t completely the same
- looking into tech/consulting internships and Berkeley is generally more known for those since it’s in close proximity to Silicon Valley

BERKELEY 
pros: 
- Berkeley math is prestigious and I love their applied math program especially because of the various tracks you can pick
- has the data science major I’m interested in so I can choose to double-major/minor if my brain cells power through
- I’ve seen and heard of lots of students who have internships in tech start-ups and consulting firms 

cons:
- I know people have somewhat debunked the whole extremely rigid and competitive atmosphere in Berkeley,, my sister (a sociology major) says it’s what you make of it but I’m still scared because I just started to get my mental and emotional health back on track and submerging myself in a potentially depressive environment may not be the best for me
- housing is only guaranteed in the first year so I have to look for an apartment starting sophomore year
- safety since the dorms and apartments aren’t really within a closed area so I have to carry pepper spray or a taser just to be safe in case something happens

mhtnc9,18,2021-04-01,"I perform at a theater. One of our interns quit because she saw a ghost. I thought she was lying, but now I think I believe her.",Finch73,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mhtnc9/i_perform_at_a_theater_one_of_our_interns_quit/,"TW: Suicide

I've been working at this one theatre for about five years. Right now, I'm playing Frank in our upcoming production in the Rocky Horror Show. Because our old stage manager retired last month, we've needed a little extra help on the tech side of things, so our director hired some interns to help out. Yesterday, one of them quit.

The Cassiopeia Theater is... interesting to say the least. I mean, in any theater there are superstitions. Hell, most theatre traditions were based off of superstition, but our building has rules and traditions I've never seen before. Now, none of these have been written out in a list or anything. Like most things in theatre, you learn as you go along. Many of the workers here are convinced the theatre is haunted. I wasn't. For example, the props crew swears there's a ghost that moves the props around. To be blunt, I thought that was bullshit. If any of you have done theatre, you'd know that actors are drawn to props that aren't theirs like moths to a flame. Or there are some chorus members who have sworn to me that they saw a ballerina in the mirror of our dance studio when no one else was there. I chalked that up to dehydration combined with intense cardio. Now I'm not so sure.

Before I get into the story, it's important you know the layout of our main costumes department. So downstairs are the biggest men's and women's changing rooms and behind those is the workroom with the sewing machines. Then down the hall, there are these stairs that lead up to where we keep all of our used costumes and extra fabrics and stuff. We call that room the hot closet because one of the main furnaces is up there and it can get blazing hot. Past the door leading into the hot closet is this high platform that looks over the room where they build the set.

Our costume lead is named Sarah and she and I are really close because when I don't perform in shows, I work in the costume department to make rent. Yesterday morning, Sarah texted me and told me the intern in costumes, Kaitlyn, called her in tears.

Apparently, Kaitlyn was working late at night last Friday to finish stoning one of my costumes. For those who have never seen The Rocky Horror Show, there is this floor show within the main show and the costumes are super extra. Frank's clothes are extra to begin with, so she was working until around one in the morning stoning this corset. Kaitlyn was in the sewing room and she ran out of rhinestones so she went up to the hot closet to get some more. As she was passing through the set room, she says she saw a body hanging from the platform. It was a young man that she didn't recognize, he had pitch black hair and his throat was a bloody mess.

She panicked and ran up the stairs to see it closer, but once she got up there, the body was gone. She grabbed the rhinestones and as she was about to head back downstairs, she saw the same man standing on the banister on the platform. The rope was tied to his neck and attached to the lowest rail of the banister. He jumped and she heard his neck break as the rope pulled taught. Kaitlyn was hysterically crying at this point. She ran over to the railing, but when she looked over, no one was there.

Kaitlyn didn't stay after that. She immediately drove home, didn't even bother to turn off the lights. That night, she didn't want to sleep, but finally her body gave in. She had horrible nightmares about the man. She kept watching him jump over and over and over again. Every time, just before he plummeted, he said the words, ""I can't stop."" As the nightmare went on, his neck got more and more worn down, until the skin came off. Then the muscle. Finally his head snapped clean off. That was when she woke up. She quit immediately afterwards.

I was skeptical to say the least. Kaitlyn isn't the most reliable person to begin with. She's flakey and lazy. I mean, this was the first time she'd even stayed past normal work time to finish a job (one she should have had finished a day earlier, but I digress). I thought she was just making an excuse for not finishing her work.

Sarah didn't agree. ""You should have heard her. She was sobbing into the phone. She sounded terrified,"" she said. I still didn't believe it. That was until today.

Last night, I had a dream I was in the hot closet looking for something on the rack. This rack has four levels to it so you have to use a ladder and a hook to get the costumes on the top rack. I was on the ladder trying to reach a dress but I just couldn't get it to hook. Then the ladder shook.

I looked down to see the man with dark hair with his hand on the other side of the ladder. His lips didn't move, but I heard him clearly say ""Sam Rivera."" Before I could even process it, he rattled the ladder and I plummeted to the floor.

When I woke up, I thought it was just a coincidence. I heard Kaitlyn's story and I had primed myself to dream about the man she described. That was, until I remembered the name. I tried all day to ignore it, but Sam Rivera just wouldn't leave my head. I looked up his name combined with my city, and what I found has left me reeling.

Sam Rivera was a 23 year old man who hung himself from a platform in the Cassiopeia Theatre in 1986. I found a picture. It's the man with jet black hair I saw in my dream just before I hit the floor.

There's no way she could have known about him. I've worked here for five years and I've never heard of him before and that still can't explain how he told me his name in my dream. One thing is for sure, though. Everything that I've written off as a stupid superstition has been thrown into question. I will never look at that theatre the same way again.

Here's my situation:  Finishing my EE degree this summer, will be applying to entry-level jobs I find interesting during the semester.  Currently have three co-op internships under my belt.  Two at a relatively big company, one at a very small startup (around 5 employees in engineering, me included).  Both companies have expressed interest in hiring me after graduation, and I've enjoyed both companies.  Due to lack of mentorship at the smaller company, I'm kind of leaning more towards the large-ish company, as I feel as I can ""learn to do things right"" by learning from others more.  However, I get tons of responsibilities at the startup and since there's so much work to do, I can pretty much pick a topic, learn it, and apply it when I want.  At the large company, there's more hoops to pass through before actually applying and trying anything, but the methods are all tested and true.

I'm also looking at other places too, and I don't have to make a choice until two or three months from now anyway, but I'm looking for advice.  Is a startup suitable for a new engineer or am I better off trying to get more structured mentorship at a better, more well established company?

Thanks!"

However, a big-ish company (owned by one of the top tech companies) just replied back to my email. Is it okay to hold the startup longer?

mhwgu0,6,2021-04-01,Does a 1-Year or 2-Year MBA make more sense in my situation (POLL)?,MBA_Throwaway616,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/mhwgu0/does_a_1year_or_2year_mba_make_more_sense_in_my/,"Background: I am 27 and currently have \~4.5 years of full-time work experience at an industry leader in B2B manufacturing. My role has been product marketing, consisting of primarily product development, launch, and product portfolio management. My location is in Michigan, with the preference to stay in Michigan or the Midwest (preferrably Detroit or Chicago area).

I have very much enjoyed what I do, but am looking to accelerate my broader business knowledge and pivot into consumer goods marketing, preferably CPG as a Brand Manager or Product Marketing Manager. Salary-wise, I’m hoping to break the $100k mark, currently in the low 60s. 

I had applied to a number of schools and have essentially boiled it down to the following two programs:

**Michigan State University Broad: 2-Year Full Time, 80% scholarship** 

Pros 

* Access to more Detroit consumer goods companies 
* I believe it carries more weight in Michigan (large alumni network)
* Chance to experience the full 2-year program, including internship
* Allows *some* exploration of other roles (this is less of a priority)

Cons

* Not a highly ranked school - seems to carry little weight outside of midwest
* Overshadowed by UM Ross when looking at Michigan Schools
* \&gt;60% of the Broad Business school ends up in supply chain (which is Broad’s primary strength) . This means less competition, but it feels like I could get less priority from recruiters as a result
* High total cost when accounting for 2-years lost salary 
* Lower ROI based on the total cost and average graduate salary

**Notre Dame Mendoza: 1-Year Full Time, 60% scholarship** 

Pros

* Closer to Chicago, which carries more opportunity in consumer goods 
* Seems to carry more weight nationally and throughout the midwest
* Has a lower total cost when accounting for opportunity cost
* Has a much higher ROI based on average salary + bonus
* Not highly ranked, but at least a Top 30 (and seems to be viewed as such) 
* I prefer the 1-year timeframe. I do value the 2-year ""experience"", but feel more inclined to go 1 year if I can reach my goal in less time

Cons

* Lack of internship: this is my biggest concern. Less about “dipping my toes in” and more about making the necessary connections to pivot.
* Overshadowed by Kellogg or Wharton within CPG
* Missing the full 2-year experience 
* Higher debt load up front 

Basically, its seems to boil down to 1-Year vs. 2-Year: while Notre Dame seems like a clear choice based on the ROI, Chicago connections, and overall ranking, I’m concerned about the 1-year not giving me the resources needed to make an industry switch. I feel like I can easily make the connections between B2B manufacturing and B2C (as there are a lot of similarities in my industry in particular), but I'm not sure that it is enough to justify a 1-year. 

One final note: I do understand that Kellogg, Booth, etc. are better programs for the consumer goods industry. However, one of my primary goals was to minimize costs - I don’t personally want the pressure of $100k in debt and end salary is more important to me than a specific company. (In addition, my GMAT wasn’t high enough to obtain fellowships or scholarship at Kellogg/booth)

Appreciate any input!

mhwj03,1,2021-04-01,Which is better after graduation - AI research engineer internship or digital graduate scheme??,rich_l,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mhwj03/which_is_better_after_graduation_ai_research/,"Hi everyone! First time poster here (from the UK) looking for some advice from those with more experience!

As the post title says, I'm currently trying to choose between a full time, year long internship in AI research, or a graduate role at a tech consultancy. From where I see it, both come with their pros and cons

A bit about myself - I'm currently completing a conversion masters in computer science at a good UK uni, and before that I did geophysics as my undergrad. Have had a hard time deciding what to do with my life, having dropped out of the first course I started studying at uni. This comp Sci masters is the first time I've finally felt like I'm doing something that I really enjoy, I was inspired to get into it after a doing some online courses in Machine learning during my undergrad. I'm also quite keen to work in healthcare/ai if possible. I'll be graduating in September and both the roles I'm trying to choose between will start immediately after I graduate. 

AI research internship pros:
- Well known company - would look good on cv?
- NLP based project
- reason I got into computer science was to learn more about AI, this would definitely help with that!
- it seems that a lot of roles in AI/ML require a PhD, so I feel nervous to pass up an opportunity to work on an AI project with a large company when i can't currently afford to do a PhD 

AI research internship cons:
- offices in the middle of nowhere so I'd have to relocate to a village where I don't know anyone
- salary is not great as its an internship
- job ends after 12 months

Tech consultancy grad scheme pros:
- good pay
- Central London offices
- been offered a role in health care and life sciences department so there will be a good range of interesting projects
- rotational schemes in cloud, cyber and software dev so I'd learn a lot

Tech consultancy grad scheme cons:
- company reputation not as good
- not sure it would look as good on my cv as the company isn't as well known and isn't a major tech company
- graduate scheme so will likely be asked to do a lot of the ground work for senior consultants which could be boring?
- not much potential to learn about AI/ML


My main question is, if you were me which would you take? Which role would provide better prospects for me in the future? I've only been doing cs for less than a year so I know I need a lot more experience, but I would absolutely love to work for a health care or med tech company like deep mind at some point in the distant future, so any advice would be much appreciated!"
mhwpwo,1,2021-04-01,Delay graduation to search for internships,Mimikyutwo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mhwpwo/delay_graduation_to_search_for_internships/,"I'm a cs major who's entering their senior year after switching majors from electrical engineering. Because of the switch I don't have any internships in software development. I have two internships that are related to electrical engineering, however, and I work as both an undergraduate teaching assistant and do research as well. I have a number of projects listed on my resume (a portfolio website I built with react and a few other websites built with a MERN stack)

I've been applying to internships with little success and I can't help the nagging feeling that the lack of attention is due to my lack of industry experience. 

Since I'm entering my senior year I figure it's time to start searching for full time positions, but I worry that I just won't receive any call backs without internship experience in software development. I've got a high GPA (3.9), but from what I've heard most companies don't really care (and neither do I, I just list it because it is high)   


My question is this -- should I delay graduation to have more opportunities to visit job fairs and find an internship, or just throw out as many full-time applications as I can during my senior year?"

Should I do the extra year for a BS?",DreamChaserDoedie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mhzlm1/failed_senior_design_but_i_can_still_graduate/,"Long story short, I was due to graduate in May with a BS in Computer Science. But our senior design project fell through, and the professor let us know that we were going to fail, meaning I wouldn't graduate this semester. I spoke with my advisor to explore different options, and she told me that I have completed all of the coursework to still graduate this May with a BA in Computer Science instead.  She said I could drop the other 4 computer science classes I was taking alongside Senior Design as they weren't needed for the BA. So I ended up dropping them, so my parent's could get their money back before the drop deadline, as I make a decision. My question is, should I just graduate this May with a BA or should I do the extra year for a BS? If I go for the BS, I would have to do a year long senior design, and 4 computer science classes over the course of a year so 6 classes total. I have about 2 years of programming internship experience, and I'm typing this from my internship right now (I'm hoping they extend me to fulltime, but there's no promises).

mi05a0,2,2021-04-01,"Graduated December 2019, haven't had a job ever since due to the pandemic. Also I'm a foreign graduate, but I live in the States. How?",Valarent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mi05a0/graduated_december_2019_havent_had_a_job_ever/,"I applied to countless job applications and have had several screenings but none of them go as far as getting an interview, other than Revature (which I got an offer from, but I rejected due to numerous reasons).

Most screeners say that I have an 'impressive' background, but none actually proceeds with my application. Is that just sweet talk and I actually have a shit ass background? I've also asked some of my friends working at FAANG review my resume, and they both said my resume is ""really good"" but ""lacks some big names"". But how do I get a big name if the only way to get into a big name is to have a big name in your resume?

In summary, I graduated from a top private university in Asia with a GPA of 3.32. After graduating I then moved back to the states right when the pandemic happens. As I was holding a foreign degree, haven't been back in the states for awhile and some family/personal issues relating to the coronavirus I haven't been able to actively look for a job until October 2020. I only started job hunting around December 2020 until now.

Regarding my skills, I believe I am not the best but certainly not the worst in terms of CS graduates. I can make simple mobile applications very quickly, and complex ones around 1 to 3 weeks. I know numerous popular front-end frameworks and languages and a couple of back-end ones (React, React Native, Firebase, NoSQL, SQLite, Java, C# are the ones I am comfortable with). I certainly am no master programmer and bright student but I can write software pretty consistently, albeit not the fastest. But I can get the job done. That's where I see myself.

I have had an internship just before I graduated, working as a Full-Stack Engineer. The company was pretty shitty so I had to do full-time job mostly, even more than the full-time employee. Due to that I am quite familiar with the structure of corporations and working with them.

Regarding Leetcode, I must admit that I'm not that good. Easy questions is easy but medium questions will take me a while, especially if I am not familiar. But it's not like my brain dies when I see the problems, I usually end up solving it with a brute-force after a while. While I know I'd have to improve my LC, what's the point if I'm not even getting interviews?

I have 2 personal projects but both of them are not finished (tell me if this is a *big* issue, then I'll stop applying and focus on finishing the two ASAP). The app I made during my undergrad research is technically the property of my institution so I am not allowed to share its source code. The app was never deployed, but had a solid architecture/background that recruiters seem to be impressed when I describe this particular project during a phone screen.

But still no interviews. Heck man, I don't care if I get rejected left and right. I just don't get responses. Most applications I got rejected, even the entry-level/internship positions. This makes me wonder, **am I still eligible for entry-level/internship positions?** If so, why am I getting rejected constantly, not being able to even get a phone screen sometimes? Or should I apply to normal positions.. as a ""new"" grad?

I would greatly appreciate any help as I believe I can do the work as a software engineer. I might not be the best at it but, isn't that normal for a new grad? What can I do to get **responses**? I don't mind being rejected, **I just need answers.** At this point I don't even know where to go. I added and messaged recruiters on LinkedIn, but none of them responded even though they all added me back. Where to apply jobs? How?

Thank you!"

So, right now, I have an offer from a startup to work as a 'Technical Content' writer. My role would be to write interview questions for software engineering roles. E.g., on topics like DSA, C/C++. They're paying a decent fixed stipend which can increase based on performance. They also said that they'd help me pick up new languages or frameworks of my choice, and I can make questions on that new topic too. So, for e.g. I want to learn React so they'd help me do that. Lastly, they said that they'd be willing to interview me for a full software intern role at the start of my 3rd year if everything goes well.

If I go for the research project, I'd be working under one of my professors for the full summer, and it'd be completely technical. But right now, I can't be sure whether I'd get selected for the project. And I can't wait for the approval because the startup wants to fix the position by Monday. Also, let's say I want to go for a job after my undergrad and then go for a master's after a few years. Would this decision make a difference?

Other factors like the amount of stipend would be almost similar in both scenarios. And the internship is work from home if it makes a difference.

So, what should I do? Right now I'm leaning more towards the internship because I can work on my DSA, and learn something on the side too. If I go for the research project then I'd be only doing that for 3 months, and I'm not sure how relevant they'd be."
mi1qug,20,2021-04-01,"I've been in college for two years, but I still can’t move past my regret of not working harder in high school",shameful_asian_girl,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/mi1qug/ive_been_in_college_for_two_years_but_i_still/,"The title says it all. I am currently a second year computer science major at a C-grade (to be honest, some people even consider it a D-grade school) California State University school. This is all thanks to me slacking off in high school and graduating with a weighted GPA of 3.6, an ACT score of 27, and a lack of extracurriculars and AP classes. Meanwhile some of my friends all worked very hard and ended up in top universities such as Ivies, Stanford and UCs.

I was initially dejected, but in the first semester of college, I channeled that regret into motivation and found myself working ever so harder than I ever did in all four years of high school and finished the semester with solid A's. I repeated this the next semester and finished with all A's as well, even with the rough transition from in-person to online as COVID hit real hard. Though I was able to motivate myself even more, the regret of not working harder in high school and ending up in a top university continuously lingered in the back of my head whenever I checked the Instagram profile of a high school classmate who got into Berkeley or Stanford or any school that was ranked higher than mine. I vowed to keep up like this for all four years, so I could attend a higher ranking school for grad school.

Overall things have not gone well in the past few months with online school. Though I finished the spring 2020 semester strong, the fall 2020 semester ended terribly. I slowly, but surely became less and less motivated as the weeks of that semester progressed. Dealt with zoom fatigue on a daily basis as all of my classes were synchronous, procrastinated more frequently, missed a few assignments and almost stopped caring about school altogether at one point. I ended the semesters with B's and one failed class (marked on my transcript as ""No Credit"") which I plan on retaking this summer.

I am doing much better this semester though. This semester, I opted for a mix of synchronous and asynchronous classes for the sake of flexibility, and ensured I actively took as many notes as possible. I frequently reviewed my notes and re-watched recorded lectures, went to office hours at least once a week, and turned in all of my assignments on time. I currently hold all A's in my classes.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to get this off my chest, but this regret and guilt is starting to get bad again. Yesterday I started thinking about applying to grad school again, did some research on how to get into a UC grad program, but then ended up watching a series of Youtube videos made by Ivy League students in which they talk about their stats and scores that they worked hard on that got them into those schools. I then went in a negative though spiral in which I continuously beat myself up for not putting more effort into my grades and GPA, not being more active in the clubs I joined, not taking more AP classes, not taking the college application process seriously and just not doing more things overall that would have gotten me into Berkeley or Stanford (my dream schools).

Even if I did well in my first year, and am doing well again in the current semester, I can't stop thinking about how my university ranking and that one bad semester could impact me in the future. I have read stories online about how students from lower ranking state universities have a much harder time landing job interviews and getting employed than Ivy League graduates regardless of whether they made the most out of their four years or not. Since I am at such a university, I fear that a no-name university on my resume would still hinder my chances of getting a great job or entrance into a top university for grad school, even if I did maintain good grades and a high GPA, actively participate in clubs, do internships and work on my own side projects for my resume. I also fear that one failed class would hinder my chances as well, even if I pass all my classes with A's and B's the following semester. I also worry about having too many B's on my transcript.

I will continue to work hard for the rest of my life, but had I worked harder earlier, I could be in a much better place, constantly feel motivated and end up in a much better place years from now. I can't help but feel that those friends who are attending those top ranking schools will be enjoying a tremendous amount of success in a few years, while I am lagging far behind after graduating from my no-name university."

A family friend in the industry reached out to me and gave me some recommendations and said ""if you can blow their socks off, try to show them a portfolio of some sorts"".

 I have never been part of a project outside of a classroom, this would be my first out of class experience and I am wondering how to approach this as I know a bad portfolio is worse than no portfolio. Should I not make one and try to display my ""skills"" in interview or should I use the projects I have worked on in class and try to construct one. 

I am pretty nervous for this real world experience as my university isn't exactly known for its CS programs and a lot of the fundamentals and necessities of CS I have had to reinforce and teach to myself after I have completed the class, because the class was designed poorly, or just plane useless.

So recently I have been dealing with a huge case of Imposter Syndrome (at least I hope so and I’m not actually just awful at CS). I’ve known for the longest time in my life that I’ve wanted to do big things in the medical field, particularly dealing with computer science. 

This internship season has humbled me quite a bit, maybe too low. I was denied from every single medical device company that I applied to. It’s not that I didn’t get interviews, I did, but the volume of applications was just so high this year, it was extremely competitive (One location of a smaller company had over 800 applicants!) 

It’s not just the medical device companies, but a lot of internships were extremely hard to compete in. Assuming I kept track of my data correctly, I applied for 289 internships. I had interviews at lots of places, and almost none of them I would have considered bad. I had mostly positive feedback from most interviews, but just couldn’t land any of the ones I really wanted. 

Most recently, I was denied from a defense company after what I thought was an awesome interview, we all had a very positive vibe and conversation during it. But again the volume of applications is just so high this year (350 applicants for this one) that it seems there is always someone better. 

Now this isn’t to say I’m screwed and ungrateful. I did land an internship at a smaller company, but I’m a bit weary as they didn’t have many qualifications posted and the interview didn’t have any technical questions, so I’m worried that this internship may just be one where I’m not doing any actual coding or projects, but rather just testing their products and software for already worked code. Actually they did make it somewhat clear that although this is a Software Engineering role, a good majority of my responsibility will be testing their products.

Experience is experience of course and I’m grateful to have anything, I know many people didn’t have the luck on internships that many of us had this year, but man this season was a real kick in the gut. I went from thinking “I’m meant to do big, amazing things in computer science. I get As and I’m passionate, I’m confident in my abilities” to “Maybe I’m just not meant to do anything amazing, maybe I was wrong about my abilities and my CS career won’t be a fruitful as I thought.”

I know, maybe dramatic, but we can’t lie and say we all, or most of us, haven’t had these thoughts before. My question is after being down, how can I get back up and get away from this Imposter Syndrome?"

I think there was more than one person commenting that they landed internships that paid them 20-30k  for the summer, if I can do that for even just my junior and senior years, I can graduate with MUCH smaller debt that I initially anticipated and it would make attending this school an actual viable option. Also, are there additional scholarships given out to students after their first year here? I asked a friend who attends and that’s what he told me."

I applied for a few internships in which I got rejected by some and still waiting to hear back from the rest. But, I do have a feeling I won't get them either due to my lack of experience. So instead of being bummed out by that, I wanted to create my own projects over the summer and I want it to be a collaborative project instead of a solo one. 

The problem is that I'm currently lacking the creativity part and coming up with project ideas. Preferably something I can show off in my portfolio. I'm not sure what career path in computer science I'm interested in, so that's also hindering my ideas. 

Currently, I have knowledge in C, C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Meteor, MongoDB, Semantic UI, React, and still working on my algorithms. 

I know there are a lot of ideas online already but I also want to personally ask here just in case someone has also been in my situation. So, any suggestions? I would also love to know what projects you were able to create at the beginning of your CS journey."
mi4g32,2,2021-04-01,UCSB or Georgia Tech for PhD in Materials,kittehlord,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/mi4g32/ucsb_or_georgia_tech_for_phd_in_materials/,"Hi, everyone, it is me again. (I want to work in the industry)

&amp;#x200B;

As the deadline for making a decision approaches, and if all goes well, I have the option to decide between UCSB and Georgia Tech for a PhD in MSE.

Both programs are within the top-10, according to [this website](https://www.msesupplies.com/blogs/news/2021-best-materials-engineering-graduate-programs-ranking-by-u-s-news-2016-2021). They both have top-tier industry relations, research facilities with cutting-edge instruments/equipment, and national laboratory connections. Therefore, I could not go wrong with either option. The problem for me is that this decision is likely to influence where I will find my first career position (company and location), the time it may take to graduate, and the type of research I will be doing. 

I spoke with my main advisors of interest at both institutions via online meeting. At UCSB, I may have the option to be co-advised by both of my advisors of interest. While at GT, I have one advisor of interest. All of them were passionate about their project, provided a lot of information about where they are headed as a group, and informed me about the general graduate student information.

&amp;#x200B;

**General:**

Both groups are well funded and have published many articles in recent years. The Group at UCSB has more Grad and Post-docs whereas the group at GT has fewer (but more undergraduate students). UCSB MSE Department is a graduate-only program, I am not sure how should that influence my opinion. 

My current advisor at my university mentioned that the group at UCSB (being focused on fundamental research in quantum materials) may lead to an academic position or national lab. While the group at GT's focus on energy materials may lead to a position in the industry.

 

**Advising:**

The advisor at GT is very structured, and from anecdotal answers by his former students, he is committed to pushing his students and giving them projects that they can call their own early on. He is also committed to allowing his students to do internships and encourage them to at least do one as that should not negatively affect their research at all. 

At UCSB, one of the advisors is relatively new to the department, and his lab is still getting new equipment. He mentioned that the facility would soon be receiving Helium-3 cryogenic equipment that will help reduce temperature to below a kelvin. So that is actually pretty cool. The other advisor is well established and has a large group. With this opportunity to be co-advised, I should not have a problem with finding the one-on-one time or just connecting with the advisors.

All advisors stated that they are often in the lab, are easy to reach, and all encourage their students to have the creative freedom to approach their projects. Which is what I want in an advisor.

&amp;#x200B;

**Research:**

Now the biggest difference between the two institutes is the type of research I will be doing there. GT offers research relating to energy conversion/storage, focusing on thin-film catalysts or advanced characterization techniques for operando study of battery materials or any materials undergoing chemical reactions with elemental specificity. 

At GT, I will be researching thin-film catalysts and/or specializing in projects using advanced emission spectroscopy techniques that can do operando study with high element specificity. I see this technique as extremely useful in the development process of functional materials, easily providing me with a versatile skill that can benefit many companies in the industry.

At UCSB, I have the opportunity to research quantum materials while under co-advising. These projects will be related to synthesizing and characterizing materials. The Quantum Foundry at UCSB has a connection with at least 18 different companies at this time, and I can become a research associate by aligning my research with their projects' goals. I can also find an internship with any of these companies directly. (and hopefully, earn full-time employment post-graduation asap).

In brief, the research opportunities at both universities will provide the soft skills I need to be a versatile candidate in the industry. It seems that GT will provide a safe route toward earning a PhD and a path toward entering the industry. UCSB may provide more challenges (e.g., catching up on and strengthening my quantum mechanics and solid-state physics knowledge). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Career Prospect:**

From discussing with the advisors, most students from UCSB enter academia. However, with more companies investing in quantum materials and direct relations between the industry and UCSB's Quantum Foundry, I may not have to worry as much in terms of employment. I can also take my experiences involving the characterization and synthesis of bulk materials to other industrial fields. 

At GT, the advisor said that many students of his went on to find careers in the industry, and I have spoken with two of his former students who have done so. GT's industry relation is very strong, and at this time, I am more confident in finding an industry career post-graduation at GT than UCSB.

&amp;#x200B;

**General Living:**

With the NSF Fellowship, I would not have to work for the first three years at either institute. However, I can save more money (supposedly) at GT. I have been to Atlanta, and I like the big city life (more food varieties, places to go, people to see), but it is landlocked as heck. I know of Toccoa Falls outside of ATL, so at least there is that. 

At UCSB, I am on the beach. I turn around, and there is the mountain. I really like that aspect of it, even if it cost more overall just to exist there. I have not been on the West Coast, but I always have an ideal image in my head of perfect weather in Ca. Santa Babara is not as big of a city, and I imagine that I can find more quiet times there versus a busy city like ATL. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: UCSB or GT for Materials?"
mi4mo3,98,2021-04-01,To anyone dealing w/ Imposter Syndrome,samuelw28,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mi4mo3/to_anyone_dealing_w_imposter_syndrome/,"Colleges (especially top-tier colleges) don't admit by ""fluke."" Application files are read meticulously and carefully. Each file is read by at least two admission officers and then discussed again by the admission committee. Again, at these top schools, with a large influx of high-achieving applicants w/ identical resumes, they begin to sift through which applicant would be the best ""fit,"" or who they predict will succeed in their environment and bring prestige back into the school. After all, colleges see applicants as an investment.

I understand how you're feeling. With all these other amazing, high-achieving candidates, how can you compare? It's almost as if you cheated your way into the system, stealing a spot from someone much more deserving.

But again, I cannot say I don't feel the same way. Although my parents were extremely excited and all, they said a comment that I don't think I will ever forget--and it sucks, but it is what it is. My mom said that ""without the college counselor, you probably would've ended up at Davis."" And that honestly hurts. Obviously, Davis is a great school and I recognize that. But it makes me also feel like my acceptance to Cal wasn't a testament to my ability, but rather my counselor's. And that will definitely exacerbate my imposter syndrome as I enter my 4 years at Berkeley, but that's just how it is.

Regardless, colleges are known for **holistic** admissions--they grade applicants from a holistic point of view. Ultimately, you have to realize that with so many high-achieving applicants gunning for a limited # of spots, the distinction between applicants comes down to ""fit,"" as I mentioned earlier. From the moment the admission committee opens your admission file, a variety of factors that we are not aware of are considered, and I'm not referring to the traditional factors (GPA + test score + ECs), but rather factors subjective to their school and their interests. Think of it as a dating site, after 15 swipe-rights, your school eventually swiped right on you. Are the other swipe-lefts a testament to your ability to succeed? Do the other swipe-lefts undermine the validity of your school's swipe-right? No, they are all looking for someone that they see would fit their interests/desires. And fortunately, **the school you got into sees potential in you**. These top colleges do not waste spots on students they don't think will thrive and succeed at their school. From a business perspective, colleges do not want their students to drop out, as that would lower their overall graduation rate which would then lower funding and hurt their rankings, so they admit students they know will survive the academic rigor and thrive in the environment given.

And although corny, I truly believe that you are always where you are meant to be--and that all works out for a greater reason. In my last year of elementary school, when it came time to find a middle school to go to, I was dead-set on Sunnyvale Middle--my local school--where all my friends would go. But last-minute, another parent recommended my mom to enroll me at The King's Academy. And when I heard the news, my heart sunk--I had this conviction that I would lose touch w/ all my friends and go to a school where I wouldn't enjoy it. But now, as an HS senior graduating in a couple of months, I've realized how much I've benefitted from the King's environment.  Without King's, I might've lost touch with my Christian beliefs. Without King's, I might've never met a solid group of friends who I enjoy being around.  Ultimately, it's all about perspective. Although you might want to change your past--in this case being strengthening your overall admission profile for college admissions--I find it detrimental to sulk in a mindset of regret and rather view it as a fundamental chapter in your long, long, story.

Although you might say you should've worked harder for a higher GPA, or spent that extra amount of time to heighten your resume--you have to consider and recognize all the outstanding accomplishments you have achieved.

But obviously, imposter syndrome won't go away soon. It's a common feeling shared by thousands of college students at top schools around the country. But I think it becomes easier when you realize that so many other students truly do feel the same way. I definitely do, for one. Moreover, I think the majority of the regret I feel stems from my desire to prove to others, as well as myself, that I belong, that I deserved my acceptance. After getting rejected from Duke, my dream school, in the ED round, I became full of regret, along w/ an empty void of helplessness and misguided thoughts. *I shouldn't have fucked up my freshman year.* *I should've landed a prestigious internship*. *I should've done more research and had it published.* Although I think that the mindset that you can always achieve more proves beneficial and admirable, there must be an established balance where the ""what could've been"" doesn't undermine the ""what did happen."" There must be a balance where the thirst for greater accomplishments does not cloud the merit of achieved accomplishments.

In life, there's always going to be a longing for more--a mindset that nothing is enough. But it's when you decide to address your potential but also applaud your ability, that you progress w/ a firm resolve to combat this said imposter syndrome."

History Teacher (10/10) — def the reason I've found great success. advisor for club I founded &amp; v close with him. He told me he spent at least a month perfecting the LOR, &amp; I have gotten into every summer program/ scholarship that he submitted a LOR for. He described me as a human being and my personality.

Math Teacher (8/10 ) — has connections with top LACs &amp; T20s. I was her strongest student in both of her math courses. She highlighted how I was extremely well-rounded and qualified for liberal arts schools since I just love learning: everything from math to chem to English to social sciences. She demonstrated my intellectual curiosity.

Guidance Counselor (9/10) — make sure you form strong connections early on in your HS career! She always supported me with everything &amp; was very sweet. I asked her to write about my lower-income circumstances &amp; how I had to often take the late bus home if I wanted to participate in my ECs. She said she wrote how I spoke eloquently on topics pertaining to social issues &amp; how I often dropped what I was doing to help her &amp; others.

**Interviews**

Georgetown: This was my first interview; it went well! I went in expecting a conservative, but my very liberal stances seemed to entertain him. Said I was a very strong fit for the school.

Yale: This was my second interview; it went phenomenally!!! My interviewer and I connected despite being interested in completely opposite fields of academia. She showed me her write-up &amp; she described me as the most enthusiastic interviewee she had ever had. She also detailed how she went very tough on some questions, and I was able to respond eloquently and with confidence. TBH, I've loved Yale for so long that I was able to relate every question to how I would confront a similar issue at Yale, etc. She said I was a perfect fit for Yale, and we still communicate and catch-up! I guess I made a friend from the interview :)

Williams: They did not conduct interviews this year.

**Essays**

Disclaimer: I started &amp; finished my personal statement/ Yale supps 2 weeks before the deadline; don't do that!

Personally, I thought my personal statement was the worst thing I ever wrote, but everyone who read it loved it so idk. It was about growing up in an conservative, immigrant household and how it shaped me into an ardent advocate for human equality. Basically, I preached for humans to unify over their similarities/struggles rather than segregate themselves by their differences.

Yale Supps: I really liked some of them; I do wish they hadn't abbreviated the max length from last year tho. I delved into all sorts of topics: from chasing the Hispanic-American Dream to fighting for racial equality to being captivated by how each of our voices contains a unique power to my time supporting other LGBTQ+ members/allies.

Over the summer, I want to find some sort of job or internship mostly to make some money to spend, but I figure it would be beneficial to do something at least remotely related to my dream job and have that experience on my resume. 

I also realize that it’s extremely rare for people not in college, and even for some college freshman, to land high level internships, so I definitely am not expecting something at Jane Street or the like.

I was just wondering if y’all had any ideas on what would be some good opportunities/fields/positions I should look into? If it helps, I am experienced in competitive math, cs, and have two years of college courses taken at a state school as part of an early college program to earn my high school diploma.

Is it bad to apply multiple times?,Fun_Pomegranate_537,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/miasrp/cant_get_accepted_at_a_company_i_really_like_is/,"Hello. I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student and I am currently an intern. I'm going anonymous for obvious reasons.

So I've known a recruiter for 2-3 years now and I keep applying to their company (called X) as an intern. I get to see them every year at university recruitment events or events that they organize for their company. As you can tell, I'm interested in their firm and I've kept close connections with their employees.

In my first year of my degree, I applied to their company as a Software Developer Intern, but I did not think much of it. I knew that as a first-year student, my chances were minimal. 

Last year, I met the recruiter and others through one of the company's events and I managed to make some connections. Few months later, they asked me for an interview. It was a 30 minute talk with the recruiter, so basically getting to know me. After 2 months, I got an automated rejection email. Felt kinda sad, but I decided to move forward and keep improving.

Now it's winter 2021 and I've completed a similar internship position somewhere else. So early in January, I saw the recruiter again at a virtual talk, where they were recruiting interns and they saw me too. After the event, they encouraged me to apply again for intern positions and would let me know when new ones are announced.

Fast-forward two months later, and I get another rejection email without being called for an interview this time. Now as you see, it's been 3 times since I've been rejected as an intern and it may be obvious that I either lack the skill or I do not fit with the company's culture.

Makes me sad because I always wanted to work there. I have several friends who are interning for that company X...for the second, or even third time in a row!

What can I do at this point? Is it a bad idea to apply again for the fourth time, even for a full-time position? What are areas I need to work on? Should I ask the recruiter for feedback? Should I give up?

Long post, but I guess it's best to ask for advice, rather than stay silent."

For background, I am a recent cs graduate and am currently looking for work in software engineering. 

I focused largely on a single research project as an undergrad, and do not have any internships or major personal projects to speak of. This being the case, I am aware that I should be careful about my expectations as to what a reasonable job offering is and avoid having lofty expectations for my position. 

This comes into play currently, because I have recently received a job offer for a position that I am not necessarily enthusiastic about, but at the same time, I have nothing to compare it to, and I wanted to ask for advice from those who are more experienced in the field/industry on where my expectations should be. 

It is a consulting position, and having lurked for some time on this sub, I have seen many mixed responses to this. I would not necessarily mind the position, but I feel I would be better suited to a position more focused around SWE, and think that my career would benefit from such as well. I am concerned about going into consulting and getting funneled into roles that would take me further from software development.

I have made it through varying stages of interviews with other tech companies, but the consulting position is my first offer at the end. I feel that I am a decent programmer, and have a solid grasp on the various material from the curriculum, but again, my exposure is limited to just that. I would not consider myself a rockstar by any means either, but I am certain that I would be able to contribute substantially to a company in a software engineering role.

My main question is this: Would turning down this offer be greedy/arrogant of me given my position? 

I do not mean to overestimate my ""value"" to a company (nor would I want to underestimate it, of course), but at the same time, I wanted to know if I should continue looking for better opportunities or instead go with the bird in the hand. I would hate to turn the offer down, only for it to be one of the best available offers to someone in my position.

I am unsure of what I should be looking for out of an initial career. Obviously median/average salaries come into play, benefits, other forms of compensation, etc., but I have no frame of reference on what would be low or high ball offers besides the more accessible values like salary or time off. I understand that it is unlikely for there to be a perfect consensus regardless, but any information on what I should look for would be greatly appreciated.

All advice is welcome, and I can provide more information if necessary."
midpw1,1,2021-04-02,"I (M24) haven't gotten over my ex-girlfriend (F24). We broke up over 2 years ago, and we still talk. Thinking I should stop talking to her.",EmploymentLanky2906,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/midpw1/i_m24_havent_gotten_over_my_exgirlfriend_f24_we/,"**She was my first girlfriend**, we met first semester of college, and got along better than with anyone I've ever met. She is gorgeous, very kind, and we would just have the best time. We had a bit of a rough start, because she wasn't a virgin, and I was, and that really messed up my 17 year old head (I know it's a bit archaic, but I was raised that way). Anyway, we really clicked, we still do, I can ask her something direct and short, and without noticing 3 hours have passed and we're still talking. I always have a smile on my face when we text.

**She broke up with me at the end of 2018** because she wanted to focus on herself, we were doing our college internships in different countries, and I just wanted to be with her, but I couldn't leave the country I was in. **I thought that if we were together things would get fixed**, and we would be back to how it was. Fast forward 4 months, and I was able to get back to my home country for a weekend. We met up, and kissed, since we hadn't seen each other in about 9 months, but she made it clear that she didn't want to be back together. **Since the day we broke up I kept insisting to try to get back together**, since I was truly in love with her, but to no avail.

2 months later, I was back for good at my home country. For the past 6 months my mental state was not the best. I'm a pretty positive and humorous person, but since we had broken up I felt like I was in a hole, always sad thinking about her, feeling powerless as I couldn't really do anything. She had been back in college and single for a whole semester while I was away, and it was gut wrenching for me seeing her instagram stories partying and living life while I just wanted to die.

I talked with her, and **we started seeing each other again**, but nothing romantic happened, not even a kiss. We went out for about two months, and I often tried to kiss her or be intimate, but she always denied me. She kept telling me that if we were going back together, I had to ""earn her back"", but I honestly feel I did everything I could. After those 2 months she had a 1 month trip planned out to go to Europe, she was meeting up with a male exchange student she met while I was abroad, and there's a good chance they were hooking up (The less I know the better...). After she came back (End of 2019), we went out a couple more times, but still no progress, so I decided to stop talking with her because I was just hurting myself. I erased her from all social media, and **tried to get away from her.** I was pretty heartbroken. She reached out on my birthday, and when I graduated, but it was short and direct.

At the **beginning of 2020**, I thought I'd take a long trip, a 2 month South American backpacking trip. I had just graduated, and the trip would help me clear my mind. One month later in Peru, Corona hit, and my trip was cut short a month. I had a pretty good time, **but I still kept thinking about my ex**. **We didn't talk much for the better part of 2020**, I wished her a happy birthday, and she reacted to some of my posts from social media, but nothing much. I still kept thinking about her. **Until September 2020,** when some mutual friends planned a short local road trip, and me and my ex were invited. I was kinda iffy about going to the trip, but my friends convinced me. We had a great time, and I was able to catch up with her. After that road trip, we planned another one 2 months later. Same deal, we had a pretty good time. We have kept in touch after those road trips, and constantly text each other ever since.

**All throughout these past 2 years I've been trying to see someone new.** I opened bumble and tinder, but everyone I match with I just find boring, and I'm not invested in any conversation (And I consider myself to be a pretty bad texter). About 2 months ago she found me on Bumble, and sent me a screenshot of my profile, telling me jokingly ""I think I know this guy, his face seems familiar, great music taste 10/10 &lt;3"". I felt horrible since **now I knew she was looking for something romantic with someone.** And got me thinking if I should ask her out. Around the same time, I matched with new girl. We texted for a while and decided to got out. She was girlfriend material, we had a great time together and started seeing each other, but I didn't feel the same level of attraction that I felt with my ex. We just didn't click as much. When we had sex, I found it difficult to ejaculate. I would get hard, but I could last 2 hours of penetration before I forced myself to ejaculate. One big plus about this new girl however, is that we were able to talk about sex nonchalantly, and I wouldn't mind it. **With my ex, even thinking of her being sexually with other people messes me up**. Anyways, after a month of going out with this new girl, we decided to end things because we had different goals (She was thinking about something serious, and me not so much). It was a great experience which helped me relax and get distracted for a bit, and she was a great girl.

**And now here we are.** I'm typing this from my room, not knowing if I have explained myself well enough, and **in a big dilemma**. Knowing my ex is in a dating app, **should I reach out to her and try one more time?** (It would be a big kick in the ego once again, since for all this time my self esteem, and ego have been on the floor) **Or should I get away from her to prevent myself from getting hurt?** (Talking to her just reminds me of the great person she is, and how I haven't met anyone that matches her). This situation has affected my self esteem greatly, I think it changed my personality a bit and it still messes with my head. Being denied so many times is not easy, and sometimes I feel I shouldn't keep doing this to myself, but I have my doubts. I constantly go to a therapist, and she has helped me, but I'm embarrassed to admit I'm still in this situation. I have a great job, I consider myself to be a pretty decent person, and my other relationships are solid, but this has me a bit f'd up. Any help or advise would be greatly appreciated. Ty"

Now I've got two options either find myself a job or go to Hyderabad. Now the research intern sounds very lucrative as every PCM student want a stamp of IIT/IIIT/NIT in their life. Also there is a possiblity they might provide me admission in MS based on my performance.

But my question is like let's take a worst case, I return back to Delhi after a year, will I count as a fresher again or it will be a year of experience and even if I have a year of experience, would it be easy to get a job once I get back? 

Is it really worth to go there or find myself a job in Delhi NCR in my domain?"

I'm a 35 year old woman, about graduate with an eng/cs degree. I've secured a graduate role in a top tech company after having done an internship there previously. I'm applying for other graduate programs as well, as the tech company is not my preferred choice although the salary is very good and it is probably wise to take it. 

As a career changer, I'm very conscious of the fact that I have less time to develop a successful career. Coming from a completely different background, I feel that I have to work so much harder to catch up on the years I wasted in my former (unrelated) career.

What can do to accelerate my career and make up for lost time? I have no kids or family, so I'm happy to work 80-100 hours a week. I'm happy to work 24/7, travel anywhere and never take leave if it will benefit my career. I've also put in an application to do my masters in the evenings online (although people say a masters makes little difference). My ultimate goal is to start as an engineer, and work up to CTO, executive partner or even higher,  and do so as quickly as I can. It is not the money, it is thought of being successful that drives to be so ambitious. I don't want anything else in life.

For people in the industry, what can I do given that I am starting my career so late? What can I do to better my career given that I won't start the graduate program until Jan next year? Is it too late for me to achieve any of these goals? Thanks"

mihgxm,1,2021-04-02,"Debating studying for the LSAT vs. continuing my study in the arts, any help with deciding?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mihgxm/debating_studying_for_the_lsat_vs_continuing_my/," I will have a degree in Photography &amp; Imaging from a pretty highly regarded school and am getting a minor in poly sci. I have done a few photo jobs and internships but the industry got hit pretty heavy from covid, so I don't have anything this semester. I am currently learning 3D modeling in one of my classes, and absolutely love it. But this skill will take another few years at least before I can get a job. Therefore, I was looking at graduate programs for Art and technology, where I would be able to learn the mechanisms behind 3D (computer science), and be able to continue making art. I could definitely see myself doing 3D as a career, but I would need to dedicate yeats before I can get a fulltime job and I'd get treated poorly unless I freelance. I am leaning towards this path more than law because it seems to be a reasonable and understandable transition. But the pay and uncertainty kind of fills me with anxiety and I'm not even an independent yet. The pay and work is pretty tough, but nonetheless still better than photography.

Another path I've been considering is law. I don't have any experience in this field, but I took a class on constitutional law and loved it. I got almost a 100% in the class and the exams composed of setting up arguments for the questions and backing it with precedents/cases. I can't see myself practicing it, because I haven't talked to any lawyers. But I do think I'm pretty good at logic and contextual analysis. Regardless, I am seriously considering dedicating 8-12 months studying for the lsat. I think the pros of this is the pay, and a more secure job market compared to the arts. Law is also something I enjoy, and I would get a sense of fulfillment helping people navigate the rules. I think the only downside is if I find out I hate it, I'm stuck with it. And I would have to take the lsat/apply for law school and I might not get in anywhere because I suck at standardized tests. For reference, I got about 1900 on the SAT after taking bootcamps. But the first time I took the SAT i bombed it. So I'm kind of doubting my ability to succeed in it. I think this path makes sense from a financially stable perspective because I'd be able to continue my art as a hobby while in school and do 3 things I like vs. 2. But I really don't know if I can do it because no one I know is going down this path.

I know I am ultimately the one who chooses my career path, but I'm in kind of in an inbetween two roads situation and don't know which path to take. I was hoping maybe some of you could give suggestions on which path I should take. Thanks!"

When I started with computers in the late 90s, there was a whole different community feeling to everything and there could be 1000s comments discussion about some Linux kernel issue or why MS was a bad company. It was that computers were made by engineers for engineers and studied by engineers.

 It seems like the field is now quite similar to what the economists who wanted to join accounting and banks behaved like in the 2000s, probably because the capital inflow  


Now with LinkedIn and social media there is everything from ""incoming interns"" with 100s of likes and no critical thought because people have their real id as their profile and it also seems like a lot jobs ""place"" you in a team, and persons don't really care about what they do as long as it's at some for now trendy company.

Somehow I can't just identify with this that almost everything needs to be some career move and people (esp in USA) are so into this whole FIRE/muh only chance for middle class(which by the way has very little do do with money in Europe :P)  chance narrative.   


  
and yes I exaggerate to make a point a bit but the feeling is still there

What do you say,  do you also feel a bit left out of the industry culture or am I just get older and a bit more cynical?"

I also recently got a full time offer after the internship, and I was wondering if it would be a good idea to work at both for the duration of the bootcamp, since both are remote and the bootcamp touches only the basics of web dev (HTML/CSS/JS), which I am already pretty comfortable with. Then, after the 6 months were over, I would quit the mid size company and work at the larger one full time.

Would this eventually show up on future background checks?

About to graduate with a CS Master's.,iokast,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mikrtu/am_i_expecting_too_much_about_to_graduate_with_a/,"I am about to graduate with a CS Master's in May specializing in machine learning. This is a career change - I have been working the past 5+ years as a Project Manager in manufacturing currently making $100k.

The Master's program is at a well known and respected school where I have been busting my butt to maintain a 4.0 GPA. I am specializing in machine learning and have also TA'ed for a few ML classes. I am also working a data analyst side-hustle.

I have been applying and interviewing since September of last year. I have submitted over 200 apps since then. I got off to a rocky start acclimating to interviewing but have got some traction recently and have 4 offers on the table. They are:

* DOD - Software Engineer - $80k
* Controls and automation firm - Lead Software Engineer - $95k
* Telecom Infrastructure - Technical Sale Lead - $85k + commission
* Big-4 Accounting - Data Scientist - $83k

Truthfully, I am disappointed with the salary for each of them. The most appealing offer is the Big-4 Data Scientist role but the salary seems very low especially since it is in a mid-high COL area.

Am I expecting too much in terms of salary? I feel like with my background I should be able to land offers at $100k+. I often see fresh bachelor grads on here and in my personal life landing $100k+ gigs. Meanwhile I have 5+ years of work experience plus a Master's with a perfect academic record and I'm just not getting there. 

I have had very little traction with big tech companies. I rarely get any response. When I do hear back I rarely get past the online assessments even though I complete them with optimal or close to optimal solutions. My one thought is I am disadvantaged because I don't have internship experience. This is because I have been working full time in my PM job which I feel should be just as valuable experience-wise. I have also been trying to round out my resume with TA experience and my side hustle.

I just feel very discouraged. It feels like between friends and the folks on this sub, awesome high-paying jobs are being thrown around like candy and I'm being left out in the dust for reasons I don't understand. Any advice is appreciated."

I intend to study mechanical engineering, so I would like to know what current students think about this program and the College in general (and I suppose also experiences with the University).

From what I have found, it seems that it is a good degree program. Would anyone tell me of the quality of the program, how good the education is, how prepared you feel to enter the workforce (compared to graduates from other universities), the quality of the professors (am I wrong in saying that there are some good and some bad? If so, what is the ratio between the two?), etc.

Also, what do you think is bad about the program or College? What are the shortcomings of studying at UF? What do you think could be done better or what changes would you implement? Do you think that the cons outweigh the pros?

Finally, what was your experience as a student here? Are you happy with your choice? How much do you study for engineering? How packed is your schedule (can you take courses outside of the degree requirements? do you have the time to do so)? What research can you do for mechanical engineering (I think I saw that only 20% of undergraduates studying mechanical engineering do research: Why do you think this is so?)? How about internships - were they easy to get? What student organizations have you joined (engineering-related and non)? What is Gainesville and the surrounding area like for a student (both academic and job opportunities but also fun things to do, hanging out, etc)?

I know that I'm asking lots of questions, so don't answer them all if you can't or don't have the time! Thank you in advance for your answers and time; they will be of great help."

Not denying that at the entry level(and for average skill level) the pay is better here. I’d be paid barely INR 25000 in india for my intern level work that I do here.

But I think the pay at senior level in India is much better. I keep reading stories of people who started at 25000 and then went on company and position hopping and now making 24lpa+. Also heard that it’s easy to earn that amount (or even higher) for any above average experience software engineer? Is it true? 

Though I make decent money as an intern, there isn’t much of a pay increase as in India or California and as a full time employee, a big chunk will go in taxes(30%) and paying apartment rent( which is often half of my salary). Meanwhile 24lpa in India would put me a totally different league considering the cheap food and housing, low taxes."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor rec- i've never talked w them about anything except class scheduling so... ? she thought I was outgoing in our 10 min LOR interview though which surprised me bc im a quiet person in general. she picked up that i didn't like my school's ""bubble"" &amp; idk how she interpreted that in her rec.

Teacher recs- 10th gr history teacher + 11th gr science teacher. Honestly no clue, probably not the strongest they wrote since I wasn't super close w either. Did really well in both their classes, but was rly quiet in one's and too talkative in the other's lol so idk. (For Georgetown &amp; rice, asked a teacher who taught me all 4 yrs...got interesting results at those as you'll see so hmmm /j)

**Interviews**

Harvey Mudd- i think it was ok, conversation went in direction of policy ECs way more than STEM tho

Georgetown- lowkey worrying... gave me kind of condescending vibes? also they gave a solid 7 minute rant about govt waste and told me to relay it to my boss. (&amp; then my boss told me to report them lol but no) ig i could've had an interesting convo with them abt it but i was thinking that i had to stay positive atm

Rice(student)/NU/Tufts- average. rly nice interviewers! almost too nice, whenever i tried to tell a story of growth to ramp up to an accomplishment they'd interject like ""it's ok!"" so i didn't always get to finish it. Tufts interviewer didn't ask questions so it kinda dragged...

**Essays**

Main essay: about my gripes w/the theoretical nature &amp; hypocrisy that can be in speech&amp;debate and taking tangible action instead, centered around 2 advocacy ECs not listed in main list... i think i got the message across but it was lacking in execution &amp; writing

UIUC: diff from all the others (as in: bad). I opened with something like ""as i write this, i am waiting for more voters to arrive at the precinct"" bc it was not very busy on election day where i was lol.

USC: too one-note in retrospect, talked about loving their interdisciplinary aspects but failed to show that :/  i used the 2nd choice Dornsife supp to write about policy interests to help my 1st choice Price School app, idk if theyre read together tho... (edit: nvm ig it worked out?)

Tufts &amp; Rice: these apps were due first &amp; i rly liked my supps at the time, but just reread them and WOW they were the worst

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* EA: UIUC (10k merit aid), ASU (14kaid, NMF if i switch it to 1st choice), Depaul (26kaid)
* American U w/25k (rejected from their special programs)
* GWU w/19k
* Case Western w/24k
* WashU for neuroscience (didn't submit optional video)
* Northwestern SESP
* USC w/NMF scholarship

*Waitlists:* (bye bye LACs &lt;/3)

* UChicago
* Harvey Mudd (did their fly-in program, but didn't have a ton of STEM in application so not surprised at result)
* Claremont Mckenna (did submit video)
* Pomona (somehow none of the ""optional"" supps went through :0 so not surprised. apart from that i demonstrated a ton of interest in the claremonts though so this hurt :( )

*Rejection:*

* Georgetown (very expected, i procrastinated these essays and they were awful but they make u pay up front so i submitted anyway)
* Rice
* Tufts

*Waiting:*

* Yale

**Additional Information:**

I sent an update to all schools (except HMC) in early March to share lobbying progress, a new soc med management EC, &amp; speech nats qual.

Advice- *Use fee waivers*! I only applied to as many schools as I did bc I received fee waivers for \~1/2 of them. Afaik, applying months early doesn't give you an edge over applying a couple weeks before the deadline, so wait a bit and see if schools email waivers! Some will send you them unprompted or if you're applying for finaid (like Rice, UChicago, WashU, American, CWRU, Swarthmore, Grinnell, Depaul). Also apply to fly-ins! This makes you get started on writing essays earlier, helps you gauge how good they are, and also gives you fee waivers just for applying (Tufts) or if accepted (HMC).

Also a lot of my application showed how i took initiative to find (free) stuff- r/ECadvice and r/SuccessBaseMass are helpful places to start. If you go to some colleges' sample Zoom classes, sometimes profs will let you audit their whole class for free. all this to say, if you're looking for ECs and can only find pricey programs, dw there's sm more out there!"
minuu9,3,2021-04-02,Am I out of line for being upset with how my boss handled covid?,heybananaguy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/minuu9/am_i_out_of_line_for_being_upset_with_how_my_boss/,"I   was hired along with two others in February 2020 with a very small   company. 9-15 people, approximately. We are in the software development   space for the entertainment industry. For the past three years, I  worked  excruciatingly long hours for no money in ""internship""  positions, so to  be offered something stable was a breath of fresh air.

Anyways,   we were shellacked by COVID. We were all furloughed in April and did   not re-open until July. Come July, I was the only one of the three hires   asked to come back. It was in a part-time capacity and I'd work under   two of the more senior members, who were obviously brought back FT  given  their status in the company. But, my boss always complimented me.  Said I  was the only one considered to return given the financial  situation and  down the line we'd talk ""real"" full-time work after this  all concluded  (I am blatantly misclassified as an independent  contractor). So, given  the circumstances, I bit the bullet, came back,  and made maybe 20K  before taxes on the year.

Scheduled   changed frequently. This wasn't a great employer clearly, but they  were  at least kind and in a field I cared about. But, some weeks they'd  ask  me for 20 hours, 40, sometimes I lost significant hours on a day's   warning, etc. But, I did whatever they asked with minimal training.  Then at  the end of October, I expect to work one more week on a PT  schedule for about $1200. However,  my boss calls me and said if I work  that final week that he can't pay it to me due to some legal issues, but  can reimburse me in  April. He said I can work for that $1200 and be  paid it later, or just not work. So, I opted for the latter just because  it wasn't worth it. So again, obviously not great. And then I was  furloughed again.

In  October,  when I was furloughed, my boss told me we'd talk soon about  full-time  and all that, yada yada yada. It's April 1st and no word. I'm  on the  company Slack and see all the more senior members are active  again. I  saw some news stories about my boss giving away some very  expensive  hardware to clients for free for good word of mouth and  relationship  building. The units are probably 60K plus and clients  usually ordered  several of them. But here I am, 7 months or so and no  word, no  check-in, etc. while I see things relatively back to normal. I also just  saw on our Slack channel that we picked up two major clients in the  past two months.

I  know they  don't owe me anything. And I know where I am on the totem  pole and why  he diverts attention to more senior staffers. But, he knows  how hard  things have been for me financially. He knows I had to live  out of my  car for a few weeks during the first furlough, he sees me  posting on  LinkedIn actively trying to find work, etc. He's a good guy  and a smart  guy technologically, but seems to just have no ""feel"" I  guess.  Like...he can give away these massive units of tech but can't offer me  one last pay period we previously agreed upon that would only add up to a  measly $1200 which would have gone to my rent and food. I don't know. I  opted out of course, but he says he wouldn't have been able to pay me  that, but he's giving away millions of dollars worth of equipment.

Again,   I'm aware this was a shitty employer to begin with. Tried to stick  with  it to ""live the dream"" and such and such. And I know they owe me   nothing and the world is cruel, etc etc. But, am I wrong to be very   upset with him? It's just such a small company and he knows a lot of   what I'm dealing with. Not even having the decency to say hi or check in   around the holidays....I don't know, stuck with me.

I’m a final year undergrad from the Indian Institute of Technology. I have received acceptance to the MS in Computational Science and Engg program at both GaTech and ETH Zurich, and have been incredibly confused as to what to choose. These are the pros and cons of both universities I garnered after having talked to many people from both the universities.

**ETH**

**Pros:**

i) Courses provide a very strong theoretical foundation that will help me get research positions in companies or a Ph.D. there itself or top schools elsewhere.

ii) The maximum duration for MSc is 6 semesters. Also, one can take off up to a maximum of 2 semesters. And part-time internship during the semester is allowed. So, that gives some flexibility.

iii) Practically tuition-free (although living in Zurich is very expensive)

**Cons:**

i) Very difficult school in terms of courses, and exams are stressful. They take place before the start of the next sem during so-called sessions, so internships can’t be done during the vacations. The only way to do a full-fledged internship is to take a sem off which is usually the norm there.

ii) Not a great alumni network as compared to GaTech.

**GaTech**

**Pros:**

i) Highly reputed CS/CSE department in the US.  Large faculty network who have completed PhDs in top American schools.

ii) Wide-ranging list of electives to opt from. And interesting exam structure (continuous evaluation as opposed to one final exam like in ETH)

iii) Atlanta, emerging as the next software hub in the US provides more opportunities.

iv) Better social life, more Indian population which will make things a bit easier.

**Cons:**

i) High tuition fees (\~70000 USD or \~50L INR for 2 years)

ii) Might be difficult to get RA funding. The possibility that coming out of Georgia Tech may lead to lower chances of getting admitted to top Ph.D. programs than ETH.

iii) Atlanta can get unsafe at times (but not a big factor I guess).

Also, I understand that the QS ranking is something that's not very reflective of good a school is and is based on all the departments whereas we should choose schools based on how good the department we are going to is. But does ETH being the top 10 alongside MIT, Caltech, and Stanford add any value?"

I’ve been living in the US almost my entire life, however, because I was born outside of the country and moved afterwards I’m not a citizen and still on the waitlist for a Green Card (the country I’m from has an extraordinarily large queue). I found out that even though I lived in the US, I would still be considered an international by out-of-state colleges, and considering that I requested financial aid with my stats as an international I wasn’t expecting much overall from decisions, even from my OOS safeties/targets. I’m not saying that my status is the _only_ reason for my rejections but it could be a significant one. I hope I got the template right lol.

South/Central Asian from the MidWest.

(Idk what exact flair to use sorry 😅)

Demographics:

Gender: Male
Race: Asian
Residence: Medium-sized Ohio town near big city
Income bracket: $70-80k-ish
Type of School: Very competitive public school, big in STEM 
Hooks: None at all LMAO

Intended Major(s): Undecided, but with an interest in the Humanities/Social Sciences.

Academics:

(I got sick with Crohn’s Disease in my early high school years, and the time I spent away from school with appointments, operations, and surgeries screwed over my work ethic &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; grades for my freshman, sophomore, and even junior year. I managed to recover and get almost straight As my senior year but it still took a heavy toll on my GPA).

GPA: 3.4 UW (School doesn’t count weighted) 
10 APs and almost all honors classes
5 APs senior year
Class rank: School does not give class rank

Test Scores:

***ACT: 30 (only took once before COVID, every rescheduling I made afterwards got cancelled, I went test optional for reaches). 

ECs/Honors: (I was generally aimless in HS because of my circumstances, I was somewhat interested in tech first but I slowly veered towards social science in my later career, still kinda aimless though).

Extracurriculars/Activites:

1. Campaigner/outreach coordinator for a local tax levy campaign that would help my local school keep its funding. Helped to canvass/make promotional material, campaign was successful.
2. Social Media Intern serving under the wing of my local representative. Worked on advertisements and helping to speed the word on elections, uses and campaigns. Really fun role, I spent a good chunk of my free time working for it.
3. Invited to join virtual conference of student activists, campaigners &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; organizers for a local political event.
4. Helped my parents set up their own self-owned business (a dream they had for years), worked tirelessly with them after school to keep it afloat. Hard work but very satisfying.
5. Treasurer for my school’s honor society, helped to set up fundraisers and charity events while also managing finances. Awesome role that was cut short by corona, don’t regret it.
6. Co-founder and marketing director of a tech event that took place in the big city near me (was when I was still interested in tech). 
7. Co-founder &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; sponsorship &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; outreach director of another local tech event that took place in a nearby school, worked with the son of Elon Musk on it (also when I was still interested in tech).

Awards: 

1. 4th Place in State Stock-Pitch Competition 
2. AP Scholar with Distinction

That’s about it LMAO.

Letters of Rec:

Spanish Teacher, 10/10: Had him for 2 years, one of the best teachers I’ve ever had. Had a rough start with him but bonded really well over the years. 

AP Government Teacher, 9/10: Had her my Junior year, super supportive and really nice. She genuinely cared about what she was teaching and her students.

AP Lang Teacher, 8/10: Tough as nails, blunt, and super intimidating to people meeting her for the first-time but she’s pretty friendly and understanding once you get to know her. 

Essays:

For my personal statement I used the “realization that you had” prompt: 

I talked about a dream I had where I was the first human on Mars looking at a blue Martian sunset and how that single dream ultimately changed my perception of the future for humanity, and how it outlined my goals to be a part of that future in someway, no matter how small or large. I’m really proud of that essay.

Supplements were of course cheesy, I talked about how I helped my parents overcome the struggles they had with starting their business, and how I had to overcome my struggles with Crohn’s.

Interviews: (I was surprised that I got interviews if I’m being honest).

Harvard, 9/10: Interviewer was super nice, we cracked a lot of jokes with each other and talked a lot about the college and what interests me, although since it was my first interview I was kinda nervous lol.

Princeton, 10000/10: Started off with my shitty ass 2010 laptop camera breaking, so only my Zoom pfp was visible to my interviewer and it was the CHICK-FIL-A LOGO. I was ready to die of embarrassment right there but he didn’t mind it at all and even joked about it, I had a good laugh with him before starting and he was super nice throughout it &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; interested in what I liked/had to say. 

Cornell, meh/10: This wasn’t an interview but more so a “discussion of the undergrad experience at Cornell” that didn’t affect my app. I still joined cause I was interested, the interviewer was super chill but seemed unenthusiastic &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; bored, like she was forced to do it. 

Decisions: 

Acceptances:

	⁃	The University of Cincinnati (Most likely going here, I loved this college when I visited it so I have no regrets).
	⁃	University of California, Davis (this actually surprised me a lot and I’m really happy that I got in, although they gave me no financial aid for their 65k a year 🥲)

Waitlists/Deferrals:

	⁃	Harvard EA (This surprised me again, even though 80% of people got deferred I thought I would get rejected lol)
	⁃	University of California, Irvine

Rejections (the moment you’ve been waiting for):

	⁃	University of California, Berkeley
	⁃	University of California, Los Angeles
	⁃	University of Chicago
	⁃	Northwestern University 
	⁃	University of Virginia
	⁃	The George Washington University
	⁃	Boston University 
	⁃	University of Southern California 
	⁃	University of Connecticut 
	⁃	University of California, Santa Barbara 
	⁃	Syracuse University 
	⁃	Indiana University, Bloomington
	⁃	Purdue University 
	⁃	Vanderbilt University 
	⁃	New York University, Gallatin

Currently awaiting:

- ~~Harvard~~ ❌
- ~~Yale~~ ❌
- ~~Princeton~~ ❌
- ~~Columbia~~ ❌
- ~~UPenn~~ ❌
- ~~HowardU~~ ❌

I don’t expect much left and I’m fine with that. If I get at least a waitlist from one of the remaining schools I’ll be a happy man. Worst comes to worst I’m thinking of possibly shooting my shot again with transferring if I get my Green Card in college, but you know how unpredictable immigration in the US is lol, if a GC is a no-go then I’m happy with staying in UC too.

——————

EDIT after Ivy Day: I got rejected from all my remaining colleges LMAO. Ahhh I kinda expected that cause of my status but y’know, it’s life."
miufio,2,2021-04-02,Worried About My Safety And Mental Health From My Job (FastFood),WOWTHATSAWESOMEEPIC,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/miufio/worried_about_my_safety_and_mental_health_from_my/,"Posting this on my throwaway account just for safety

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so Ive been working this job for about 6 months and its my first job ever. I started last august of 2020 and have been working since. Since working ive seen alot of saftey issues and no care for covid ect... I deal with really bad anxiety and have social troubles so thats why I havent really said anything or done anything. Anyway I'll just list off my worries in bullet points. (Also to add I do closing at this fast food restruant)

&amp;#x200B;

1. For last 2-3 months the people I usually do closing with will not wear there mask unless the boss is there. When the boss leaves they will fully take their mask off or have it under their chin. Usually its for last 2-3 hours before closing when the boss leaves. So I work drive through and the 2 other people both do cooking except for 1 who also can work drive through (Its always just 2 me and someone else when closing) Anyway both dont wear mask when making the food. Also dont wash their hands unless there coming from the bathroom or their hands are wet. Also the one guy who also knows how to work drive though will work drive through with no mask and do the same thing of making food with no mask. (Also all the cooks that work at our store dont wear gloves when making food)

2. I feel like my boss tries to take advantage of me cause she knows I know how to work every station and always work hard. I usually only work 4 days a week but I would say atleast 1 time a week on my day off she will ask if I can come in. I use to say yes but recently I've just been lying saying im busy so I can enjoy my day off since I am already so mentally stressed. I also recently brought up of me going to 2-3 days a week before june as im starting college and want to focus on my majors ect... which she didnt seem happy about and shes been asking me questions about it I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

3. One of the guys I work with I hate. He came in about 4 months ago but worked morning at the time. Then about 2 months ago he go switched to night shift and since then its been a nightmare to work with him. Hes one of the 2 people that I talked about who doesn't wear his mask ect... He also lazy and I have to make up for his work. Most times when we get a car and its just the 2 of use for closing he will have me do all the work well he sits on his phone. Ive had times where we've had like 3-4 cars and I have to handle everything by myself even though he has a headset on and can hear me take all the orders and thanks to this our times always go to like 10-15min sometimes even close to 20min a order just cause he wont help and im only 1 person. He's also really mean. I think in his head he wants to think its a joke but there have been times where he yells infront of the customers at me saying ""COME ON PICK UP THE PACE'' ect... He also recently been talking about the way I work drive through. He tells me I need to use my man voice and stop using my pussy voice. He says this because I usually talk very montonish and I have a kinda nasily voice. Theres alot of other stuff I can also rant about him but I think sets a stage of what kind of person he is

&amp;#x200B;

   4. Ive been worried for last month that some of my works might have covid. First off this week both of the people who doing closing with me have gotten sick. Monday the guy who I dont like called in and went to the doctors and has something wrong with his throat or something idk the full details, and the other person who works night shift called in sick and I think she was going to the doctors also from what my boss told me. Anyway like I said most of my co-workers dont wear mask and I usually the only one who does. Also some of they have been coughing and now with the 2 people both sick at the same time im a little worried. I actually got a covid test last year in november when I was working and tested negative but I think I might need to get another one cause Im worried since my job takes no steps to protect us and seems like its a covid party ast my job. Also like 95% of customers dont wear there mask also so it could easily be transferred in ect...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway thats my rant/worries. I prob have alot more but those seem to be my main ones off the top of my head. No TLDR for this but please give me some ideas on what to do. I do have a good amount of money saved up so im thinking of looking for another job maybe at bestbuy or something since I have experience on my resume thanks to internships I took during highschool"

miwbam,6,2021-04-02,My Unsettlingly Successful College Admissions. Why I think I got into one of my top choices.,Evrenarif1218,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/miwbam/my_unsettlingly_successful_college_admissions_why/,"Stats:

\- 3.91GPA UW (9 AP courses. 10 if you count Physic C as 2 AP courses due to there being 2 tests.)

\- No SAT/ACT.

\- one 4 and five 5s on the 6 AP tests I have taken. 

\- South Asian (USA native-born).

I'd like to discuss something that I found slightly unsettling about my college admissions that may help some other people. I applied to 17 universities during the Regular Decision round, save the ones that release on Ivy day (and the EDI and EDII of course), and was accepted to 4 of them. 3 safeties, 0 targets, and 1 reach — for the sake of privacy I'll call it ""University X"".

According to my school's Naviance graph, the Average GPA for ""University X"" is 3.85 UW and the SAT average is 1506.21. More than that, a few of my friends who I believe were better qualified for admissions (while likely being out of the range of yield protection) were all denied.

""University X"" had about a 37% increase in admission, making their overall acceptance rate this year around 10.9% (assuming they are accepting the same number of people as previous years). Considering that quarantine cut junior year in half and our school giving a grade boost that increased its students' GPA by around 0.01 to 0.09, there were plenty of other applicants that had a 4.0 or above. In addition to that, there were plenty of people who applied to ""University X"" with ECs such as Math competitions, internships, or in-depth research work, while I only really had 2 main ECs — YYGS and a ""University X"" specific research program.

So what about this do I find unsettling? The focus I put into ""University X"" in my college application as a whole is why I believe I was accepted. For reference, the research I conducted in ""University X"" was based around the circadian rhythm of a certain breed of moths (I enjoyed this immensely). This became such an important part of college applications, that it worked its way into my common app essay. While a large amount of the focus I put into ""University X"" in my Essay and ECs was intentional (I really like the school), I feel that the main reason they accepted me was because of that, as opposed to the actual quality of my Essay. Stats, and ECs.

The point I'm trying to make here is that, from my experience at least, college decisions are highly dependent on the interest you show through programs you partake in, and how much you ""talk"" about a college throughout your application.

While that all might be rather obvious, there is a huge problem with this — location and cost. Many people, myself included, have some schools outside of their state as their top choices, and living outside of that state limits the possible interaction one can have with certain colleges. Had I lived in the middle of Montana with a similar education and stats, it would be unlikely that my application to ""University X"" would have worked out for me. Traveling across a country just for the chance to participate in a research program that itself costs money would, in most cases, be too much for an average middle-class American family to care about. Not only is it inconvenient, but similar programs of equal quality may be nearer by and more affordable. The only problem with them is that they are NOT ""University X"" (or any other top choice university you might imagine). Assuming the program you participate in isn't of the same caliber as RSI or something similar, it matters less about what you did in comparison as to where you did it.

That being said, I am very happy with my ""University X"" decision, but I feel like there is a quality of unfairness when it comes to the cost that one has to pay to maximize demonstrated interest in colleges, and the factor of location becomes a large issue when you want to attend universities in other states. I know this is nothing new, but it's something I felt I had to talk about.

Hopefully, I'll see some of y'all at ""University X"" in the upcoming year.

Good luck with Ivy day!

I have a 2 year diploma in software development right now and want to earn a degree in computer science. I don't have any developer work experience but I do have some projects.

I'm single right now and just want to focus on my career and personal growth.

I don't want to do cs just for a job, but to become a better programmer/engineer too. I want to understand the underlying math and theory of computation. I want to be able to design and program complex and useful software. I also think a degree will help me in the long run compared to self learning.

My question is, do you think it's worth it as this point? I know there are 21 year-olds graduating computer science and starting as jr devs. I'll be 27 by the time I start even an internship or a full time position after graduation. I fear being too old for the market or being looked down on for my age.

I keep being rejected for jobs in the field of mental health when I mention during interviews that I (obviously!) cannot drive a car to transport clients when needed.,TwinPurpleEagle,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/mixesw/im_legally_blind_i_keep_being_rejected_for_jobs/,"I'm currently a college student in my junior year majoring in psychology with plans to attend graduate school to become a therapist. I live in California.

I'm legally blind so I am unable to drive a car. I am completely blind in my left eye and have 20/200 vision in my right. It's blatantly obvious because I wear glasses with one centimeter thick prism-like concave lenses. Especially here in southern California where public transportation is nonexistent, not being able to drive makes it nearly impossible to be independent.

I'm trying my best to look for internships or part time jobs where I could work directly with clients struggling with mental health issues. I decided to apply to mental health treatment programs near me (inpatient care, residential treatment facilities, day treatment programs, etc) for direct care staff/mental health technician floor staff positions. I have chosen treatment facilities where clients stay in one place all day long so it's doable for my limitations (i.e, no home based therapy or field based work driving from client to client, so ABA therapy is out of the question - believe me, I've already tried). Every place I have applied to – requires a driver's license to transport clients to medical appointments, community outings, etc.

I've managed to land about 7-8 interviews throughout the past month, so I think my resume is pretty good for a college student with limited experience. I do not mention that I am legally blind or anything of that nature on my resume.

However, in every single one of these interviews, things go great until I mention ""I'm legally blind so I am unable to drive a car. I do have reliable transportation (paratransit/Uber) to get to work on time and I do not require any additional accommodations otherwise. I just cannot drive clients to appointments or other services in the company vehicle when at the facility. Is that OK?""

I've received the following responses from the program directors that have interviewed me:

-	""Good question. I'm not sure. Let me ask HR and get back to you."" The next day I was told ""Your interview was great and we'd love to have you, but being able to drive is considered an essential function according to HR. If a client has an emergency and needs to go to the ER or something, staff needs to be able to drive them. I'm very sorry.""

-	""Sorry. Our insurance company requires that all employees be able to drive for liability purposes.""

-	""Sorry. We require all of our employees to be able to drive. And no, it can't be another coworker with you who does the driving for you.""

One residential treatment center for substance abuse I interviewed at back in January made my blood boil. I was told during the interview that being unable to drive wouldn't be an issue. I was offered the position – signed the offer letter, W-2, direct deposit information, employee handbook, etc – and turned in all the hiring paperwork. I was then told to expect an email soon from HireRight to proceed with the background check...3 days passed and I hadn't yet received any emails. Worried, I went back to the website where I had applied for the job – and sure enough, I found the job opening for the exact same position with the exact same shift schedule and pay had been reposted. I called the treatment facility and was told that they had changed their minds, being unable to drive would unfortunately be an issue. 

Just today, I followed up with HR about another position I had applied for at a long term residential facility in California specifically for blind adults over the age of 21 with multiple disabilities who cannot live independently. It sounded like a perfect fit! I was interviewed on March 2nd about a Residential Aide position. When I explained that I'm actually legally blind myself and don't have a driver's license, the facility manager told me it wouldn't be a problem because there's plenty of other staff members that can drive if needed. She was so impressed, she offered me the position on the spot and told me that HR would be calling me shortly. Unfortunately no one ever did, and HR called me this morning to inform me that - yep, you guessed it - the position requires a valid driver's license. Umm...excuse me? All of the clients are blind or visually impaired themselves - so that is beyond terribly hypocritical - and it makes my blood boil even more than the last incident described above!

I'm just so frustrated with all this discrimination I'm facing all because I am legally blind and cannot drive a car – all things that are not even within my control. I am well aware that the rate of employment for persons with disabilities (17.9%) is much lower than that of the general population (61.8% as of 2020), but I had never experienced first hand why exactly that is until now. I don't know what to do or who I could contact that would be able to help me with this. I'm on the verge of giving up, quite frankly - and even if my determination wasn't dwindling, there's only so many companies around the area and I'm actually running out of places to apply to!"

First, I still want to get one this summer. Are there any things to do or places to look now that it's so late in the game? I promise you I have tried everything - hundreds of applications, cold emails, asking everyone I know, job fairs, resume help, etc. I've only landed interviews for internships I really have no business interviewing for, and getting rejected. My last rejection was from Lockheed, which was a real bummer.

Anyway, I now need to begin to plan for an internship-free summer that will not make me look like a total scrub on my resume. My GPA is still good (3.76) but my lack of internship experience sucks.

\- try to get a solar installer job (dream job in the renewable energy field)

Thank you so much everyone for your advice on this. I got offered a job at the company and I accepted! Couldn’t have done it without all the comments on this post. 

Excel 2016: Mac

I have an interview for a internship in HR analysis on Tuesday the 6th. I was given some pre-interview work that they want me to complete by Monday. The assignment is pretty much to draw insights from the set of data and create visual aids. Some of the data given is name, department, position, status(active/terminated), gender, workplace preference(WFH, office, hybrid), performance ratings.

So far I have created a conditional format for the ratings(green=good, red =bad) pivot table to help filter out each employee in each department and their workplace preference, subtotal formula to count the amount of workers active Vs terminated and some charts for location. 

I’m at a bit of a roadblock right now and I could use some advice as to some additional insights or visualizations. Appreciate any help!"

My family is low income so I chose to go with a non-target school instead of a potentially ""semi-target"" school which I didn't even really know the difference of other than price at the time. At the t
When I was graduating high school, I didn't really have an idea of what I wanted to do or anything about finance, target schools etc. Didn't enjoy CS or anything else that pays well after graduating with a bachelors like an engineer, so I went finance because I felt like I wanted to work at a high paying job and be one of those Wall St guys like in the movies. 
Fast forward 2 years later, I'm now a sophomore in Uni but considered a junior because I overloaded on credits for 3 semesters in a row and took 2 summer classes +AP from high school. I did that because I felt like I needed to graduate earlier and start making money to support myself and my family. I have 0 internships as of now but reality is hitting me hard and fast that I'm graduating next year in May. It's literally my 2nd year in Uni right now and everything feels like its been sped up because of Covid. I have a 3.9 GPA, went to a few club meetings but didn't really join clubs or participate in much school stuff because I was only on campus for 1 semester before Covid hit and was busy with overloaded coursework.

I just started reading about the diff. types of jobs you can get with a finance degree and just the field in general. It seems really competitive. You need to be from a target school, have intern experience, have high GPA, and most importantly connections. I don't have any family or alumni connections but was fortunate enough to make ~15 friends during my first semester. Only one is a business major and has a family member/relative in the field that may potentially help me with getting an internship position this summer but that is up in the air. 

Going with worse case scenario where I graduate next year from a nontarget with a 3.9 GPA, no alumni connections, no internships, what should be my next plan?

 I was originally planning maybe working for a couple years as an analyst or something before applying to a more prestigious Uni for an MBA and going back into the field. But that was before I started reading more about this field and it seems that even getting a job might be difficult for a nontarget candidate like me without anything really standing out. 

I will keep applying for internships but I'm wondering what should do if worse comes to worst. I really should've done more research freshman year or even high school and I'm hating myself for not.

TLDR: 3.9 GPA, Nontarget sophomore (Junior),no connections, no school activities like investing club etc. Graduating next year.  Desperately need guidance and advice from those who are already in the industry!"

&amp;#x200B;

**SUNY University at Buffalo** (Cost 25K)

* Their CS dept places really well within big tech companies
* Large university with a traditional campus right outside the city

* *Worried about the large university size and the party culture*

&amp;#x200B;

**North Carolina State University** (Cost 18K)

A bit about me, I have been getting into the software space for 2 years now, and I am fairly decent at programming stuffs. I got a job around 1.5 years ago as a programming instructor, which I left when I got an internship. I classify myself as an introvert and one of the things that was really tough was having to lead the discussion for a \~50 minute 1:1 class when the student was not really playing a part of the conversation.

I think part of the feeling like I have to keep talking may be that I feel like I have to provide the student something since their parents are paying around $60 for each class. But also, I just don't know what else to do if I ask the student an open-ended question, and they just say ""I don't know"" and stay silent.  


 I had the offer to come back to the company, but I want to try to change my approach to the classes, so I could potentially have a better experience.

Some ideas I had were:

1. Having the student work on a project independently for 10 minutes while I observe them silently. (hehehe)
2. Letting the student know that they have to also carry the discussion if we want to have a fun class
3. Putting all of my lessons on the same day so I have the rest of the week to recharge (it would be around 6 \~1 hour lessons; I am not sure if I should keep these on two days or one...)"

By ""how to apply for internships,"" I mean knowing the answers to:

1. When to apply for internships
2. How many internship applications is realistically enough to get an interview 
3. What you need to do to prepare for internship interviews

A lot of students at my university don't apply for internships until the last minute, and some don't apply at all until it's too late (they've already graduated).

Many of them also don't apply to nearly enough companies. I've heard of students who applied to 10 companies throughout the entire year and thought that was a lot.

Some never learn what LeetCode is and trust our CS classes to teach them everything they need to know.  This often doesn't work out well.

Why do some students learn to how to apply internships and others don't? That's basically the question I'm trying to answer for myself."

I'm an international high school senior trying to pick between UIUC and UMich for CS. I will be paying roughly the same amount at both places, so the cost isn't really an issue for me. I wish to pursue an education that encompasses both CS and Finance. Both fields really interest me, and after much experimentation with various niches in the CS fields such as webdev, blockchain research, I really liked applicational-CS, and as such I wish to eventually start my career as a quant/algo trader or builder/analyst in the finance industry, with the help of my CS skills.

Some things that I like about UIUC are:

&amp;#x200B;

* The CS program is top 5, and I have observed that doing well at Illinois will set you up well for lots of careers in the CS field, and might give an edge over UMich in something like high frequency trading
* James Scholar and Honours which I was directly admitted into, which may open other doors.
* Slightly Cheaper, however, not much of a difference
* Proximity to Chicago for Internships / Local job opportunities, as compared to Ann Arbor which is further away from any booming major cities (Detroit excluded because it is mainly an auto city)

Some things that I like about UMich are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Better connections and diversity, as well as the alumni network in the finance an management consulting industry as UMich is generally well reputed across the board of disciplines of study, unlike UIUC, which is known most. This might be beneficial as I hope to take a lot of econ classes during college.
* Possibility of a dual degree with Ross in finance, as I hear it is one of the best business schools in the nation.
* Better general public perception, may help me down the road. (Not really banking on this)
* Ann Arbor being a more fun place in general than CU

Could someone help me narrow down which exactly I should go to, as I feel that both have equally good reasons to attend.

Thank you all so much!"

I was recently offered a paid research mentor position over the summer and complete a research project in urban ecology with a group of high school seniors, but I am not sure if I should accept it or if I should look for opportunities more directly related to the fields I'm interested in. 

I have enjoyed working with younger students in the past but I don't know if I'm super interested in urban ecology or if that's something that I would like to do post graduation. Right now I think I'd like to go to grad school and study urban informatics (hence the American Studies and CS double major) and then do data analysis for either some non-profit or government agency, and I don't know if this will really help me do that. 

I already have some experience in data analysis. Last summer I worked as a data analysis intern for my school's IT department (but I mainly used Excel and Power BI to build some reports for them). And soon I will complete this two month long research workshop on machine learning, and I just started working in one of my school's data mining labs. 

So I don't know if I should just take the money from this urban ecology research opportunity ($5k+), bank on my other data analysis experience, and then try to get an internship more directly linked to my interests for the summer going into my senior year, or if I should bail on the urban ecology research and try to do something that is directly related to my interests for this summer to make sure I don't waste my second to last summer before graduation. What should I do? Is research in an unrelated field, viewed positively by tech employers or grad schools? Is it not worth it to still work with high school students going into my junior year of college? Any advice would be appreciated!"

So I don't know if I should just take the money from this urban ecology research opportunity ($5k+), bank on my other data analysis experience, and then try to get an internship more directly linked to my interests for the summer going into my senior year, or if I should bail on the urban ecology research and try to do something that is directly related to my interests for this summer to make sure I don't waste my second to last summer before graduation. What should I do? Is research in an unrelated field, viewed positively by tech employers or grad schools? Is it not worth it to still work with high school students going into my junior year of college? Any advice would be appreciated!"

**Demographics**

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: Black, Asian
* Residence: Northern VA/DC
* Income Bracket: 100K, but I live in a split household
* Type of School: public, Governor's School
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM

**Intended Major(s)**: Neuroscience, Computational Biology

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.1 UW/3.7 W\* (more on this later)
* Rank (or percentile): school doesn't report
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Largely honors, 6 APs, all other classes were ""post-AP"" (Of which I've taken 4) and weighted out of 5.
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Lang, AP Gov, Multivariable Calculus, Computational Physics, Geosystems, Quantum Physics and Electrodynamics, and Japanese 3. Also technically considered coursework, one class period will be dedicated towards a quantum physics research project.

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT: 1600 (took it freshman year, absolutely nailed it, but I'll probably take it again to give colleges a more recent score)
* AP: APCSA - 5

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. Research intern at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center - Performing research underneath a professor in the Department of Pathology. Ideally, I'll get a paper published before I graduate
2. Machine Learning intern at a bioinformatics startup - Led a team of two high school students and one professional in a summer internship where we designed an ML algorithm to predict the success of clinical trials
3. Co-founder, co-president of school's Quantum Computing Club - I write weekly lectures and worksheets for an audience of 25-30 students
4. President of school's Gay-Straight Alliance - In the past year, I've worked to make our club's voice heard by the school's administration, organized student panels, and held weekly discussions on gay rights activism
5. Varsity competitor on school's Academic Decathlon team - We're competing at nationals this year, with our state competition score placing 6th out of all teams that will be present at nationals
6. President of Amateur Radio Club - Organized license exams and the rebuilding of our school's defunct station. Thanks to COVID, however, I doubt that the club will continue to run

**Awards/Honors**

1. Various awards from Academic Decathlon, and that's about it

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor - Meh, at best. I don't know what she could talk about.

Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics - This one should be good. The teacher I had for this one had witnessed me struggle from a really low point in my life to a point where I was hitting some relatively nice successes. On top of that, we discuss research often and have a pretty good relationship.

AP Physics - Pretty OK. I get along with him well and he's the sponsor for the quantum computing club I preside over, so he can speak to my leadership ability.

Research mentor - This is probably the only one that isn't ""tainted"", per se. More on that later

**Additional Information/Context**

This, by far, is the most important part. GPA-wise, I've been doing terribly all three years, but I feel as though I have a good explanation for this.

Freshman year, I was living in an incredibly abusive household which ultimately led to me being hospitalized and a restraining order placed on my abuser. Up until the hospitalization, my grades were at a solid 4.0 W, but after that, everything started to break.

After that, I was emotionally and mentally spent, and my sophomore year grades were only marginally better than my freshman grades. This is partially why I say that the research mentor LOR is the only one that wouldn't be ""tainted"": he's seen me after all of that ugly stuff happened.

Then COVID hit.

From my youth, I've had a very mild case of Tourette Syndrome which exploded because of the lockdowns and social distancing.

In a very short amount of time, my daily life became hell, and while I was starting to do well in school once we reconvened, I was living in near constant pain and discomfort. I started taking medications, and while they do help a lot with the ticcing, they leave me exhausted.

I only get around 8 or 9 hours a day where I'm awake and alert, and I rely heavily on my teachers' class recordings. My ability to complete assignments in a timely manner was completely shot, and I ended up failing a semester course in AI as a result. My teachers know this and are as accommodating as they possibly can be, but it's tough to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on bolstering my ECs would be greatly appreciated, seeing as how that's probably what's going to help me the most."

mj9wik,4,2021-04-03,Crossroads,Miike21,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/mj9wik/crossroads/,"Hello Everyone,

I can really use some advice here. Currently I am working at a top 10 public accounting firm. I just finished my 2nd busy season (1st busy season was last year during an internship at a big 4). During my 1st busy season, I was able to see how intense it is and how stressful it can be but ultimately I did good and got through it (received a full-time offer). 

For my 2nd busy season, now as a full-time associate at another firm, it was a completely different experience. I did not receive good reviews and according to the firm I was not meeting their expectations. At the moment I am currently under probation and may be terminated if I receive anymore bad reviews. I partially do take some of the responsibility for not meeting their expectations but at the same time, I feel as a new hire during busy season the firm should be more considerate to their new employees. 

Not going to go into full details but let’s just say one bad review I received was for my 2nd week of working at the firm. In my opinion any company that gives you a bad review after 2 weeks of you working there says a lot about their culture. I believe the real issue the firm has with me is that I am too honest with my timesheet (Main critique is I take too long on tasks). In the 3 months of me working here I have been asked multiple times to not charge all my hours to the client **“Eating Time”**, which I have not done. Sadly, even though this is unethical from the firms standpoint, the way they get back at you is by giving you bad reviews. Again, I do take partial responsibility and I have tried my best to complete any assigned task as fast as possible but it is never fast enough for them. 

I am not worried about losing my job at this firm because I do have multiple offers from other public accounting firms in the fall (including big 4) and I know that if I am terminated I won’t have an issue finding another accounting job. My issue right now is that based off my experience at this firm I am completely turned off from public accounting in general. I dread signing into work every…single…day. I don’t feel like dealing with the fake passive aggressive corporate BS of “hey you can ask me anything but yeah not really”. 

I left a really good industry accounting job to come to public accounting (Reason for leaving was for a higher salary) but I feel as if this was the wrong choice. Right now I just want to find another accounting job that isn’t public accounting and just say screw all of the offers I have in the fall. I am a highly motivated individual and that is why I have received multiple offers. I’ve worked really hard to get to this point but now I’m reconsidering my choices. 

Not sure if anyone has been in a similar situation as me but any advice would help. I know if I pass up the opportunities I have now, there might not be a second chance and I might regret it in the future. Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this post."
mjdqeg,12,2021-04-03,My brother [17M] told me that I [20F] should have chosen somewhere else to jump when I was having suicidal tendencies a year ago.,detourfaction,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mjdqeg/my_brother_17m_told_me_that_i_20f_should_have/,"Hi guys, I'll apologise in advance for the format as I am on mobile.

Today, I was caught in another storm that brewed in my family, and I felt very upset for the rest of the evening. The context being, I did not want to have dinner with my parents as they were having fried chicken for dinner, and they were dead set on it. I was trying to cut down on oily foods myself so I politely refused and told them that ""It's okay, I'll have dinner on my own, you guys should go enjoy eating it."" My brother wasn't going as he had a friend over. My mother threw a huge fit at me for refusing, saying all sorts of stupid things, like ""why are you making everyone unhappy"" and ""because of you we can't even enjoy dinner"" and even, ""why are you shouting at me, it feels like I don't have a voice in this household"", which is just pure bs. I never shouted at her, I raised my voice a little to reply her as she was standing a good 7 metres away (and she had complained about me talking too softly before anyways). As I was already feeling uncomfortable, I tried to refuse again, but this time, she threw an even bigger tantrum, and she said, ""You are the cause of all the problems in this house. Nobody likes you."" 

For extra context, this is a trigger sentence for me as she used to say it so frequently throughout the day before my suicide attempt last June, and that was the main contributor to my self doubt and spiral. She witnessed my suicide attempt and stopped saying anything close to that for a few months, and today, she said it. I have specifically told her and explained to her before that this is my trigger sentence, so she knows not to say stuff like that. 

I don't like to deal with my parents' tantrums and fits, so most of the time I go along with what they want to keep the peace. My brother on the other hand, is rebellious and he never takes whatever they say to heart, and he does not listen to them, he avoids confrontations with our parents by leaving the house for long periods of time. So I went along with it while arguing with my mother just to placate her, and was spiralling all over again as dinner progressed. 

When my brother came back, I told him all about it, and advised him not to get on our mother's bad side. He laughed at me for bearing the brunt of her rage, which honestly felt uncomfortable as well. My brother is someone who likes to joke, and likes to dismiss other people's opinions with jokes that aren't well executed enough to sound like jokes, so alot of what he says in reply to people, even when they are in need of help, sound dismissive and ingenuine. I started to recount the evening to him and got to the trigger sentence. I told him that it was a trigger sentence that started from the suicide attempt last June, and also filled him in with the general details of what happened back then as we never explicitly discussed it until today. I told him that I was close to jumping off the window from my room, when he cut me off and said ""If you want to die, don't jump off here, go to the kitchen and jump there instead"" while laughing. He explained that if I ever jumped from my room's window, the incident would ruin his experience while he's playing soccer downstairs or riding his bike downstairs, and added that the kitchen window would be a better choice. I was in tears at that point because I was already feeling even more invalidated than before. I asked if he was joking, and he said he wasn't. He continued on to point out each and every thing in my room that he would sell off after my death, and continued to laugh about it while saying he doesn't care about my trauma. 

I guess all I have now is myself, and there really isn't a single person I can trust in this household with my mental health. My friends have been more supportive of me than my family has, and they have been looking out for me and my wellbeing.  I have taken steps towards getting therapy, but that is expensive where I live, and I sure as hell do not want my parents to know that I am getting therapy, so I planning to get some work to earn enough to recieve the help I need. I'm trying to forget about everything I heard and felt today, and I think that while I am in my hiatus before my internship, I'll stay out of the house as much as I can. I can't save my family relations if I can't even save myself.

New member here and new Redditor altogether. It seems like this is a very active community with friendly, knowledgeable people. I wanted to get some advice on where to pick up where I left off.

So for the past 6 years I have completed a Toolmaker apprenticeship but now I'm realizing the mistake I made and want to get back into the world of computers and programming.

I am looking at database admins or  cybersecurity. Both interest me very much. Which is more 'future proof' and more 'in demand', database admins or penetration testers? I'm looking to start learning online ASAP and I would like to know what I need to get cert/degree wise for each? Are there any paid internships or earn as you learn type of programs? Also wanted to ask how relevant is my B.S. now that it is 6 years old.

mjet9i,13,2021-04-03,Help me choose! Duke Kunshan University or UNC for CS?,careerprepthrowaway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mjet9i/help_me_choose_duke_kunshan_university_or_unc_for/,"My college admissions time has more or less come to an end.  I hear back from Duke on Monday but I'm pretty sure I won't get in.  Thus far, I've gotten in to UNC, NC State, and Duke Kunshan University (Duke's international campus in China).  I've narrowed it down to either UNC or DKU.

Some things to note:

* Both cost about the same (I'm an NC student so in-state tuition)
* I live 20 minutes from UNC currently and am pretty familiar with Chapel Hill.
* I have a bunch of AP and dual enrollment credits that would transfer to UNC, less so to DKU
* I am very interested in studying Chinese.  I did NSLI-Y's virtual program last summer and am travelling to Taiwan through them this summer.  Either way I want to be fluent by the end of undergrad.
* My main interest is CS- I want to be a software engineer either operating my own business or making a high salary straight out of undergrad (so internships are a must).
* At DKU I would graduate with a Duke degree and a DKU degree, and I would study one semester Junior year and one summer at Duke.
   * I also don't want my degree to be something I have to explain constantly.  I'm worried here that it would be.
* No offense to DKU, but given how new the program is I'm a little concerned.  Above all else I want to feel confident that my university is going to have the resources to let me succeed so long as I put the work in (which, I will).  DKU has lots of seemingly great faculty, both from Duke and from other universities in the US (and of course from China) but no one has graduated yet and won't until next year (class of 2022).
   * However, other programs like NYU Shanghai (which is basically NYU's version of the same thing) have been successful. 16% of the class of 2020 made between $90-120k and they work for major tech companies like Google and Facebook ([source](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/campus-life/career/graduate-destinations2020)).
      * My theory is that if DKU is anything like NYU Shanghai, I will be career-ready.
* My mental health has been.... not great lately.  I have some """"""""""""trauma"""""""""""" I'm dealing with from my childhood (I guess child abuse is the way to put it).  While it ended once I started high school and I was pretty happy as a Junior, all of Senior year my issues have reappeared.  I've been under a lot of stress the past 9 months or so.
   * I don't know anybody going to UNC, but I have some friends in the area that I can always hang out with outside of class if need be.
   * I'm a little concerned about having a mental break if I go and basically being stuck in a foreign country.
* I've met some people I like already at DKU through their and group chats they've sent up.  Overall it's a community I would say I'd fit in to, but I'm still pretty nervous.

Please give me your opinions! I'm rather stressed about this decision and want to make the right one."

Last year, I did get a very nice REU internship. You know, because of COVID-19, it was truncated and moved onto this summer. For this reason, I guess I settled, and decided not to look for industrial internships for the sole reason that I already had something on my plate.

I guess, I do realize that I may not end up wanting to go to graduate school for chemical engineering. I am still thinking about certain paths to take (whether I want to go straight to industry or get a master's in a completely unrelated field). I'll speak to my advisor soon so that I can prepare myself in the summer.

However, I do recognize that REU internships hold more value in graduate school applications rather than industry. I tried to opt for the most practical project (computational/programming projects but in the context of material science). I wonder if this will at least give me some leverage in the industry. Also, how can I market it to give myself a more competitive advantage?

I have a recurring issue of having jobs where my schedule is not consistent at all and it ends up hurting me in the long run. I’ve worked retail (pay too low even if hours are good), restaurants (pay is fine but hours are brutal, very little work/life balance because you don’t get home til 12am), and am now a pharmacy technician. I’m paid alright but not great, and my company is continually asking techs to take on new responsibility with few incentives for us. They also cut hours in half in my district so I am struggling financially as a result. 

Point being, I am tired of living like this. It’s partly my fault as I went to college just to go to college and ended up with a degree I don’t want (spanish). I am 22 and have no student debt, but I do have some medical debt and I don’t feel stable enough financially at the moment to want to stay in pharmacy.

I can type 80+ WPM. I can read (and kind of speak) another language. I have data entry experience and I have experience with insurance billing. I can use a computer well, fix a printer, run a fax machine, answer the phone, troubleshoot Windows, and use Microsoft Office. I know how to talk to clients and problem solve. But I don’t know if any of these skills are good enough to get into something like IT (my dream career) without a degree and 11 internships under my belt. Is it worth it for me to try and do a few bootcamps and create some projects of my own or do I need to try and find someone who can be a connection for me?

I am a 4th out of 5 year computer engineering major with a psych minor. From northern Wisconsin.

I have gotten a summer job that is basically wiring panels for 40-60 hours a week for about $15.47 per hour. This job is located about 30 minutes from my home so I can live at home (with my parents) and not have to worry about paying rent in two places for the summer. I also wouldn't have to pay for much in the line of groceries since my parents said that I wouldn't need too. It would be 3-4 weeks of day shift training and then switched to 3rd shift, with the possibility of a pay bump of up to a rate of $18 an hour. 

One internship is located in Lower Michigan and I am a finalist (1 out of 3) for an IT position.  It's not exactly my major either, but it is paying around $21 an hour. 40 hours a week with opportunity for overtime. I would get a small moving stipend, but it wouldn't cover the full cost. 

The last internship is less likely to happen, but sometimes you just need to hope. It is a Research and Design internship that could possibly be remote, but I could end up in a completely different state. Pay would be $24.50 an hour with 40 hour work weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice people have would be helpful. I have tentatively accepted the non internship offer, because I would rather be safe than sorry this summer."

In different country's. (Netherlands and Ukraine) But we have been together for almost 6 years. But due to covid we are not able to be together and its been really hard. She use to work in a library, but for the last year she is not able to work as much as normaly. 

I have been trying to support her as much as possible. But the last few month are hard for me to and for her. She is getting into debt, and her mental health isn't getting better to. She doenst sleep well and is just very stressed. I am really worried and dont know what to do. 

At the moment she is still studying and doing an internship. But the internship fee is not enough to cover the fixed costs. She works a few days a month at the library, but they arent open as normal so she doesnt get her normal payment. 

At this moment i cant take a loan myself because i am paying off my house.

I dont know what to do and really could use some advice .

**Letters of Recommendation**

i dont really feel qualified to rate them numerically or anything, but i will say that some of my teachers let me read their recs about me despite me waiving ferpa (make of that what u will lol)

*AP Lang Teacher*: didn't get to read this one, but i will say that even though we weren't super close, i always stayed back after school to ask for feedback on my essays and this is smth i know she mentioned

*Pre-AP Spanish Teacher*: she actually was an advisor for an in-school art initiative i started so she spoke a lot about that, talked about how whenever i do something, i always go ""all in"" so hopefully that speaks to my ""enthusiastic nature"" or smth like that LMAOO

*AP Art Teacher*: wrote about my in and out of school art initiatives mainly; mentioned how i took multiple art classes in one year/entered art competitions meant for juniors as a freshman etc etc. for some more context this teacher entered my artwork in a lot of district/state wide art comps and nominated me for leadership conferences/awards

*CEO of my City's Art Foundation*: i outlined a youth-centered framework with her while i was serving on her youth council + also took it upon myself to do a lot of outreach for new art initiatives in my city, so i think she really spoke towards my enthusiasm for starting up new projects

*Research Mentor*: she knew a lot of the background behind WHY i wanted to do the research i did, so she can speak to the personal reasons behind my research (which involved immigrant mental health). since she oversaw me conduct this research, she can also attest to my ability to conceptualize projects involving abstract ideas and see the real world applications/solutions behind it.

**Interviews**

*yale* \- apparently it's pre-screened but i doubt it means anything other than im not an auto-reject. anyways, it was okay - not terrible but not amazing either 

*cornell* \- was not even a formal interview, more of a q&amp;a session LOL

**Essays**

UT was the only place i applied early. i can say that the quality of my writing greatly improved from October-ish (when i submitted to UT) to end of December (when i submitted everything else). stuff like activity descriptions and overall wording of things was also better in the winter since i had much more practice at that point from applying to the UC's.

* that being said, i wrote my common app about art (surprise, surprise!), but more specifically about how it was a way for me to hear listen to different peoples stories + share those stories in a way that honors the nuances of their experiences. it talked about my fascination with grocery stores (because people from all different walks of life congregate in this one common area) and how they inspire me to look for people's stories (and then share them through art).
* my leadership essays were about teaching art at my local language school and combining art + activism as a way of preserving heritage.
* diversity essays were about the value of collectivism in my culture and how it showed me the importance of service to others (backed this up with examples of me applying my academic interests to volunteering and advocacy)
* why major essays were about immigrant mental health and importance of taking culture into account as a context to address health disparities
* any other essays were about my affinity for translating across disciplines and how this ability allows me to thrive at the intersection of art and psychology + see art therapy as a tool for personal + social healing

**Additional Information:**

there was quite a bit of info in my additional info, but idk if this is something the AOs appreciated. Not sure if i would recommend doing this, but i just really didn't want to leave anything out:

* mentioned a couple of regional art awards + that i was on the graphic design/illustration team for some youth-led organizations. was published in print and online &amp; exhibited in \[museums and galleries\] nationwide. contracted by \[museum\] to create a mural for their public art campaign.
* and then some minor in-school clubs + honor societies + awards (DECA state, NSE, teacher awards) as well as my role in my school's band for the first two years of high school (which i had to quit bc of health complications)

so sorry for the obnoxiously long post LMAO, but i wanted to include any bit of info that may be helpful for those who take the time to read this :) 

in a year as crazy as this one, i'm so so grateful for the acceptances i've been lucky enough to receive. i also look back now and am satisfied knowing that i pursued things that genuinely interested me, even if they didn't result in the most flashy/prestigious awards. 

anyways, please feel free to ask me any questions, i stalked this sub religiously my junior year and i want to pay it back in any way i can :)))"

     I recently accepted an offer as an EY tech consultant. I'm a CS major. I'm currently assigned to the engineering track and had a few questions.

1. Will my roles be solely coding? My past internships were coding, but I realized I don't want to do coding anymore but more business tech roles. Some areas of interest I want to transition to with my coding knowledge being tech transformation, product roadmapping, and potentially strategy.
2. Are there yearly raises/bonuses, if so, what are they usually like? 
3. What are the average weekly work hours, how bad can it get and how often are those long work weeks? I know it won't be a 40 hour work week. 
4. How has your experience been and has it been worth it (exit opportunities, interesting projects/experience, good culture/people)?

     I wasn't sure what I wanted to do out of college, and consulting was something I've wanted to try at one point in life. I figured it be best to do it now if I want to try different roles and have a strong start for my career/resume. Any insight would be appreciated, thank you."

I was recently admitted into the Faculty of Arts and I plan to major in Computer Science after my first year at McGill.

* MATH 133
* MATH 140
* COMP 206
* COMP 230
* COMP 250

I know that this question is highly subjective but McGill doesn't offer any co-op or internship statistics that I could find so any insight would be much appreciated!

Community College:

Pros
- got into the Honors College which has perks like small classes, free trips, increased transferability, and surrounded by a limited group of intelligent people
- Completely free (aside from books maybe?)
- 30 minutes from my house
- I could play for their soccer team (for fun and possibly recruitment in the future)

Cons
- I would have to buy a car to transport myself
- I would be home (I wanted to move out, but not necessarily far away)
- Would be hard to find internships or get any type of hands on experience
- I would lose two years to make connections or even just have fun at a four year school
- I would attend Rutgers most likely afterwards but even in state is expensive.


Georgia Tech:

Pros
- T10 Engineering School
- Great resources
- Challenging (could be a con I don’t know yet)
- I would live there
- The overall quality of student and staff would be better
- Located in Atlanta near a good amount of tech

Cons
- 30k per year cost (but I have figured out ways to keep the amount of loans I have to take out to 50-60k even though it might not be guaranteed)
- I have never left home before so moving 13 hours away by car will be hard
- My work/study/social life balanced be busy and hard to manage


I can’t think of any more right now but I will edit if I do. If anyone could give me an advice or their opinion that would be great."

I will be doing a dev internship this summer and plan on retaking that class as well. Doing poorly was a combination of some life circumstances, burnout, and not spending enough time on that class. Doing this terribly in a class is definitely an anomaly for me and I'm sure I'll be able to do well and get a high grade after retaking it. I'm not sure if I want to go to grad school or not but I'm aware that your grades/GPA will matter quite a bit if you apply for grad school. The one thing I'm the most worried about is how it will affect my future internships and jobs and how employers will feel about my transcript. Will larger tech companies automatically reject me for internships/full-time jobs after seeing a withdraw on my transcript? Would other tech companies do the same?"
mjqlae,119,2021-04-04,My experience with the selection process for a research internship as a CSE BTech graduate (by u/itsmeyohacker_0811) [OC_Article],itsmeyohacker_0811,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/mjqlae/my_experience_with_the_selection_process_for_a/,"my\_qualificationS: [B.Tech](https://B.Tech)(CSE) 2021  

In this post, I'm going to talk about how I got a research intern position at IIIT even without clearing GATE and how having an interaction with strangers sometimes can help you!   


I am a final year B.Tech student from Delhi. Like every other PCM student, I had a dream to pursue engineering from the topmost institutes in the country but unfortunately, I took JEE too lightly and never prepared for it, and only relied upon my 12th preparations. Later, my parents gave me an option to drop, but I decided to get admission in a state-level university.   


My college was decent with a decent average package ranging from 5 to 6 LPA. But then I came to know about GATE and read some quora answers that usually say it is the easiest way to get into IIT and all those sugar-coated stuff that really motivated me to prepare for GATE itself.   


As my degree came to end, I again experienced another wave of excitement and enthusiasm to join prestigious IITs/NITs, this time I prepared thoroughly considering it as a ""do or die situation"" but, I guess my luck didn't help me and I failed again.   


The placement process in my college usually starts in September, since I was determined to crack GATE I never truly focussed on placements. The placement session was thoroughly rough for me, sometimes I scored good in the screening process but the company never called me, in TCS, I scored 1480/1800 and TCS never mailed me and my peers with fewer marks got mails and other procedural letters. I tried contacting the company and they asked me to appear again for the exam. I did and scored 1600/1800 and still waiting for their reply. \^\_\^  


Other times I went to the last rounds and was rejected there, and, boy, it feels miserable to get rejection after spending 10 hours of your day in interviews and technical rounds.   


But as I mentioned, I never focused on placements therefore never took the rejections seriously. I just used to fill forms and appear in interviews whenever a mail from TPO pops in and wanted to keep the job as a backup.  


Now as I approached 2021 my preparations grew more serious and I started spending 10-12 hours a day for GATE leaving out every distraction and fun activity I had. But unfortunately, GATE didn't happen as expected. I guess it's just a 3-hour game, no matter how thoroughly you prepared your luck plays a major part in the game and I screwed GATE. I don't know maybe it was luck or a flaw in my preparation strategy but, to me, I knew I devoted myself truly and did every possible thing I could to crack the exam.   


Now, I got two options either take a drop or go for a job. I preferred the later one because I didn't want to be disappointed again and really fear rejection(HUMAN NATURE!).  


Anyways, I got in touch with a research associate from IISC through LinkedIn. I pinged her and asked about her position at IISC, how she got admitted there, I requested her to have a meet over call and explain everything thoroughly. We exchanged some talk over the phone and she told me that she works as a research associate there i.e. you get to work on various projects that are usually sponsored by the Govt of India or MNCs and mentored by professors.  


For that, you can always email professors and ask them to mentor you. If they would be having any vacancy or project under their hood they might employ you and govt of India will give pre-discussed stipend i.e. Rs. 12400.   


I grew excited as my parent's dream of getting into a prestigious institute was still not broken and I didn't have to enter the corporate world too soon. I asked her to send me the prototype of the mail and I begin my research on finding different professors' email IDs and their research interests. I shortlisted over 50 professors from various parts of the country and mailed custom emails to every professor. Out of those 50+ mails, I only got 3 responses i.e. from IIITH, IITKgp, IIITD. All three institutes asked me to complete a task for the internship following an interview.   


My field is ML/AI so the task for me usually involved building a predictive model or some python coding competition on hackerrank, hackerearth, or leetcode. I completed the task for IIITH and cleared the interview as well and that's why didn't appear for the rest two internship tasks.   


Some points to keep in mind:  

* The internship totally depends on assigned tasks to professors if they don't have some tasks they would never reply.  

* The duration of the internship could vary from 2 months to 2 years.   

* Don't expect you'll always get a stipend sometimes the professors could be sponsored by private companies so it all depends on sponsors.  


Some tips to create emails:  

• Start with your basic introduction.   

• Always try to send a personalized email to professors as it will give them a sense of effort made by students like you can mention in the mail about a brief discussion of how you liked one of their published papers.   

• Add about your experience how you got interested in that field and what are your further plans.   

• Add more about your past experience with the field, papers you've published, projects you've made in your graduation, and companies you've worked with as an intern.   

• Add dates you're comfortable starting your internship.  

• Don't forget to add your resume.   

• Try sending emails in Feb-April as projects usually start from the new academic year i.e. August.   

• Researching in colleges under professors after your graduation is not a waste of time it gives you time to think more about your interest and gives you an opportunity to have practical industrial exposure.  

• I have also come to know you can also email foreign university's professors regarding the same and they might even help you to get admission there with very little/no fee."

mjtm3n,0,2021-04-04,Bipolar Black PhD Woman,raremetalalchemist,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/mjtm3n/bipolar_black_phd_woman/,"  I am going to try to keep a blog from now on. You can check it out here: [https://chandalowrancecom.wordpress.com/2021/04/04/bipolar-black-phd-woman/](https://chandalowrancecom.wordpress.com/2021/04/04/bipolar-black-phd-woman/) So much has happened in the past three years and it’s hard for me to know where to start. I guess I’ll start from the beginning of graduate school. I started graduate school in June 2017. I was dating my ex-boyfriend Brennan and I moved to Baltimore, MD. Research seemed promising, I was making friends, and my relationship was strong though long distance.

In Fall of 2017 my relationship with Brennan started to become strained due to the long distance. Classes had started and I was trying to divide my time between research, classes, and my relationship. I worked out a four-year plan with my PI (boss) and I was ready to work hard and complete my goal of receiving my PhD. In October 2017, my kitten Bear died from a congenital defect. In November 2017, I broke up with Brennan. Later in Spring 2018 Brennan passed away. I wondered if I had stayed in Colorado whether we would still be together and he would still be alive.

In the following years I dated a French guy, I got an internship with a venture capital firm, I competed in business competitions, I completed my courses and exams, and I continued to do research. I was sure I was on track to complete

April 2020 I was in a relationship with a Muslim man I was friends with from undergrad. I went to Colorado to convert to Islam and spend time with the guy since school was closed due to the pandemic. This is when my psychosis and mania really started. We got into a couple of bad fights so I decided to return to Baltimore. I got into a fight with the flight attendants at the airport and I wasn’t allowed on my flight because they said I was a flight risk. I had to book another flight through a different airline to get home. May 2020 was when things took a turn for the worse. My mania, which I didn’t know I had, was at an all time high and I was beginning to act outwardly. I was posting nonsensical things on social media. I was talking to myself. I wasn’t sleeping. I was blasting music for hours on end. My first hospitalization occurred after I threw a bunch of stuff, including my cell phone and laptop, out of my window and onto the street. I was committed to the hospital once more before I realized that something was wrong with me.

When I got home from the hospital, I realized all the trouble I had caused. I deleted my social media because I posted and messaged a bunch of crazy stuff. I started entering depression because my mania was ending. My cat, Jiffy, died which made things even worse. The amount of work that I was able to do at one time diminished.

Now it’s April 2021. From the beginning I was planning on graduating May 2021. Now I may not be graduating until May 2022. What makes it sting more is I am watching people I went to undergrad with graduating now. I used to do so much and finish work so fast. Now my confidence is diminished because I was not able to achieve my goal. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. What’s worse is I don’t think I want to do chemistry anymore. All this time, sweat, blood and tears and I don’t even think I am going to do what I am going to school for. Right now I am feeling broken and dreadful. I spent so much time on my PhD and now I may not even finish it. I don’t want to quit but I don’t want to feel this way anymore.

Any advice?"

And [ever since our intern quit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mhtnc9/i_perform_at_a_theater_one_of_our_interns_quit/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3), I've been trying to figure out what it is. 

My director Jack told the costume lead, Sarah, and I to come in early on Monday. When we got to his office, he was a mess. Usually, Jack is a well put together, albeit a litte eccentric, guy. He's a tall, thin man with bright eyes. On Monday, his black hair was ruffled and his clothes were wrinkled, a far cry from the man who I've seen spend an hour adjusting his bowtie. He sat us down.

""So Kaitlyn told you what happened."" His mouth was a straight line.

Sarah started telling him everything Kaitlyn told her, but before she got very far, Jack held up a finger. ""I am well aware of her story,"" he said, ""She gave me an earfull last night. What I'm worried about is how she seemed. Was she dazed at all? Did she seem herself?""

""She was shaken if that's what you mean,"" said Sarah, ""Anyone would be.""

""Maybe I should be more specific. Was she spacing out? Staring fixed, or forgetting what she was doing, or not knowing where she was?""

I felt taken aback by these strange questions. Sarah was unperturbed. ""No, sir,"" she said, ""None of that, I checked.""

Sam relaxed. He started muttering to himself in small, interrupted thoughts. He went on like this for awhile so I can't remember everything he said exactly but I caught some of it. He definitely said, ""Got lucky... yes, but now what?"" And I know I heard him ask himself, ""Will it be the same one?""

After that, he collected himself, and told Sarah she could go. I was about to follow when he told me to stay behind. He asked me about my dream, Sarah must have told him. I relayed the details and told him I looked up the name and found Sam Rivera, the man who hung himself from the platform. 

Jack got flustered. At first he told me it must have been a coincidence. She must have read the articles and freaked herself out about it. I told him that still didn't explain how I got the name, she definitely didn't tell me. Then he told me that I probably heard about it too and her story gave me my nightmare. By the time he told me to leave his office and go wait at the Mainstage, his pale face had turned red and blotchy. At rehearsal, he was the same bright eyed, energetic man he always was, like the whole hour before never happened.

For the next couple days, everything was running pretty smoothly, save for costumes who were down a person and had to keep up with two less hands. I'm not sure how far behind they are exactly. I've been avoiding the entire department ever since my dream. I almost would be able to forget about the whole ordeal, if it weren't for the reccuring dreams about the Hot Closet. I haven't seen Sam Rivera since the dream where he knocked me off of a ladder. In the dreams, I'm just looking for a costume that I can't find. Sometimes Sarah's there, sometimes it's another member of the costume crew, but usually I'm alone.

I was just finishing with rehearsal a few days after the weird conversation in Jack's office and the Stage Manager, Allison, told me to come see her for notes.

""You need to be careful,"" she said. 

Allison is a short, round woman, with a pleasant voice. Everyone always jokes that she's the company's mom. She's the sweetest person I've ever met which made it incredibly unsettling to see her face looking so grave.

""You can't trust Jack. I can't say much and he can't know I'm telling you, but I like you and I don't wanna see you... I just wanna make sure you're okay."" 

I was overwhelmed, to say the least. 

""This is crazy,"" I said, ""I can barely believe everything about Sam, I feel like I'm going crazy. I mean, this place can't really be- I've worked here for five years!""

She put a small hand on my shoulder. ""And sweetheart, I can't believe it's taken you this long. We told you what it was.""

""How was I supposed to know you were serious? I thought it was a joke, or just some weird superstition.""

A certain kindness overtook her expression, followed immediately by sternness. 

""You need to know something very important,"" she said, ""This place is more than haunted. There aren't just ghosts here. There are things that have never been human. Old things. These things have left their mark""

I scoffed. ""What, like a curse?""

""Exactly like a curse,"" she said. ""And one of them is that every five years, a sacrifice must be made.""

I started to chuckle, ""You almost got me. Almost. Allison, I've been working here for five years, I'm pretty sure I would have noticed if someone dropped dead when I joined the company.""

""I didn't say it was a life that had to be sacrificed. It's not always that. It could be anything. The first one I was here for, a technician fell down the pit and landed on his ankle. He lost his foot that day.""

""Wait, so what you're trying to tell me is that I'm next?""

""Jack certainly thinks so,"" she sighed.

She opened her mouth to say more, but before she could, Jack called her over.

""Just go to the dinner theatre and find Jonathan. He's the set lead. He'll tell you what you need to know."" Without another word, she turned and left me alone.

The Cassiopiea Theatre has four performance spaces. The Mainstage is our biggest theater, the next biggest is our Dinner Theater, after that is the Old Theatre, and then we have the Black Box. All four are connected by a space in the center that's used to store and move the set pieces of our ongoing productions.

After rehearsal, I slipped backstage, but instead of going out through the side door, I went through set storage and went into the dinner theatre. The room was pitch black save for the ghost light (a lamp without a shade left onstage to keep anyone from harming themselves). I was just looking for the switch when the theatre lit up. The stage was empty except for a mock living room, and dinner tables in the audience were set.

At the switch backstage right was a balding man wearing a paint splattered plaid shirt and jeans. In one of his hands was the switch, in the other was a wet paintbrush. He was smiling proudly, like a child who had just been praised. 

""You're Jonathan?"" I asked. He stared at me, still smiling unblinkingly, which I assumed meant yes. ""Uhhhh, you're doing Company, right? The set's coming along nicely."" 

There was a wooden chair just near Jonathan on a tarp, dripping with wet paint. I realized that he had been painting the chair in total darkness, save the dim ghost light.

""Thank you,"" he said suddenly.

""Uh, what?""

""You said the set looks good. Yes, yes, I do think so too."" He had returned back to his chair and was painting it happily. His hand was moving gracefully with precision, but his eyes were looking right at me. He still hadn't blinked.

""So,"" I said, ""Allison told me you could tell me something.""

""Oh yes,"" he nodded, still moving his brush, ""I could tell you many things."" He laughed as if he'd told a joke.

""Do you think you could, um, tell me about a... a curse?""

""Ohhh, you must be Finch! Yes. Yes, yes, yes I have heard much about you. Five whole years never knowing! And nothing happened either, very lucky indeed. Ignorance is bliss I suppose."" He barked a laugh.

""Yeah, I'm dumb, I get it. But the curse?""

""Oh, YES!"" Jonathan's hand was moving very quickly, and finally he tore his eyes from me. He was looking around as if he was worried someone was listening.

Still scanning the area, he said, ""Every five years it hits. Not deadly, not always. Only kills when-"" he cocked his head, ""oh I guess I can't tell.""

""Can't tell?"" I asked.

""No, no can't tell you that. I'm not allowed."" He laughed again, like the whole thing was hilarious. ""Jack thinks it's you. Stupid man.""

""It's not me?""

""I don't know. If Jack thinks it's you, it probl'y isn't. He doesn't know this place, but it knows him, yes siree."" His eyes were still moving around the room, not scanning, just looking in a daze.

After a moment of silence, I said, ""If you don't mind me asking, who was it last time?""

His face snapped back to me and his smile dropped. ""Well that was me,"" he said. 

Then he started giggling, and with his eyes still locked on mine, he got louder. He kept laughing and laughing and laughing. As I backed away, he started cackling. The light shut off and on instinct, I ran. I left the side door of the Dinner Theatre as he howled with laughter. 

Last week, I was just Frank N Furter in The Rocky Horror Show, thinking all of this was a lie or a joke. Hoping it was anything but this. I don't know if there's a curse or not, but all I know is I don't wanna end up like Jonathan.

Also, does anyone have advice on how to stop nightmares? [I’m starting to lose sleep.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mnc48h/the_ballerina_in_the_mirror/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)"

With zero internship done, zero research, and hope of 3.5+ GPA down the drain, I dunno what I should do next.

I can’t help but compare myself to my classmates already almost two years into making 6-figure salary while I make 570,000 KRW(hey! a six figure monthly wage - it’s actually about 500 USD) a month.

How do I reboot myself? A bunch of leetcode? Read old textbooks? How do you prepare for interviews after such a long gap?

Is Minnesota a prestigious uni for CS? and will I be able to land a job in US after graduating? Obviously, returning to my home country after graduating is an option but I prolly won't be able to make 120k working my whole life, so it won't be worth it.

I am currently an MS Computer Science student focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am really interested in making a transition to astronautical engineering and working with space technology as a career. If it helps, here are statistics about my experience:

\- 1.5 years working as a full-stack developer

\- incoming NASA intern (working as an AI/ML intern on a space communications &amp; navigation project)

\- proficient in Python, MATLAB, Java, C/C++, R, web development, data management

\- intermediate knowledge in robotic software, experience using ROS

\- taking courses in mechanics, electromagnetism, embedded software systems, and astrophysics

\- experience with research in robotics, deep learning, and astronomical data

\- completed/participated in many projects relating to data science and robotics

What are some skills I can learn or opportunities I can take to transition into astronautical engineering? My goal is to specifically be able to write algorithms (specifically, AI algorithms) that can be used for spacecrafts. I know I could most likely try to get a job directly doing this, but I am also interested in pursuing programs like I am looking to enroll in a graduate program after I finish my current program that focuses on astronautical engineering. One school that has my interest is the University of Southern California because they have a program tailored specifically to astronautical engineering. Interested in hearing your thoughts and connecting with folks who might have similar interests."

Demographics: India, Asian Male, Low income (30K USD)

Intended major: CS with a focus on Data Science and Cybersecurity

Academics:

33 ACT; competitive private school, 400+ kids per grade, no ranks but consistently in the top 8%. School doesn't offer APs/Honors, but my courseload is the hardest offered.

Freshman grades weren't good, but everything has been great sophomore year forward. 

ECs:
- Research on a Doman-Specific Programming language @ CERN (publishing to Frontiers in Big Data)
- NLP Research @ EVALITA (first author publication; most researchers were PhD candidates so it was peer reviewed to those standards)
- System Developer for a company (Linux app development, paid part-time work)
- Embedded realtime image segmentation to mobile for a start-up (Computer Vision stuff)
- Platform Developer for a company (data analytics platform for content creators, paid part-time work)
- Professional Ethical Hacking Certifications (CEH, ECSA; a couple of vulnerabilities reported) 
- Published a bus tracking app to the Play Store, lead a student dev team from school
- Data Science Intern (identifying responders to advertisement campaigns)
- I run a blog writing summaries for my favourite research papers
- Lead a dev team developing a social media platform (government organised competition for startups)

Awards:
- High Distinction for Chem Olympiad
- Hackathon
- Excellence in CS 
- Excellence in Math award
- ASSET Talent Search High Distinction (qualified for a few summer programs, but couldn't go)

Essays:
Common app was about my fascination with CS, how I decided I hated my OS and how going about replacing it with Lineage was the moment I knew how I wanted to spend my entire life. Spoke about using Discord study groups to learn ML.

Recs:
Teacher Recs: CS and English. 
- CS should be really good, we're very chill I've helped him out w/programming a bunch of times. His English isn't great though, so let's see.
- English should be really good too, I challenge her a lot in class which results in interesting discussions, I enjoy those classes a lot.

Supplemental Recommendations: Academic mentor and Research Supervisor (CERN)
- My mentor is the most amazing person in the world, gave my life the 180° I needed. Said he's written the best recommendation of his life, and I believe it.
- Research Supervisor's should be great, I never could meet him in person but we interacted very frequently over Skype.

Interviews:
Got one from Princeton and another from Stanford. Both went really well!

**Decisions -**

Acceptances: Purdue (Data Science), King's College London

Rejections: MIT, Caltech (I still love you), Stanford, Amherst, Oxford, Imperial, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, UPenn, Cornell and Brown.

I'm ready for this to be over, every rejection is a fresh gut punch. It's exhausting. I'll update this as decisions come.

Thank you all for your amazing wishes and words of confidence. It means a lot!

Well, that's it. I couldn't have done any more even if I tried, but yeah. Tough luck. Good luck to everyone applying."

I was planning to undertake a project in conjunction with a university society (to address some unique needs of their member base). I recently got into contact with a small 'startup' that is developing a product along a similar line.

I mentioned my own planned ventures to them and they were interested in the concept. I offered to be taken on as an 'intern' wherein I would create a proof-of-concept of my project. If they like it, they will then undertake that project themselves and have it as part of their offering. It would mean my hypothetical project and code base (would only be around 2 months work) would be their IP.

In this context it may sound bizarre to take on this offer, but my project would not be particularly innovative nor technically complex. It sounds like a good opportunity to turn a project into a proven 'internship' (though it would involve me working largely independently) and keep in contact with a promising team.

I'm debating between accepting the 'internship' offer and working on the project independently and then showing it as a proof of concept to them, except it would belong to me, not them.

Am I being too ambitious?

Edit: Thank you all for taking the time to respond. I've gone along with the current consensus and won't be signing up with them. "

mk443d,87,2021-04-04,Letter to the Students On this Sub (and somewhat of a FAQ),AwkwardClassroom,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/mk443d/letter_to_the_students_on_this_sub_and_somewhat/,"TLDR: Finally took some time to type this up. Students are always asking the same questions on this sub. I wrote out some basic post layouts. Hopefully my post can help out and drive some conversation in the sub. It’d be great if we could have this turn into a FAQ or some sort of reference guide. Comment any additions you think can be helpful.

So as I have become more active on this sub, it seems like most questions from students boil down to 4 topics. 

1. Help me choose an offer

2. Interview Advice

3. Career Advice

4. Recruiter Communication / Interview Communication 

(“OMG I haven’t heard from my recruiter in 4 hours, 20 minutes, and 69 seconds from my interview, does this mean I’m not getting an offer?!) 

Obviously, most people can simply search the sub for these answers but they never do. So I figured I can try to help address some of this, and get feedback from the community as well. Without further ado:

&amp;#x200B;

1. HELP US HELP YOU - Often times when people ask for help choosing an offer, they never include enough information

Please use some sort of layout to answer the basics, such as:

***Offer #1*** 

*Location (be as specific as you can be/are willing to be):*

*Firm (be as specific as you can be/are willing to be):*

*Service Line (audit, tax, advisory, consulting):*

*Specialty/Competency (examples: IT, M&amp;A, Cyber, etc.):*

*Industry Focus (if known):*

***Rinse and repeat for Offer #2***

***Facts about you:***

*What is your background (student, professional experience, etc)*

*What are your current interests?:*

*What are your short-term goals?:*

&amp;#x200B;

2. If your question is based for internships surrounding the more “generic” positions B4 takes big cohorts for (namely audit and tax) the advice will not change much between geography, firm, time of year, etc. The advice is the same, a) know about the firm, b) know about the position, c) don’t be weird (airport test). 

Now, if you are interviewing for more “specialized” functions that may require technical interviewing, namely corporate finance groups and some consulting and advisory positions, refer back to #1. Include as much information as possible in your post, with as much time as possible before your interview (and research the sub for more than 2 seconds). 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Similar to #1

Question (be specific): 

*What is your background?\**

*Short-term goals?*

*Long-term goals?*

*Industry Focus:*

*Interests:*

  *\*for students background includes: Year in school, Major/Minor, Professional Certifications (planned or current), Previous Internships, Any additional helpful information*

  *\*for professionals background includes: Current position, years of experience (YOE), Professional Certifications (planned or current), and any additional helpful information*

&amp;#x200B;

4. Just talk to your recruiter.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Interviews**: Yes, sometimes you can hear back within hours about your interview performance, sometimes it can be days or weeks. So many factors play into this that no one will be able to give you a straight answer other than to talk about their experience. If you are at the point where it is reasonable to ask, reach out and do so in a professional manner. My opinion is wait out a week minimum, and go from there. 
2. **Anything else**: Literally just send them an email with your questions, or email them to ask them for a call. Every student has different needs (may want to change service lines during their internships, or maybe even office locations). Recruiters have dealt with the good, the bad, and the ugly. They will be a wealth of information that can be more valuable than some stranger on reddit possibly giving you the right or wrong answer. Just reach out to them within a reasonable timeframe if your question is something actionable. 
   1. I have asked recruiters questions ranging from the interview process (what to expect, timelines, who I am meeting with, etc) to office changes, service line changes, and information about any internal resources that can help me before, during, or after my internship. I was never treated any differently for it. No one expects you to know anything.  

So ya’ll drop some comments to get the conversation going. Let me know if this good or shit. Offer any improvements I can edit the post with."

I'm a .NET developer (kind of fullstack now because of the ciscumtances). Graduated in 2019 and I have 2 years experience (+2 years if you count part-time internships). I live in a developing country, Brasil, and my annual salary is - wait for it... - around 12k USD.

I don't usually care about that because I'm already earning 3x the average salary of my country and even a little bit above the .NET dev salary (within the 1\~3 years experience range), but I feel really frustrated when I read reddit posts about 40k USD being kinda low even for new grads (?!) when I can't make 1/3 of that.

Worse than that, the top-tier annual salary for a senior developer here is about 29k USD (14k BRL/month, enough to be in the top 1%)

My quesitons are:

1. Does these 60k+ USD salaries only applies to native north americans/europeans?
2. Do you think anything below 20k USD is a fair salary for a backend developer (even new grads)?
3. Do you have any foreign coworkers? How were their english skills when they started working with you?"

I’m also not feeling great as to what I should do for project ideas to show on my GitHub — Maybe I can do a simple chat based TCP/IP app ? 

As for internships, I know my chances are slim to none before my freshman year, but maybe I can get some in the summer of 2022, since by then I will be an upcoming sophomore. I’m also confused as to what my day to day basis would look like, and if anybody with internship experiences can help out, please do so, I’d love to hear it :) 

Well other than that, I think that for the summer, I guess I’ll be grinding those websites, making simple projects, and just trying to enjoy it as much as I can :)."

My concerns with UIUC would be 1) Location (less opportunities for internships and jobs perhaps?), 2) Out-of-state cost, 3) less-valuable name in the case I choose not to pursue CS

I would also like to know if there are any alternatives to the CS major at Berkeley in the case that I am not able to declare it.

I've already had a year and a half of experience working there and if I am able to hold that job until graduation, I will have 3.5 years working with them. I really enjoy the work I do with them and I'm incredibly thankful that they've been paying me internship level wages long-term.

I took a look at the public salary listings and it seems like they pay their full-time employees quite generously. The overwhelming majority are getting paid 60-70k a year, with a good amount going over 100k too.

Even though it's long time from now, would it be worth a shot to ask the upper level staff if they have open roles? I'm already intimately familiar with many of the names and faces there.

I'm in my college's honor college, which takes up some of my time, and I have an school job that is an internship type of thing. It involves what I'm going to school for, so it is very important to me. As of this summer, I will be working twenty hours a week for that job. I will also be studying for two very important exams which require about 400+ hours of studying to do well. 

I also have a retail job that I loathe at this point. It sucks the life out of me and takes up lots of my mental space/energy/motivation. The past summer I was working nearly forty hours a week, even though I am a part time employee there. I work about 4 days a week on average right now. 

For the past school year, I have been struggling with a balance and getting caught up in staying up all night, consuming lots of caffeine, and taking sleeping pills so that I could keep up with my full schedule and the difficulties of everything. 

Now here's where I need advice. My academic advisor told me to strongly consider quitting my retail job to focus more on my academics. My grades are not bad, but it is clear that I am nearly out of steam. I will have to quit this retail job by the end of July anyways. Money is also not an issue for me right now. So my question is, should I quit my retail job and focus on school and my internship/school job over the summer, or should I just suck it up and try to push through my burn-out?

Thanks for any advice."

I decided my senior year that I’d take the doctor route and become a psychiatrist and that would be the career path i’d take. THEN i got nervous because I didn’t want to be 30 and just barely have a career.  So here I chose to enter college undecided so I’d have time to declare a major and figure out what I want to do. It’s been really fuckin hard because my entire first year has been online, I barely had the chance to get hands on experience with anything. Even internships are online and it makes things difficult because i’m not just a visual person. I couldn’t possibly decide that I want to do  something if I haven’t had the chance to try it out.  I did take a politics class and my professor was also a lawyer, which got me slightly interested because she seemed to love it.

I am now a high school senior stuck in dilemma of choosing colleges. So far I got into UCLA (Data Theory)and Vanderbilt (Stats/Math). I am planning to double major in CS and Stats. Both are wonderful colleges with unique strength. I think UCLA not only has a greater reputation and strength in STEM fields, but also is located in LA, which opens to many internships opportunities. It is also globally renowned (ie. a few global rankings put UCLA in TOP20 in the world), so people around the world know it. But the downside is, though, that UCLA is a large school, so perhaps it provides less resources per student. I am mainly worrying about undergrad research and academic support at UCLA.

For Vandy, it is a fantastic institution in the southern states, and is good at some non-STEM majors(law, medicine, education...). Vandy is known for its undergrad education. It is further a smaller school, meaning more resources and individual support given to each student. However, Vandy is not as well known as UCLA globally, and is a little behind UCLA in CS/Stats and some other STEM areas. I heard Vanderbilt is expanding its CS department in recent years, but I am not sure how that goes. Nashville is a great city, but I worry that Nashville might not offer as many internship opportunities in big name tech companies as LA does. Please correct me if I'm wrong! :)

I am a foreign citizen, and probably will work in my home country later. I can't physically visit both campuses right now, but have done virtual tours at both, and I am impressed with both campuses (without preference). Tuition is not a major concern. My questions are:

1. Almost certain that I am going to a grad school. So which one will place me in a competitive grad school (MIT/Stanford/Berkeley/CMU/ivy...)? Given that I will work hard and actively seek resources.
2. Which is more prestigious, overall, nationally? What about their reputation in CS/Stats and other STEM areas? I understand that prestige should not factor into decision making, but I'm just curious about it. 
3. How is undergrad summer internship recruitments at both? Being in LA would allow me to intern locally, or travel briefly to bay area. Also UCLA is a target school, so I guess internships are more accessible. In Nashville I might need to intern somewhere else. And Vandy might be a semi-target.
4. It would be great to hear from current students at both school for this question! I scanned through CS requirements from both schools and did not notice much difference. So I guess the learning environment and professor's teaching are different and should be weighted more during decision making. Could you please comment about your school's CS curriculum and professors' teaching? It would further be great to know about depth and breadth of the curriculum, and your learning experience.
5. I understand professors would prefer to conduct research with grad or PhD students no matter where, but how accessible are undergrad research opportunities?
6. where would you pick?

I'm supposed to be doing backend development but realised along the way that I would like to try front end development instead. I initially chose to do backend development because that's what I was most confident in. This is due to all my programming experiences being backend related - I have no professional experience in front end development.

There are two ways I'm considering to make the switch to front end development:

1) wait for my current project to end and hope my next project given by my current consultancy will allow me to work on front end skills. I don't really like this idea cause it feels like a huge gamble - I don't know when my current project will end and I don't know if I will even get a project I like (some colleagues from other projects have really bad projects to work on)

2) apply for entry front end positions in other companies while working on a personal portfolio. I'm currently taking this approach but I'm not sure if its the best way to go about doing this - as mentioned, I don't have much professional experience doing front end work, just learning this stuff from udemy. I have created some personal projects but I don't think they are impressive enough to land me a full time job in front end development.

3) look for a front end developer internship (6 months or more). If I get something good, quit my job and take the internship (my current employer doesn't allow me to do part time internships). - I'm thinking this will boost my resume in terms of front end development experience which might open doors for full time positions or a return offer.

Hope you guys could offer some perspective and advice. Thanks!

Tldr: graduated 2020, got a job with sucky long term growth, discovered I like front end development but don't have enough experience to get a full time job. Thinking if I should quit my job and get an internship or keep applying for entry level positions with a personal portfolio."

Since then, he has been unable to land a CS job. He's not even making it to the interview stage most of the time. I'm not really too sure what other advice to give him. He has applied to all jobs in practically every area of the CS spectrum. From engineering to general IT position, to UI/UX jobs. At this point, it's really starting to feel like a lost cause.

We talked about him going back to school since he really doesn't even like CS to begin with. He would much rather be in nursing, event planning, or maybe even accounting. Unfortunately, like many people, kinda realized this too late. And going back to school is really expensive, We also discussed maybe doing a coding bootcamp might be helpful.

IMO, I think it's because he really doesn't have much technical experience on his resume. He never did an internship and his other part-time jobs aren't really ""CS"".

Any ideas what to suggest?

FT OFFER 

* Analyst on the finance team at a ""top"" asset manager
* 67,000 - 77,000 salary range
* In the location I prefer
* Interned there, like my team so far

&amp;#x200B;

GRADUATE SCHOOL

* Data Science Masters @ Columbia SPS, 1 academic year
* Would help with skills to build my startup
* Scholarship would cover roughly  90% of school cost, only about 5-10k to cover OOP or with loans 
* Would need to cover living costs 
* Would delay entering adulthood (I know this is a $\*!T reason but I am really not ready)

&amp;#x200B;

Additional Background:

I don't have any student debt currently. I have what I would consider a \~healthy savings\~ that I was planning to use for a down payment on a multifamily should I go the FT route, that could help with living costs should I go the graduate school route. There is a possibility, I could intern with the firm I have an offer from for the duration of my program and then work with them FT afterward (I know people who have in the past). Should I chose to go to graduate school, I am mostly concerned about renigging on my offer being that I accepted in October.

I plan to take on a full time SWE internship for 8 weeks with a company over the summer. Either or of the classes will indirectly benefit my internship since it has some sort of web dev component it anyways.

Problem is 411 has given class times that I will working and 498 is ""arranged"" which will help my schedule.

Has anyone taken these classes during the summer concurrently with an internship? Is this doable?

Thanks!"

**Hooks:** Underrepresented country (?), first gen.


**Intended Majors:** STEM


**ACT/SAT/SAT II**: 36 ACT, 1580 SAT.

**UW/W GPA and Rank**: 4.00 UW until now, will become the valedictorian if I don't get something like 3.6 next year.





**Coursework:** School offered none. I've prepared and took 3 AP exams from outside. AP Calculus AB (5), AP Physics 1 (5), AP Chemistry (4).


**Awards:** Having the first place in national HS exams (why didn't you go to a better HS would be the perfect question here and I really don't have an answer for that. We live in a small town and I didn't want to live 500km far from my family at the age of 14.) , attending to the national math and physics olympiads and getting the 2nd place at math (will attend the worldwide one next year but will probably get fucked so don't even count it lol.), winning the national robotics competition with the team I found in our school. (This was kinda famous.)


**Extracurriculars:**

1- Teaching English, German and maths to the kids at orphanage. Probably like over 150 hours on this.

2- Knowing 4 languages (idk if this counts)


3- ABRSM on guitar and percussion.

4- As I mentioned, finding a robotics team which won the national championship.

5- Making an app for a famous charity non-profit which you can easily donate with, raised over $10k (and this is HUGE money for charity for my country's standarts.)


6- Having the 2nd place in the national Math olympiads. (Also passed the first exam for physics but I couldn't get into the top 3 on that one.)


7- Internship at a research center about neurology.




**Essays:** They were too personal and heartfelt. Maybe too informal, but I think they still define me well. I still have a year to work on them tho.



-------------------------------

So yeah, I'd be confident if I were coming from a magnet school but everyone who goes to the Ivies or T10's from my country attend these magnet schools. Although my school is successful at the national exams, they have never sent a student to US. So yeah, I'm kinda nervous because of this one. Please tell me what to do. Should I aim big and hope they'll believe me or should I take a step back and apply to T30-40s or something?

Recently I began looking into switching my career path to IT. A friend got me interested in the field. I know that the technical side of IT is important but I’ve heard that the “soft skills” are too. I have a bachelors of science from Purdue university and I have been working as a registered behavioral technician for about a year now. I’ve been looking at different areas that I could apply my skills/knowledge to that I already have. Computer and Information Systems Manager is something I keep running into. It’s management so my psych background is helpful there. I just don’t know if there’s a different area of IT that would be easier for me to get into with my background. Is there? If not, then my big question is, what do I need to do to land a job like that? I know there’s certifications out there but I’m not too sure which ones would be the most helpful. Again I don’t know much about the technical side of IT so that’s a factor. I work full time and I’m willing to spend a couple hours a day on furthering my education or doing some type of part time internship. Any guidance would be really appreciated."

Im basically the only engineer there so I had to architect some solutions by myself and that has definitely been both immensely challenging but really fun. I just finished a major project, everything is looking good but they offered me the opportunity to redesign the backend infrastructure over the summer. The thing is I don't really love the company. The CEO is a business major and usually throws out unrealistic expectations and also Im underpaid for what I do.

The problem is I have a year and a half left, in school and I dont have an internship lined up for the summer. I can build out some apis for you but my algorithm skills are not the best. I've been working to improve and I've been getting better but by now all the great internships are gone and it feels like there's nothing left.

Im not sure if I should take the opportunity to redesign backend, search for an internship or spend the summer working on leetcode and projects so I can do better next year.

They always suspected that I was up to no good, and would try to catch me doing anything wrong. They had absurd rules, and I felt like I had to tiptoe around them since I was 7 yrs old. I always felt like I was disappointing my mother with anything I did, she never seemed to be content with me. I would try to please them, try to be a good daughter, listen to them.

Now I am in university, in another country, and 1 month away from graduating. I thought the study abroad experience would instill some faith and trust in them for me --- after all, my grades are good,  I have a full time job lined up before graduating, did an internship last year, have research and extracurricular experiences. My parents believe that I am lying about the full-time job, even though the internship last year was at the same company. They ask for proof for anything I do. each semester they ask for a screenshot of my grades. I know that they want to see an offer letter from the company but they dont ask to see this. I suspect if I show them an full-time(FT) offer letter, they will stop thinking I am lying/deceiving them about the FT job. But at the same time, I dont want to show them the offer letter because its none of their business. This is only 1 example of how they dont trust their 23 yr old adult daughter. Even though this daughter has successfully navigated studying and living in another culture, handles stuff like taxes, rent on her own.

I used to be able to ignore the way they distrust me. But I am tired of it. I dont want to play this game anymore where I have to defend my actions to them all the time, often on multiple occasions, since they apparently forgot/dont listen to anything I told them previously. Example, my dad called me yesterday, saying that he found an internship for Summer 2021 I can apply to(as if I am looking for work rn, I ALREADY HAVE A JOB!) I told him that how would I work the internship because I have to start my new work from June. He was like, ""Oh! They gave the full-time job offer letter right? You sure right?"" This made me so mad, like they know that I got the full-time offer letter in August of last year. I told them then, and yet he says this in April 2021!!! WTF. They do this with any accomplishment in my life, just doubt it. 

Also: I have to repeat everything I say to them, like 10 times. They ask the same questions over and over again, have the same conversations, as if we didnt just have this conversation like 2 days ago! Yeah I know they are in their fifties, but come on, try to retain something I say !! It makes me think that they honestly dont listen to a single word I say. 

The problem is, they are paying for my undergrad tuition. Also, if I ever speak up, I end up crying angry tears and they just dismiss me as a 'emotional' girl. Also, my mother's words hurt so much. She can be very cruel when belittling me.

I want to go non-contact with them in the future, because I never felt loved and appreciated as a child, and even now. I have no emotional attachment to the people I call 'my parents'. I went 'silent treatment' with my mother(she is the more toxic/abusive one) at 15, and now only talk to her to convey information that I absolutely need to. I have no problem cutting myself off from this family. My only worry is that: my sister. I love my sister, she is the only family member I can talk freely to. My mother tried to drive a wedge between us when we were younger. From when I was 10 yrs old, she blatantly plays favorites with my sister, taunts me that my sister is better than me at everything ,indirectly insulting me for being useless. But it hasnt ever stopped me from loving my sister because its not my sister's fault that we have a mother that compares us like this.

I intend to go NC after 4-5 years, when my sister will be in 2 or 3rd year of university. Also, my parents are the type where they will contact the police if I suddenly stop answering my phone one day(if I go NC). They can navigate apps and internet well too. They will lie to the police if they need to, in order to get to me.

I live in the United States. My plan to go NC is I will talk to them, tell them that I dont want to talk to them anymore and ask them to stop trying to contact me. I KNOW that they will not listen, so when I dont answer my phone/email they will go to the police(in the States and in their country), probably make up some story about me going missing or something. I want to know if there is anything legal I can do(like maybe talk to the police) so that whatever they do, wont affect me, atleast legally. I dont want the police tracking me down and giving my address to my parents.

More importantly, has anyone gone NC with their parents while being in contact with their sibling(s)?"
mkoyfn,1,2021-04-05,Job experience bias,brittonashford,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/mkoyfn/job_experience_bias/,"Hello!

I am trying to transition to an entry-level software developer position (full stack or otherwise), and am finding that most employers won’t give me much consideration unless I have JOB experience with a given language. 

Here’s my background: I have been working as a client-facing developer for the last 5.5 years. In this role, I use VB.Net and SQL as well as a lot of proprietary GUIs to build functionality for our clients. Much of the architecture is black boxed, which is frustrating, but part of the company’s approach.

So, my job experience is obviously esoteric/dated, but at the end if the day, I have 5+ years of OOP experience. What’s more, I have taken classes and read books on my own to learn JavaScript, Python, MongoDB, etc. and learned Java in school.

I feel comfortable writing code in all of those languages. I might have to look up the syntax for some things, but I know I could adapt easily.

How do I get employers to give me a chance? I have literally seen a company hire an intern over me and I am feeling really frustrated. 

It seems that MOOCs, self study, bootcamps, etc. aren’t taken very seriously:/

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

My resume isn't bad by any means; I have some interesting projects and I'm an IA for a programming course. My GPA is also pretty competetive at a 3.95, and I've already taken EECS 281. 

Overall, I've been pretty actively applying since October. So far, I've applied to about 150 internships, and I've received 5 interviews; all leading to rejections. Keep in mind the companies I received interviews for were tiny local companies.

Do I need to apply with actual referrals, or what? Or maybe my interviewing skills are subpar? Maybe applying on LinkedIn and Handshake isn't viable? Or maybe it's just the case that it's super rare for underclassmen to get internships, even though most of the people I know have things lined up for the summer?

This is a bit of a rant, but I want to get a good internship for next summer as a rising senior, and I feel like not doing anything this summer will hurt my chances. What are some backups I should be considering for this summer?"

mkqc32,1,2021-04-05,I got a great offer and I don't know if I should take it. Comfort vs ambition,claudiassofia91,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mkqc32/i_got_a_great_offer_and_i_dont_know_if_i_should/,"So, I live in a country in Southwestern Europe. This is relevant because of the logistics of what I'm going to explain in a second. Law is the first degree where I'm from, not a second degree.

So I majored in Law, and I decided after university to do the legal internship (2 years) that would make me a lawyer by the end of it.

I had really good grades in University which in theory would mean I would be able to apply and have a chance at any of the big law firms where I'm from to do the internship. It is important to state that the smaller firms don't usually pay their interns. Yes, you might have to do an unpaid two-year internship, which is why I wanted to get into the bigger ones, where they pay and they pay a lot by my country standards.

Well, I didn't get into any of the bigger ones, much to my dismay and frustration. Instead, I got into a medium-sized one, that does pay, but not a lot. I had a lot of problems integrating the team in the beginning, mainly because there's a serious disconnect between what you learn in university and what you do while practicing law, and I felt suuuuper dumb. Additionally, my social anxiety really hindered me from connecting in a professional or personal way with anyone. So it was a mess and I looked everywhere for another place I could go do my internship.

I never got any paying offers though and I decided to stay. Well, slowly, things turned around. I started to get used to things, I learned from my mistakes and I started to learn.

Even though I still have bad days and my anxiety still makes me see problems where there aren't any (e.g. if my boss's voice sounds more distant, I immediately freak out internally that he is unhappy with me), for the most part, I like the job. I'm unhappy with the low pay, but because it's just an internship I keep thinking I have all my life to make money. Additionally, they're going to increase pay a little bit after the first year, in a few months.

Well, one of the bigger companies wants me now. They called today. It's still not one of the biggest, but it's generally more reputable than the one I'm on.

Additionally, the pay is close to double what I make now and if I'm honest that is the part that tempts me more.

Well, now that I have the offer I don't know if I want to take it. I clearly discovered I have serious integration issues and am not very adaptable. Additionally, even though this is a bigger firm in general, I would be working in an office with only 4 people, three of them would be my bosses, not close at all to my age and who seem to be very stuffy (uptight/formal) people (maybe you would expect this from people in law, but in my admittedly limited experience people are for the most part really nice and hate the pompous aspects of being a lawyer). In my current position, I have tons of people my age, so I always have someone to speak with and to vent. I am a person that needs people.

There's only one person my age there and I contacted him to know what's up (I knew him in college). He basically told me he hates it there. He likes the work but doesn't like the bosses, they don't treat him that great, they aren't flexible, etc. etc. He basically told me he regrets taking the internship there.

That added to the fact that I am honestly fine where I am is really making me not want to change. Am I crazy for not accepting a position with that much of a pay raise? I have always been an ambitious person, and I'm afraid that I'm choosing my comfort over the advancement of my career.

At the same time, I'm super young (23F), I'm still finishing my Masters. It's insane to be afraid that no other opportunities will present themselves, right?

I've asked quite a few people in my life what to do and the responses have been mixed. Some people are like: I understand what you're saying but you can be there for a year until you finish your internship and then you leave and you made a lot of money. Other people are like: well, you have your whole life to make money, your internship is to learn and you'll learn better where you feel good, so you should stay.

I'm really lost on what to do. It's true I want to stay but I'm afraid I'll come to regret it or that other opportunities won't present themselves.

TL;DR: got a job offer that includes huge salary raise, but I'm comfortable in my position and I don't really want to leave it. At the same time, I don't want to ruin my future chances by choosing what's comfortable for me at this time in a highly competitive field in the middle of a global crisis."

My girlfriend of 3yrs and I had planned to do a program called Jinternship for a while now. They require you have an internship in Israel, and they pay for your stay over the Summer. So it has been a dream of ours to travel abroad together for, what is likely, our last Summer together before graduating.

I have been interviewing with this company, and at first they were cool with it. They did not seem to care if I worked in Israel. However, upon receiving my offer today, I asked again if it was okay for me to be in Israel. They seemed uncertain, but said they had considered since our last talk and the 7hr time zone difference would be a big rift they are not sure if they are okay with. So, they told me it will likely be this internship or Israel.

Upon telling my girlfriend, she was not happy of course. It would be 3 months apart, and she has been looking forward to this trip. So initially she said it would cause a big rift in our relationship if she were to go to Israel alone, and she feels like I am basically between a rock and a hard place. Forced to decided between her and the internship, since she has an internship lined up already at a good university and was really looking forward to it for the past 4 months. 

So, I am left a few options:

1) I try to convince my new boss. Regardless of his answer, I go to Israel anyways. If I work 9-5, 7hr time-zone lag, I will work 4pm-12am. Which I know I can make work.

2) I stay in the US, and make my gf decide between going to Israel or giving up a very solid experience for me.

I want advice on both, but mainly on the first option. Has anyone done this? What are my chances of getting caught and losing the internship? What things may I be overlooking by choosing this route?"

I also have a 4.0 currently and feel confident I could continue to get great grades here (big fish in small pond).

I’m majoring in finance and want to work in non-sales finance. I’m strongly considering becoming a financial analyst and eventually getting my CFA. My question is should I stay at my small college or switch to the large state school nearby (university of Texas), assuming I can. I would be unable to run track there (I’m not good enough) and would not realistically be part of student body government, however I’m certain I could find clubs or extracurriculares to join.

UT would be cheaper and probably a better education if I get into McCombs, their business school. However, part of staying in my current school would be that they require internships to graduate. In other words, I would get a finance internships at my current university that I might not be able to get at the larger school.

With all that in mind, do you have any advice on which school would be better to go to for entering my future school? Better grades at a smaller college with an internship or slightly worse grades at a larger, more recognized school without the guarantee of an internship?

My life right now is garbage. I study as an EU student in the UK but currently due to restrictions imposed in January I am staying with my parents (I went home for Christmas and was supposed to go back for start of second term, but I couldn't). With covid everything is closed, and the few friends that I have from highschool are scattered around the country because they went to unis there. I have very little human contact outside my family, if any.

Things with my gf are going to shit for the past months as well. She lives and studies across the country but due to how the degree is difficult she literally has no time for me - even when I came for visit, she would wake up at 9, study till 2 AM only with breaks for quick food, then sometimes get hammered with friends, go to sleep at 6 AM and repeat. No weekends breaks, no holidays, no nothing. We used to call for hours, now it's few minutes here and there with little to talk about, as she only does uni. Seriously thinking about breaking up with her for the past months, but I keep saying to myself that I'll give her time till summer holidays and then decide.

I am a Math Major, but during covid I last summer I decided to pick up coding - I believe I know a fair bit of Python and can solve some LC mediums - trying to work on it but usually after uni stuff I have little energy to do more work - I wanna have fun and just chill, I can't psychically study all day every day. I absolutely cannot find any internships - in my country it's not a thing at all, and even though I usually impress the companies, mainly due to studying in the UK on a better uni than any in this country are, but it fails on the thing that I can only work during summer. I can land anything in the US and in the UK, as the uni is not so impressive, even though it's top 10-15 UK. I've been applying for over half a year now, and nothing seems to work. I just can't, but I keep pushing myself. It's depressing tho, not sure for how much longer I can go.

I never had this bad of a period in my life before covid. There were bad times, but I would always vent them through computer games, and sometimes just doing something with friends. My gaming rig is in the UK however with no way to get it here, so for the past 4 months I am unable to use my usual ways to stay happy - I tried numerous things (mindfulness and breathing exercises, started running, the famous Yale course) and while they do help a bit, I know what would help the most.

My uni grades are dropping due to all this - last term I managed straight As in hopes of going to Oxbridge for Masters. I also have a somewhat prestigious bursary to study abroad - I am central Europe so UK is very expensive for me (for example it's an issue to pay the fees for tests when arriving to the UK and that's why I am stuck here) and I wouldn't be able to study here at all without it. I see this as an incredible achievement as there are some very wealthy people(Forbes global top 50) behind the foundation that sponsors me and I was the one that impressed them, but the imposter syndrome is real here and now that the grades are going to shit it's haunting me more than ever.

Please help. Any thoughts or things that helped you stay happy are also welcome.

TLDR: Everything is collapsing, nothing is working out and it's getting even worse. Getting very sad as there's little I can do, or atleast it's what it seems. I need advice / help on what to do."

Since recruiting season is right around the corner, how would you feel about a service that would hold mock interviews for internships at top tech companies? Unlike existing companies on the market which can run upwards of one to two hundred dollars an hour, we would charge reasonable prices for our services and you would be guaranteed to speak to someone one with at least one FAANG or Big N internship under their belt. We also have teaching experience as teaching assistants, tutors, and volunteers. In our mock interviews our team will provide you with resume pointers, insights into commonly asked questions (both technical and behavioral), and offer relevant interviewing experience to aspiring interns, as well as a timeline of prep work leading up to the interview. 

Please let us know your thoughts! If you are interested in our services or collaborating as an interviewer, shoot us an email at: [theinternviewers@gmail.com](mailto:theinternviewers@gmail.com)"
mkt3pj,0,2021-04-05,How do you know if you should transfer?,stres7,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mkt3pj/how_do_you_know_if_you_should_transfer/,"I am currently finishing my sophomore year at my dream school majoring in computer science. It’s a very large school and the cs program is pretty high for ranking (top 20). However I have found the program to be awful, the class sizes are 300+ and no matter who I reach out to it’s hard to get help. Tutoring is always fully booked, office hours include so many students it’s near impossible to get one on one help. I’ve been to every internship fair and applied everywhere and gotten no internship for this summer or any meaningful connections from my school. I understand things are difficult with covid but I was on campus for my first year and it was the same way. The program is extremely competitive and cheating is very common because of this. It’s so competitive it seems the school takes pride in the dropout rate of the program. I wanted to go to this school because of its high ranking and job opportunities, most students get a job out of this program with 70k starting (from what I’ve heard). But I hate the program and I feel like I have no resources for help and my school doesn’t care about my success. I’ve written to faculty about this and they pretty much said they are doing their best and they can’t really afford to hire more tutors and get more TAs. I’m debating transferring to a smaller school where class sizes are 40 maximum. But places like Amazon and Google don’t tend to recruit people from this school and it is not highly ranked for cs schools at all. I know I could be happier there and have less of a work load and competitiveness, and also have way more resources and the ability to get to know the staff more, but I’d lose the ranking and level of job opportunities and out of college pay that I’d get from my current school. I don’t plan to live where I am currently once I graduate, so I’m worried that this small school will look bad on my resume since it’s not widely known, especially since my current school may get recognized out of state. I’m really not sure if I’ll regret leaving since I’m already halfway through, or if it’s worth leaving for an unknown school where I’d get more of a personal education and connections?"
mkt4y9,2,2021-04-05,How do I stop feeling like I’m not doing things right and I’m running out of time?,Practical_Pop_665,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mkt4y9/how_do_i_stop_feeling_like_im_not_doing_things/,"So I’m a freshman in college now i’m not even 20 yet and i constantly feel like i’ve already wasted my life! up until my junior year i wanted to be a psych major and be a psychologist but i kept being told that being a psych major was pointless and should think of something different. I decided my senior year that I’d take the doctor route and become a psychiatrist and that would be the career path i’d take. THEN i got nervous because I didn’t want to be 30 and just barely have a career.  So here I chose to enter college undecided so I’d have time to declare a major and figure out what I want to do. It’s been really fuckin hard because my entire first year has been online, I barely had the chance to get hands on experience with anything. Even internships are online and it makes things difficult because i’m not just a visual person. I couldn’t possibly decide that I want to do  something if I haven’t had the chance to try it out.  I did take a politics class and my professor was also a lawyer, which got me slightly interested because she seemed to love it. I took the brief idea and ran with it and now I’m a poli sci major with intentions of going to law school (or at least that’s what I told everyone) People always emphasize getting a job where you’re passionate about your work, but I feel like I’m not PASSIONATE about law or anything really i’m slightly interested in everything I feel like  and that worries me because what if I do end up hating it when I’m older??? Is it really as simple as quitting your job and doing something new because I doubt it. Can I just add that I think it’s bogus that 19 year old me has to decide what I’m gonna do forever??? Idk who to talk to because none of my family members went to college and they just want to see me successful or whatever. How do I fix this?"

While EY pays slightly more then Geico and they’re both remote, I am looking for the best opportunity for this summer. if i choose EY i want to make sure it’s absolutely the best option as I would be re negging the Geico offer which could potentially make things look bad.

Is this right for me?,4th_Of_July,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mktdpv/having_a_midcollege_crisis_and_not_sure_what_to/,"I was just in the cs career questions sub reading a post and found myself super bummed out. Someone posted their resume complaining that they haven't been able to get a job for 3 years post-graduation. My naive ass thought the resume was genuinely pretty good, but all the comments in that post were pointing out how there's not enough side projects, internships, experience, etc. and how they should be devoting their free time to these things to 'prove' to their future employers that they're dedicated to CS. 

Is this really the state of the CS industry now? My buddy has an accounting degree and got a job within a few months of graduating, with 1 short summer internship. Not to mention I don't think there's even any such thing as ""side projects"" in accounting (he didn't have any a least). 

I'm in my junior year at college with good grades (honors, all that good stuff), I do enjoy it and have a couple half-baked side projects and one I'm very slowly chipping away on, but I also work part-time have other hobbies I'm more passionate about like photography and rock climbing and mountain biking (ie, things I can't put on a CS resume). Like I said I like coding but I don't want to spend all my time doing it.

That is all just to say, I'm just wondering is there any space in this industry for someone who doesn't necessarily want to eat, breathe and sleep CS? Will I be totally screwed with just a Bachelors degree and decent GPA to hold me up?

Edit: Wow thank you guys so much for all the great advice and kind words, I sincerely appreciate all of it. I wish I had time to reply to each comment but just know I'm soaking up all your guys' wisdom, thank you!"

Never landed an internship, didn't go to an elite school, so it was very difficult landing this first job, but I did have some projects, a very strong GPA, and network connection to secure the interview.  Then I interviewed really well and accepted their offer.  Comp is pretty meh for a very HCOL area.

It's at a large fortune 500 company as a backend software engineer; however, I quickly learned that the engineering department is rather small.  Myself and three senior engineers among a larger team of business people.

At first, I really enjoyed it and was just psyched to be working full time as a dev.  And I learned that I DO very much enjoy the work, and this career is definitely for me.  But the cracks at my company have started to show over these past few weeks.  These past two weeks in-particular have been unbearable.  

I was on-boarded and currently work 100% remote due to the pandemic.  It's been really, really hard to establish relationships and grow due to this fact.  My manager is more of a tech lead and has never had any direct reports before me.  He's a nice guy and helpful if I push him, but he really doesn't seem at all interested in helping me grow.  Everything on zoom is transactional as fuck, and it feels extra depressing working in silence for the majority of my day broken up by 15-minute meetings where two people go back and forth really fast on something I have little context until they finish and everyone immediately drops.

As a junior, I don't get a lot of control on my projects (understandably), but it always feels like pulling teeth to try and get context on any project I'm assigned.  I mainly get assigned micro-tasks (fix this bug here, that bug there)/grunt work (understandable to some degree), but my manager is totally disinterested in reviewing my own goals or helping me understand the general goals of the business.

Furthermore, although the everyone is really nice, the culture can be super frustrating sometimes.  Everyone is so concerned with their own individual shit that they often lose sight of what we're trying to achieve as a group.  And when I first joined, I thought leadership was awesome since they were all really nice and welcoming in the beginning, and they say all the rights things.  But from the way our team works, I'm really starting to question the quality of the leadership.  We are never allocated any time for documentation (oh, right, I have to figure out our entire codebase and tech stack with very minimal documentation.  Then senior engineers get annoyed when I pester them with questions), I always feel rushed to start coding without planning ahead, my questions about potential next steps/where-does-this-project-end-up are always shut down, and worst of all we prioritize shipping absolute dogshit code (not even ""bad"" code.. I mean like... 5k lines of dense logic nested in for-loops and if-else statements written linearly) that we know will break in the future because it's more important to meet the deadline as not to upset leadership.

I'm getting overwhelmed with frustration and not sure what to do.  I am frustrated that we can't be in office, frustrated that nobody really provides me guidance, frustrated that we essentially sabotage our projects for the sake of optics.

I'm naturally a very ambitious person and really want to do well both individually but also as part of a team.  I feel like due to the pandemic I'm playing the game with my hands tied behind my back.  Recently, I've been doing just the bare minimum to keep people off my back like some of my team members seem to do, but I really fucking hate this.  It's just not who I am and not the kind of professional attitude I want to adopt.

I know there will be no perfect company, and at least some of these issues will be present in otherwise great companies, but I feel like it has to be better, right?  I feel like I'm too young and early in my career to become so bitter and jaded about soul-sucking cOrPoraTe AmErICa.  

My intuition and everyone I talked to has told me to stick it out for 12-18 months, then bounce.  But after these last two weeks, another 4 months seems like for-fucking ever.  I really don't know if I'm going to make it.  Would it be looked down upon to dip after 9 months?  Should I just try to do the bare minimum to avoid getting fired then leave after 12-18 months?  Should I try to talk to my manager to improve things even though he seems not super receptive to managerial duties?

RANT ABOUT THESE LAST TWO WEEKS:
These last two weeks have been increasingly frustrating and stressful.  We had won a government contract, and as part of that contract, we apparently promised a turn-around time of 1 day on this project.  Which no one told me about.  So I am given this sample dataset and told to write a python script to do X task in preparation for this project.  Cool, I can handle that, and I do.  Then the day of this project, I get called into a meeting and apparently my script isn't working.  I take a look, and it turns out the sample data provided to me to create the script is not at ALL like the data in full dataset.  So I try my best to explain this to these senior executives, and of course all they understand is ""script no work, code monkey fucked up.""  So I spent the next few hours sharing my screen and being watched by all these execs while I debug my script for this major project with hundreds of millions in impact.  For the first time, my hands were literally shaking as I typed because I felt so much pressure."

I'm interested in pivoting from sales and trading to strategy consulting. Was excited to get into Yale, Fuqua, Kellogg and Darden but I'm ultimately torn between the last two....

For context, I went to UVA undergrad and LOVED it. I'm from VA and currently live in CLT so have always lived in the Southeast and enjoy that area / culture. Some major criteria for me are:

$$ - received half tuition and a Forte fellowship at Darden (vs. nothing at Kellogg)

Location - would prefer warmer weather in Cville but am also intrigued by living so close to a big city like Chicago. ultimately want to end up on the East Coast.

Social life - seems like the student culture is similar at both

Brand Power - Kellogg wins here for rankings/network

Consulting recruiting - they seem neck and neck on this one based on my research

Relationships - family based in VA and boyfriend staying in CLT, so Darden would be easier on this one

Part of me applied to school for a new experience and I am worried I am doing myself a disservice if I return to UVA. I know that my internship will give me an opportunity to explore a new city / part of the country, but I'm not sure if I'm making a mistake by not branching out further now.

mkwha0,8,2021-04-05,I'm legally blind. I keep being rejected for jobs in the field of mental health when I mention during interviews that I (obviously!) cannot drive a car to transport clients when needed. That's it – I give up! I'm DONE!,TwinPurpleEagle,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mkwha0/im_legally_blind_i_keep_being_rejected_for_jobs/,"I'm currently an undergraduate college student in my junior year majoring in Psychology with plans to attend graduate school and get a Master’s degree in mental health counseling to become a therapist (MFT licensure). I live in southern California.

I'm legally blind so I am unable to drive a car. I am completely blind in my left eye and have 20/200 vision in my right. It's blatantly obvious because I wear glasses with one centimeter thick prism-like concave lenses. I have no depth perception nor peripheral vision, but I do have enough functional central vision for ambulatory vision (being able to see objects and move around a room without stumbling or bumping into things) without the need for a white cane. Especially here in southern California where public transportation is nonexistent, not being able to drive makes it nearly impossible to be independent.

I'm trying my best to look for internships or part time jobs where I could work directly with clients struggling with mental health issues. I decided to apply to mental health treatment programs near me (inpatient care, residential treatment facilities, day treatment programs, etc) for direct care staff/mental health technician floor staff positions. I have chosen treatment facilities where clients stay in one place all day long so it's doable for my limitations (i.e, no home based therapy or field based work driving from client to client, so ABA therapy is out of the question – believe me, I've already tried). Every place I have applied to requires a driver's license to transport clients to medical appointments, community outings, etc.

I've managed to land about 7-8 interviews throughout the past month, so I think my resume is pretty good for a college student with limited experience. I do not mention that I am legally blind or anything of that nature on my resume.

However, in every single one of these interviews, things go great until I mention ""I'm legally blind so I am unable to drive a car. I do have reliable transportation (paratransit/Uber) to get to work on time and I do not require any additional accommodations otherwise. I just cannot drive clients to appointments or other services in the company vehicle when at the facility. Is that OK?""

I've received the following responses from the program directors that have interviewed me:

-	""Good question. I'm not sure. Let me ask HR and get back to you."" The next day I was told ""Your interview was great and we'd love to have you, but being able to drive is considered an essential function according to HR. If a client has an emergency and needs to go to the ER or something, staff needs to be able to drive them. I'm very sorry.""
-	""Sorry. Our insurance company requires that all employees be able to drive for liability purposes.""
-	""Sorry. We require all of our employees to be able to drive. And no, it can't be another coworker with you who does the driving for you.""

One residential treatment center for substance abuse I interviewed at back in January made my blood boil. I was told during the interview that being unable to drive wouldn't be an issue. I was offered the position – signed the offer letter, W-2, direct deposit information, employee handbook, etc and turned in all the hiring paperwork. I was then told to expect an email soon from HireRight to proceed with the background check...3 days passed and I hadn't yet received any emails. Worried, I went back to the website where I had applied for the job – and sure enough, I found the job opening for the exact same position with the exact same shift schedule and pay had been reposted. I called the treatment facility and was told that they had changed their minds, being unable to drive would unfortunately be an issue.

Just today, I followed up with HR about another Residential Aide position I had applied for at a long term residential facility in California specifically for blind adults over the age of 21 with multiple disabilities who cannot live independently. It sounded like a perfect fit! I was interviewed on March 2nd about a Residential Aide position. When I explained that I'm actually legally blind myself and don't have a driver's license, the facility manager told me it wouldn't be a problem because there's plenty of other staff members that can drive if needed. She was so impressed, she offered me the position on the spot and told me that HR would be calling me shortly.

Unfortunately no one ever did, and HR called me Friday morning to inform me that – yep, you guessed it – the position requires a valid driver's license. Umm...excuse me? All of the clients are blind or visually impaired themselves – so that is beyond terribly hypocritical – and it makes my blood boil even more than the last incident described above!

I'm just so frustrated with all this discrimination I'm facing all because I am legally blind and cannot drive a car – all things that are not even within my control. I am well aware that the rate of employment for persons with disabilities (17.9%) is much lower than that of the general population (61.8% as of 2020), but I had never experienced first hand exactly why that is until now. I don't know what to do or who I could contact that would be able to help me with this. I'm on the verge of giving up, quite frankly – and even if my determination wasn't dwindling, there's only so many companies around the area and I'm actually running out of places to apply to!"

Stupid question, but will I face any trouble getting a new grad position if I apply for full-time jobs in the September-November timeframe (what normally would be internship application season), and expect to start in January?

Im a aspiring full stack developer, currently working my first web development internship.

My laptop has seen better days, and I world love to treat myself to an upgrade with the money I have been saving up for quite a while now. 

I have heard a lot about issues with stuff not working with the M1 chip, and compatibility issues working with people who don’t have the M1 version. I’m bit confused by it all, is this something that I need to worry about? 

For context, I work with the MERN stack. I would also like to learn and work on React native projects this summer.

I work at the quallity team, so i bascilay make sure that the product( simulation software for power systems) are working. That means testing new modules that the dev team creates or new features. I also work at the support for customers, so i need to help them and some times pass their demand to the devs team. Latelty i also have been helping the interns.

My daily tasks feels so boring and so little meaningful, i actually dont know if work is supose to feel like that. 

I dont mind doing a shit job for some time and eventually get promoted for a better position that does cooler things. But at my company or i will became a dev that code at c++ that i dont like, or i will take my boss position that also do stuffs that i think is boring.

At College i always wanted to work with electrical machines and design, but at my country almost every machine is bought from other countries. After graduate i had recieved so many shit offers that i accepted the first job that would hire me as enginner. 

Did i made a bad decision on accepting this opportunity? Should i try to chase the dream of finding some job that i will like ?

I always thought that everyone hated working, but last week i talked to a friend who works as a medical doctor  and he said ""i love my job, i want to work until my last day of life"" that really fucked me up.

Any comment from you guys that have been throught what i feeling and have a lot more working time will be helpful on getting another sight on the issue.

mkxn3n,15,2021-04-05,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (4/05/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/mkxn3n/weekly_job_qa_thread_4052021/,"Hi all,

Here is the fifty-eighth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I'm a new grad who just got an amazing offer from a company and I'm extremely excited and blessed to find opportunity right now. Everything is better than I could have hoped for, from the work that I'll be doing, to the compensation, but there is one small thing that worries me. The position that I am accepting is technically non-entry level. I have about 12 months of internship experience, but I'll be working in an area that I don't have a ton of experience in (ML), and the team that hired me is aware of this, but I'm feeling a bit of pressure. Furthermore, the team that hired told me throughout the interview process that they want someone to bring some solid SE practices to the team, as much of the team doesn't have a form CS education and come from the math side of academia. I went through a pretty rigorous program, but I'm feeling a bit worried because my background is definitely more in the math and theoretical CS side of things. I'm starting in a month and was hoping for some resources where I could work on those skills before the job starts. 

Cheers."
mkzrc6,1,2021-04-05,When hiring an intern or new grad what is a startup typically looking for?,lifelifebalance,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/mkzrc6/when_hiring_an_intern_or_new_grad_what_is_a/,"I've reached out to a startup and they have agreed to meet with me remotely next week. I'm wondering what they are likely looking for in an intern in terms of a long-term timeframe. Not so that I can mold myself into that person but because I want to be honest about my goals in life when they ask me about them.

Am I the wrong fit for working at a startup if my intentions are to eventually start a startup of my own? I believe in this companies mission and what they do but I don't think it would be completely honest to say that I want to be an employee there for the rest of my life. If I was in their shoes as a co-founder though my opinion would be different, this company would definitely be something I would be happy to spent my time on for the long term. I find it unlikely that this is what they would be looking for in an intern though. Am I wrong about that?

I am not saying that I believe I am instantly qualified to be a key member of every company ever created I just know that I am not the kind of person that wants to settle into an employee role and live comfortably making a salary for the rest of their life. I want to build something meaningful.  I don't want to give them the wrong impression and I'm really unsure of how to answer bigger picture questions about my goals and aspirations in this situation.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

(For context, if necessary - I'm an overthinking INFP, I enjoy helping people and am an empathetic person, but being pushed to perform in sprints while drowning in a lonely dark hole of bugs is pretty much my worst nightmare and led to breakdowns every couple days, so it's not my cup of tea.

ml242d,7,2021-04-05,Any advice for someone with a very large gap in their work history?,spikey4000,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ml242d/any_advice_for_someone_with_a_very_large_gap_in/,"From 2010 to 2014 I was working on a Computer Science degree, which I quit about 85% of the way through due to mental health issues that were making it untenable to continue. I never did any internships or anything. Shockingly, said mental health issues didn't improve once I was back home with nothing to do, none of the support available that I had in university, and no way to leave the house on a consistent schedule, so I ended up sitting around doing basically nothing for years. At the end of 2019, I started actually trying to get help again, and in August of last year I started working a fast food job 2 days a week. This is the first job I've ever had. That leaves a gap of about 5.5 years during which I was neither in school nor working.

Now I'm looking at IT as a potential way out of this mess. Since I'm only working 2 days a week and still living with my dad, I have plenty of time to study for certs and mess with homelab stuff if I want to. I have about $30,000 in defaulted student loans disqualifying me from further aid (which would take me a little over 4 years to pay back with my current job assuming no other expenses), so I'm not sure if going back for more school is a realistic option. 

My worry is that with so much competition from everyone trying to make this exact transition due to this pandemic business, even if I do all that I'll get my applications dismissed instantly when they see that I wasn't working for over 5 years. [This experiment](https://www.resumego.net/research/resume-employment-gaps/) found a roughly 3% callback rate for people with a gap of 5+ years in 2019 (granted, not for IT specifically), so I have to assume it's worse now and that the average number of jobs I'd have to apply to to even hear back might be greater than the number of openings available in my area. It's been discouraging me from even trying, and I'd love to be convinced that this is doable without a lot of luck."

I graduated August 2020.  I had a part time TA job that ended shortly thereafter.  My thesis project was basically a remote software developer internship, but not technically.  I thought an undergrad in computer science, plus a relatively practical thesis, plus a former career (ie, I have soft skills) would've been enough to get plenty of responses from companies.  It hasn't come close.    


Some opportunities evaporated because of COVID. I got far for a data analyst role out-of-state, but I never heard back after I submitted a form that asked for salary expectations ($70-$80k was the range I inputted. learned a lesson there, and that's to ask what the budget is for the position during the first interview.)  I was recently approached about another data analyst role in NY (again, out-of-state) that was paying 52k - yeah, no thanks.  The Indian bodyshops contacted me several times already, but I ignored those messages based on what I read on this subreddit.  Recruiters asked for my resume for several software developer roles after saying I'd be a good fit, but I never hear back.  A few others tried to entice me with business analyst positions with little to no technical skill-set required.  Why would I go back to school to get a technical degree to work in a non-technical position?  


I've applied to about 140-150 companies either directly or indirectly (sending resume to recruiter who reached out on LinkedIn).  I tailor my resume and cover letter for most of those applications, which ranged from software engineer to technical business analyst.  I reached out to a few contacts, including friends of my parents and siblings.  Several of these contacts (including a technical recruiter) helped a lot in refining my resume.  But I don't think it'll be enough.  


I completed several toy apps before I went back to university for a CS degree.  Since graduating, all I have to show for it is a login and registration portal with Java, Spring Boot and SQL.  The plan was to build something I find interesting, but I lost interest.  Perhaps it's because of the tech stack.  Perhaps the lack of positive feedback from the job hunt is weighing me down.  My lack of job hunting success is probably part resume (now fixed) but probably also lack of a sophisticated portfolio to show hiring managers.  Some on this subreddit might respond with, ""Build a web app with Node and React!"".  I enjoyed most of the CS classes, debugging, programming, etc, but I'm filled with a sense of apathy after all these months.  I'm not sure where to go from here."

So I decided to change my speaking voice in interviews and sound like I have more energy. I still got rejected from more places. Then today I got rejected from a company I really wanted to work at and their feedback was “we really liked you and think you have a bright future ahead of you however, we feel that you do not have enough experience for the role”

I would’ve believe that excuse if I didn’t find out who got the role. The person who got the role has no experience at all so it felt like a slap in the face.

I am now going to an internship that rejected me originally but called me back because their interns quit.

University: Indian Tier 2

2 Research internships

2 second author publications at EMNLP and WSDM,

1 first author at EACL

GRE: 325 (169, 156, 4.0)

TOEFL: 103 (L29, R26, W22, S26)

I quickly wrote my SOP and got it reviewed by my friends, advisor, a couple of seniors and a prof from UCSD with whom I had worked on a paper and another prof who is Area Chair (AC) at tier 1 conferences. The point of mentioning this was that I feel my SOP was strong.

I had 3 LOR, 2 from my university (1 from my advisor who is also the HOD) and 1 from the AC  prof. I think the recommendations were also strong.

I applied to CMU (MLT) and UIUC, UMD, UT AUSTIN, Georgia Tech (MS CS).

Yesterday, I got my fifth reject, from Georgia Tech (haven't got the official rejection mail from UMD, but it's expected to come this week). 

I'm totally devasted, I don't know what to do and what was my profile lacking. I thought UT Austin and Georgia Tech was within my reach. I also saw profile of people who got in (congratulations to them) on grad cafe and I belief I had a better profile than a bunch of them.

I call for help, I have no idea what to could have been the reason for all these rejects. Definitely the TOEFL score is low, I'll give it again and will aim ~110. But what else can I do to make my profile better. (I have a couple of more first author papers now)

Please let me know what do you think of my situation. This whole admission thing had made me incredibly low."

Currently, I have applied for and am pretty sure that I can become an intern for the John's Hopkins ASPIRE summer internship for computer science and also run a small business that I am looking to scale soon.

What are some awards or activities that I can add to my resume over the summer? Is it too late for something like USACO? Are there any events similar to them? Any awards, scholarships, opportunities for either business or comp sci?

Thanks for any advice!"
ml4s8t,1,2021-04-06,Just switched to DS Major... feeling stressed LOL,micamundo,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ml4s8t/just_switched_to_ds_major_feeling_stressed_lol/,"Hello everyone! 

This post is mostly a cry for help and direction as I am currently a double major who recently switched my second major to Data Science. However, I am a sophomore, and now entering the realm of DS/CS I am realizing how important internship experience is, and I guess you could say I am nervous because I only have two more summers.. and this one isn't looking too good so far.

I've taken lots of classes, try to spend my time absorbing information and learning fundamentals of CS along with DS. I was able to switch into the major because I had done research work at a lab that taught us how to use R, and from there I got really excited about learning how to code and do big projects similar to those we did at my lab. At the beginning of my sophomore year I made the switch and immediately began taking DS and CS courses. After my first semester I was able to land a Tech Marketing role (marketing is related to my first major) that lets me practice the skills I learned. This spring semester I also landed a role as a Teacher Assistant and am teaching two classes (Java &amp; Python) throughout the week to middle schoolers and high schoolers. I think these will look good on my resume, but I'm not really sure what a good CS resume truly looks like. On paper I'm a sophomore, but in terms of technical experience, I feel like a freshman who hasn't learned enough to pass the interview rounds. 

That being said, I have sent (and am still sending) many SWE internship applications. I've gotten interviews for two biggies, but got rejected from one, and am still waiting to here from the other. I'm not so much worried about getting an internship at FAANG, but I just want *something* on my resume for this summer. As for personal projects, I have ideas, but I also work four jobs outside of taking 5 uni classes... so I barely have time to work on my passion projects. D: 

Do you guys think I will die next year trying to find an internship if I don't this summer? Also, does anyone have resources to find fall internships besides the basic LinkedIn? I'm going to post my resume later on the bigger thread to get feedback, but am currently trying to find a balance showcasing my first major IRGB with DS. Send help pls."

3. Upward trend as I am getting all A’s now. Me finding people I can be with helped me academically and mentally.

4. Very harsh/strict parents. Don’t know if I wanna talk about this.

I’ve been under immense stress this past year. Because of Covid I’ve been in-front of my computer for majority of the day, and all I do is look up college acceptances, Naviance, and all the other college stuff. I’m really lost and AP tests are next month and I’m freaking out about that as I’ve learned little to nothing from my teachers. I’m just really scared and I don’t know what to do. My parents expect me to go to an elite college and I know that I’m probably not going to get into one. I’m scared of what the backlash is going to be like once results come out next year. Could you guys please help me to form a list of colleges, reaches, matches, and safeties. Also, what can I do to improve myself. Thank you and have a good day."
ml5e45,7,2021-04-06,Advice for an Informatics Major postgrad,getshacked_,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/ml5e45/advice_for_an_informatics_major_postgrad/,"*Background*:

I've always loved technology since I was a kid, but when it came to declaring a major I had little confidence in my learning ability and did not think I was smart enough to pursue Computer Science, so I came into UCI as a Business Econ major, because it was ""easy"". Fast forward and I'm a third year, getting A's and B's in Econ scheduled to graduate early at the end of the year, but I felt like I was never really learning anything applicable. That quarter I took ICS 31 and fell in love with programming. I then took ICS 6B, 32, 33, although they were much more difficult than my Econ classes, I still passed with A's and B's and loved what I was learning. I talked to the CS counselors and they said that I can double major in Informatics, so I decided I will stay a 5th year and double major.

*Currently:*

I'm nearing the end of my 4th year and I would really like to pursue a career as a software engineer. I still have a year to go, but after further research, taking some IN4MATX classes, and reading other reddit posts, I noticed that Informatics is no where near other majors like ICS, CS and CE. Once I graduate next year I know I will lack the foundational/technical skills that other CS/CE students have and worry that I will be unable to find any jobs. On top of IN4MATX courses (specialization in Organization and IT) I plan on taking CS 122A (data management) and ICS 45C (C++) to further my education.

I think the major offers a sort of broad introduction to the tech industry, although it's very interesting, it's not as challenging/useful as I want it to be, and I feel like I'm just dipping my toes into this industry, but I am determined to learn more. The problem is I have no idea where to start...

**I would greatly appreciate any advice or resources from previous Informatics or CS majors that I can use as guidance to continue my education/software engineering journey outside of UCI, in hopes of landing an internship.** For example are there any bootcamps, online courses, book recommendations, etc.? Thank You!"

I joined a club because I wanted to get involved and start meeting new people so I joined a club that is basically student council but for the business school at my college (I’m a business major). So basically our club is responsible for putting on all events for the business school and we also fund all of the other business clubs.

I had to write 3 essays and pass 2 interviews to get in and was so proud of myself for getting in.

But then I realized how freaking smart and successful and cool and popular everyone in my club is and I feel like I don’t fit in at all.

Everyone in the club seems to have their life together, most of them have already had like 2 or 3 internships, are Presidents or Vice Presidents of other clubs, in a sorority or fraternity, active social life, super smart (a lot of them have 4.0 GPAs) and just successful and popular. And they all know what they’re doing and just have it all together.

Meanwhile I have none of those things, I’m a junior and am just now applying to internships and trying to get my life together. I have no social life and I’m not cool and popular like these people. It makes me feel shitty and embarrassed about myself and I truly feel like I don’t fit in at this club. I’m worried that once things are in person next semester, everyone is gonna realize what a loser I am and judge me and think less of me.

How can I stop feeling this way?!"

I still have a year left before graduation, have done an internship as a back-end intern but would like to go full crazy into back-end tech and explore more.

Have heard that it's difficult for a fresher to get a back-end role and is more easier to work as a full-stack developer initially and then switch to a more back-end specific role.

Any kind of opinions/help is greatly appreciated. Also, I have no interest in working for companies, will just be applying to startups.

mlapza,34,2021-04-06,Incoming freshmen: here's a more positive take on the CS lottery,RockSmacker,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/mlapza/incoming_freshmen_heres_a_more_positive_take_on/,"I think this subreddit can be a bit too negative at times, and I get that since people sometimes have come here to vent. And naturally, people with complaints or frustration about the system will try to find a way to get that out. But I don't think that attitude should be all that people see when they're thinking about whether they should come to UCSD. So with that in mind, here's a bit more of a positive take on the infamous CS lottery that I'm copying from another comment I made on here.

&gt;UCSD has a lottery system to switch to a CS major but I think that's better than many other large public universities that have hyper-competitive application processes. Before the lottery system was implemented, there used to be crazy high cutoffs to get into CS (I think like 3.9 GPA minimum or something) but now there's a lottery instead.
&gt;
&gt;Because of that change, all that competition turns into collaboration, so you're not competing against anyone and there's no pressure to be the best. Even if you don't get into the CS major (you can apply to the lottery twice), you can still freely take a CS minor and major in a related field. At the end of the day, while coursework is important, your experience, projects and internships count for more when it comes to employment.

I'm sure there will be some people who will disagree with me and that's fine. But it's important to remember for incoming freshmen trying to decide, that you may still change your mind while you're in college about what you want to pursue (this happens to a LOT of people) and UCSD has great programs in fields that are related to CS (for example, Cognitive Science with a focus on Human Computer Interaction). My advice is not to tunnel vision on CS to the point where you close doors to other opportunities that could be just as good or even better. If you're accepted to the CS program at another great university, by all means you should go there. But if you're on the fence, I don't think this should be the reason you choose not to go to UCSD.

I am a graduate student in Comp Science. I switched fields a couple of of years ago from Engineering. It was an uphill battle for me because I didn't really have a structure in my studying. I started with courses in Coursera, Udemy, and etc. Completed courses in Web Development, iOS Programming, Databases, but I knew that I would have to get a proper education, so I started taking college courses in CS once I graduated from my Bachelor's program and started my first full-time job. Around that time, I started solving LeetCode, Euler, CodeSignal, and etc. I liked solving algorithmic problems. I knew that I would have to get good at solving LeetCode style questions, so I started practicing them, but it wasn't a chore for me. Mind you,  I hadn't taken any course on DS and Algos. Everything I learned about that was from YouTube videos and LeetCode.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year later, I started applying for jobs. My general CS knowledge and my LeetCode practice helped me land my first full time job as a WebDev. I learned a lot, and the problem solving skills I developed in Engineering helped me out tremendously. I kept doing interviews, just to get more practice. I applied to one of the big tech companies and got absolutely destroyed. It was a wake-up call for me. I changed up my preparation and finally started learning DS and Algos in the proper way.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I got into grad school in CS at a pretty good school. I have landed my summer internship at a unicorn as an ML Engineer, and I may land an internship at FAANG for Fall 2021. My LeetCode grind paid off. However, so far I have solved 300+ JUST LeetCode questions. I am not even counting CodeSignal and HackerRank. Albeit, I mostly practiced on LeetCode. I solve at least 1 medium/hard LeetCode question a day. I keep myself in shape, basically. Looking back at my journey, I have realized how much harder everything has become. Yes, you can land a 70k$ job with good grades and projects not having to jump through the hoops, but most of us want to reach the top, right? At this point, I think that, if I want to jump ships in the future, I will have to get even better. I will have to get as good as those competitive programmers. Here comes the reason why I am even typing all this.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is a senior in high school, and he is thinking about doing either CS or Math. However, I am worried that by the time he makes to graduation, the CS scene will get so over-competitive that he will have really low chances of finding a well-paid job post-graduation. He asked me for an advice on what field in CS he should pursue. I think that the fields that require a lot of Math have less competition than more generic fields like Web Dev. Most programmers I know are not good at Math. He also considers jumping into Product Management with a CS Degree. He is naturally gifted with good social skills, and I don't want him to waste his potential grinding LeetCode like a monkey day-in day-out. What other career routes can he pursue with a CS/Math Degree where he won't have to grind LeetCode?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: switched to CS a while ago. Solved combined 500+ coding questions. Doing well right now, have a very good internship lined up but realized how broken the hiring process is at the top companies. Think it will only get worse, as learning to code is widely advertised. Have a sibling at high school. He wants to do Math/CS in college, but I don't want him to turn into a LeetCode monkey.

I know this sounds very dramatic and I should be grateful for what I have, whatever that is. I'm well aware many people have it much worse than me. I'm not usually the complaining type, but this internal conflicts have been there for months and I cannot hold them anymore.

I have always wanted to move abroad and leave my home country, yet here I am, after all these years, still in the same place. I’m not talking about travelling for holidays (this, I have the chance to do a lot), and also, there is nothing that I try to escape by that (I live in a great city &amp; country), but… I really just always wanted to live abroad, like since I’m a child. Like my number one dream and goal in life. I’m so curious about the world, I don’t see the point in staying in once place your whole life. Not trying to convince anyone, it’s just my point of view on life and how I always felt deep inside.

Before you put this is in question, I know this is something that I want and would love to. I actually did live aboard several times (jobs, etc.) but always had to come back after some months, because no job/no money – yet, I never lost hope (until now) to find another opportunity where I wouldn’t have to come back.

And now… I’m 38 and, I’m still in the same city for the last 30 years.

I always thought I would find a partner here and we would move aboard together. I’m an introvert, and need something/someone that I can rely upon, like a relationship and a partner that shares the same dreams.

To me, this has never been in contradiction with having a family. I have always thought I could build a family, meet a guy a have kids. And we would move abroad together, possibly travel the world too.

But none of this ever happened to me; OR I never succeeded in making this happen.

Also, I had a dream job (be a researcher/scientist) yet, I failed here too. I don’t like my job (an office job), although I did study for years (2 masters), many internships, shitty jobs, and zillions of applications. I ended up in my current job only 5 years ago – first steady job at 33 and I don’t even like it. Being a researcher is not something you become at almost 40 if you haven’t succeeded anytime before.

So what did I ever achieve here? What have I ever done of my life? I have failed on everything that was important to me and that I wanted to do: my biggest dreams, but also the very possibility to have family.

And I’m not even talking about having a house, because that’s not even something realistic.

I’m unable to move forward with anything in my life right now. I always thought my partner would be willing to also move, even if it meant compromises on where and when.

Worst part is: I got a unique opportunity to live on another continent when I was 34, I was so excited. But stupid me met my boyfriend two months after the news, and I just let the chance go away because I was so in love. Of course, I regret it. At the time, I thought everything would be possible, as long as there is love, but the truth is we should have had a honest conversation about it right away.

Now I know he doesn’t want to leave the country, ever. And we do have other issues (if you check my history, you'll see, but that's just another aspect of my life that's not going well but I don't want to start about it here).

Now, for the last weeks, months, I haven't been able to sleep well, I have a hard time thinking and doing basic things, I feel in a constant panic state that doesn’t seem to calm down as I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life right now.

Of course, I could leave everything (him, my job, my country) and part of me wants to do that so bad… but, although I’ve done it in the past, for once in my life, it scares me! Because maybe I'm too old now to build a new life on my own! I always imagined moving abroad with a partner, and I almost did with my ex, but now… leaving everything and everyone behind, on my own, at my age, I might just end up alone.

Who wants a partner, or a new friend that’s 38 yrs, no relationships, no kids, no career, and basically nothing to bring to the table other than a chaotic past?

If and once I leave my boyfriend (which I do love - that's the hardest part), I might also leave behind my last chance to have kids and start a family?

What are my chances to find someone that shares the same objectives in life &amp; with whom it goes so well we can consider building a family in what, less than 2 years?

As for staying here and starting a family, boyfriend is not even sure he wants it and the idea of being stuck forever here because of our kids, and he not wanting to move away... just depresses me so much. I just don’t want that life. And travelling for holidays/leisure is not an alternative in the sense that it doesn’t answer the same needs (in my case).

How come I didn’t think better of this 10 year ago, instead of losing so much time going in the wrong direction? And staying with people who didn’t want the same as I do?

I am stuck in this situation and I keep wondering: how did I get here? How did I mess up everything?

I know I haven’t always made the best choices, but it feels like I really tried to do my best. Was I that unlucky? Am I so bad at taking decisions? Am I unable to create a life that I like?

I wish I could go back in time. I wish there wasn’t the biological deadline for children. I wish I had met the right person. I wish I could advice my self of ten years ago, and I wish I could hear the advice of my self in ten years from now.

I just wish I knew what to do.

I feel like I have constantly failed myself and all the dreams I ever had.

I do see a therapist and it helps to see the situation, but up to now, it has only showed how stuck I am in my life.

Any life advice welcome!

EDIT: Thank you so much for replying to my post and for your precious encouragements! It is maybe not much to you, but it has made me feel better and even made me tear up a bit.... I need these positive feedbacks once in a while and the reminder that it's not completely foolish of me to want to realise some of my dreams. I still don't know what to do, but I see things in a more positive light and I hope this is the first step towards a new life that will make me (more) happy."
mldoze,42,2021-04-06,Taking a year off,narrowmortgage,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/mldoze/taking_a_year_off/,"Hi folks! I'm considering taking a year off and would love to hear about other people's experiences with this. I'm just finishing my third year now and am on track to graduate in Winter 2022 but want to take the year off and graduate in Winter 2023 instead. 

I have an opportunity to work on a documentary in Toronto (which is actually the result of an internship I did last semester, very relevant to my major and also personal career interests). If I stayed at McGill this year I would be writing my thesis and trying to drive back to Toronto as much as possible to be a part of the doc. I'm very used to overextending myself but trying to take better care of myself and instead go at things at a reasonable pace- which for now would mean staying in Toronto for a year to work on the doc and then going back to Montreal when I can fully focus on my thesis. 

All to say, I am very comfortable in Toronto and have plans for my year off. I just want to hear about other people's experiences, any advice or tips to deal with the McGill administration for all this?

Thanks!!"

&lt;Begin Call&gt;   


Agent Summers: “Hi, this is Agent Summers again. Thank you for agreeing to speak with me. You don’t mind if this conversation is recorded?”

Nick Salle: “Not really, since I’m recording too, that’s cool right? Cool… It’s a bit late for a phone interview, though, isn’t it? I thought government agents had like, regular business hours.”

Agent Summer: “SIA never sleeps. It’s somewhere in the fine print on one of our brochures. Now, I’d like to ask you some questions about one Lillian Smith?""

Nick Salle: “Mmm, she in trouble?""

Agent Summer: “Not at all, we’re doing background checks for potential Signatory status and found you listed as a contact of hers. Courts are so thorough I wish I was paid hourly.""

Nick Salle: &lt;laughter&gt; “And you thought asking the most punk motherfucker on the planet to cooperate with a Federal Agent was a good idea? Signatory… You putting the screws to her so she’ll be a trained Agency monkey?”

Agent Summer: “I like to think SIA hasn’t had time to earn the… unjust reputation of other three letter agencies. And no, we don’t put the screws to people. She hasn’t applied for a job here.”

Nick Salle: “Well, depending on what you ask, I reserve the right to not answer. She’s not a fan of the SIA, from what I’ve seen.”

Agent Summer: “Any idea why?”

Nick Salle: “No, and I haven’t asked her, Agent Summer.""

Agent Summer: “Noted, noted. When did you first meet Miss Lillian, and how long have you kept in touch?""

Nick Salle: “I met her in college… Sophomore year. I was hawking tickets for a local band on the quad, and I got her number after she walked up and got a conversation out of me. I first thought she was just interested in meeting the band. You see that from time to time in the music business. Their singer eventually made it in Hollywood about… three years ago, y’know? People in the know, *knew* he’d be big. Anyway, turns out Lillian was just this sweet Midwestern Fae chick who wanted to check out concerts in town and thought I’d do a good job showing her around. We’ve met up at least once every few weeks since for concerts and stuff. She’s got a good ear. Last conversation with her was… two weeks ago. I’ve got tickets in a few weeks for a show she’ll like.""

Agent Summer: “Has Lillian used any magic around you, on you? I’m sorry, but it’s a standard question for non-human subjects in the process.""

Nick Salle: “I mean, yeah. Nothing film-worthy, but she easily can do some stuff like move stuff, stop it in mid-air. I think she can make small objects as well. The basic wizard shit’s super useful when someone’s about to drop beer on you by accident. She’s saved a few pairs of pants and jackets from an early grave. I’m eternally grateful, not that I can tell her, ‘cause, y’know, that Fae contract and verbiage stuff. She hasn’t bewitched me or something.""

Agent Summer: “Anything else you two did together besides concerts?”

Nick Salle: “You expecting the typical drugs and political activism or something? Nah, she kept away from that. At least around me.""

Agent Summer: “Were you… Dating? Seeing one another? Did you notice her seeing anyone else?”

Nick Salle: “Hey man, I’m not answering that. Feminism’s the shit and I don’t kiss and tell on anyone.""

Agent Summer: “Relax, it’s only because your contact info was listed with several hearts next to it.”

Nick Salle: “That’s sweet of her, but I’m not blabbing deets. All you need to know is that we go to shows a lot and have a great time. She’s my go-to call when I’ve got tickets no one's smart enough to jump at.”

Agent Summer: “Right. Any violent episodes, or worrying use of magic around humans or non-humans that you’ve seen?""

Nick Salle: “Nah, she and I beat the shit out of this tool who tried roof’ing a girl about four years ago at a human bar in Evanston. Bartender handled it afterwards so we could leave for a show, but it was pretty righteous, y’know? She’s good with a solid pair of boots. I looked it up, and the guy got busted for coke as well that night, so fuck him. Hope his daddy spent every penny to keep him out of jail. You’d have to be a real dick around her to set her off, ’S what I’m saying.""

Agent Summer: “That *does* sound like a violent episode, though.”

Nick Salle: “Right. What kind of behavior are you concerned about, anyway? You go to enough concerts and bars, shit happens.""

Agent Summer: “Hmm… Not necessarily the violence *itself*, just words or actions that would indicate her mindset at the time. Sometimes we get cases where beings are... excited by the prospect of hurting others, and it helps for SIA to know. Anything else in terms of violence?”

Nick Salle: “She stopped me from going harder on that cokehead, so she’s clearly not whatever you’re worried about. Violence-wise, she’s great in a mosh pit? Like, any Fae’s going to follow rules if you get them to agree to stuff, but she’s smart about mosh etiquette and can really take a punch. I’ve never seen her bloodied or bruised. Might be a Fae thing. Eternal youth like in stories. I dunno, I don’t keep up with the magic shit, music’s my forte. Past ten years have been a real Renaissance for underground bands, and magic can’t beat a good set of speakers yet.""

Agent Summer: &lt;sounds of writing&gt; “ Mosh… That’s also good to know.""

Nick Salle: “You don’t know what a mosh pit is, do you?” &lt;laughs&gt;

Agent Summer: “Hey, I’ve been to Lolla' a few times. They let us out of our cages here, occasionally.""

Nick Salle: “An Agent with a good sense of humor, and passable taste in music? That’s extra dangerous.""

Agent Summer: “Keep that in mind when I direct you to the end-of-call survey, I’m flattered. Any other incidents?”

Nick Salle: “I’m thinking… Nah. She’s good at talking her way out of things, I noticed a while ago.” &lt;laughs&gt; ""She’d probably make a solid wingman, now that I think about it.”

Agent Summer: “Excellent, excellent, moving right along… Have you met with any of her other friends?”

Nick Salle: “Yeah, like, in bars and stuff sometimes if I’m free. A bunch from our college, some guys I think were nerds who guilted her into playing D&amp;D with them, and like, other random activities she seems to do. Some she knew from work, like... this secretary? A Wood Elf, if that narrows it down. They’re cool. Not exactly my crowd, but I’ve helped get them tickets before, and they’re nice enough to say they enjoyed the show.""

Agent Summer: “Thank you for your time, I’ll call and leave a message if I have more questions.”

Nick Salle: “Alright, I guess.“

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “Hello Amanda Lynn, this is Agent Yalla Mel’y’Ain with SIA, badge number 2528395154. Apologies about the time, but I need to ask you some questions about a Miss Lillian Smith, an employee of yours at... CyberWorks InterConnected? Do you mind if we do a video call?""

Amanda Lynn: “Hi Agent Mel’y'Ain, no it’s not a problem. Just let me… There! Sorry for the state of my house, I just finished breakfast. What’s this with Lillian? She’s not in trouble, is she? Is there some trouble with her residency status? Does she need a lawyer?”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “No, not at all. We’re running a background check on her with regards to possible Signatory status, and would like some information. How long have you known Miss Smith? And in what capacity?""

Amanda Lynn: “I’ve known her for roughly six years, and have been her boss’s boss for all of them. Nathan Ku is her direct report. Lillian and I have spoken at length in a formal capacity at least weekly since she’s started working here, and a little bit at company get-togethers less formally.""

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “Any disciplinary or magic-related incidents you know of?”

Amanda Lynn: “None at all.""

Agent Mel’y’Ain: ”And your opinion of her?”

Amanda Lynn: “Oh, hmm. Well, Lillian is a rather brilliant and diligent employee. She's very friendly with everyone on staff, and always on time to work as long as the trains aren’t broken down. But you know how the Loop is. Frankly I wish more of my employees were like her, but I’ve heard cloning technology is still too early in development… That was a joke! I’m sorry.""

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “No worries, it’s ok to be nervous. Any problems with her since she was hired? And does she tend to use magic around the office?""

Amanda Lynn: “She’s one of my best employees. If there’s anything a little off about her, it’s that she’s at times… reserved socially, I guess? It’s not a real problem, but she tends to leave early from afterwork bonding events with an excuse. Doesn’t show off too much with magic, although interns or new employees ask her for some when they first go with her after work.” 

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “What does she do?”

Amanda Lynn: “It looks like, like, basic parlor tricks? She doesn’t use magic any stronger than that. Low-powered, but interesting and inventive and requiring serious control that she makes look effortless. First few years, I thought she was an exiled Fae Princess and leading a double life. Not that it’s my business.”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “A Fae Princess? Surely you must be joking.”

Amanda Lynn: “She also has a certain grace and confidence about her that’s rare in someone her age. Exiled Fae Royalty made sense at first.""

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “A double life... What kind of double life would she be leading?""

Amanda Lynn: “It’s a feeling I have, who knows? Out of all my employees, she’s the most vague about her personal life. Family in... Ohio I think, and a lot of friends she knows through someone or something outside of work, usually college. The strangest thing is that she hasn’t dated anyone at the office, or mentioned she’s dating anyone. I’m still jealous, though.""

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “Jealous?""

Amanda Lynn: &lt;laughs&gt;“Have you *met* her in person?”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: &lt;laughs&gt; “No I haven’t, Miss Lynn. I’d need a few promotions for that part of the job here.""

Amanda Lynn: “Well, if you met her... Between us girls, you should know that she’s one of the most beautiful women you’ll *ever* see in your life. Pictures don’t even do it justice. I know, I know, a lot of Fae are pretty, but she practically lights up a room. And she’s got serious charisma. I’ve been thinking about promoting her in a few months with a little social training so we can put her in front of clients. Though since she’s Fae, I worry that humans and other species might intimidate her in social situations. Especially if she thinks her employment's on the line.”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “Intimidate her?”

Amanda Lynn: “She, like a lot of Fae I’ve seen, is very careful about what she says and who she says certain words to. When she walked in the first day to handle her official contracts, she went through every document, even the non-legal ones, three times. And when I checked in on her, had her older sister on speaker phone helping her through the legal jargon, holding a metaphorical knife to our HR rep's throat. Poor kid.”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “Did she tell you she was an Orphaned Fae?”

Amanda Lynn: “No, but it was obvious she was one, and I didn’t press the issue. Non-Signatory kid with a radiant face and a small point to the ears? There’s just some paperwork for that, no big deal if you know what you’re doing and can navigate government websites with a lawyer. We don’t often have Orphaned Fae apply, since we’re an unsexy tech company, but Lillian made a great impression with the teams and they wanted her. I made clear anyone who tried to make it a FaeShit job gets fired, though.”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “FaeShit job?”

Amanda Lynn: &lt;sighs&gt; “Court Fae are good with understanding contracts and employment, but Orphaned Fae are a bit... too trusting. You probably know how some humans can stack the deck against them with a few lies and turns of phrase, but that’s just the start. More work hours, less pay, bonus always out of reach, you can't quit, and worse as a boss gets their hooks into them. That’s the industry term for it, at least. I first heard about it when a friend of mine with a Fae son complained about an internship he did. I appreciate that SIA has been helping squash that stuff, it gives the Tech industry such a bad reputation.”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “Huh, learn something new every day. And I’m glad you appreciate our efforts. Anything else you’d like to add about your experiences with Miss Smith?”

Amanda Lynn: “I’d hate to say this on the record, but she really needs to get herself out there and start dating. I’ve seen her get a little forlorn when the other women in the office ask her about boys, and I know she’s gently turned down several guys. Her excuse is ‘I’m not good girlfriend material’, which breaks my heart to see. You know how Fae can get. I bet some jerk broke her heart in college and she’s still not over it. If I find out someday that she’s waiting half a century to be ‘worthy’ over some guy who said the wrong thing?” &lt;sigh&gt;

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “You seem pretty invested in your employees.”

Amanda Lynn: “I don’t talk to them about it! I just, y’know, overhear office gossip. We’ve got an open floor plan, and I think a happy employee is a successful employee. Turnover here is far below industry standard, and productivity is far above, if you can keep that a secret.”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “You’d think most companies would see things your way... Well, I think we’ve covered everything I needed. Thank you for your time.""

Amanda Lynn: “It’s been a pleasure. It’s probably on your list already, but please make a note to let my legal department know when Lillian gets Signatory status, so we can get through the paperwork.”

Agent Mel’y’Ain: “Of course.”

Agent Summer: “Hello, this is Agent Summer with SIA, badge number 82341530. Is this a good time to talk, Mr., Ah, Chadwick Holmes III?”

Chadwick Holmes: “Uh, yeah that’s me. Call me Chad, everyone calls me Chad. Yeah, now’s a good time to talk, Agent Summer. What’s up?”

Agent Summer: “Well Chad, we’re conducting some interviews for here at SIA for a background check on someone you know from college. A Miss Lillian Smith?”

Chadwick Holmes: “Yeah, I mean, we talk ’n stuff. Known her for like, wow, a decade. What do you want to know?”

Agent Summer: “Well, to start with, how did you first meet her and how long have you kept in touch?""

Chadwick Holmes: “Ok, um, so it’s freshman year of college, right? Like, first few months. Everyone’s going crazy because we’re away from our parents and it’s still warm out. And like, we’re all packed in our dorms ‘cause they don’t want us running around town immediately. I hadn’t really been around many Supernaturals or whatever growing up in Springfield. So I was curious, like, what are they like? Stuff was happening when I was growing up. But I didn’t pay attention, because I was trying to get into college, play sports, date chicks, all that good stuff."" 

Agent Summer: “Sounds reasonable.""

Chadwick Holmes: ""Anyway, so on my floor, there’s this smoking hot babe. Like, hotness you’ve never seen in your life, and I started flirting with her at a get-together organized by a buddy of mine, ‘cause *why not*? Worst thing she says is no, and as long as I don’t make any sudden moves towards her I won’t die like that guy who got his skin taken off and lit on fire. Piece of cake. She said her name was Lillian, and like, one of *her* friends on the floor passing by said she was a Fae. Orphaned Fae. At first I was like, ‘eh, maybe we shouldn’t hook up.’ ‘Cause like, I heard Fae don’t- man this sounds dickish, but like sometimes they don’t understand shit easily? Y’know? And then it’s downhill from there.""

Agent Summer: “What do you mean?”

Chadwick Holmes: “Look, like, sometimes they take things literally. Like, ‘let’s get out of here’ is just that and the Fae just walks out of the place without getting the subtext that like, you wanna get intimate. Other times it’s like, they get real interested in random stuff and you can’t- I dunno. Anyway, but for Lillian I don’t really flirt with Fae because it’s kinda not worth it for either of us. Court Fae I’ve met are just crazy, total other extreme in my opinion.""

Agent Summer: “That does sound frustrating.”

Chadwick Holmes: “Anyway. Point is, Lillian whispered, ‘Hey wanna come over at my place? Pun intended.’ in my ear when no one else was paying attention. So, uh, we hooked up in her room. I think her roommate was at another party. Exchanged numbers after, was cool. But yeah, we’ve hung out and hooked up at least like, once a month or so since then. There were other benefits too.""

Agent Summer: “Other benefits?”

Chadwick Holmes: “Yeah, she’s like, five times as smart as me and the other guys on the football team. Saved my ass in a few classes tutoring me after we uh- we hooked up.""

Agent Summer: “Are you willing to talk more about your relationship with Lillian?”

Chadwick Holmes: “Sure… I wouldn’t exactly call it a *relationship*. We had some fun together, she’d go off and do her thing a bit after, I’d do mine. Football took up a lot of free time in college. We never were exclusive, but we’ve kept seeing each other all this time, so I’d think she likes being around me.""

Agent Summer: “Any worries she’s using you for something?”

Chadwick Holmes: &lt;laughs&gt;“Bro, you ever *met* her?”

Agent Summer: “No? I’m sorry, I wasn’t in the detail that interviewed her.”

Chadwick Holmes: “Ok, if you met her you’d know that’s the wrong question to ask. She’s never asked me for money, and I guarantee she could get dick better than mine, any day any time. I’ve met more high maintenance *blind* *first dates*. Hell, I worried *I* was using her during college. She’s just a nice babe into some kinky shit- uh-stuff.""

Agent Summer: &lt;sound of writing&gt; “Kinky stuff?”

Chadwick Holmes: &lt;groan&gt; “Look, this better not get back to me, because I’m seriously violating the Bro Code, but she’s down for pretty much anything. Guys, girls, non-human beings, S&amp;M, group sex, costumes, role-play, you name it, she’s probably done it and then some. I’ve had like, five threesomes with her. And she’s *still* a total bro. She’s not as sly as she thinks she is, but it’s cool. I cover for her when I can.” 

Agent Summer: “Cover for her... Why would she keep it secret?”

Chadwick Holmes: “Parents? More uptight friends? I don’t ask. She wanted me to keep quiet about stuff in college, so I did. Which… makes me look like an asshole now. Shit.""

Agent Summer: “It’s fine, it’s fine, don’t worry. We’re not in the business of spreading personal information.”

Chadwick Holmes: “I guess, but like, she worked hard to keep it under wraps. Shit. I guess people give even a non-human a hard time for her love life. It's weird, because like, if I scored that much in college I’d be a legend at my frat. You SIA guys probably got some Witch from our dorm with a grudge spreading shit in another interview all these years later, but nah, she’s not like that.""

Agent Summer: “Witches? I haven’t interviewed any yet. Could you elaborate on what Lillian is ’not like’?""

Chadwick Holmes: “Yeah, she and several Witches didn’t like each other so much, at least the first few years. They thought she was weird, she thought they had sticks up their asses. I had to talk the Witches out of trying to spread rumors about her being a vapid whore or a dumpster baby my freshman year a couple times. Total mess, and I never told Lillian about it. Actually... Yeah, can you promise never to tell her I said this stuff?”

Agent Summer: “I *assure* you these records are confidential.”

Chadwick Holmes: “Awesome, cool. I mean, it’s not all about sex, she’s got depth.""

Agent Summer: “I’m not sure what you mean?”

Chadwick Holmes: “So, Lillian's cool to hang out with. Always got something on her mind, willing to go for a beer, listen to me talk about the local games, even go to a few of them. Her tech stuff’s a bit over my head, but yeah, I try and follow it. She's not a fan of politics, though. Probably because the Fae stuff’s messy and it makes her sad.” 

Agent Summer: “Well, we’ve been trying to refine laws and regulations for a while now with regards to Fae. So this is definitely a point of interest. How does it affect her?""

Chadwick Holmes: “Yeah I heard a bunch from my father but tuned it out a little ‘cause he’s probably wrong... so I’m not an *expert*, but like, I just know it’s weird on an individual level. Lillian can’t go to a bunch of bars and events, but she pretends it’s fine. Some lingo trips her up mentally, and she’s super careful to read all bills and paperwork and avoids religious stuff. There’s probably more I’m forgetting, but like, a lot of times with Fae it’s not what’s said, it’s what’s *not* said, I think. I’m kinda careful who I meet around her as well. Like, she’s *never* going to meet my parents. They’d say something awful by accident… or on purpose. But most of my friends are chill with her, so we’ve hung out a few times.""

Agent Summer: &lt;sound of writing&gt;“Interesting. Have you met any of her other friends? Family?""

Chadwick Holmes: “A couple, she’s got a lot of friends, hard to tell who’s just friends or a sex-bud, but like, I don’t ask. Y’know, I met her sister a few times, and she tries to watch out for Lillian. I got sized up by Anne, that’s her sister, human like me, and uh… found wanting. It was a little off-putting at first-” 

Agent Summer: “Off-putting? How so?""

Chadwick Holmes: “Because Anne’s making sure you’re not sketchy. Like, if I didn’t know Anne and Lillian were sisters, Anne would be one of those annoying people on campus or busy streets who try and get you to sign really specific petitions like it’s life or death even though it’s life or death *you* get to class on time. Except, y’know, it’s her *sister*, which made me think. There’s probably some more stuff Lillian’s just not equipped for, I think, and she’s gonna need someone making noise for her just in case.""

Agent Summer: “Hmm, thanks for giving clarification.”

Chadwick Holmes: “No problem... Shit, I uh, I gotta go. Friends at the door for a party. Yeah! I’ll get it, lemme-""

Agent Summer: “Of course, I’ll call you again tomorrow if I have followup questions. Thanks for your time, Chad.”

Chadwick Holmes: “Yeah, uh bye.""

If you can help me by answering these questions, I would really appreciate it. I really don’t want to major in finance only to regret it after. 

Also, if anyone can help by providing universities that are best for each financial career- in terms of internships/ opportunities, that would be so so great!

Thank you!"

I applied for a job a few months ago, got through to the final round, had great rapport with them, everything was super positive, but then they informed me I’d not been selected. Ok, fine, shit happens - the person they picked just must’ve been better, right?! Well I just looked on LinkedIn and saw who they gave the job to....and the person has hardly any professional experience (mostly internships), and each role they’ve had has been for around 3/4 months long, and is in completely different area of focus to the role. I have 9 years of professional/more senior experience, all of which is more closely aligned to the role requirements.

I’m pretty pissed. It’s hard enough out here trying to find a job during this pandemic....but to find out you’ve been bumped for someone WAAAY less qualified just kills me a little. Like, what’s even the point anymore in trying if you’re not gonna be judged on the requirements they set out in the job description? I’m wondering if maybe they chose the person so they could pay them less?! I don’t know...

If anyone could offer up any ideas as to why a company might do this I’d be grateful....as I’m pretty confused and disappointed right now."

Should I consider moving out of state, like specifically New York, in search of a cs job, or is there another solution? I suppose I could move to downtown Dayton or maybe Columbus, but it's still Ohio.

Buuuuut there is a small portion of students that actively put others down. Specific examples:

1. You get a decent exam grade. You clearly see someone a little distraught and upset and harass them to ask for their grade to make you feel even better

2. You have a group assignment, do all the work before even talking to your group, then complain about how much work your group is doing

3. When they hear someone got an internship at a prestigious company they didn't. 
""What? How did ________ manage to get an internship at Lockheed?! It must've been because they are ______ and they needed to fill their quota""

Y'all are toxic. These are the same students that graduate and feel like blue collar workers are beneath them. These are the same students arrogant enough to take on something they are not as qualified to do when another colleague is more suited for the task. These are the same people who take on managerial roles and make the workplace toxic.

mllagp,58,2021-04-06,Words of Consolation to Rejected Applicants From College Senior,JBizzle07,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mllagp/words_of_consolation_to_rejected_applicants_from/,"I posted this a couple years back but just wanted to reiterate for current applicants.

I've seen a lot of people saying words of comfort like ""It's so random"" or ""they're not evaluating you, just the application you sent in"" yada yada. Personally, I wouldn't find that kind of thing reassuring, so I wanted to offer some different words of comfort.

1. This is a cliche, but it does matter more what you do in college than where you are. I go to Wharton. I struck out for both sophomore and junior year internships, and that's prob justified; I wasn't that proactive in getting offers or making myself a competitive applicant. My buddy wanted to go to Wharton. He's at UC Irvine, and he had a lot of initiative in teaching himself relevant skills and networking. He's got multiple summer offers, and was very successful last summer as well. I know a family with kids at Wisco, Penn and Columbia. The first kid is the most successful (they're all part of/going into consulting). One of the most accomplished 24 year-olds I know got into Stanford+ivies, went to USC; he knew he could be successful anywhere, and he was right.
2. Point 1 is basically ""Your success depends on your efforts"". Point 2: You could be even more successful at a less competitive school. One of my most brilliant friends wanted to go to UCLA for pre-med, ""only"" got into UCSB. He's gotten near perfect grades, loves the school, and feels like he dodged a bullet by not competing with all the UCLA premeds. That dude is on track for a bomb med school. Another pre-med friend got into Duke/Cal, went to Pitt cuz it was cheaper+he could stand out more there; he's doing awesome btw. Some pre-med friends at Penn regret being in classes curved around B- and filled with brilliant kids.
3. Be glad that this is only the start of college. It's so much better than high school for almost everybody. I can't believe it's half over for me. You're so lucky to have 4 years of crazy fun ahead of you.
4. If you want a prestigious degree (and it's fine to care about that kind of thing), it's easier to get in for advanced degrees. For MBA, some acceptances rates are Vandy 43%, Cornell 30%, Georgetown 48% etc. Law school admissions are very numbers based. If you have a great GPA and test scores, there is a very high chance you'll go to a top law school; there's less randomness involved. If you're ""stuck"" at a mid-tier state school for now, be a big fish in a small pong, get that 3.9+ gpa, and go to Harvard law.
5. You can transfer to a ""top"" school if you still want that in a year. Some are very transfer friendly. Vandy (30%), Cornell (18%), Northwestern(15%), Notre Dame (27%), Cal (23%), UCLA (26%), Emory (26%), NYU (26%), Mich (38%), UVA (38%), UCSB (56%), Georgia Tech (38%), UCSD (54%). But try to embrace your current choice for the time being, you might end up loving it.
6. Going to a top school doesn't fix your life problems. It won't cure your depression or anxiety; in fact, it might exacerbate it. At Penn, there are plenty of stressed out kids. I've heard it's the same from friends at other top schools. I have personal difficulties, and they disappeared when I was happy about acceptances, but came back immediately after euphoria wore off. It takes reflection and proactivity to conquer whatever insecurities/difficulties you have, and no college acceptance can compensate for that.
7. I have no stats to back this up, but going to your state school might be more memorable/enjoyable than the dream school you have in mind. On average, there are probably better parties, more attractive students, more school spirit (very lacking in almost all T20s). My friends and I chatted with a Penn State student headed to Goldman; we were jealous that he got to have state school experience AND have more success than us. Be that Penn State student.

tldr; I guess my point is that it's alright to be sad for now. You shouldn't repress it. A lot of you worked incredibly hard, and it's perfectly justified to feel that this whole thing is unfair. Eventually, the feeling will pass. There are plenty of ways to be successful regardless, and if your definition of success is getting a prestigious degree, there are still plenty of ways to accomplish that as well. Maybe my opinion means less because I lucked out in admissions, but I really want to reassure all of you that this process means less than it seems like atm."
mllqel,20,2021-04-06,"how extensive should a gitHub portfolio be for a CS student with no ""real world"" experience looking to secure their first internship?",archaic_angle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mllqel/how_extensive_should_a_github_portfolio_be_for_a/,"I am a CS student that has reached the senior level of the degree program.  As someone with absolutely no ""real world"" experience in terms of working a job related to computers, I feel that it has become absolutely critical for me to start applying to internships.

However I have become a little overwhelmed and confused about how robust my gitHub portfolio must be.  

My understanding is that a gitHub portfolio where you can showcase your programming skills is essential when applying for work in the field of computer science. 

My confusion is regarding how many and what types of programs should I place into my gitHub and how many different languages do I need to code in?  

The programs I have written in various classes are kind of all over the place, some are pretty mediocre, like coding a simple calculator to learn how to code GUIs.  Or very basic programs to learn simple data structures.  

Others are a little more complex like code that I wrote in my algorithms class, however in the algorithms class each coding assignment required us to add to the previous assignment so that by the end of the course we essentially only had one giant program with a lot of different functionality.  I worry that might make my gitHub portfolio look a little sparse.  

Even worse, I have pretty much only coded in Java so it would be very difficult for me to code programs in C or C++.  In fact, I haven't even learned Python yet because I started my degree program before Python become popular when the preferred language was Java.

I worry that coding a robust detailed portfolio for gitHub could take weeks (maybe even months?) especially if I need to include code in more languages than just Java.  I worry that this will take so much time and effort that it will greatly delay my ability to actually start applying to internships.  

If anyone could give me a few suggestions as to how detailed a gitHub should be for students looking to find their first internship, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you"
mlm35j,2,2021-04-06,A cop who wants to become a programmer.,xapizko,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/mlm35j/a_cop_who_wants_to_become_a_programmer/,"Hi guys. As the title says, I am a cop who would like to change careers and become a programmer. Last year I decided to apply to finish the degree I was taking before I became a cop. But I ended up discovering that with the different shifts I have at work, it becomes very difficult to attend all classes and follow the material given consistently.

And after some conversations with friends who finished the degree and are already in the job market, we came to the conclusion that there are some subjects that are of no use to make you a good programmer in the job market.

After all this and with everything I have read in this sub I came to the conclusion that perhaps the best option for me would be to learn by myself. But with this, I had some doubts.

I already have some knowledge in programming (Python, C, C ++), and currently I am finishing a Udemy C language course which gave me the ability to develop a naval battle game on my own (example). What would be the best course to follow from here? Continue to take Udemy courses (Java, JavaScript, Python ...)? Trying to create an app or project on my own? (...)

But my biggest fear is how to enter the job market ... a person like me, without any kind of experience in the area, how do you build a curriculum that gives companies credibility to hire me? I know that if I continued to finish the degree, I would have the final internship that would be a great help to enter the job market ... but without that, how do I do it? With bootcamps? There are some bootcamps where I live that offer a kind of internship in companies but working as a police officer it becomes very difficult for me to frequent them. And what do I need to feel to know that I am ready to enter the job market? And for example, do udemy courses have any viability and credibility for an employer?

**TLDR:** *I'm a cop who wants to become a programmer. My profession means that I have little time to finish the Computer Engineering course in which I am enrolled.

mlmycb,8,2021-04-06,Recently got into an argument with my dad about college/grad school and have some questions,csquestion124,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mlmycb/recently_got_into_an_argument_with_my_dad_about/,"Some backstory:

I'm a sophomore at a T50 CS state school, think (OSU/Penn State/Virginia Tech), and I recently got a summer internship at Twilio. I believe that opportunity will be substantial enough to propel my career forward and my undergrad school will be irrelevant in a few years.

My dad has a BS EECS from MIT and a CS MS &amp; PhD from UIUC, and he is pressuring me to transfer schools and/or attend grad school. He has told me that in industry, your school is irrelevant in your first 5-ish years, but after that, the majority of people in senior-level positions have graduate degrees or attend better undergrad schools. He's also emphasizes attending a better school to get to know famous professors and do research with them, which is not something I'm particularly interested in.

Previously I had intended on transferring, but after I got my internship I've become unmotivated because I don't see it as a necessity anymore. The issues I have with transferring are that I might lose credits and have to retake classes, which I'm unsure is worth the tradeoff of a better name.

The schools I have applied to as a transfer are UIUC (rejected), UCI, UCSD, UCLA, and UCB. Can anyone give me some insight on how transferring to one of these schools, or going to grad school will affect my future career prospects? Ideally I would graduate with a job in FAANG or a Unicorn, and I'm unsure how hiring or promotions would be affected if I graduate from my current school and don't attend grad school."

I have not heard back from the professor asking some questions about the workload and logistics so I was wondering if anyone had similar experience with the class or with doing a job and a summer class. Also we do not have a megatred about classes next semester yet correct? I have a few questions but I do not want to make a bunch of post if the mods are making one now."
mln42p,1,2021-04-06,CUDA engineer vs Machine Learning Engineer as a start position?,LaserAlpaca,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mln42p/cuda_engineer_vs_machine_learning_engineer_as_a/,"I am doing a master's degree in GPU related area and I am almost graduated. I am not sure what careers are better for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am doing an internship with a small company, dealing with machine learning stuff and also use Cuda. After I graduate, they can give me the position of ""Machine Learning Engineer"" for build the model (but probably we will just copy some open-source model since we are very small), or ""CUDA engineer"" for writing CUDA code. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, they told me my full-time job will be different from my internship, so I cannot do both anymore. I need to focus on one area. And I have 0 plan of doing a Ph.D. degree anymore. So if I am not going to pick the machine learning engineer position probably I will not able to compete with other guys with a Ph.D. degree for the ML engineer position in the future if I am going to apply for some big companies?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, It seems that there are more job positions for machine learning engineer and seems the salary is a little bit higher on machine learning engineer? I am really thinking about the future which will give me more benefits. Writing CUDA code is fun and gives me challenges. I am quite enjoying it. I don't like the training part of machine learning since it took too long to train a model, but other parts are fine for me. I am still struggling with which one I should pick. Any advice will be welcome!"

I'm an international student in computer engineering student at a university in Istanbul and I'm in my final semester. Apparently, I need to do an internship for at least one month in order to graduate. However, my graduation requirements page doesn't say that even though it should. I recently found out that I need an internship in order to graduate. 

My university staff is useless, they ignored all my emails. Most companies are looking for national students rather than international students. Most international students are struggling to find internships. 

I've applied to many places through LinkedIn. Never had any luck. If there is another alternative to LinkedIn, please let me know. 

I'm comfortable with Java, C++ and Python. I'm mostly looking for a remote internship. If you have any connections with anyone who is looking to hire an intern for a month. Please let them know. 

You help will be much appreciated. 
Thank you."

I'm currently working at a Fortune 500 tech company as a paid intern while attending school right now. I've already graduated with an Associates degree but I'm only a freshman in the college I've transferred. If I wanted to, I could for sure get into a program at this company where I just work full-time, possibly moving up the ladder and I have a really great reputation at the company too so there's a lot of opportunities open for me.

Is college really worth it for me? It seems like businesses are starting to open up about the possibility that college isn't as necessary for being a good working employee as it used to be. I already have this company on my resume so would it really be worth it to slave away for the next 3+ years of college just to add to my resume for a stupidly expensive degree that is getting more and more meaningless?"

I am transferring to University next Fall and I would like some advice on how should I prepare myself. 

During my 2 and a half years in the community college I took These classes:

\*Math: All calculus classes, linear algebra, and differential equations. 

\*Physics: All engineering physics courses ( 1-mechanics, wave motion and sound  2- electricity and magnetism 3- heat, light and modern physics. )

\*CS: C++(intro and advanced courses), data structure ( with c++ ), Java (  intro course ), computer architecture

\*ENGR: Electrical circuits

My questions: 

1-What are the courses I should review before starting my junior year in the University? 

2-Should I focus on one language or practice as many as I can? and what language would you recommend for me to focus on? 

3-As a student coming from a community college, how can I increase my chances in getting an internship? what are the skills I should focus on? 

Thank you so much for considering answering this post. Any input would be greatly appreciated!"
mlokq6,2,2021-04-06,I saw this girl I follow on Twitter recently get a college internship on her last few months before graduation. It's really pissing me off because she accomplished where I failed.,djdisciplejosh,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/mlokq6/i_saw_this_girl_i_follow_on_twitter_recently_get/,"I saw one of her recent tweet threads saying how she's so happy and stuff. She got a media internship with the NFL in NYC.

She's living my dream. Well not necessarily, both our career paths involve media, but I'm into more of photography and video and she's more into broadcasting.

The reason why it's bothering me so much is because unlike her, I ended up having dropping out of college due to reasons related to Covid-19 and mental health. My program was meant to be a more hands-on practical program but how am I supposed to be getting the proper education when everything is being forced online and I'm not getting the learning that was intended.

I find it impossible to focus through online classes and I was pretty much on my own and had to figure things out for myself with little to no help from my professors. I was in danger of failing two of my classes with no opportunity to make it up. Given my underlying mental health issues and Covid related reasons, I pretty much dropped out and decided enough was enough. I never should have gotten into this program in the first place if I knew this Covid-19 nonsense was gonna happen.

I was supposed to have an internship but I have already given up and my area is tightening restrictions due to the fast rising Covid-19 case numbers.

It's eating me alive because she succeeded where I failed. I honestly hope something bad happens to her and she doesn't become successful with her career."

Ap Lang/journalism teacher: 10/10; she doesn’t let kids see their letters but sent me mine to make sure it was perfect because she said she wanted to do everything she could to help me get in. Super detailed with projects and info I forgot from multiple years I had her

Wellesley: went really well and went over allotted time and into the next interviewees time on accident. She gave me advice on how to maximize my other apps in the future and we related pretty well.

Harvard: she said I was “an excellent candidate for Harvard” and we got along pretty well, but it only lasted 26 minutes which is pretty short for a Harvard interview.

UCLA was my dream school. When I got waitlisted and watched friends get in, it really hurt. I felt terrible and cheated and just wanted to disappear. I thought I had worked so hard for nothing. As u can see, I was only admitted to two UCs and was really hoping for more of a choice. At this point I only have Stanford left and am probably committing to UCSD right after that sweet rejection. I just want to say that you shouldn’t attach ur feelings of worth to ur schools.

I did from eighth grade and the fallout was not pretty. I suggest u look for reasons why u like ur dream schools and see how u can find those qualities in realistic schools for urself. UCSD was my second top choice after ucla so I am really happy to be going there. Just keep ur heads up and everything will be alright."

•2 years in a Client facing strategy and marketing role - work with Tier 1 companies like Shell, Lowes, Sobeys, Samsung, etc on merchant strategy. My company has the largest consumer big data set in the country in and we are pivoting to a DaaS model which has been exciting.

Have made final rounds for PMM roles in the past year, I am close to securing these roles as is.

Other:

During undergrad I worked 20hrs a week minimum. Worked at Toyota plant lifting tires just because I could get guaranteed hours so I could pay for school. I didnt even think about internships and was just happy to earn a steady guaranteed cheque. This lack of foresight screwed my journey and I essentially used the double degree masters program as a reset.


Grew up on a welfare, family was evicted when I was 4 years old, lived in government housing with mom, brother and sister until I was 12 in 500sqft apartment. Single mother. Me and my brother shared a bed until I was 12, and when we moved to a house we slept on the floor beside my moms bed because we couldnt just get used to sleeping in our own rooms(story makes me chuckle when I think about it lol). Absentee father, hasnt been in my life for the last decade - the stereotypical story unfortunately. 

In the past I have been encouraged to share more about my life story but I adamant on avoiding the ""woe is me"" mentality and letting past experiences define me thus i keep it private. I rather not mention it all to be totally honest.

* AP Chem teacher: 10/10
   * She made us do a whole worksheet so she could write the LOR. Overall, I was a great student in her class (did well on tests, showcased leadership in situations, showed I was genuine). Currently a TA for her so it's not like we haven't talked since March
* AP Lang teacher: 8/10
   * Not as close as AP Chem teacher but still close (but idk, maybe it was just her southern hospitality). Didn't do that great (still good but not mastering the subject) and was a little quieter in the class but she seemed eager to help me with a bunch of stuff (LORs for other programs, helping me edit essays, etc) so I'm sure her LOR was great
* Band teacher: 9/10
   * Took band all 4 years of HS and he's the cosponsor for Tri-M so we were pretty close, I also stepped up and learned the oboe when we needed one so I would say he wrote a pretty good LOR. -1 because it's not an ""academic recommendation"" and couldn't use it for most colleges (limit 2 LORs)
* Counselor: 6/10
   * Not really close to her but she's really nice and we got to chat at the beginning of the school year through zoom (talked about basic stuff like how we're doing, colleges to apply to, adapting to online learning). I helped her by making an information sheet about the online health course I took for other students a couple of years ago, but overall we're not really close.

**Interviews (All lasted ≈40 minutes)**

* **UPenn:** Average, the interviewer was nice but wasn't too excited, didn't fumble or anything
* **W&amp;L**: Really good, the interviewer was really nice and excited to be there

**Essays (I had 2 different commonapp ones)**

1. The first was about my last piano competition and how it taught me perseverance

**Additional Information:** 

Again, I think essays are where it's at. I spent so much time on my JHU supplement and tried to be very genuine because it was my #1 choice. In my LAC supplements, I talked about speaking out against monolithic political culture at my school (according to everyone I talked to it was either a genius idea or a stupid one, turned out to be a stupid one). I thought my ivy supplements were good, but they're ivies so not too surprised. I'm not a religious or superstitious person, but something in me tells me that everything works out for a reason (still kinda surprised I went 3/11 but I did apply to very competitive schools). Some force in the word decided my place was at Johns Hopkins, not Yale or UPenn, and it might seem confusing now but it'll all make sense once I step foot on campus. Go blue jays!"
mlqsz2,10,2021-04-06,I got rejected from every school I applied,lilynotlili,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mlqsz2/i_got_rejected_from_every_school_i_applied/,"I am 20 years old now. After graduating from high school, I decided to take a gap year to better prepare for my study abroad plan in the U.S (btw I'm an Asian). Because my scores at high school are not too good so I tried to improve my profile by taking extracurricular activities and other competitions/contests. I just want to say that I worked and studied really hard in this gap year to pursue my dream college. 

However, I still can't achieve that goal. I got rejected from every school I applied to in Fall 2021 admission (I remember my list is about 20+ colleges) and it damn hurts so much. 

I think that I need to give up dreaming about studying abroad because if I continue I have to accept that I will become a freshman at 21 (if I get received from some college). Maybe it is normal to some people but in my culture, starting college at 21 is too late, and seeing my peers at my same age is preparing to find an internship or graduate college makes me really stressed and pressured. Another factor is that my family is in a low financial background, I feel that if I expand my study path so long, it just causes my parents difficulty because they are at the entire age and I cannot force them to pay too much tuition or expenses for me anymore. 

I don't know what I have to do with all of this. Having given up on my dream is terrible and deeply I don't want to do it. But the above two factors make me consider a lot. Can anyone give me some advice? 

Thank you a lot."
mlr4kn,3,2021-04-06,Struggling to Determine how competitive an applicant I am,HospitalNo7098,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/mlr4kn/struggling_to_determine_how_competitive_an/,"Hello, I am currently a junior majoring in computer engineering. I really want to attend graduate school. I am very highly driven, and I want to attend the the best program I can get into. Like everyone else, going to a top university would be an absolute dream for me, but I am struggling to figure out how competitive an applicant, I am.

As a result, I would greatly appreciate feed back on what kinds of schools I might be actually be admitted at.

I plan to apply strictly to masters programs, as I want to further my education, but I am not necessarily interested in a Ph.D at this time.

My university is well received regionally. It is a mid sized (\~5,000) engineering and business focused school.

Unfortunately the school offers no research opportunities, and while I applied to some summer opportunities, I never was accepted to any.

When I apply this fall I will have either a 3.5 or 3.56 / 4.00 Cumulative GPA, and a 3.78 Major GPA

This summer I will be, with a professors guidance, doing a research project in the same focus as the graduate programs I intend to apply to. While publishing would obviously be amazing, I unfortunately will be working on it only 30 hours a week, while also working 30 hours a week at my internship this summer.

I will also be working as a TA for computer engineering classes for that same professor starting this fall.

As a result, I believe by the time I apply I will have a very positive LOR from said professor.

My second LOR will be from my employer. While my university has almost no research opportunities it has awarded me the opportunities to work for the past 3 years as an intern in a Co-Op program as an electrical engineer at Caterpillar, working full time during the summer, and part time while attending as a full time student. Which has been great experience in a field closely related to the field I want to pursue a graduate education in, but unfortunately not the same field.

Finally I am studying for the GRE I just started and am hoping to get above a 165 in the Quant Section, I am currently at 161\~ on my practice exams. If I don't manage to score above a 165 how less competitive will I be? After all many schools are accepting it this cycle due to Covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this was super unorganized or confusing to read. I am really struggling to determine if I have any chance at admissions into top programs, and in general how competitive of an applicant I am to masters admissions, and I would really appreciate feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:I am not concerned with funding or scholarships, paying doesn't really concern me.

I made this post because I know at the end of the day I lack the one thing every single forum, or knowledgeable person says is important, undergraduate research. I lack this due to previous financial situation of having to fund my own education, and as a result, did not apply to any Research programs until this year. As a result, I want to know if by virtue of having everything else per say on my CV, I still am a competitive applicant. "

**Letters of Recommendation**

I had an alright relationship with my recommenders; though I wasn't by any means the top student in their classes, I did make an effort to participate and show interest in their subject area. It's hard to know how good these were but I'll throw some numbers out anyways. 

Precalc (\~5/10): Probably run-of-the-mill to above average. 

APUSH (\~6/10): Pretty good I think; she was out for the first 1/4 of the school year, but in spite of that, I think we got along pretty well.​

**Interviews**

Stanford: This went alright; it lasted for an hour but I think I could have done better. 

Penn: I thought I did well initially, but in retrospect it was pretty bad.

Dartmouth: I think we got along well! I enjoyed talking with my interviewer. 

Cornell: Spoke to a guy from the town next to me and had a good time. I'm fairly certain that the interview doesn't matter for admissions though. 

**Essays**

I do think that essays matter a lot. I worked with an admissions service to help with my writing, especially for formulating ideas and revising. I spent around 2-3 months on my Common App, starting in mid-July/early-August. I did my Penn essays over the course of September and October and did all my RDs in the weeks after I got rejected from Penn. I'd rather not get too deep into the content of these essays. ​

\- Math Teacher (7/10) Typical rec letter with some personal anecdotes; I thought it wasn't that bad

\- English Teacher (?/10) Didn't read; she had me for two years, but she was really strict, so I wasn't very fun in that class

\- Comp Sci Teacher (?/10) Didn't read; he had me for two years, and I'm pretty sure he was brutally honest

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

*- Harvard:*  Lasted around an hour and a half, really awesome conversation, my  interviewer and I seemed to click

\- *Princeton:* This was my first interview, and I didn't really know what I was doing. Lasted about 45 mins, not great not bad

*- Stanford:* Lasted around an hour, had a cool conversation and learned a lot about Stanford; I thought it went pretty well

\- *Duke:* Lasted a little over an hour, it was less about me and more about Duke, I thought my interviewer was pretty cool

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor: We were quite close! I think this letter was probably decent.

AP Lang teacher: Could’ve been alright, I suppose. My writing was frequently used as an example and we were friendly, but I wasn’t as close as some folks are to their recommenders.

AP Macro teacher: Pretty generic, definitely nothing super special. It was nice though!

State Representative: 10/10. My mom cried at it. It was a good supplement to the rest of my app and very personal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interviews**

Denison: probably about average. Lasted for about 45 min, and I felt a tad nervous, but it was a good conversation.

Carleton: went really well! I definitely bonded with my interviewer and it was very fun and relaxed.

Oxy: I felt as though I didn’t totally click with my interviewer, but hey, you win some, you lose some!

Middlebury: went amazingly! I really clicked with my interviewer.

Princeton: I felt good about this one, my interviewer was from my high school and he was very enthusiastic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**

I put a lot of time into my essays! (Granted, some were better than others). If I had to sum it up, I’d say they were for the most part either quirky, about politics in some manner, or both.

My CommonApp essay was an anecdote about how I inadvertently got pulled into investigating a prostitution ring on behalf of some private investigators while doing voter registration and ended up trying to register a prostitute to vote, and how it ties into my ideals of bravery and persistence. (Yep, that actually happened. Hopefully it’s memorable.)

I feel as though I’m generally a decent writer, but I’m probably around average when it comes to the college applicant pool.

**Additional Information:**
I’m extremely surprised and excited about how well this turned out! To be honest, I was just shooting for the moon with most of these applications. I plan to continue to be politically active going forwards; I have an internship with a national politician this summer and goodness knows what’ll come next. My high school experience was interesting in that I was VERY shy when I entered and I have really gotten over it and embraced leadership positions! It’s okay to not be doing insane ECs in your freshman and sophomore year. Also, it’s worth taking a risk on essays. I was sorta afraid that my crazy stories might be too “out there” for AOs (and maybe they were at the ones I got rejected from), but they seem to have done the trick!"
mlt2i2,1,2021-04-06,Internship in FANG or a decent role in a seed-funded startup for an undergrad?,automatedhuman3120,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mlt2i2/internship_in_fang_or_a_decent_role_in_a/,"Let's say a person X, who graduated recently, had offers from a FAANG company and a seed-funded startup with a decent traction. He would have an internship in the former and a full-time senior role in the startup. In the internship, X would have a junior programmer role but he gets opportunities from time to time but the chances of getting placed there would be low, while in the startup, they require him to be build an entirely new feature in a 3-man team. What would be the perfect decision since the advantages of being in a FAANG company and learning from the best, building the best tech and with a similar pay in a startup where you would learn to take responsibilities, maybe not develop the best tech but surely create something of your own. What would your choice be as an undergrad?

I am still a freshman in Uni so I have absolutely no idea how companies actually function but my brother had a similar dilemma where he chose the FAANG company.

Note: On the salary part, I THINK they would be on a similar level but I would gladly take help from the comments.

mlt4qr,2,2021-04-06,Got into Applied Statistics phd however should I go for it?,Randomessinlife1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mlt4qr/got_into_applied_statistics_phd_however_should_i/,"Hi guys,

Before I start, I wanna give some background on myself: International, BS: math, MS (about to graduate): Statistics. My goal is to work in the industry--get into ML. I have an offer from Ph.D. in Applied Statistics from top 100 stats program but at this point, I am having a tough time deciding whether I should go for it.

Factors for not going:

1. Finances(big one)-- The stipend is okish(\~23k for 9 months) and looks like I won't be able to save much and any emergency funds for the first few years probably are going to be out of my pocket which means there is a chance of a bit of debt to add up. Talked with few current students--some work as TA or RA and a few do internships in summer. I really want to avoid paying by taking debt which means living frugally and sometimes not having peace of mind which could cause stress. On top of these, academic pressures. Still lots of unknowns and not sure if I should put all the eggs in one basket.
2. Internship-My hope is, if I go through the program, to get an internship in my third year which usually was done by few past students. However, the internship probably still is competitive so not 100% sure I can land one given all the other commitments I probably have to make on top of research.
3. Age- if I graduate within 5 yrs, I will be 31. not sure if that is a good or bad thing to start out in the industry.
4. Not sure if I would like research- As Ph.D. is a research degree, and getting into the depth of some statistical learning technique sounds appealing. However, as of now, I cannot tell if I really like research or not because I have limited experience. This is something I have to find out by joining the program. I like statistics. However, looking over the past student's thesis and trying to read papers, math seems to be intimidating which I am hopeful that will get easier with time.
5. Graduates from the program seem to be working as a senior biostatistician, quant analyst, data scientist, etc and some go to academia which is great. However, I feel that to become a data scientist, I can build up my skills while working and will be able to get into a good data scientist position with 5 yrs of experience.

Factors for going:

1. Skills(big one)- The one thing I wanna get out of my Ph.D. is to have tons of statistical/programming skills. I like to study and this is probably why I wanna go for Ph.D. in the first place. Also, I don't want to feel limited or have a plateau at some job in the future because of my master's degree.
2. Felt special-I always had mixed feelings about either going to Ph.D. or industry. Had I not received this Ph.D. offer, I wouldn't have had that choice to make. I was selected out of 150ish students which did make me feel good. To imagine having a Ph.D. in Applied statistics feels pretty good as well.
3. Applied- Since it's applied, I feel that the opportunities are endless as to where the statistics could be applied. If I decide to go, I will most probably be working in mixture modeling. Not how relevant it is currently to industry-Gaussian mixture molding seems to have tons of applications.

I was set on accepting the offer until yesterday when I suddenly decided, after considering the amount of stuff (sell car, move into a new state, buy a car, etc etc) that I have to go through even before the Ph.D. starts, led me to feel that I should just apply for jobs instead, and self-study on the side, learn more coding --maybe take online cs masters--and get too big tech or some other jobs that may come. Now, I am planning to apply for OPT and maybe look for jobs. Some friends say that I can always go back for Ph.D. later and can still get into Ph.D. programs after working for some years. However, I feel that once I start working, I will probably not get back living like a student, and also I may not get such an offer again.

Is having a Ph.D. better? Should I just try to land some entry-level analyst role and work on the side until I get into top companies--into roles such as data scientist? By the way, if I go for Ph.D., I probably will be working on some mixture modeling area. Going through some papers, the math is still esoteric but I like the professor works on it. I have not sent my reply yet and the deadline is soon. Thought I would just ask here to see if someone could suggest to me something that could help me make up my mind."

I still don’t feel like I deserve the Berkeley spot, but super grateful! Also, I was pretty content on  and excited about UMD until berk. I would tell any person who is applying as a cs major to **always apply to multiple safeties**, given how competitive the field has become.


Alsoooo for any nervous freshman/sophomores I would say please pursue extracurriculars and find your passion early! The number of ap classes doesn’t matter, it matters *how well you perform* and your extracurriculars are much more impressive than your stats, atleast in my opinion."

I'm an international student in computer engineering student at a university in Istanbul and I'm in my final semester. Apparently, I need to do an internship for at least one month in order to graduate. However, my graduation requirements page doesn't say that even though it should. I recently found out that I need an internship in order to graduate. 

My university has a department that helps students find jobs but the staff is useless, they ignored all my emails. Most companies are looking for national students rather than international students. Most international students are struggling to find internships. 

I've applied to many places through LinkedIn. Never had any luck. If there is another alternative to LinkedIn, please let me know. 

I'm comfortable with Java, C++ and Python. I'm mostly looking for a remote internship. If you have any connections with anyone who is looking to hire an intern for a month. Please let them know. 

You help will be much appreciated. 
Thank you."

Advice?",Meowthra1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mlu2fn/just_started_interning_and_company_politics_is/,"Won’t say the company name, but it’s a e-commerce unicorn that is based outside US and just setting up the US office. I was hired as a data engineer intern and started last week. 

The problem is, the main office seems really protective of their data. Although my boss here in US is trying to advocate for me, the main office is reluctant to grant me access to anything (even for training). As a result, I haven’t been able to do much data-related work yet. Instead, I have been spending a lot of time talking to different departments of both offices, and basically listening to them going back and forth over my security privileges. 

I am by no means experienced in the professional world, but I sense a lot of politics going on. Is this normal, or is this only happening because I’m a new intern? What can I do in these circumstances?"
mlud77,1,2021-04-07,My Ex just showed up on a dating app I use and I feel like I want to reconnect with her but worried,TAGameDevS,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mlud77/my_ex_just_showed_up_on_a_dating_app_i_use_and_i/,"I broke up with my ex because she had absolutely no time for me, her friends or family and would likely be this way until the end of 2021 when she finishes uni (due the major anxiety and overwhelming amounts of work) and was away for 4 months in the middle of nowhere for an internship but just came back. However, she appeared on a dating up for companionship (not a hookup) and it is making me feel like maybe a lot of the storm has passed, such as her coming back from a long trip that I wouldn't have been able to handle while still being with her (as it would be long distance) and covid restrictions have risen making it easier to hang out with more places to go, as well as the fact i've been focusing a lot on myself this year, which would help as I would also be focusing on myself if we were to get back together again, which would balance things out. The situation might be different, a lot of new things have come up but i'm afraid of falling into another pitfall and it could result in the same scenario again regardless.

For context, the first 2 months of dating her previously, I got to know what she was like when she wasn't bogged down by uni work and stress and I really loved it but gradually her work load increased and she had no time so I couldn't handle it after 9 months (plus she had to move away for those 4 months). If we got back together, she would still be the same amount of busy and even after the end of uni for the year, she could continue to be stressed, now from looking for a job OR even when she finds a job, she might still be overwhelmed by something, idk. But also since once you finish work, you leave work behind, she wouldn't have something stressing her out too much after it. What would you guys do?"
mlv9ra,1,2021-04-07,Making a Leap of Faith,jimharbaughthrowaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mlv9ra/making_a_leap_of_faith/,"Short story: I am a sophomore in college (the institution should be pretty obvious from the username). The first semester of my freshman year, I took an introductory coding class that beat my ass. It was a totally new topic to me and I wasn't prepared for college yet, so it destroyed me. 

I withdrew from the class and my confidence has taken at least a year to recover. Like I don't think I can describe how badly it fucked me up mentally -- it's taken me a full year-and-a-half to get my confidence near pre-college levels. I changed my major from data science to econ and just decided to roll from there thinking I could get some finance job and then maybe branch out into something else, as an econ degree has a pretty wide set of uses (double-edged sword, I guess).

I took an equivalent of the same coding course at a community college over the past summer and passed it. Hated every second, but that was largely because I was taking it online, working, and taking another class at the same time. Right before this school year, I learned about my school's UX/data analysis program and made it my intention to apply. At that point I was really despondent about being an econ major as most of the jobs I'd been gunning for there would be taken up by the business school kids anyways.

However, I learned that the program isn't quite as robust as I thought. Yes, they have lots of resources and connections, but it's still incredibly new and from what I've seen it doesn't teach enough technical fundamentals and the variance is pretty high i.e. some people go to great companies with great jobs and others work retail. The program is also rather easy, and I have a lot of trouble coming to terms with spending tuition on something that it isn't hard or give me super tangible skills.

Even though I had these concerns, I still applied to the program because I'd taken the prereqs and was still interested in UX as a career (even though I still find the field to be a little vague, as ""UX"" is used in a lot of contexts and I'll be completely open about the fact that I feel like I haven't done enough research about it). I knew that UX is a super competitive field, but went ahead with my plan anyways.

Just in case, I worked on Plan B, which was my econ degree . I took some more of the courses (except not the super important one, as I didn't see the point if I was applying to the UX program). I also started to relax a little bit about being an econ major, as I started to talk to some alumni and do some research and honestly people don't always do that bad with the degree. also took that intro coding class's older brother, and am thoroughly enjoying it to the point where I'm definitely going to do a CS minor. I spent so much time on Plan B, in fact, that it's starting to look like a pretty sexy option. Despite being way behind my friends in the internship and extracurricular activities arms race, I've actually realized that I'm capable of things I set my mind to and am really enjoying my computer science class to the point where I am thinking about getting into it as a major. Paired with my econ degree (which is on its way to being done) this would be a killer combination. 

I was accepted into the UX program.

So now I find myself at an impasse with two options:

1) Go into the UX program, where I know I'll pass the courses but I'm not sure if I trust myself to grind enough with networking and such to get a good job. Would also get a CS minor. Alternately I could do the information analysis program within the same school and potentially pair it with econ.

2) Stick with econ and just make that my sole focus with finding internships, etc. Maybe get my master's in econ or cs, idk.

3) Switch to CS and strap in. I know I've only taken like two CS classes but damn do I actually kinda like it. I'm taking discrete math this summer so I can take the final class for the minor in the fall. However, there I continue to have lingering doubts about my ability and intelligence so this is a really scary option for me.

If anyone has been in the same position or generally knows how to navigate leaps of faith, please let me know. Thanks for reading this wall of text as well."

Even though I had these concerns, I still applied to the program because I'd taken the prereqs and was still interested in UX as a career (even though I still find the field to be a little vague, as ""UX"" is used in a lot of contexts and I'll be completely open about the fact that I feel like I haven't done enough research about it). I knew that UX is a super competitive field, but went ahead with my plan anyways.

Just in case, I worked on Plan B, which was my econ degree . I took some more of the courses (except not the super important one, as I didn't see the point if I was applying to the UX program). I also started to relax a little bit about being an econ major, as I started to talk to some alumni and do some research and honestly people don't always do that bad with the degree. also took that intro coding class's older brother, and am thoroughly enjoying it to the point where I'm definitely going to do a CS minor. I spent so much time on Plan B, in fact, that it's starting to look like a pretty sexy option. Despite being way behind my friends in the internship and extracurricular activities arms race, I've actually realized that I'm capable of things I set my mind to and am really enjoying my computer science class to the point where I am thinking about getting into it as a major. Paired with my econ degree (which is on its way to being done) this would be a killer combination.

I was accepted into the UX program.

So now I find myself at an impasse with two options:

1. Go into the UX program, where I know I'll pass the courses but I'm not sure if I trust myself to grind enough with networking and such to get a good job. Would also get a CS minor. Alternately I could do the information analysis program within the same school and potentially pair it with econ.
2. Stick with econ and just make that my sole focus with finding internships, etc. Maybe get my master's in econ or cs, idk.
3. Switch to CS and strap in. I know I've only taken like two CS classes but damn do I actually kinda like it. I'm taking discrete math this summer so I can take the final class for the minor in the fall. However, there I continue to have lingering doubts about my ability and intelligence so this is a really scary option for me.

If anyone has been in the same position or generally knows how to navigate leaps of faith, please let me know. Thanks for reading this wall of text as well."

I’ve got my classes planned out so that Summer 2022 and Summer 2023 are completely empty. I’m planning to look for an internship in Summer 2023, but as for 2022, I think doing something abroad would be really great. I really want to go to Australia, because I think it’s one of the most interesting places in the world and living there would be amazing, or somewhere in England or even Japan. For a computer science student, are any of these 3 reasonable choices? 

I talked to my advisor about abroad today and she told me that some students go abroad to get a useful minor, such as international engineering. For CS, would that make sense?

I have bright futures FAS, so will they pay for that?
If any CS students have done abroad, what kind of program did you go into? Where did you go? Was it worth it? How expensive is it? Scholarships?

Sorry I have a lot of questions but I don’t think I’m able to do a study abroad advising appointment because I need over 2.75 gpa to even fill the interest form but I won’t be over that until after this semester (it’s my first year and my fall semester was really rough)"

mm22jz,1,2021-04-07,What do you guys think of this major?,RJA27,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/mm22jz/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_major/,"Hey guys,

So lately I’ve been feeling VERY lost. I’ve been in college for 3 years now, this is my 6th semester. After transferring schools a bunch, some credits were lost in translation and I’m now technically a sophomore credit-wise. Over the course of the past few years I’ve tried a lot of different engineering majors: biomedical, aero, mechanical, computer science and currently electrical. 

The reason I got into engineering is a long story that I’ll spare you so I’ll just say that that reason is no longer in existence. I’ve been pursuing it further not out of passion or enjoyment but because it felt like the smart decision. This semester I’ve decided that I cannot go down this path anymore. I’m seriously not enjoying it and I’m really, really struggling. 

So I’ve been looking for a new major. I’ve considered a LOT of different paths: business, law, accounting etc. and I just don’t feel a pull towards any of them. I’ve known for a long time that my passion in life is music. I absolutely love it, playing it, writing, performing etc. If it’s what I could spend my life doing, I would. But if I’m being honest, I know that a music degree is not practical. 

My school does, however, offer a kind of different and unique major called Sound Studies. It’s brand new and I mean brand new. It was started last fall so there’s not much data on it (student starting salaries, job placement percentages etc). It’s a mixture of music (theory and performance) as well as studies is recording, editing, acoustics etc. This is right up my alley and I know that I’d love doing this. But I’m worried about how practical it could be. 

Honestly, the fact that it’s so new concerns me. I met with the Department Head who told me that the students who are in the major have gotten some really nice internships at places like MTV, VH1, Sony BMG, Atlantic Records etc. places I think I’d really enjoy working. It sounds good on paper, but I’m still a little nervous about it. 

So my question to you guys: what do you make of this? Are there some good grad school options with a degree like this? Should I be looking into something else? To clarify it is a Bachelor of Arts degree btw. 

Thanks!

EDIT:

To give some more info/background on the Major here are some of the courses and descriptions:

MUSC 395. Acoustics &amp; Sound Control. 3 Credits.
Examines the science and theory of acoustics via sound production and capture in various mediums and in various controlled spaces. This course is designed to introduce the fundamentals of acoustics, with a focus on sound capture and control for recorded music and live performance. 

MUSC 393. Audio Mixing &amp; Music Prod. 3 Credits.
An advanced course designed to elevate students to a professional level of audio mixing and music production. The course will be taught in a Pro Tools environment, while Logic Pro and Ableton Live will be used for post-production. Students will have access to Apple Maclntels, MIDI Controllers, Condenser Microphones, Monitor Speakers, Digital Pianos, and DigiDesign Sound Modules. 

MUSC 390. Digital Audio Recording and Editing. 3 Credits.
An introduction to music and digital technology designed to help students gain familiarity with the language of music editing, recording, and production. Although the Apple-based program Logic will be the main software used for recording musical and other sonic schemes, ProTools, Finale, and GarageBand will also be used. Students will have access to Apple MacIntels, MIDI Controllers, Condenser Microphones, Monitor Speakers, Digital Pianos, and DigiDesign Mbox2 Sound Modules."

I would choose the larger company due to better pay and name recognition helping resume in future, but am worried that a front end position may lead to a career path of front end when I am unsure if I want to fully pursue it as my projects currently on my resume are front end oriented as well.  Should I take the full stack role for a more broad experience, or should I take the larger company for better name recognition on resume?  Plus, is it a valid concern that an internship could have such an effect on the potential side of swe that I want to pursue in the future."

Hello, I really hope to find some help here.

My situation: I, M, am 24 years old and have studied business informatics. During my studies, I also worked for two years at the largest software company in Europe in the pre-sales department and also completed my mandatory internship there. After my studies, I added an additional half-year internship for the same position. Since April 2020, I am now working as a developer in the same company AND THAT just doesn't work.

The working environment and the colleagues are just great but the subject matter itself is just horrible for me. The work is way too dry for me and I don't enjoy it. I get angry at myself when I don't understand contexts and don't understand the programming language. I never wanted to end up as a developer and already hated programming during my studies, but I really wanted to start at this company. Additionally, the fact that I've been stuck in a home office 24/7 for a year is weighing on me. In this one year I have gone from an optimistic graduate who also managed group projects during his studies to a bitter, suicidal, anxious worker. I would very much like to change (don't know in which area yet), but I'm terrified that I won't get a job in another company because they think I'm ""too stupid to develop"" and a ""job hopper"". In total, I've been with this company for over 3 years and only 13 months of that at this job.

This job has made me so insecure that I can't list a single strength of mine and would prefer to bury my head in the sand whenever confronted.

I need help. My family doesn't recognize me anymore and my sister told me to my face ""I wish you never started at \[company name\]"". This is also the reason why I am writing this post in tears. I am looking for help. Are there people here who felt the same way? Do you have any tips for me?

Thank you in advance..."

**Letters of Recommendation**

**Honors Physics / Engineering / Math Team Teacher** \- 9/10. Loved him, he's told me that I have rare abilities before, has seen me perform in Math Team since 9th grade. I don't have all positive experiences with him but overwhelmingly so, and he told me he wrote ""all solid stuff.""

**Honors English** \- 7/10. She was a sweetheart, although initially, we hated each other. She submitted my rec letter kind of late, and I think she rushed on it, but if she didn't this probably would've been a 10/10.

**GC** \- 7/10. She likes me, but I know she liked other people better and mine will be kind of general. She knows I do a lot, but I rarely actually tell her everything lol so I guess I can't expect much

*Optional Rec Letters (not used for all)*

**CSP / FBLA Teacher** \- 5/10. She sent me the letter she wrote. Very VERY general stuff. I also read what she gave my friend, and it was basically the same stuff, slightly better for him since he had leadership in the club. I could've used someone better

**Youth Council Advisor** \- 8/10. Again, I saw this letter, and it was really nice and sweet. I basically told her what to write because she wasn't used to doing this stuff, but I liked it, and my guidance counselor also liked it.

**Interviews**

1. UPenn - First one... all in all, it absolutely sucked. I lost my train of thought, got corrected like twelve times, and was not good at all - 3/10
2. MIT - Better, except I applied PoliSci and kept confusing the name with the name of the Princeton PoliSci School (which I also did during my Princeton interview keep reading lol) - 6/10
3. Dartmouth - Ok, I said what I needed to say, but my interviewer just seemed bored, like right from the start it was like he just wanted to get the job over with. Still, just a solid interview - 7/10
4. Cornell - Amazing, but doesn't matter lol - 9/10
5. Columbia - I had reservations bc the guy was in his seventies, but this was my favorite one. We immediately clicked, and he told me I was his most promising interviewee this year, and that he really wished that I was the 1-2 from his group that gets into Columbia this year. - 10/10
6. Harvard - was not expecting this interview, got interviewed by someone who graduated from their law school, he kept talking abt his alma mater, Duke, and gave me 2 hours to prepare for my interview. Despite this, it was pretty fun, and he said he was very impressed by my portfolio, and that it was one of the best he'd seen - 8/10
7. Princeton - Literally same as the MIT, except the guy was a PoliSci grad and straight-up called me out for it - 3/10
8. UMich - meh, my guy just kept trying to get me to consider a fraternity. he was a massive frat boy and that's all that was talked about - 6/10
9. Stanford - Similar to Dartmouth, lack of connection, and she seemed bored. Cut me off 32 minutes out of 45 because she had to leave, told me to email her my questions (which I did) and never got a reply - 5/10
10. Yale - Chill interview, we kinda just talked. Nothing important was said, but it was I guess just a solid interview - 7/10
11. Duke - Never actually got it, even though I asked for one. 0/10?

mm577j,1,2021-04-07,Extending degree for two more internships or not,Kushdoctor69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mm577j/extending_degree_for_two_more_internships_or_not/,"Hi there!

I know this is a long post and I understand if you do not have the time to read it. But if you do, I really really appreciate it and I would love it if you could offer your input on my dilemma.

I am currently finishing year 3 out of 4 of my software engineering degree and I am also enrolled in the school’s co-op program. Because covid hit us hard last year, I didn’t manage to get an internship last summer (as I was supposed to per my co-op recommended course sequence) and so I had to take some summer courses and shuffle around some classes.

The co-op program wants us to do three internships before we graduate. I have done one already and I will be doing another one this summer. This leaves me with only one internship left to do but with two semesters worth of courses left. This leaves me with a dilemma in my hands.

One option is that because I only have two more semesters of school left, I could simply study next Fall and Winter and thus graduate next Summer (beginning of May 2022) with two internships (and not three). I would have to quit the co-op program for this (not a big deal).

The other option is currently what I am planning on doing but I have my doubts on whether this is the best option (hence my posting here). I could take another internship this Fall (internship #3), then study in Winter, then take another internship in the next Summer (internship #4), and then finally go back to school for Fall 2022 and graduate in middle of December 2022.

My dilemma here is the following: is it worth it to extend my graduation date by nearly 8 months in order to graduate with four internships instead of two? I will write down a list of advantages that pertain to my situation for each option below and I would love to have your opinion on which option you think is better (and if my points make sense or not).

&amp;#x200B;

Option #1 pros:

\- I will start to earn a better salary (vs lower intern pay) sooner and so those eight months will be a lot more profitable.

\- Will also make me acquire “better quality experience” sooner (i.e. full-time experience is seen as superior compared to intern experience). Instead of having 8 months of extra intern experience, I will have 8 months of full-time experience.

\- Not dragging on school longer than I need to.

&amp;#x200B;

Option #2 pros:

\- Doing two extra internships (at hopefully two different companies) will allow me to experience more work environments which will allow me to know what I like more, what company is better, where I should set my standards, etc. I won’t be able to explore companies as much once I get on the market since leaving before 1-2 years is seen as bad on your CV.

\- Will allow me to have a more developed professional network. I don’t plan on returning to my first company but maybe to my second one. And so, with two extra internships, I would have the possible choice of returning to three companies vs just one.

\- Would allow me to apply to FAANG for my last internship (Summer 2022). This would give me a better chance to compete since I would have 2 internships + 1 ongoing when applying in August 2021 as opposed to having to apply to a newgrad position with 2 internships where it will be harder to get into a FAANG (with option #1). Am I correctly estimating the difference in difficulty of entry for intern vs newgrad or do you think that I would still be ok with applying for a newgrad FAANG or Microsoft position with just 2 internships?

\- Would allow me to possibly travel in January-March 2023 after graduation with my girlfriend since she would have the time off from university during those months (although this is not set in stone). If I find work right after graduation in December 2022, I would try to negotiate my start date for it to be in March 2023 or something. However, in the case of option #1, I doubt that I would be able to get some time off after 8 months of work in order to travel (and this is assuming that I start working in the beginning of May 2022 immediately).

\- Would have an easier time getting a newgrad position in general with 4 vs 2 internships. However, I am wondering if it really makes a difference at that point anymore. Would I really have an easier time? And would I really be able to leverage a much larger starting salary and benefits with 4 vs 2 internships? Maybe a hiring manager can chime in on this point.

\- Jumping into the market later could be a good thing since it would allow the job market to recover even more after covid. However, will the situation really improve that much between May 2022 and December 2022 for this 8 months extension to be worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, the way I see it, option #2 offers a lot more flexibly and potentially better outcomes (e.g. travelling after graduation and easier FAANG entry). However, I am afraid that stretching my studies this way is simply a waste of time and I should just jump into the market as soon as possible with option #1 and get paid better and gain better experience since I already have 2 internships which is enough. What do you all think?

Thank you so so much to everyone who managed to read everything until the end of this wall of text. It really means a lot to me and any input will be highly appreciated!"

I was fortunate enough to get a Data Science internship for this summer in Seattle, WA. I am given an option to choose between a hybrid (some in-person and some virtual) and a fully virtual internship.

I really want to do the in-person internship since I find it to be a better experience and would love to explore Seattle this summer. However, I am concerned that I'll be one of the very few people who will be there in-person this summer and I don't want to be all alone in a new city.

Do y'all have any recommendations or advice on what I should do?

4. AP Scholar w/ Distinction
5. Questbridge College Prep Scholar
6. *Dell Scholarship Recipient (updated most of my RD colleges since I hadn’t gotten it until March)*

**Letters of Recommendation**

Very strong. My 1st LOR was from my math teacher who had taught me since sophomore year (Alg 2, Honors Pre Calc, AP Calc AB) and also a sponsor of a club I'm in. It’s important to note that math is my weakest subject but she knew me the best and saw how hard I worked for my A’s. I feel like we formed a friendship over the years and she definitely enjoyed my presence as much as I enjoyed hers.

My 2nd LOR came from my AP Psych teacher. She first met me through mock trial (end of freshman year into sophomore yr) and then I took her class. Once again, a well established relationship beyond the classroom. 

Counselor rec: I gave my counselor a lot of information about me so I’m assuming her counselor rec contained all the goods needed. 

**Interviews**

My interviews went pretty well. They weren’t spectacular or anything but I tried to present them with new information. I’m pretty good at talking to strangers. 

Although, I don’t think they matter that much.I thought my Stanford interview went well and got rejected, while my Northwestern interview was probably my most least personal and I got in. Role of the dice type thing.

**Essays**

My personal statement was a good essay (I’d give it an 8/10). It wasn’t super specific to one topic but it also wasn’t super vague. And I didn’t center it completely around one event per se. It pretty much just summed up how my family challenges and participation in mock trial shaped me into who I am today. It was very moving and beautifully written (words from people who read it.) I think the biggest thing though was its honesty and candidness. My introduction was pretty dramatic and attention catching and my ending is a little cute clever nod to what I have in store for the future. It had some imagery, allusions, and metaphors to add an extra \*mmph\* if you will. I didn’t try and sound like I was Shakespeare by adding a bunch of big, fancy words that I got from Oxford’s dictionary but I also didn’t sound like a third grader. I think I struck a nice balance in my PS which served me well ;)

Overall, my supplements were pretty good. I was very (and I mean very) specific for my why x college essays. I used what I had done in HS and what I wanted to do in the future to show why that college was a fit for me. I also used any major essays to discuss my future career as an attorney. Furthermore, I tried my best to not repeat myself if colleges had multiple essays. If I had already talked about this EC or experience, I made sure not to talk about it again so I don’t come across as one dimensional! 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Northwestern (RD)

**Additional Information:**

I think the three turning points of my application were my advocates, essays, and commitment. 

My teachers were fierce advocates for me and I gave them a lot of specific information to go off of. We had strong relationships outside of the classroom which really helped me open up to them and in turn, they put their time and effort into crafting quality LORs. 

My essays were nice reads. No need to reiterate what I said earlier, but I definitely think I got points for creativity, thoughtfulness, and honesty. 

My commitment to my ECs were clear. I had been in most of my ECs since fresh/soph yr. I pursued leadership roles or at least engaged in leadership activities and brought them up in other parts of my application without shoving them down the AO’s throats. Not related, but I also think keeping my grades up was a plus (idk?) I know COVID completely obliterated some people’s work ethic and senior grades (some people being me) but I found a way to maintain all A’s for that first semester. 

Overall, I am content with my decisions. I got a lot of rejections before I got a wave of acceptances so just have patience. If there are any rising seniors reading this that want advice or help with essays feel free to PM me. Until next time!"
mm5jmi,3,2021-04-07,Should I quit machine learning if I have no intention of doing an MS/Ph.D. and want to get into FAANG or any large companies?,Public-Drag1602,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mm5jmi/should_i_quit_machine_learning_if_i_have_no/,"I am currently in my final year of graduating from college (CS degree). I am presently interning at a company where the work is mostly based on Computer Vision (searching for the right model(s) to suit the task of the company) and have a full-time job offer with decent pay (I'll be graduating in August 2021). I actually love the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning and also have a paper published in IET Electronic Letters. (I seriously have no intention of bragging, sorry if it sounds that way). I like researching models occasionally and try out different things to improve DL-based computer vision models.

But my long term goal is to work at one of the FAANG or any other large tech company with good pay

However, I realized (pretty late) that to get a job in machine learning at big companies, you have to hold an MS/Ph.D. degree and not in a position to apply for MS because of personal reasons. Also, I have no interest in pursuing a Ph.D.

Most of my internship experience and is mostly towards ML/DL and don't have much experience in software development apart from 2 projects involving building websites in Django and a bit of Node.js. I am okayish in DS/Algo, however, still not close to the level of giving interviews at companies like Amazon,etc.

I suppose you have to be exceptional at coding for getting jobs at big tech companies and also need good software development skills and experience. I have worked on only one software development WFH internship but it did not involve OOP's or system design, just basic features added to the existing codebase on C++, and thus am not sure if it'll count as proper experience

My question is should I start practicing interview questions from Leetcode after coming from work and is there anything I can do so that I can build good projects that qualify as ""Software Development"" so that I at least can apply for these jobs?

mm66o4,5,2021-04-07,Extending degree for two more internships or not,Kushdoctor69,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mm66o4/extending_degree_for_two_more_internships_or_not/,"Hi there!

I know this is a long post and I understand if you do not have the time to read it. But if you do, I really really appreciate it and I would love it if you could offer your input on my dilemma.

I am currently finishing year 3 out of 4 of my software engineering degree and I am also enrolled in the school’s co-op program. Because covid hit us hard last year, I didn’t manage to get an internship last summer (as I was supposed to per my co-op recommended course sequence) and so I had to take some summer courses and shuffle around some classes.

The co-op program wants us to do three internships before we graduate. I have done one already and I will be doing another one this summer. This leaves me with only one internship left to do but with two semesters worth of courses left. This leaves me with a dilemma in my hands.

One option is that because I only have two more semesters of school left, I could simply study next Fall and Winter and thus graduate next Summer (beginning of May 2022) with two internships (and not three). I would have to quit the co-op program for this (not a big deal).

The other option is currently what I am planning on doing but I have my doubts on whether this is the best option (hence my posting here). I could take another internship this Fall (internship #3), then study in Winter, then take another internship in the next Summer (internship #4), and then finally go back to school for Fall 2022 and graduate in middle of December 2022.

My dilemma here is the following: is it worth it to extend my graduation date by nearly 8 months in order to graduate with four internships instead of two? I will write down a list of advantages that pertain to my situation for each option below and I would love to have your opinion on which option you think is better (and if my points make sense or not).

&amp;#x200B;

Option #1 pros:

\- I will start to earn a better salary (vs lower intern pay) sooner and so those eight months will be a lot more profitable.

\- Will also make me acquire “better quality experience” sooner (i.e. full-time experience is seen as superior compared to intern experience). Instead of having 8 months of extra intern experience, I will have 8 months of full-time experience.

\- Not dragging on school longer than I need to.

&amp;#x200B;

Option #2 pros:

\- Doing two extra internships (at hopefully two different companies) will allow me to experience more work environments which will allow me to know what I like more, what company is better, where I should set my standards, etc. I won’t be able to explore companies as much once I get on the market since leaving before 1-2 years is seen as bad on your CV.

\- Will allow me to have a more developed professional network. I don’t plan on returning to my first company but maybe to my second one. And so, with two extra internships, I would have the possible choice of returning to three companies vs just one.

\- Would allow me to apply to FAANG for my last internship (Summer 2022). This would give me a better chance to compete since I would have 2 internships + 1 ongoing when applying in August 2021 as opposed to having to apply to a newgrad position with 2 internships where it will be harder to get into a FAANG (with option #1). Am I correctly estimating the difference in difficulty of entry for intern vs newgrad or do you think that I would still be ok with applying for a newgrad FAANG or Microsoft position with just 2 internships?

\- Would allow me to possibly travel in January-March 2023 after graduation with my girlfriend since she would have the time off from university during those months (although this is not set in stone). If I find work right after graduation in December 2022, I would try to negotiate my start date for it to be in March 2023 or something. However, in the case of option #1, I doubt that I would be able to get some time off after 8 months of work in order to travel (and this is assuming that I start working in the beginning of May 2022 immediately).

\- Would have an easier time getting a newgrad position in general with 4 vs 2 internships. However, I am wondering if it really makes a difference at that point anymore. Would I really have an easier time? And would I really be able to leverage a much larger starting salary and benefits with 4 vs 2 internships? Maybe a hiring manager can chime in on this point.

\- Jumping into the market later could be a good thing since it would allow the job market to recover even more after covid. However, will the situation really improve that much between May 2022 and December 2022 for this 8 months extension to be worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, the way I see it, option #2 offers a lot more flexibly and potentially better outcomes (e.g. travelling after graduation and easier FAANG entry). However, I am afraid that stretching my studies this way is simply a waste of time and I should just jump into the market as soon as possible with option #1 and get paid better and gain better experience since I already have 2 internships which is enough. What do you all think?

Thank you so so much to everyone who managed to read everything until the end of this wall of text. It really means a lot to me and any input will be highly appreciated!"

I'm confused whether the auditing experience is actually going to be valuable  for me in the long term or if I should take my chances applying for more relavant internships for next year and just finishing my studies a year early then using the extra year gaining the right experience."

* I only had two work experiences prior to my current job as a software engineer
* The last experience was a ""software developer"" internship in the summer of my senior year, where I did very little actual coding and mostly menial crap
* The experience I had before that was a research position where I did work that a trained monkey could do

Given the fact I got nothing from my summer experiences, let's just say I ""embellished"" my resume a bit regarding those two positions and have already submitted my resume to companies that I'm in the final stages with. Should I email my potential references without providing my resume? Or do I revise my resume to be slightly more accurate and hand them the revised copy?"

mm8nop,0,2021-04-07,Can I do two internships at once? I need help please!,WaterBottleGodKing,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mm8nop/can_i_do_two_internships_at_once_i_need_help/,"**Backstory:** In January I transferred to a four year from my CC and in February I got my first internship offer ever and I was very happy. I accepted the offer; however, I soon started to feel like I got lucky so I started my search again to prove to myself that I could get another internship. So in mid March I started applying again and I recently got my second offer. Now I'm conflicted.

**Problem (I need help here):** Let's call the company that first gave me the offer company A and the second one company B. I really liked interviewing at both companies and genuinely enjoyed speaking with the hiring managers that extended offers to me. I also liked the technologies both companies work on and I know for a fact I would learn a lot in both internships while being in a positive fostering environment.

I want to work at both companies. Do you think that's possible? I understand I would be working all day, but the reason why I can justify this is because I normally don't do anything over the summer anyways and I know as soon as I finish my day at company A I would practically just play video games for the rest of the day and get bored.

How do I approach telling both companies the situation I'm in? Should I ask them if they're okay with me interning at two places at once or should I keep that info hush hush?

I would like to work at both companies for the experience and because I would like to build a relationship with both companies in order to expand my full-time options upon graduation.

**Team:** The technologies I'd be working with overlap a lot. With Company A I'd be working with Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and some cloud stuff. With Company B I'd be working with Java, Docker, Kubernetes, and some other stuff. Both companies placed me in a real team working on real products.

Both jobs are remote and company B mentioned that they're flexible with the time I start and end the day as long as I get the job done.

**Compensation:** Company A is more per hour, but Company B is more long term since it is a year long internship rather than just summer. I don't necessarily want to factor compensation into my decision but I'm including it to give a better picture.

**Competition/NameBrand:** Company A uses Company B's software so I don't believe they're necessarily competitors — and I believe Company B is better known because it has been mentioned before in these CS subreddits whereas Company A has no mentions.

tldr: I want to intern at two companies over the summer. How do I go about doing this?"

I'd appreciate some advice on pursuing a programming career via a different path",AnImpromptuFantaisie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mm91dw/ive_finally_realized_that_although_im_very/,"Hi there,

### 

I'd like to apologize in advance for the long post. Feel free to skip the life story and jump right to the Questions section if you'd prefer.

**tldr: I'm looking for advice on pursuing a career in programming without a CS degree.**

### 

###Background

I've loved to program since I was about 12 or 13. Learned Java to make Minecraft mods, went to some tech summer camps, took a couple high school programming classes - a pretty common story. From early on, I never even considered pursuing any path other than CS, and went off to college with that plan in mind.

Now I'm 22, still a student, and just realizing that I couldn't care less about computer architecture or the IEEE 754 standard for floating point arithmetic. I've never been good at math, which has proved to be a roadblock for things like time complexity, etc. I aced every Data Structures programming assignment, but tanked all the written tests. I definitely had a different image of what ""Computer Science"" was, and am now coming to terms with it not being for me.

I'm still as passionate as ever about programming, and I'm also pretty damn good at it. I work on personal projects in my spare time, learn new languages, and have built up a sizeable portfolio of code.

### 

###Questions

I still definitely want to pursue a career that involves programming, and there's two paths that come to mind:

* Shift gears to a major like WebDev or Game Design so that I obtain an actual degree.

* Use my previous internship experience and code portfolio to try to find work without a degree.

### 

Regarding making that decision, there's a couple things I'd like to ask about/get advice on:

1. How beneficial would a non-CS, but programming related degree be for finding work? I'm fully aware of how important a degree is in the application process, but is it worth it if it's not a CS degree? What would my time be better spent on - looking for work, or getting one of those degrees? How about a programming certificate?

2. Are there any other programming related degree options that I'm not thinking of? WebDev and Game Design were just the first things that I thought of.

3. My understanding is that a CS degree allows for a wide variety of career paths. If I do end up getting a degree in one of those more specialized majors, will I pretty much be restricted to just that field?

4. If I do end up deciding not to get a degree, are there good tips for improving my odds at being noticed when applying for jobs? I'm sure there's already a bunch of posts on this subreddit asking about this, but I figured I'd ask anyway. For example, I've been using various AWS services for years and have gotten pretty familiar with them. Should I look into getting AWS certification? Anything along that same vein?

### 

My mind is sort of scrambled right now trying to figure out my future. I'm sure my post isn't as coherent as it could be, but I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it.

### 

Thanks,

I am about to graduate from college with a history degree. In the past year and a half I've been really interested in developing marketing and social media skills, so I have 4 internships in that field. But I have no formal education in the topic. My career goal is to get a marketing / social media job representing a non profit. I've done communications for two non profits and I really enjoy promoting equitable causes. 

However, one of my internships has just offered me a job doing communications and community outreach work. Although I was originally interested in interning there, I've realized that its a local business that just opened and does not have a marketing team. I would be the only one leading those initiatives. I feel like I wouldn't be developing my skills in marketing as I wouldn't be learning from a department.  It's a small insurance business and I don't really enjoy the sales based atmosphere.

It's not my dream job, and it's not a nonprofit. I'm feeling really torn here...

I'm worried if I pass the job I won't readily find a (hopefully remote) social media / marketing job. If I take the job I feel like I may stagnate on the path to my desired career. One possibility I am considering is volunteering as a Social Media Manager for a non-profit, and find a similar job in a year.

I heard that for a normal graduate student doing research, your stipend increases during the summer because you are expected to do more research and less coursework? Are the recruiters targeting grad students who have funding for research during academic year but not for summer? Or is it because the grad student hasn't progressed passed X number of graduate level courses and thus doesn't get research until X is completed? Is this part of some kind of academic rotation thing where your school/department/advisor/funding source says its okay to get experience elsewhere?

Originally, I turned them down but, at this point, I'm getting kinda desperate.

**Is it worth it to take an unpaid internship this summer due to my lack of success with paid internship companies? Or would it be better to get some sort of paying job on the side (most likely not tech related) and develop my skills through other ways (e.g. side projects, boot camps)?** My main concerns are: a) not having a source of revenue for the summer to pay for tuition, rent, etc. and b) not gaining enough experience for next year's internship recruitment cycle (internships help give that ""structure"" for learning/working on a project even if they're unpaid).

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated!!"

Therefore, if I had to redo the whole process, this is what I would do differently:

1) Be born in a wealthy family

2) Take an accelerated middle school path and be done with calculus by the time I finish my sophomore year

3) Enroll in a $80k/year private school in New York City that sends 50% of their kids to Ivy

4) Start SAT/ACT Prep in my freshmen year and have a 1600 by the end of my sophomore year

5) Start three non profit organizations that my family could funnel money into, would always look great to put ""raised xxxK in only two years for x in need""

6) Secure an internship at Stanford through an expensive summer camp program

7) Demonstrate interest to universities by making a donation of $50k each

8) Have my family members put my name down in their research papers and ask their friends at Universities to do the same

9) Join an Ivy Consultation organization that would draft my essays and demonstrate interest through their connections

10) Have my three admissions counselors read over my essays, and improve them with their own ideas if needed

11) Take out the regional admissions officer to dinner (they're a family friend)

12) Enroll into my favorite T10.

I hope this can help prospective college applicants, and I really do believe that these steps are necessary to take if you want to have a chance at any high ranked university."

I knew that this slot can support up to 32gb so that I can have maximum of 40gb of memory in this machine, however, as the time I go over 16gb of memory, I will lose the benefit of having dual channel. 

So my question is : does this loss of dual channel have a big impact on doing programming. I am a current CS student so I mostly use it for doing assignment in the college, doing some typical personal project of a CS student to help me get an internship in the future.

mmcwaw,1,2021-04-07,Unpaid internship and notice,Silent_Range6703,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/mmcwaw/unpaid_internship_and_notice/,"I was an intern at a very small start-up where none of the part-time employees are paid since the project is currently doesn't have funding. I'm a graduate student and initially thought this would be a good experience to work part-time to gain some industry experience. In the job posting, they mentioned that it could lead to full-time employment after the duration of the internship (just over 6 months). I had already been working with them for almost 6 months and there is no way this was going that full-time employment was going to happen as they don't have any funds.

I did receive some mentorship and all the people on the team are very nice. However, I felt like we mainly did work to build the product with minimal supervision, I often felt stressed due to pressure that the founder would put on me for funding deadlines. Ultimately, I felt like the project was not going to be successful and my schedule was becoming increasingly busy so I decided to leave the team. The internship has been adding to my stress tremendously over the past few months.

I met with the founder explained why was leaving and that I really didn't have time to work on further projects.  At first, they asked if this was just a busy time and I could continue working once I got less busy. I said no and that I had made the decision to leave, and felt very overwhelmed with school so I couldn't continue to work on the projects. They made me feel absolutely horrible that I was leaving the team with no notice and that I should take responsibility to help them transition until they can find another intern. I know in hindsight I should have given two weeks notice and left in a more professional manner. Now I feel like I wasted the last 6 months working on this project only to have completely burned the bridge with them. Should I be feeling guilty about leaving this internship?"

These are my following choices.

University of Maryland (In-state + Honors) (22k)

University of Michigan (65k)- 65-75k loans if graduating early

Georgia Tech (50k)- 45-50k loans

UIUC (55k)- 55k-60k in loans

My choice thus far is UMD, since it is a very solid school and the cost is very manageable, but I would love to hear other thoughts. I won't use them (comments) to solely make a decision, but I would definitely consider it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to choose UMD, I kind of have a (good?) problem. I would be coming in with 60 credits, which would make me a sophomore by credit, so I could double major in CS and Math, while graduating in three years (1 whole year early). I have heard that graduating early isn't the best, since you lose a year of internship experience, but if I were to do 4, is a 1-year masters really worth it? Within this same question, do I apply to internships (this year) as a Freshman or Sophomore, since it it my first year, but I can graduate a year early.

I took an intro coding class the first semester of my freshman year of college (am currently ending my sophomore year) and I hated it, mostly because the material was so foreign to me -- ended up withdrawing from the class. Despite changing my major to Econ, I took an equivalent course at a community college last summer. Didn't particularly enjoy it but I think that was more of a result of the pandemic than anything. Now, I'm taking the next course in the CS sequence and actually really enjoy it and am doing moderately well, probably right on the median grade. I also found out that I've actually got quite a few of the other classes required for CS out of the way and would still largely be on track for the major (maybe an extra semester or two, which sucks but isn't as big of a deal as if I were paying out-of-state tuition). 

The problem is that before I realized that I actually do really like CS now (like it's my favorite class and I wish I could spend more time coding during the week), I applied and was accepted into a program for UX design at my school. I like the thought of being a UX designer, but I realized that the market is oversaturated and the program itself isn't very difficult i.e. I feel like it wouldn't give me the same marketable/technical skills as CS and it'd be harder to find a job. 

I find myself at fork in the road trying to choose between two things I feel like I'd enjoy but one of them would be tough to find a job (UX) or one that I'm still not totally sure I have the chops for (CS -- and also I might be screwed for finding internships being as old as I am). Has anyone been in the same position, and if so how did they navigate it? Also, has anyone made the jump into CS this late as well?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

8/10 - Cheer coach and English teacher who saw me grow a lot during my time in high school and really liked me. (Submitted to all)

6/10 - Biology teacher who I only asked because I needed a STEM related LOR, no close relationship so I imagine the letter was pretty indifferent. (Submitted to schools that required 2 teacher recs)

7/10 - Neurosurgeon I interned for, seemed excited to write it and told me he made it as strong as possible. His profession is very related to the major I want to pursue so I imagine that helped. (Submitted to schools with a non-teacher recommender option)


**Interviews**

* Harvard (REA): I thought it went really well. Clicked with my interviewer and discussed our opinions on world events. Was very complimentary and optimistic about my chances (lol) ~1hr

* Princeton (RD): Went alright, was also complimentary at the end and told me I was a great fit. ~1hr

* Stanford (RD): I was the most nervous for this one because my interviewer was a known person in my area... Still went ok. ~50mins

* Yale (RD): Hardest but most fun interview. She “poked” my answers a lot, and wasn’t as complimentary as the others, but it felt more like an intellectual conversation than an interview which I think is good for Yale. ~45mins

* UPenn (RD): Probably my best interview, she was young compared to my other interviewers and we got along really well. We joked around comfortably and had a lot in common. ~45mins

**Essays**

CommonApp: 8/10. My CommonApp essay was about my love for writing and how it helped me express myself and grow as a person. I’m pretty confident in my writing since I do it a lot, and got a ton of feedback on this essay.

**Additional comments**

Overall, I'm beyond grateful to have gotten accepted to so many amazing schools, especially given how much of a crapshoot this year has been. As of right now, I am mainly debating between attending Princeton or Pomona. Pomona has been my dream school for a long time, but I'm very reluctant to give up the rare opportunity to attend an ivy. Either way, I know I'll have an amazing experience at either school!

essentially, Berkeley is high risk high reward, while vandy/umd would be the safer options.

i’ve listed some main pros and cons here, i appreciate any insight!

berkeley

pros:

- ranked #1/2 in cs, internationally recognized, most prestige

- bay area: such an amazing location for job opportunities and other aspects (food), and I've always wanted to go to school in cali

- farthest from home, which is something I've always wanted but is also a con

- better weather

- more diverse


cons:

- 0 financial aid (around 300k+travel from east to west coast, but parents are willing to pay for most), but if I'm able to graduate as a cs major, I'll hopefully be able to pay off relatively quick (a little risky)

- i'm not eecs, so i wouldn't be guaranteed the cs major (need a 3.3 gpa in the intro classes which I've heard is pretty hard to do)

- not even sure if i want to major in cs, BUT berkeley's other majors are all super good too (and with majors like data science i’d be able to still get similar opportunities as cs major)

- i’ve heard how difficult cs classes are, not sure if i’ll be able to handle the rigor and worried for my mental health lol

- huge public school, easy to get lost in the crowd, have to be super independent, which could be a good thing


vanderbilt

pros:

- super generous financial aid, would cost the same as an in-state school

- probably much happier and less stressful vibe in general (#1 student life)

- closer to home (still ~10 hour drive, but less scary than across the country)

- good name in general, high ranking nationally

- Nashville is safer (?) than the city of berkeley

- guaranteed housing all 4 years


cons:

- cs can't compare to Berkeley cs (but again, I'm not 100% sure i want to do cs, I'm considering business-related majors), not in top 50 cs programs

- not as many opportunities in Nashville compared to bay area

- not as much international recognition and prestige, especially in tech and cs

- greek life is super prevalent, not sure if i want to do that

Originally, I turned them down but, at this point, I'm getting kinda desperate.

**Is it worth it to take an unpaid internship this summer due to my lack of success with paid internship companies? Or would it be better to get some sort of paying job on the side (most likely not tech related) and develop my skills through other ways (e.g. side projects, boot camps)?** My main concerns are: a) not having a source of revenue for the summer to pay for tuition, rent, etc. and b) not gaining enough experience for next year's internship recruitment cycle (internships help give that ""structure"" for learning/working on a project even if they're unpaid).

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated!!"

mmh62d,1,2021-04-07,Need some advice on Software Engineering,rrighter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mmh62d/need_some_advice_on_software_engineering/," 

So I currently am 26, I am enrolled in a certification program at a pretty good college in my city. My buddy did his undergrad at the same college and has been with Microsoft as a Software Engineer since finishing.

So this specific certification is a 5 course track (credits can be used towards Masters in CS/SE/Cybersecurity) designed to bring students up to speed that do not have experience in CS/SE. My undergrad is in finance and I became interested in PC's again after building my own and helping another friend build his. I'll spare the sentimental story, but my concern now is trying to find an internship or find some type of avenue to take to gain experience so I can have something on my resume when I enter the job market. And then, that leads me to also question if I should also finish just the certification and enter the job market OR continue on and finish the Masters.

Edit:

So my two questions:

1. Should I finish the masters or try to find a job w/ just the cert?

2. How do I find internships with a full time job that is currently paying for education?

Any advice would be helpful..."

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: White
* Residence: Texas
* School Type: Private, semi-competitive
* Income: Upper
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None

**Intended Major(s)**: Either econ or finance/business

**Academics**

* GPA/Rank (or percentile): 4.1/4.3 UW (A+ is 4.3, A is 4.0, A- is 3.7, etc.)
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: All classes at my school are honors unless otherwise specified, not allowed to take any APs until junior year, and only 3 APs allowed per year. The three I took junior year were AP Comp Gov (5), AP Lang (3 lol), and AP Chemistry (4). WHAP and APUSH aren't offered at my school, so I just did honors us and world history.
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Calc BC, AP Statistics, AP Chinese, a Dual-Enrollment Research class, English 12 (AP Lit not offered rip), Concert Band, Theologies of Good and Evil (we have to take one religious studies class sometime during HS, and even though I'm not religious, it's actually an interesting course about how different religions defined and differentiated between good and evil)

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

* ACT: 34 (34E, 32M, 33R, 35S, 9W)

**Extracurriculars/Activities:**

1. Science Olympiad for four years, engineering captain in junior and senior year
2. First chair trumpet in concert band, did some various solo and ensemble competitions
3. I invest in the stock market in my free time; had 40% gains from the start of 2020 to when I submitted most of my apps in early December which is pretty decent
4. Interned at a local company, most related to accounting (even though I've since decided I'm more interested in finance)
5. Elected Honor Council Rep
6. JV Golf (I'm not amazing at golf or anything but its fun), 4 yrs
7. Independent Mandarin Study. I've been taking Mandarin since 7th grade, but was able to do a school-sponsored language immersion in Taiwan for a few weeks. I also was in the mandarin club, but it wasn't very active.
8. Not rly sure if this counts as an EC but I was able to take an introductory microecon course at Northwestern (over Zoom) with current NU undergrads this past summer. I got an A-, meaning I was at least in the top third of the class. I got credit too so that was pretty cool.

**Awards/Honors (excluding SciOly stuff, nothing too special):**

1. AP Scholar (11)
2. Best World History Student (10)
3. Best Chemistry Student (10)
4. Best Mandarin Student (11)

**Essays:**

* Wrote my common app about my grandfather teaching my cousin and I about metalworking and woodworking. Then went on to talk about specific larger projects I began to take on by myself and with my cousin and how I acknowledged my failures in order to become better at it. Tied this a bit back to high school towards the end.
* Supplements were solid but probably not as good as they should have been. I just don't think they stood out enough when I had to write about my ECs.

**LORs (no idea how to rate /10):**

* Lang teacher junior year, he was a tough teacher but one of my favorites. I don't think it was an amazing letter but still solid. We had a pretty decent relationship
* AP Chem teacher junior year, I performed really well in that class and formed a good relationship with him. Solid letter.
* Mandarin teacher. She's been my Mandarin teacher since sophomore year. I've been one of her best students (won the award in junior year as seen above). She always had great things to say about me so I think it was a very good letter.
* Counselor. My best letter by far. She was my history teacher freshman year and my ap comp gov teacher, so I have a better relationship with her than any other teacher.
* Internship boss/coordinator. Solid letter going into more detail about what I did in the internship and my work ethic etc. Nothing too special.

When schools only let me submit 2 teacher letters, I submitted the AP chem letter and Mandarin letter.

**Interviews:**

* Northwestern: Nothing incredible, a very straightforward interview. He told me he thought I had what it took to get in and be successful at Northwestern. Lasted 50 minutes.
* Cornell: My best interview. Lasted an hour and a half. There were no questions besides ""tell me about yourself"" and ""why Cornell"" but we had a full-fledged conversation about a lot of different topics.
* UT Austin Canfield Business Honors: This felt like a job interview. She was only a senior in BHP, but this wasn't as free-flowing as other interviews. The admissions office came up with the questions and I could tell that my answers definitely would be taken into account to a larger extent than private school interviews when deciding whether I would get in or not. Either way, my interviewer told me I did quite well in the interview. It was a strict 30-minute time limit.
* Emory: My second best interview. Basically the same as Cornell, just a little shorter at around an hour long.
* Harvard: Solid interview. The guy graduated before my parents were born. He told me he could easily see me doing well at Harvard but that admissions is like a roll of the dice. Lasted around 45 minutes.
* UPenn: Same as Northwestern.

**Reflection:**

Yeah, it was a LOT of rejections, but I'm hyped for Rice. The goal of shotgunning was to maximize my chances of slipping into 1 or a few reaches, and I successfully got McCombs, Rice, and Emory. Going into this, I knew I was a good applicant, but I wasn't amazing or anything. Nothing on my application stands out that much, so I knew it would be majority rejections (and potentially no reaches). However, Rice (and Emory and UT) took me! There's a solid argument to pick McCombs over Rice, but Rice is still ranked very highly for econ and they are adding a business major this year. Rice has the perfect atmosphere for me and I just didn't vibe much with UT. Can't wait for the next four years! Go Owls!

Edit: My school does not rank, and 80%ish of UT Austin students are auto admit from the top 6%. This made UT a reach despite being in-state, even more so because I applied to McCombs."

I listed some pros and cons of both. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks. 

UC Berkeley EECS vs. NYU Abu Dhabi

**UCB**

UCB Pros:

* One of the top-rated comp sci programs
* Have some friends going to Berk

BC Cons:

* Slightly expensive
* Heard negative things about the culture
* Seems to be more restrictive academically (ex. can't explore outside of your major as much)
* Large class sizes

**NYU AD**

NYU AD Pros:

* Full scholarship (covers tuition, housing, meals, some flights, etc.); completely free for me to attend
* Paid research started freshmen year
* Extremely small class sizes (literally 10-20 per class)
* Guaranteed study abroad in various countries (majority of cost covered by NYUAD)
* Many resources open to the students
* Students have large academic freedom; interdisciplinary study opportunities and taking classes outside of your major are encouraged.
* I like the country and have some family there
* Extremely diverse (students from over 100 countries I believe)

NYU AD Cons:

* Not as well known worldwide
* Not as prestigious or well known as EECS
* School still very young (founded around 2010)

I like the atmosphere of NYU AD and the fact that exploring outside of your major is encouraged. There are many academic fields that I would love to get a glimpse into besides just EECS and NYU AD allows for this. However, my biggest concern is that the school is still fairly young and not as well known or praised as UCB EECS. I fear that going here would put me at a disadvantage when it comes to getting jobs or internships. I have friends at UCB EECS/CS who have amazing internships because the program is that well known. I do not know how widespread computer science is in Abu Dhabi or the UAE, but probably not as much as in California."

Chemistry: 5/10?? I perform horribly in this class tbh. Not sure what she wrote, but hey it worked so no complaints. Bless up.

Anthropology: 8/10. My best class honestly. Teacher knew me really well and loved me as a student. Got me interested in pursuing the humanities in college.

I also got one from a lifelong friend who works in foreign diplomacy, but I only sent this to Georgetown. Didn't help lol. 

**Interviews**

Georgetown: 6/10. Pretty standard. The interviewer liked me, but it was my first one so it was awkward af lol. Don't think it could've hurt me, but not sure if it helped. 

Cornell: 6/10. More of an info session than an interview. He did like 80% of the talking, and believe me I tried. Again, don't think it hurt me at all, but not sure if it helped me. 

Dartmouth: 7/10. The interviewer was a student and she was really cool. She loved my answers, but our personalities didn't flow too well. Idk this one was pretty average. There's clearly a pattern here lol. 

Stanford: 10/10. Interviewer was awesome and she loved me. Wanted us to keep in touch in the future once this is all done. Glad to have had this interview opportunity regardless of admissions decision. 

**Essays**

Common App: This essay was pretty good, if I do say so myself. Wrote about a pretty cliche topic, though (cultural disconnect, floating identity, blah blah...). Everyone who read it loved it. 

Cornell: One of my best ones. Wrote about combating climate change sustainably in rural areas and how I want to overcome the stigma against rural communities. Secured the bag. 

Hopkins: Pretty average in my opinion. Connected to a few classes and programs they offer, briefed them on my interests, etc. Reread it yesterday and found a glaring typo so idk. 

Georgetown: Disgusting really. Wrote it an hour before it was due. Like a version of the Cornell essay about rural discrimination but a bootleg version. 

Stanford: These ranged from average to garbage. My roomie essay was a parody of All Star. I love Shrek.

Harvard: I knew this app was a lost cause so I did the book list and I had fun with it. It was pretty funny tbh. I hope that they at least got a laugh out of it amidst reading apps. 

Barnard: Poured my heart and soul into these essays. I love this school. Totally not bitter. 

Brown: If upper middle class were an essay. Like they were average but on the upside of average if that makes sense. My interview video thing was a tour of my Minecraft server (Friends, please don't expose me).

Dartmouth: Lower middle class essays. Couldn't think of why I liked the school and wrote that I liked their connection to nature since they're in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. 

URochester: I thought this one was really good. Basic, but yeah. Also wrote the alumni essay but it wasn't that good. 

Tufts: Basic af, no personality, pretty bad. Wrote that I wanted to study abroad in Senegal and that I liked their dining halls. 

Swarthmore: Only applied bc they sent me a fee waiver. Still wrote a pretty good essay about my community, though. Definitely didn't hurt me. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

Stuck between Cornell and Hopkins. If anyone has any input let me know I guess. International Agricultural and Rural Development for Cornell. International Studies for Hopkins. I know Hopkins is way better for foreign policy kinda stuff, but I feel like the decision right now is basically STEM vs. Humanities since Cornell is more of a science route and Hopkins is more political."

**Cornell**

Pros:

* Name of ""ivy league"" (may help for internships, etc.)

I think demographics played a large part of it. I'm in an overly competitive area but go to an underfunded school with few clubs and opportunity, so I did most of my stuff outside.

* How hard is it to get an internship/job?
* How good and accessible are the professors?
* How is the overall quality of the cs program? 

And if I get off of the waitlisting for UCSD, should I even consider it? Even though UCSD is in a great location and has great name recognition, I heard it's pretty difficult to get the classes, internships, and jobs you need. Seems easier at SCU or Northeastern.

Which of these schools would you choose and why?"
mmkh0v,0,2021-04-08,[Rant]: Damaged my own career prospects,delauriasil,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mmkh0v/rant_damaged_my_own_career_prospects/,"Since a young age, I've always had this issue where I could not get my brain to focus. I could not set a project or task for myself unless there was an immediate deadline. I managed to get good grades but I was terribly inefficient at doing so. 

CS was not my original degree. Before this, I was aiming to get into a professional program. During my undergrad, I began taking speed prescribed by my doctor. This was to help stay productive with my grades, extra-academic stuff, etc. It worked well for me in the sense that it helped me stay productive, but this career path did not end-up working out as planned. 

I went into CS as a back-up plan. I enjoy programming and like the adrenaline rush when I solve a problem or a particular test case. At the same time, I felt the need to rush this degree since this is technically a second degree, and I'm already behind most people in my age tier. So I have spent this past ten months cramming in three years of Computer Science courses in order to graduate as quickly as possible. So far, i managed to keep good grades doing this simply through pills. Without the pills, there is no way my brain would have the stamina and energy to basically redo my undergrad this quickly (even if I genuinely do enjoy CS). 

Unfortunately, the fact that I've been rushing this means that I didn't get the time to engage in side projects that a normal student would do. I've been trying to make up for that this semester, but trying to cram my way through my courses on top of job applications at the same time was difficult, and at this point even pills are barely doing much for me. I have become terribly inefficient, and have not managed to secure any internship for this upcoming summer. By next year, I will have completed this degree with the very real possibility that I'll have no internships or industry experience.  

So I'm kind of in a catch-22 here. I'm not really in a position in my life where I can slow down. At the same time, I am rushing through this degree with basically little experience to show. On top of all this, I am wholly dependent on amphetamines now and wouldn't be able to even read an email without them."
mmkw00,25,2021-04-08,Retrospective from a successful CS PhD Applicant,Birdieyy,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/mmkw00/retrospective_from_a_successful_cs_phd_applicant/,"Hi everyone,

I thought it would be a good idea to post a little bit about my experience (what I had challenges with and what I think helped) with the grad admissions process, as it could help those applying in the future.

**Basic Overview**

Just to give a little overview of myself, I'm an undergrad at a mid-tier UC with a \~3.85 GPA, 1ish years of research experience (with one publication), a double major with a social science field, and no summer internships. I finally decided to apply for a Computer Science Graduate School in late June, trying to focus in computer architecture (where I did previous research). In the end, I submitted 8 PhD Applications and 3 Masters Applications.

Here were my results for PhD:

Interview -&gt; Accepted: UCLA (I'm headed here next year!), UCD, UCSC

Interview -&gt; Reject: Cornell, Yale, Harvard

Rejected with no interview: UC Berkeley, UWash

Here were my results for Masters:

Accepted: UCSD

Rejected: Stanford

Still waiting: UCSB

**Before Applying**

I was really nervous about applying for CS PhD programs. I wanted to go to graduate school, but I had severe imposter syndrome after looking at everything on Grad Cafe and here. After coaching from my parents and undergrad research advisor, I decided to apply to 8 PhD programs and 3 Master programs to sort of hedge my bet and hopefully increase my chances of getting into a graduate program.

One big problem I had with my application was my undergraduate coursework. I had taken my Data Structures and Algorithms class as pass/no pass because of the pandemic, and also had taken very few computer science electives. I got into the mindset that these will absolutely destroy my chances of graduate school and that I'm going to get rejected everywhere. Come application time, I never heard of these things as concerns from any professor that I interviewed with (I don't think it helped though).

Once I decided to apply for graduate school, I spent a month of summer somewhat preparing for the GRE. I ended up getting an average score (164Q, 156V). To be honest, I think this was all a waste of time as I only submitted by GRE to Stanford (where it is only required for masters not PhD) and Yale. If I applied again, I would have looked more closely at GRE requirements and only applied to schools where the GRE was optional/not considered. The GRE was just a massive waste of time.

**While Applying**

The statement of purpose was pretty simple for me. I just followed the draft of Introducing my intentions -&gt; Talking about research experience -&gt; Why x school -&gt; Future plans + closing. I think it was helpful to send it to my school's career center to help edit.

For the school part, I would choose two professors and type in two filler sentences about how I liked x paper and this part appeals to me. Because I'm chronically procrastinating, I usually ended up doing this part on the day the application is due. I think these just show that you considered the program and help them decide who to send the app toward. Something I learned is that assistant professors seem to be more active in getting students (and therefore it's more likely that you will be accepted by them).

The important part of the statement of purpose is to try to emphasize your research. I thought my research experience was pretty useless (like no application), but I was able to talk about it pretty well. I learned that professors just skim these statements (One read it for seemingly the first time during my interview) and others just use it to fill out checkboxes.

For the diversity or personal contributions statement, I used it to express my understanding of diversity and privilege. I used most of it to showcase my work in student activism in creating a better campus. My thought is that professors that actually cared about the diversity statement are actually invested in diversity and inclusion so wouldn’t be put off by student activism.

My letters of recommendation probably carried me in the application. I actively attended my profs office hours prior to covid and knew them all very well. So I think they hopefully had a lot of good things to say about me and were very influential. Unfortunately, this is the part of the application that's nearly impossible to know or control.

A huge stressful part for me was the suggestion of sending emails to professors prior to applying. I got huge email anxiety and only sent 2 emails (one of which I was accepted, denied from another school). I found them helpful only in the sense of knowing if the professor was accepting students, but I didn’t do anything about that anyway. I also never replied to the professors' responses because I was scared. I don’t think emailing professors early makes a huge difference.

**Interviewing**

Something that was underemphasized to me was the amount of interviewing that I would end up doing. I think in total I had around 12 interviews with professors and by the end it was quite exhausting. 

I would study for the interview by taking a few hours to read a few of their papers and generating a list of filler questions. Interviews usually involved me first explaining my research work, the professor explaining their work, a few questions, then a brief update on the process at the end. In a few interviews, I got quizzes on my research and computer science concepts, which totally caught me off-guard. The really tricky interviews, that I universally failed at, were with professors that had completely different research subfields, which usually happened on the second round of interviews. For most of the interviews, I was extremely nervous and kinda shaking.

I think the best thing to do in these interviews is just be yourself and don't have overly scripted answers to questions. Most of the professors asked the same few questions on what your experience is, why grad school, what do you want to do after, ect. One of my interviews basically tanked because I gave rambly answers to questions about what I wanted to do.

What surprised me is how little some professors prepare for these interviews and how much control individual faculty had. One professor opened my application in front of me and was reading it for what felt like their first time. Others flat told me that they were the ones that decided whether I get in or not. It's super professor dependant on how these interviews go.

**Summary**

In the end, I succeeded and got into a fully-funded PhD program. CS Graduate Applications (and grad apps in general) are extremely competitive, and I think I was mostly helped out by applying to a less-competitive subfield. I’m honestly still in awe that I got into a graduate program and UCLA at that. My biggest note is to not be overwhelmed by imposter syndrome and just try!"

I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post in, but I need advice on what I can do to advance my interests in becoming a software developer.

I've been programming since I was about nine; It started when I saw a video tutorial on making a simple video game with Pygame and Python. Now at 15, I've also learned C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, C# and have learned how to work with Unity, VEX Robotics, git, and Linux by myself through books and online guides; No one, not even a teacher or mentor, has taught me a single one of those. When I was enrolled in my high school's online python course, I passed the entire thing in two weeks. During the pandemic, I've even started development of a multiplayer, server-authoritative 2D survival game with a friend just to learn how to make one. Currently, I'm  reading the Pragmatic Programmer to make my large projects more maintainable; That's how much I love programming. Don't even get me started with Data Structures.

Thing is, I have no clue what to do at this moment. Do I keep learning and doing personal projects, or do I try to search for internship through connections? Just focus on high school perhaps? I don't know. I haven't read or seen anyone in my position and age, which is why I came here to ask. While I do like learning more stuff about what a computer scientist actually does, I would love to apply it to something in the real-world."

Just wondering because I've been having some thoughts about whether my CS degree was even worth it. Granted, I didn't go to the best school for CS (I went to UGA), but I still see some people from my year who've had jobs since graduating. 

Like is a CS degree enough to land you a job almost anywhere? Because I'd be applying to internships as well and even they wouldn't invite me for an interview sometimes."

Am a junior in computer science currently and I applied to countless internships very early in august 2020 for summer 2021 intern positions. When I was applying, I had quality full stack development projects which involved working with different APIs and so forth. I am also a technical lead at my college’s Software engineering Club. 

The result of all that hardwork though was only 1 interview call from Citrix. I passed their technical interview with flying colors and did reasonably well in the behavioral section and yet got rejected. I applied to so many other companies small, big, medium. I tried to get referrals too from most but I never heard anything back from almost anyone. I must have sent around 500 applications. 

Unity sent me an online test. I did very well and yet I got rejected. I go to one of the top public schools in the United States and yet I feel like a complete loser for landing only one actual interview despite all the work that I have put into my side projects and my officer position. 

By the time Spring semester came along I decided to look for internships on angellist and I have been doing unpaid internship part time along with full time academic work. I am planning on joining a different startup in the summer for an unpaid intern position. 

I just feel really bad that my skills are only worth 0 $. I don’t understand why my resume is so easily rejected. I feel like the F1 VISA is a major reason for it but I don’t know. 

I am planning to do 3 internships paid or unpaid by the time I graduate. I hope these companies atleast consider me then for a full time oppurtunity. 

For anyone who is going through the same, my heart goes to you. Don’t give up keep trying to gain experience somehow or the other. I am sure we will make it one day 🙃. 

Have a nice day/night"

I’m deciding between two schools for a computer science degree. Both are pretty similar program wise, the only main difference is that one has 4 terms of 4 month coop placements, and the other has one term of a 16 month internship placement. Which would would give me an advantage when looking for jobs. For the multiple 4 month placements, it’s good to have exposure to multiple jobs and sectors, however, with only 4 month duration it’s hard to work on bigger projects and build strong relationships. On the other hand, the single 16 month internship allows you to focus on one industry and work on larger/more in depth projects at the company, and also allows you to build a strong relationship with the employers after working for so long. I don’t know which situation is better.

This was the worst year to be an international. So many amazingly talented friends of mine were shocked at their US results, and so many internationals on reddit were too. If you're international, don't lose hope. At the end of the day, college is just a vehicle to get educated. And regardless of where you go, you can take away just as much as anyone else from college, just remember not to let this get to you. Don't let a bad college application season define you. Allow the successes of your college life and beyond to write your story.

This year has been a rollercoaster for everyone, and we should all feel proud that we've made it through to the end, regardless of how things turned out. We've all probably learned a lot from this past year; I know I have. These experiences will undoubtedly stick with me throughout my life. It just goes to show that the C/O 2025 is one of the most resilient, hard-working graduating classes there will ever be."

**Advice and reflections:**

F****** live in high school. My biggest regret is not spending more time with my friends and enjoying my high school years. For the first 2.5 years of high school, I only focused on extracurriculars and had a pitiful social life. I can’t get that time back anymore but it’s hard to make the most of what I have now with the Covid situation. Also, ivies and T20s are a straight crapshoot. I thought I had a solid chance at MIT (given my Olympiad background) and Stanford (given the amount of time I’ve spent working with their faculty), but I guess it didn’t really help. I’m happy with Berkeley, but definitely was gunning for more."

I have done some research on both schools' (UIC and Boston University) CS program. However, I feel as the student body will offer a more genuine input on the program.

For context, at UIC I would pay $14k with no room and board while at Boston University I would pay $17k room and board included. Despite my grandparents living 18 minutes from the university, my parents are against me living away so far. They are against the $12k extra cost (in 4 years) and believe the two universities are the same.

I was just looking for some genuine responses from some Boston University CS students. How is the curriculum (theoretical, practical)? How are the internships? How are the student body and professors? Any notable CS clubs (some on the website may appear more lively than it actually is)? If you're near graduating, are the job search/fairs easy to find here (better if you're in cybersecurity too)? Is the accelerated BA/MS CS program worth it (cost, opportunities)?

I was really excited for the posting since I think cyber security is kinda cool (hacking 🙌) however now I discovered it is more of a business type internship. I don’t think ill even be coding based on my interviews.

Long story short I got my first internship offer. Based on the money and the job itself it sounds like a good experience . However, this semester I did a lot of side projects (hackathons, Google SPS, side projects) and I really like coding.

2022 will be the summer after junior year and I was wondering if its a good idea to accept this offer over trying to secure a 2022 SWE internship. I plan to become a full time SWE after college so I am just worried this will hinder my chances.

Edit: I have two weeks to accept the offer"

I currently have 1 offer in hand and working as an intern at a company for the time being as a software developer intern. 

Now me along with a friend of mine joined this internship but at the start of this month he left the Internship for a better offer than the one the company is offering. 

He said that two more people have left the internship. 
Today I got a message from the hr telling me that I have good feedback from the software engineers in the company regarding my performance during the internship and want to extend me an offer asap 
Also asking me for my interests and any other offers that I have. 

Now the company said that the interns who don't perform well will be informed within 3 months of internship 

I have being offered here full time within 2 months of the internship 

Now the job offer that I have pays lower than the one at the internship that the told me at the beginning. 

They want me to inform whether I am interested or not by tomorrow. 
My question is how should I tackle this offer to get better pay after the internship?

I’ve received a summer 2022 internship offer for Deloitte (audit) in Nashville and an offer from KPMG (audit) in Charlotte NC. I’m still waiting to hear back from EY for audit in Nashville.

At first I was set on EY just because I met a lot more people while recruiting than I did with Deloitte or KPMG. But now I’m meeting with more people from Deloitte and KPMG and they are all nice as well. Of course I understand that they will probably be gone by the time I start full time. 

I put Nashville as my 1st preference and Charlotte as my 2nd but now I really really want to intern in Charlotte instead of Nashville. 

I’m a bit hesitant to pick KPMG since it’s the smallest and it gets made fun of the most. If my Deloitte offer was in Charlotte I would most likely pick them. (Would it be crazy if I messaged the recruiter and asked if I can be in Charlotte?) Then I’m hesitant to pick EY because I’ve heard their technology is not the best and unlimited PTO. 

Please if you have any advice it would be amazing!"
mmwiiv,7,2021-04-08,A (Short-ish) Intro to Finding ECs,thebreadcangetitself,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mmwiiv/a_shortish_intro_to_finding_ecs/,"First, a disclaimer: I'm not by any means an expert or AO or admissions consultant or what have you. I'm just a senior who feels kinda weird about app season being over. But I've been thinking about what I wish I knew getting into this process, and I have a few ideas to pass on. 

1. Finding the EC

There’s a few different ways to find an activity--ideally, one you’re doing out of personal enjoyment (but I get it, it’s a college sub, blah blah). The most rewarding ECs I’ve done--for example, a niche sport I got into freshman year--was something I had wanted to do for years, but just never had the courage or initiative to try out. If that sounds familiar, and you have the time/money/energy to take the leap, PLEASE check your quirky activity out. Not just for college apps--pursuing something you find interesting, just because you find it interesting, will give you the confidence and self-motivation to continue to explore your interests. 

There’s also the ‘scrounging the internet’ method, which I personally used to varying levels of success. I’d suggest checking out volunteermatch.org and idealist.org to get started--you can sort by location, issue area, paid/unpaid, etc. I’ve found very cool opportunities that have really strengthened my app (and, perhaps more importantly, defined my career interests). Obviously, you should be careful--if any posting sounds interesting but seems too good to be true/sets off alarm bells, think twice and run it past a trusted adult. 

On that note, there’s a lot of info online about cold emailing professors for research if you’re STEM/law firms for pre-law/med practices for pre-meds. I don’t have a lot of experience there, so I won’t say much on it, but as long as you’re respectful and (I’m sorry to say it) understand you’ll likely get ghosted, there’s no harm at all. If you’re unsure where to start, there’s plenty of templates online that will give you a good framework. 

Finally, there’s no harm in networking. If you know a classmate, friend, upperclassman or even college student interested in the same issue areas you are, or even if they may know someone who is, take the chance and reach out. I really, really wish I’d begun doing this earlier--people love to talk about their own experiences, and they love to connect others with fun opportunities, especially if you have common ground (same high school, club, activity, cultural community, etc.)

2. Applying

So you’ve found your dream EC. If it’s an internship or anything of that sort, you’ll most likely have to apply, usually with a resume and cover letter. 

It always pays to have an updated resume on hand.  If you’re unsure what a resume should look like, look around online or ask an older friend/sibling/parent. Generally, it’s one page, in an appropriate font, with short and straightforward descriptions of your activities and responsibilities. 

It’s okay if your resume looks a little sparse at first--maybe a few clubs here and there, or tutoring/volunteering. When I first created my resume, all I had was Model UN, CSF (Cali kid here haha), and a volunteering club or two. I was still able to get some cool social justice volunteering positions, simply because I expressed my interest in and passion for the cause. That’s what a lot of the volunteer coordinators/professors/people who receive your resume are looking for--so make sure to show it, usually in your cover letter.  

The cover letter kinda tripped me up at first, but finding a template really helped. Here’s the info and samples I used to get started: [https://icc.ucdavis.edu/materials/cover-letters](https://icc.ucdavis.edu/materials/cover-letters). Remember to pick the activities you talk about with a specific purpose in mind--you’re building a case for yourself as the ideal candidate, the researcher/writer they just have to get. 

On that note, please don’t psych yourself out when applying to any sort of opportunity. I nearly chickened out from applying to a cool writing internship when I realized I’d be competing against undergrads, but, weirdly enough, my application made it to the final cut. While I ended up losing the internship to a Cornell student, the program coordinator reached out to me a few weeks later about another program and asked if I’d be interested. My point is this: it’s always worth it to get yourself out there. If you’re passionate about the position, there’s really no harm in applying, and you might find yourself surprised. 

(One note: Remember that the more responsibility you have, the more people are counting on you--especially if you’re working in an academic or volunteering setting. Be realistic about your deadlines and communicate with your coordinator/supervisor if something comes up. Honestly, people are so much nicer about personal circumstances than my middle school teachers told me they’d be LOL. )

Also, something interesting--your ECs often have a sort of snowball effect. Once you pick up a cool activity that you like, you’ll often be able to take that experience and its transferable skills and use it as a unique background to bring to the next cool EC, and on and on. It’s okay if maybe you’re not exactly a IMO/ISEF/Olympic gold medalist. I sure as heck wasn’t. But just start small, and think about your story--the cumulative skills your activities have given you, your talents and interests. For me, I really like political writing and advocacy, so I was able to tailor my resume, my activities, and eventually my college apps to that theme. You don’t have to go that far, and you absolutely don’t have to pigeonhole yourself into one career field or one niche, but think about your application’s arc, and which opportunities best suit you. 

That’s pretty much all I can think of for now. If you take some chances, put time into your cover letter/resume, and add in a bit of luck, I think you could score some really cool ECs! But remember that no matter how amazing they are, ECs are not a ticket (by themselves) to the T20s. And maybe even after all this work, you might get rejected from your dream school. That’s what ended up happening to me--but honestly, it mattered a lot less than I thought, because the same day I got rejected, I got a really cool writing job that I was able to advocate for because of my varied experiences, experiences that ended up shaping my high school experience in a very real way. Even if Harvard doesn’t quite see eye to eye with you on how you’d contribute to student life, your ECs will be there to cheer you on.

In the end, yes, this is a college sub. But ECs are also a way to explore your interests, challenge yourself to apply to competitive opportunities, and get comfortable prepping important documents. Looking for internships/volunteering gigs was actually a weirdly fun experience. I hope y’all enjoy it too. :) 

Thanks A2C for all the advice and laughs for three (!!) years. And good luck! "

But after spending a huge chunk of my day doing school related CS assignments, I want to do everything BUT code.  If I had a few months off, I feel that I could start work on some interesting independent projects, but during the school year I find it impossible to start.  

 I love CS and the field but I feel like it already takes up such a huge chunk of my life that in my free time I want to be as far away from a screen as possible.

Any thoughts to help me make a balanced decision would be appreciated.

Thoughts:
- All are great schools overall. Some of my friends argue UChicago and Northwestern are better than Cornell Tech, but I think they’re all similar in reputation. Curious about career resources and quality of education, but the latter is difficult to measure.
- Cornell Tech (from what I heard) has a stronger CS program. 1 year program, scholarship provided. Intense program of 4 CS courses and a studio course per semester. 
- Northwestern has an engineering school but CS is not its main strength. 2 year program, more time to take classes and get an internship. 
- UChicago is expanding its CS department. 1.25  year program, more time to get an internship."
mmwvti,4,2021-04-08,USC MSBA or take a year out?,Fancy-Stress-806,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/mmwvti/usc_msba_or_take_a_year_out/,"Hi guys. Long story short, I applied to 8 different schools for an MS in Data Science/Business Analytics and the decisions are given below

Rejections:

* MIT Sloan (MBAn), Harvard, UPenn, Stanford

Waitlisted:

* UChicago (MSc Analytics Full Time)

Accepted:

* USC Marshall (MSBA)

Haven't heard back:

* Columbia (MS Data Science)
* UCLA Anderson (MSBA)

At this point, I'm assuming the worst case scenario and so my prospects aren't great (USC was my last choice and didn't really want to go there in the first place). So, I am trying to plan around these circumstances. I'm looking for the school with the best career development resources (e.g. Analytics Capstone project + mandatory Internship + company matching) and I felt that MIT was the best in this regard where they basically link/match you with companies for internships and the capstone project and so everyone has something (no one leaves with nothing), which I heard from a friend who's currently on the programme. 

I wasn't able to find much on the USC Marshall MSBA page other than the video so I'm not sure if I should go with USC because I don't know much about it. So I've come up with 2 different outcomes:

1. Take a year out and work as an intern for 9-10 months as a Data Analyst/Scientist/etc. Improve application, get recommendations, improve on my GRE scores (152V 165Q 5.0AWA - pretty atrocious for the schools I'm applying to lmao but I went with it because I have a 3.9 GPA from a global top 10 STEM university), etc. Then when the Fall 2022 applications open, reapply.
2. Go with USC. I was hoping if some of you guys could provide some insights/opinions on the career development resources at USC Marshall and what they do for students (specific examples etc.).

What should I do? I'm pretty bummed out from all these rejections and didn't see myself being in this position initially (was really naive when I applied, I know that now) and was expecting to at least get UChicago or UCLA Anderson (I quite like their programme because it's ranked 2nd to MIT's and mandate a capstone project and internship but they haven't replied with an interview or anything since I applied 2 months ago so I'm assuming a rejection). Any advice would be great. Thanks in advance guys :D"

My major would be **electrical &amp; computer engineering**. Of course, I'm so grateful to have this problem in the first place, but I need some help deciding.

For some context, **Calhoun Discovery Program (CDP) is a program at Virginia Tech that gives me a scholarship** and access to industry projects (CAT, Boeing, GE) for all four years of college. I also get a 2.5k stipend every year for ""experimental learning"" (Study abroad, research, etc.). **My parents will not help me pay for college, but they will support me and help pay off the interest.** Here's my pros and cons list for both schools. I'll put two comments, one for VT and one for CMU, and you can upvote the school you would pick if you were me.

I removed personal factors, asssume that I love both colleges equally.

**Virginia Tech.**

*PROS:*

\- very good price (I'll take out \~20k in loans after four years).

*CONS:*

\- lower average salary in my major (\~70k for EE, \~75k for CPE).

\- less companies I like recruit from VT

\- less prestige, less prestige in my major (#15-20 for EE and CE, Doesn't matter too too much because I'm in engineering and not law or something).

**Carnegie Mellon.**

*PROS:*

\- thicc average salary for my major (\~105k. although most students go to software &amp; computer hardware which are more lucrative so the numbers are swayed).

\-higher job and internship placement (more for software engineering type roles). 

\- companies like AMD, NVIDIA, Apple, etc. recruit at CMU that don't in VT. If I go into computers this is amazing, but if I go into something more traditionally electrical engineering like Radio Frequency or PCB design then there isn't much of a salary benefit to CMU compared to VT.

\-More prestige in my major (#1 CPE, #6 EE)

*CONS:*

\- expensive. (I will take out \~100k in loans after four years)

I'm having an extremely tough time deciding between these two amazing options. I'd like to hear some input : )."

**Letters of Recommendation**

* probably ***5-6/10***, I did well in their classes but I wasn't super close to any of them
* got one from my internship mentor, I'd say it was around ***6-7/10***

**Interviews**

* Interviews are probably my weakest point, but I didn't think they mattered too much in the end (even tho I got rejected from all the schools I interviewed with LOL)
   * if you have the chance to definitely take the opportunity! I learned a lot about the schools and it was good practice :)
* Interviews + how I felt about them: MIT (good), Rice (okay), Princeton (good), Yale (okay), Harvey Mudd (okay), and UPenn (kinda bad)

**Essays**

* Personal Statement: I submitted two different essays for EA and RD schools
   * EA schools (USC merit deadline, UMich, NEU, state school): This one was 3 of my MIT supplements stitched together because I procrastinated the weekend of and didn't really have time to write anything else, so it was pretty rushed, it was a solid ***4/10***
   * RD schools: During winter break at 1am I got sudden inspiration and wrote it in around 2 hours, and it went through 2-3 rounds of editing, so total time spent on this one was around 8 hours? It was a pretty genuine essay about quitting an EC. I'd rate it a ***7/10*** maybe
* Supps: Wrote most of them all over winter break, supps mostly talked about my interdisciplinary interests, tie-dye, and internship experience, early supps were probably ***3-4/10***, RD were ***4-6/10***

**Decisions (All CS unless specified)**

*Acceptances:*

* State safety w/ honors
* CMU SCS (RD) - Comp Bio
* USC (RD)
* Brown (RD) - Comp Bio

*Waitlists:*

* Northeastern (EA, deferred)
* UMich Engineering (EA, deferred)
* UIUC (EA)
* Cornell Engineering (RD)

*Rejections:*

* MIT (EA, deferred early)
* Harvey Mudd (RD)
* UCLA (RD)
* Berkeley EECS (RD)
* Rice (RD)
* Princeton (RD)
* Yale (RD)
* UPenn (RD)
* Stanford (RD) - Comp Bio

**Reflections**

After receiving my early results, which were all deferrals that turned into waitlists and rejections (NEU, UMich, UIUC, MIT) and then rejections from Harvey Mudd, UCLA, and Berkeley, I literally told my friends that I shouldn't have applied CS and probably something else, but I somehow managed to scrape out a few acceptances!!!

I was super motivated early on and finished my college list at the end of junior year, but over the summer, probably due to a mix of quarantine and work, I didn't touch college apps again until a few weeks before early apps were due. Probably should've started earlier. For RD apps, I did most of them over winter break, and honestly it wasn't too bad because I was able to recycle a lot of my essays (I turned in most of my apps 30 minutes before they were due which was pretty stressful). Also, I feel like compared to other CS applicants I didn't have as many CS ECs (one internship and coding projects for fun outside of school) which probably hurt my app. I definitely set my expectations too high with some results (I thought I'd get into Northeastern and UMich), and didn't think I'd get into any Ivies or CMU, which just goes to show how random college admissions are (ESPECIALLY WITH CS), but I'm really happy with how it turned out! As for where I'm going, I'm deciding between CMU and Brown, and it'll be a tough decision.

Advice (take with a grain of salt): if you aren't completely set on CS/have the option to apply something else/don't really have CS ECs, it's probably better to not apply CS because it was a massacre this year (I know so many talented people and people way more skilled than me who didn't get in). Either way prestige doesn't really matter in CS anyway, so I wouldn't worry too much anyways. Also, if you want more info/have questions about my app just PM!"
mmzbgq,1692,2021-04-08,I just got offered a data science internship with Amazon. I've been lurking on the sub for 3 years and just wanted to thank the folks who put together stats/ml cheat sheets.,BluntButter,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mmzbgq/i_just_got_offered_a_data_science_internship_with/,"This sub really motivated me to take my undergraduate degree in biomathematics/statistics and turn it into a masters in data science. I use to think I wouldn't have the programing background or that I wouldn't have the technical skills people wanted. It took a lot of my moving past my imposter syndrome as a woman in stem and working on my skill set but I've gotten this far. Thank you all so much.

Edit: Just came back to this post and saw all the support. For any one interested i have been applying since September to internships and have since then applied to 83 positions, reworked my resume twice, ended up making my own website for my projects just to look better on paper, and got 5 interviews at the end of March. I have gotten offers so far from every place I interviewed at and used the smaller offers to ask Amazon to give me a decision earlier, which ended up working. I only did 2 interviews with Amazon before I got my team and offer, which from reading online isn't common as they usually have a 3rd or 4th interview for interns. Its been a long process and a battle at every stage. Just 2 weeks ago I was resigned to the idea of a summer with no internship, but here we are now."
mmzhf6,2,2021-04-08,UMD vs GA Tech vs Cornell for CS,NovelTechnology03,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mmzhf6/umd_vs_ga_tech_vs_cornell_for_cs/,"I’m a high school senior and am currently deciding what college I should attend. I’m fortunate to have been accepted into some pretty decent schools for CS. I like Computer Vision and Deep Learning and want to ultimately get a job at Tesla on their Autopilot self-driving system or work on something that allows me to interface Computer Vision/Deep Learning with the general public.

At UMD, I was able to get a full scholarship so the net cost is $0. I also got into their honors college and the cybersecurity living-learning community. Out of the three, their program seems to be the best for AI/Computer Vision, and I think it would be cool to have the opportunity to get internships at organizations like the NSA and defense contractors. On their Career Fair website, I also see that Google, Facebook, and Amazon regularly come to UMD, but looking through LinkedIn, it doesn't look like that many UMD students get internships/jobs at big tech. I'm not exactly sure if a lot of UMD students don't want to work at big tech or if they don't get the offer in the first place.

Georgia Tech would be $50k/yr. My parents agreed to pay half, so it would be about $25k/yr for each of us.  I like that GA Tech is strong for everything in Engineering; whereas, UMD is only that good for CS. I'm also not really into partying that much, so I think it would be easier to connect with more of the people at GA Tech than the general population of UMD. I also like the city life of Atlanta, but UMD isn't that bad since it's close to DC; whereas, Cornell is very secluded. Atlanta is also a plane ride for me, so I could only see my family every few months, but I could see them every few weeks at UMD since it's about 3 hours by car.

Cornell would be $80k/yr, so my contribution would be $40k/yr. Cornell is probably as good as GA Tech in CS curriculum-wise (but not as good as UMD curriculum) and it has the Ivy league connections which might be better than GA Tech. I think I would be able to get a more holistic education at Cornell since everyone at Cornell across all majors is pretty good; whereas, GA Tech is more engineering-focused and UMD is only CS. I don't think I would particularly enjoy living at Cornell due to its seclusion though.

My question is will I miss any opportunities by going to UMD over GA Tech or Cornell. It looks like many Computer Vision/Deep Learning jobs prefer Masters/PhD holders, so I guess I would have to do grad school at all 3. From my AP credits, I should be able to graduate a year early at UMD, and I could go to grad school a year early, do a fall and spring internship, or get a full-time job at a decent tech company and then think about going for masters. I still have some personal reservations about attending UMD since I worked hard in high school and thought I had a good shot in attending the Big 4 and UMD doesn't have too much prestige to the layperson. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to give up a full ride at UMD to pay thousands of dollars at GA Tech and even more at Cornell.

Any advice would be helpful. Thank you in advance!"
mmzwyj,0,2021-04-08,"I made a massive, life-altering mistake two years ago, and I cannot stop looking backwards",Nvjds,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mmzwyj/i_made_a_massive_lifealtering_mistake_two_years/,"So to start, I was enrolled at the University of Delaware in 2017-2019. I left the school in the MIDDLE OF A SEMESTER (right after spring break fourth semester), in April 2019. Looking back on that decision, I don't understand what I was thinking. I had tons of good friends there, I knew the campus well, I had lots of professors and advisors who deeply cared about my well being, and most importantly, I was a member of a prestigious, newer program known as the World Scholars program. I was majoring in Geography, which has undoubtedly been my passion since I was in diapers. I used to be a very inquisitive kid, starry eyed and bubbly.

Fast forward to today, and since dropping out of Delaware (which by the way, not completing that semester completely drained my college fund), I have taken some classes at a local university called Cleveland State University. I've been back in my hometown of Cleveland for two years now, and I've just become a completely washed up loser. I’m in the worst physical shape of my life, I have lived either with my parents or in one of two apartments, and I have virtually no money in the bank. It is now 2021, and nearly everyone from my High School class of 2017 is graduating college in a couple of months, leaving me in the dust. I don’t even talk to most of my friends from senior year anymore. Nonetheless, I’m finally realizing that all my parents EVER wanted for me was to get an education and be a successful adult, but I’m none of those things. I’m not independent minded, I’m not motivated, and I’ve also been in and out of the hospital for mental health reasons three times in the last five months. I don’t have any marketable work experience other than restaurant jobs, one of which I lost during Covid.

I’m not trying to just be a whiny faggot here, but if I had just stayed at that school, I would be graduating from a program started by the current president of the United States. Thats right, Joe Biden started that program. I remember Trump, plus smoking too much weed, plus some very toxic romantic relationships, plus the general struggle of self-care being things that seriously impeded my \~educational\~ experience at the school, but looking back, I had a really nice life there, and I’ll never be able to get that back. I thought at the time 'I’ll show them, I’ll be successful and travel WITHOUT college!' but all thats happened for me in two years is the loss of friends (both from Delaware and even friends in my hometown), loss of jobs, and a lack of personal growth. Everyone I know who stayed in school (by the way, I don’t know anybody who left college in the middle of their sophomore year) is now a person with marketable, relevant skills, who also got to live out the college experience, spring break trips, trying new clubs and activities, LEARNING new things in class, the like. I seriously left college right before it might've started getting challenging. I just feel extraordinarily left out. My little brothers are now a freshman in college and a senior in high school who's committed to OSU, and I know for sure they aren't going to end up in the situation I've found myself in. Social media doesn’t help. Even my friends from high school who are younger than I am are off to college, leaving only a small handful of friends in Cleveland, most of which are college students themselves.

Essentially, when I left college at age 19, I don’t really know what was going through my head. I had no plan, no skills, and no reason to leave school. Bill Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out because they had businesses to run (for example). All leaving school did was socially isolate me, and turn me into basically a dependent on my parents, who, by the way, met in grad school. My brain is unraveling, I don't remember how to write formal emails, I get frustrated extremely easily, and I have a headache 24/7 because its not just FOMO, its GENUINE missing out. I was upset in 2019 because I felt like things at the school just weren’t going MY way. I felt like UD didn’t deserve to have ME there. I basically said 'fuck you college' and went home just so I could be around my family and hometown, but now I’m realizing I’ve essentially trapped myself here.

Meanwhile, I see and hear about friends in college who get internships abroad, who study abroad a whole semester, who are working in fields they're fascinated by, and I’m doing none of those things. If I just stayed in school, those things would most likely be happening to me as well, but I didn't. I'm still not even a junior by credit hours, and I’m nearly 22 years old. I’ve become completely envious of anybody who is currently in college, or about to begin their college career. I seriously don’t know what to do, or how to not give up. Its very lonely and depressing having gone AWOL on so many people that loved and cared about me at my school. Leaving in the middle of your fourth semester really leaves a gaping hole in your mind, one that is extremely difficult to get closure with.

\*\*TLDR\*\* This time four years ago, I was a bright eyed young man who wanted nothing more than to travel and learn about the world around him. I had the perfect school and the perfect program, one which allowed me to visit 13 countries, and I shat all over the program and school simply because things didn’t go precisely my way while I was there. In the two years since leaving I have only come to realize more and more that what I did was irreversible, and moving forward is very difficult when you grew up in a town where 65% of people hold bachelors degrees. All of my friends from high school are about to graduate from their schools and move all over the world, and I’m practically living with my parents. Joe Biden is president now which is just a constant reminder of what I gave up on. It's very upsetting. I really am struggling to move on and stay optimistic when I’ve already done so much wrong.

Does anyone know of anyone in a similar situation? I seriously feel like I’m in a league of my own when it comes to stupidity and short-sightedness. It's very hard to escape. Especially considering that Covid only made school that much easier for everybody too. Yeesh."

1. Honorable mention for some journal
2. National Merit Finalist
3. AP Scholar with Distinction

**Letters of Recommendation**

History teacher: I was his student for three years, and he was the one who originally sparked my interest in history. He wrote a lot of my recommendations in the past.

English teacher: I had her for AP English Lang, and she seemed to like me.

Counselor: I didn't speak much with her throughout high school since there were a lot of kids in my class.

Sister: For the Dartmouth peer letter.

History professor: This is the second year I'm interning for her. She seemed to like me since the other interns fizzled out after a few weeks. I sent this letter to my RD applications only.

**Interviews**

Duke: I thought this interview went the most well. He lived in my area, and was also Korean. I was able to connect with him quite deeply and explain to him my interest in history.

Dartmouth: Pretty standard. I don't remember anything particular from this interview.

Harvard: Also fairly standard, though I got the feeling that the interviewer didn't really connect with me and my passion for history.

Yale: I thought this one went pretty well, though it got cut short because my interviewer had a meeting scheduled 30 minutes after we started.

Stanford: This was my first interview in the early round. Like the others, I don't really think it was particularly good or bad.

Princeton: I had this interview with a professor from the local state school that I had interned at. Though she taught a different discipline, I was able to tell her about my experiences with working with the faculty there.

UPenn: Decent. The interviewer was a judge, so I was able to ask him specific questions about the law track and whatnot.

Columbia: I thought it might have been disastrous since I accidentally forgot to confirm the time until the day of. The interviewer seemed to be understanding though, and it went pretty well.

**Essays**

I won't assign quantitative ratings to my essays, though since I don't have a particular ""spike"" or hook, I'm guessing these tipped me over the edge at most schools.

Common App: I wrote about the Korean American experience and how it has caused a cultural separation in my identity. A lot of it was just a collection of thoughts I had being a second-generation Korean American. I also tied in my interest in history, but the main focus of the essay was about identity, and as such, I chose the first Common App prompt. This essay went through several revisions, and I'm happy with how it turned out in the end.

Supplements: The supplement that I adapted for most schools was about the study of history, and more specifically, the humanistic ways in which it can be studied. This essay (structure) went into almost every school I applied to, save for the ones that didn't have a prompt related to my academic interests.  I spent the most time revising and editing this one aside from my Common App. Other supplements that I used for many schools was a ""community"" topic about my experiences and relationship with music, as well as a loose template for the ""why"" prompt.

There seems to be a lot of talk on A2C about the importance of essays and whatnot. From what I've gathered from my own experience and others' is that if your stats are competitive (grades, test scores) and your ECs are decent and relevant, your essays can be the selling point of your application. I see it as the only real opportunity to communicate your personality and passions. Then again, I'm just an arrogant high school senior who has no experience in admissions and I don't really know anything. I'm only speculating.

I did not hire a college consultant simply due to the outrageous costs. Instead, I asked family and friends for help on edits and revisions.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

In alphabetical order:

*Acceptances:*

* Brown University RD (I received absolutely horrible aid. Worst among all of my decisions.)
* Cal Poly SLO (I don't think I got a dime in aid. My first RD decision, and it filtered into my junk mail 😬)

* Dartmouth University RD (Fairly average aid)
* Duke University RD (Likely letter for Focus Program, awaiting aid)
* Johns Hopkins University RD (Hodson Trust Scholarship - 40K a year. Great financial aid on top of that)
* Princeton University RD (Bless you Princeton and your incredible financial aid awards. Like seriously holy shit thank you so much)
* Rice University RD (Received pretty crap aid)
* **Stanford University RD (Deferred REA and accepted RD, awaiting aid but expecting to commit!)**
* UC Berkeley (Decent aid - about 10K - at all UCs)
* UCLA
* UCSD
* UCSB
* UCI (Regents + Honors)
* University of Notre Dame RD (Mediocre aid)

* Vanderbilt University RD

*Rejections:*

* Amherst College RD
* Harvard University RD
* Pomona College RD

* Yale-NUS College RD

About my college list:

Obviously, I was incredibly fortunate with my acceptances and I am very thankful that I have been given all these great offers. However, I do not necessarily recommend this practice of shotgunning to 20+ schools. I think it may be more beneficial to spend more time and produce quality applications for a lower number of schools that you are truly passionate about. That being said, I too only applied to schools that I would be actually be interested in attending (basically, I didn't apply to any schools that I would rather CC+transfer over).

Also, you probably noticed that my college list looks like I went on USNews and picked all T20. There may be some merit to that, but really, I only applied to schools that are need blind and would give good (or at least decent) aid. It just so happens that most of the T20 and T30 institutions meet my criteria (notable exceptions including NYU, WashU, Northeastern, and to my knowledge, CMU). This is why I get somewhat annoyed when seeing posts about how T20 and ""prestige"" don't matter. I can totally understand why they'd think the latter, but the fact is that these ""prestigious"" and wealthy institutions are the ones that many families can reasonably afford once financial aid is accounted for. This is the same reason I didn't apply to any OOS publics. 

One thing I would definitely account for if I had to do this whole process again is applying to more safeties. I fortunately lucked out this time around, but I arrogantly assumed that UCI and Cal Poly SLO would be safeties for sure. Do not be like me. Do not assume that.

**Additional Information:**

Coming from a very STEM-heavy high school, I was one of few among my friends that applied as a major in the humanities. I hope that this will be helpful for a junior looking to do the same, and if you have any non-intrusive questions, please do not hesitate to ask. If you recognize me, don't bother with DMs - just ridicule me in person 😘"

mn0ho8,1,2021-04-08,Advice on relocation?,Splendid_Shinobi,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mn0ho8/advice_on_relocation/,"I am a 21 yo upcoming college graduate (engineering) who is choosing between two job offers. One is a continuation of an internship and is in my current city, in a field I really care about, and has an extremely enjoyable/helpful work environment. Another offer I just received is much more geared towards lower-level technical design on cutting-edge tech, which would be a lot more exciting and challenging for me. It also has a 25% better salary, but would require me to relocate. My main concern with this is that I am very close to my two roomates. I haven’t had a home environment where I feel as happy and comfortable as I do now, I’m living with two of my best friends and we have a lot of fun together. I really makes me sad to imagine having to put an end to this era, but I also want to make the better move for me career-wise, which would be the new offer. I also realize a spouse, kids, ect... will limit moves like this in the future, so I don’t want to miss out on a good opportunity when I’m young and it is feasible but I am a little wary of leaving this great dynamic to go to a new city alone. Has anyone made similar moves or have any advice? I realize it’s really up to what I think is best, but I’d hate to make a decision that I regret in a few years. So what do you think, is a challenging and better paying job worth leaving two friends I’ve grown really close to? Thanks"
mn0yjb,1,2021-04-08,Help choosing internship,alphamale8422,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/mn0yjb/help_choosing_internship/,"I'm currently a junior at a qs 90-100 ranked school majoring in Business Analytics. I currently have a 2.4 GPA due to two fucked up semesters where I got less than 0.8 GPA. . 

I recently got an internship in January at a 25-30 employees company working as a Marketing Analyst (on paper but I basically do email marketing). I performed extremely well, and my employer offered an extension for my internship with a nice pay rise with a potential job offer in the future (This literally happened yesterday). For reference, please keep in mind that I'm an international student so I can only work for one year in the US after graduating. And getting basically a confirmed offer at this stage (and the economic conditions rn) is pretty set. 

And yesterday right after my boss offered me an extension to which I said yes, I had another company offer me a summer internship as Business Intelligence and Operations intern. This company is slightly better than my previous company as the core functions of the business is Data Management so it is something that is directly related to my major while my current company is basically a Sales and Marketing company. 

The dilemma I'm currently in is that I'm having trouble choosing one over the other. If I stay at my current company, I'm 90% guaranteed a job after graduating unless I mess something up real bad.

I'm currently a junior at a qs 90-100 ranked school majoring in Business Analytics. I currently have a 2.4 GPA due to two fucked up semesters where I got less than 0.8 GPA. . 

-Posting here because I wish to enter the data science field even though I'm in Business school majoring in Business Analytics.  My coursework has a mix of CS and Business classes. 

I recently got an internship in January at a 25-30 employees company working as a Marketing Analyst (on paper but I basically do email marketing). I performed extremely well, and my employer offered an extension for my internship with a nice pay rise with a potential job offer in the future (This literally happened yesterday). For reference, please keep in mind that I'm an international student so I can only work for one year in the US after graduating. And getting basically a confirmed offer at this stage (and the economic conditions rn) is pretty set. 

And yesterday right after my boss offered me an extension to which I said yes, I had another company offer me a summer internship as Business Intelligence and Operations intern. This company is slightly better than my previous company as the core functions of the business is Data Management so it is something that is directly related to my major while my current company is basically a Sales and Marketing company. 

The dilemma I'm currently in is that I'm having trouble choosing one over the other. If I stay at my current company, I'm 90% guaranteed a job after graduating unless I mess something up real bad. At my current company, I can also work on and off with our BI team so that's a plus. I haven't done it yet due to time constraints but if I wanted to, I could. I have a brilliant relationship with the coworkers and specially my boss who had to go above and beyond to secure me the extension and pay rise because he really wanted me to stay. 

But I feel like for professional development, choosing the new company would be better as I'd be working on what I wish to do in the future but there's no guarantee of a job.

I am a junior year undergrad from KJSCE Mumbai, India. I am aiming to give my GRE in August 2022 and going to try for MS in CS in the USA for fall 2023. I am really worried about my profile so can someone please help me out in evaluation, so that in the coming 6 months, I can try to build it as much as possible.

**GPA**: 9.4/10

**Internships:**

a) Data Science Intern at a FinTech Company (2 months)

b) Research Intern at KJSCE (1 month with a professor from my college. We did submit a paper, but it did not get accepted.)

c) App development Intern at an EdTech Startup (3 months)

d) NLP research Intern at KJSCE (just started, with a professor from my college)

**Projects**: [https://www.github.com/talha1503](https://www.github.com/talha1503)

**Extra-curriculars:** Part of technical council of college for 2 years, where we conducted workshops, held hackathons, taught the students of our college regarding various technologies, frameworks, etc.

I am really worried as I do not have any publications/ nor any internships from good companies, so even if I get a good GRE score, will that weight my profile down? Or should I focus the next 6 months on getting a good GRE score? Or should I try for fall 2024 and look for much better research opportunities in my final year?"

Right now as I am planning to commit, I am trying to decide between two schools: UIUC for Stats + CS and UCSD for straight CS.

UCSD: I am an in-state student so this would be the cheaper option (however, I have talked to my parents and the difference between UIUC and UCSD is negligible as internships can cover that), the weather at UCSD is also good.

UIUC: I am currently leaning towards UIUC as many people I have talked to have told me about how the CS department is very good with employability and internships. I am a little concerned about the downsides to not getting straight CS but instead being in a CS + X program. Many faculty members from UIUC have conducted admitted student sessions and have said that CS + X and CS are effectively the same thing for employers and won't make a difference. One friend that I talked to, however (he is in straight CS) told me that a few of his classmates in CS + X are having trouble finding internships and jobs whereas students in straight CS are effectively guaranteed a job.

Personally, I want to go into AI/ML and finance and am considering minoring in business if I go to UIUC, however, this isn't a choice I would make if it comes with the cost of me not being able to find internships or jobs. Furthermore, I've found that UIUC seems to be a lot more involved with innovation and startups than UCSD which is something I would be very interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

As UIUC students, have you guys seen any sort of difference between CS + X students and straight CS students when it comes to career fairs or general employability? Additionally, would the benefits of UIUC (good internship and job placement overall, a unified community with innovation and startups, CS + X) justify not going to UCSD for straight CS?

Thank you so much in advance!"

I applied for jobs freshly out of school but didn’t find anything. I also didn’t do any internships while in school, so that didn’t help. Life got in the way, so I stopped applying for a few years and now I’m trying to get back to it so that I can use my degree.

I know it’s been a while since I graduated, and I feel like a complete failure for still not having found a job in the field. I am afraid no one will hire me since it’s been so long since I graduated. I am 30 years old. 

I’ve been working on learning new things such as web and mobile app development throughout the years. The last few years I’ve been focusing on learning iOS development. When it comes to programming interviews, I know it’s all about data structures and algorithms. 

My question is, should I focus on only mastering Swift or should I also go back and revisit some programming languages I’ve previously used such as Java, JavaScript, and Python. Or should I just focus on Swift? I really want to get a job as an iOS app developer, but at this point, I will really take any job offering. Should I focus on my goal to get an iOS developer job or should I just go for any job and see what I get? I feel like if I go for any job and not something specific, I will have to work harder to get better at multiple programming languages as I won’t really have one main target. Please, give me some advice! Focus on iOS or go after any programming job? 

I also have no previous work experience as a programmer. Will I still be able to find a job even after almost six years of having graduated? How can I better prepare myself for interviews in my situation?"

&amp;#x200B;

What I used:

* I'm in the process of a Cybersecurity AAS at my local community college.  I'm getting funded by a grant program through my state to increase the percentage of tech people in our area.  There is a lot of buy-in and targeted internships from our local community for these programs.
* I took an applied security course fall term that used the Testout Security Pro coursework. There were also numerous additional labs. I didn't take the Testout cert test. I do like their practice tests that can be sorted by domain.
* I also read through sections of  Mike Meyers' CompTIA Security+ Certification Guide, Second Ed, but not in depth.
* I supplemented with Prof Messer vids for the domains I was consistently weak in, which were 3 and 6.
* I thought I was doing very well until I took the Dion practice tests on Udemy the past 10 days after seeing a free voucher here in r/CompTIA, and was only scoring about 65%.  I was sure I was going to fail.  My partner talked me into taking the test anyway, as he felt I was just testing poorly, and actually had a bigger grasp than that was indicating.  At least if I failed, I'd know the test format for a retake.
* I don't need a retake.

I wish I:

* spent more time reading log files and outputs from various testing programs.
* was stronger on various algorithms and standards.  So. Many. Acronyms.

Next I'm:

* planning on taking Linux+,  as well as both Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, and Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals in May/June as I was given a free voucher for two Microsoft fundamentals exams.  I'll be continuing with CCNA and possibly Network+ in late summer after I finish my Cisco sequence of classes.

* Residence: midwest suburbs
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): none

**Intended Major(s)**: Business/economics -- I put down film or communications for schools that allowed multiple majors of interest

**Academics**

* GPA/Rank (or percentile): 3.98 uw / 4.52 weighted. school doesn't rank
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 11 APs over 4 years
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Lit, AP Calc AB, AP Environmental Science, AP Spanish, AP Psych, AP Gov.... *please do not take 6 APs senior year*

* SAT II: none
* AP/IB: 5s on APHUG, both AP economics, APUSH, and AP Lang; 4 on AP Physics 1

**Extracurriculars/Activities:** tbh I feel like ECs were a weak point. I did activities I enjoyed, but didn't really have any leadership or things that stood out a lot.

1. Did sports video journalism for a company since sophomore year; was promoted after a year internship
2. Competed in team improv acting; won state sophomore year
3. Had a part-time online job \~8 hours/week since sophomore year typing closed captioning for videos
4. Play tuba in top band and was all-district
5. JV cross country and track all 4 years; no team captain
6. Various independent video projects... making free vids for local businesses, etc.
7. Had a YouTube channel freshman year with a few 1,000 subscribers and 500,000+ total views (don't think this contributed much to app)

2. Runner-up in international film contest
3. Winner of statewide film contest
4. All-academic in cross country conference
5. School honor roll

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** I got two LORs from my Lang and economics teachers. I think they pretty good, but nothing outstanding. I was a pretty quiet kid in class, but I worked hard and I think my teachers have a positive opinion of me. I also got a LOR from my boss at the journalism company I work for because I think it shows a different side of me. I'm good friends with him so I think this one was good too.

   * UPenn Wharton ED
* Withdrawn: Northwestern, Williams, Yale, Columbia, Harvard, Stanford

**Additional Information:** Wow, the past six months have been rough but we all made it out! I went into this process with wayyy too high of expectations. Getting rejected from Penn was a big wakeup call for me (but it hurt because it was my dream school). I'm a more mature person with a bigger perspective coming out of the college admissions process.

I'm really happy getting into UMich Ross and WashU because they were two of my top choices! I decided to ED2 to WashU because this year, decisions were so unpredictable and competitive that I wanted to hedge my bets. Plus, WashU's an amazing school with a great business program!

I had a bit of a spike in filmmaking but I could've done more activities for it to shine through. If I could redo high school (which I wouldn't), I would've doubled down on journalism/filmmaking and really developed that area of expertise. Overall, I'm really happy with my results considering I didn't really have any leadership ECs and I genuinely enjoyed every activity I was involved in throughout HS. I didn't do anything just for the sake of college apps.

I hope this helped some people out, and go bears!!🐻💚❤️"
mn5zqd,39,2021-04-08,Honest Thoughts on First Column,uncool-beans,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/mn5zqd/honest_thoughts_on_first_column/,"I lived at a First Column apartment for 2+ years and here are my honest thoughts:

Firstly, vandalism on the quad is obviously terrible. Definitely ruins the whole aesthetic with it being plastered everywhere.

The service at the First Column Office is very unprofessional. Upon signing, you are automatically enrolled into their own affiliated apartment insurance without much notice, and you are charged an additional fee every month. In addition, I was sent emails advertising a **different** insurance service **FROM** first column even though I am already signed up to their affiliated insurance by contract. 

Their ""consultants"" and ""interns"" are also not trained well. I've had many occasions when after I called to ask for important information, they gave me answers that were just assumptions or simply told me they did not know. I always end up calling until I luckily reach a manager or upper level employee.

Their parking lot situation is also no-bueno. Not sure if they have any control over their metered guest parking, but those are always leased out to construction(?) or other companies. This leaves the residents with no guest parking for when people come to visit. Again, not sure if they have control over this.

The rooms are honestly ok. Definitely better than most apartments due to the price range, but a lot of their cabinets, couches, and other furniture are made of cheap materials. Because of this, its easy to lose your direct deposit even if you're careful.

The only great thing about first column is the maintenance. Their maintenance team is extremely responsive and work really hard to fix your appliance. They've even replaced entire washing machines after mine broke.

Overall, First Column's office service and aggressive initiative for advertisement is terrible. Can't complain about the rooms themselves but matches the amount of price you pay for it. My honest opinion is to try to look elsewhere.

Hope someone finds this helpful if they're considering living at First Column!"

I am currently in my final year of graduating from college (CS degree). I am presently interning at a company where the work is mostly based on Computer Vision (searching for the right model(s) to suit the task of the company) and have a full-time job offer with decent pay (I'll be graduating in August 2021). I actually love the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning and also have a paper published in IET Electronic Letters. (I seriously have no intention of bragging, sorry if it sounds that way). I like researching models occasionally and try out different things to improve DL-based computer vision models.

But my long term goal is to work at one of the FAANG or any other large tech company with good pay

However, I realized (pretty late) that to get a job in machine learning at big companies, you have to hold an MS/Ph.D. degree and not in a position to apply for MS because of personal reasons. Also, I have no interest in pursuing a Ph.D.

Most of my internship experience and is mostly towards ML/DL and don't have much experience in software development apart from 2 projects involving building websites in Django and a bit of Node.js. I am okayish in DS/Algo, however, still not close to the level of giving interviews at companies like Amazon,etc.

I suppose you have to be exceptional at coding for getting jobs at big tech companies and also need good software development skills and experience. I have worked on only one software development WFH internship but it did not involve OOP's or system design, just basic features added to the existing codebase on C++, and thus am not sure if it'll count as proper experience

My question is should I start practicing interview questions from Leetcode after coming from work and is there anything I can do so that I can build good projects that qualify as ""Software Development"" so that I at least can apply for these jobs?

I feel a bit bad about this because all the work that I have on ML/DL so far would essentially be a waste (including the paper publication)

I am really confused as to how to proceed, any help would be appreciated. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this long post"

I applied for jobs freshly out of school but didn’t find anything. I also didn’t do any internships while in school, so that didn’t help. Life got in the way, so I stopped applying for a few years and now I’m trying to get back to it so that I can use my degree.

I know it’s been a while since I graduated, and I feel like a complete failure for still not having found a job in the field. I am afraid no one will hire me since it’s been so long since I graduated. I am 30 years old. 

I’ve been working on learning new things such as web and mobile app development throughout the years. The last few years I’ve been focusing on learning iOS development. When it comes to programming interviews, I know it’s all about data structures and algorithms. 

My question is, should I focus on only mastering Swift or should I also go back and revisit some programming languages I’ve previously used such as Java, JavaScript, and Python. Or should I just focus on Swift? I really want to get a job as an iOS app developer, but at this point, I will really take any job offering.

mn85od,6,2021-04-08,Lost As a CS Major,dopeamine___,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mn85od/lost_as_a_cs_major/,"Hey everyone. This is my first time posting on Reddit, so I am not sure whether this is the right place to post. I am a junior majoring in CS (obviously lol) and I just feel very lost right now. I feel like I am not good enough to be a CS major, and all of my classes (Data Structures and Algorithms, OOD, Computer Org and Architecture, and a project focused software engineering class) are very difficult. I do all of my projects and I am getting okay-ish grades in all of my classes. So many of my classmates are getting good grades and honestly, I find myself comparing myself to them all the time and just feeling really bad about how I am doing. The transition to online classes was really difficult for me, and I find it harder to understand and implement the concepts that I am learning in class. On top of that I do not have an internship lined up for this summer and haven't gotten offers from anywhere. At this point I don't even feel like I deserve to be a CS major because I am just not good at it. 

I would really appreciate it if someone who has gone through a similar experience can comment and share what they did to get better and build confidence as a CS major. Thank you."

This is my first post, and I just need a space to let this out. I  (28/F) have never felt so lost in my entire life. I know its not the end of the world but I feel so broken inside.

I don't have career and I still live with my parents. Before covid, I went from job to job, mainly bartending and was absolutely sick of it. I managed to scrape together as much money as I could and used covid as an opportunity to exit. 

In the last year I thought about different careers and ways I could optimize my time. I decided to go all in for graphic design (maybe for the wrong reasons). I was an art major in college (which I ended up hating as well, but just finished it to finish it). I had a good eye and figured it would translate well. I managed to get an intern in a marketing/graphic design position but the truth is.. I really just don't give a shit. I'm just not passionate about it, or can even actually say I like design or marketing period. I know I learned a new skill but in ways, I feel like I wasted all this time. The dread I feel when I think of art and graphic design now is heavy.

The only 2 things I am passionate about are singing and dance. Nothing can compare. These two hobbies are really my bread and butter to living. I love everything about the stage and performance. I've always fantasized about the spotlight.. But I'm 28 now and so many start when they're little. And in terms of skill, I can honestly just say that I'm fairly amateur. I don't really know what to do with this passion or IF I should. I know age is just a number but I feel like I'm a little late.

I also know I enjoy helping and inspiring people. Kind of more on an emotional level. I love music and dance because it lifts people's spirits and evokes emotion.

Really lost and don't really know where to go from here. I guess I should stick out my unpaid intern. I've cried so many times because I just feel so pathetic. I feel sick to my stomach. I need to start making an income. But don't want to float around to meaningless jobs. I know I have so much to give. I know what I'm doing right now doesn't feel right in my gut. 

Thanks to whoever read this. If you felt this way, I'd love to hear your experience and how or if you sorted it out. Or maybe we're on the same journey together.

TL;DR: Living at home, 28F, I hate doing art and graphic design. I'm lost as shit and need a new path.."

Right now I dont have anything else so I’m leaning toward accepting it but I dont want to work 40 hours a week unpaid.

Do you think I have any negotiating power like “hey since I’d still like to help the company and gain experience but it’s unpaid would it be alright if I work 20 hours a week?”

That way I still gain experience but I also don’t have to grind away at something unpaid and I still have time for other things like a job or projects. Do you think this would work or would it not be professional?"

mn9xd5,89,2021-04-09,"Never give up, I just received an internship offer from a Fortune 500 as an ordinary 2nd year college student during a pandemic.",cabbage-soup,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/mn9xd5/never_give_up_i_just_received_an_internship_offer/,"One year ago I was working at a dead end fast food job. Poorly managed and understaffed. Most of my coworkers were on drugs and half of them had been fired from other stores for drug usage and theft. My manager hoped she could ‘save’ them so thats why she rehired them. I felt so out of place, but also extremely discouraged. It’s hard to think you’re going to go somewhere when you’re surrounded in a bad environment for the majority of your week.

Well, over the summer things got worse. 3rd year with a broken AC and with the masks, it was unbearable. I get heat stroke in temps above 80F, but it was 110F+ daily inside my work. People were leaving left and right, and it was the good people too. People who actually made it somewhat enjoyable to stay. And I’m not kidding, every single one left. I knew I needed to get out too, so I started applying to jobs immediately.

At the time I just finished my freshmen year of college. Double major in interaction design and IT. I felt like my design skills weren’t great, so I only applied to a few IT internships. The rest of the jobs were other retail. Just anything besides fast food.

Anyways, I got an interview for an IT internship. Was nervous as heck. Somehow did well during the interview (fyi, saying you use google for troubleshooting is a good answer!) and got offered the job. Loved the job (like really loved it), but hated the industry. I wanted to focus on design. I dropped the IT major, took a minor in marketing, and I left the job for a digital marketing internship that I got by chance.. I was the only applicant and they had one week left to hire.

Moral of the story there, if you’re starting out, just apply places. You never know who will like you or where you’ll end up. Don’t doubt yourself, just be confident with your potential, especially if you’re going for internships.

Well fast forward to today. Been applying to design jobs since October (even prior to my marketing internship). Had quite a few rejections. Got offered a summer development internship that paid well but was inflexible, had many red flags, and I was not looking forward to it. Accepted it, but wasn’t satisfied. Actually felt very depressed even thinking about the job.

I have been applying to jobs very regularly since I accepted that position. Not feeling great about myself, but also not trying to lose hope. Most of my process was just googling ‘design internships’ and filtering by location and date of posting. My year and major didn’t really help me either. I wanted a design internship but I had a lot of IT experience to show and not a lot of design. I did my best to build a portfolio, but a lot of companies rejected me due to my lack of traditional design work.

It was even harder in February when a dream company rejected me. I didn’t get a basic rejection email either, I got this positive message from the employer saying how I was one of the most impressive 2nd year candidates they’ve seen. But a graduate student had more skills so they went with them instead. They told me exactly what I was lacking compared to the grad student and encouraged me to try again next year. By that point I was heartbroken and I spent the whole rest of my day in tears. Really wish they had separate internships for graduate students. But a few days later I realized that I had been compared to a grad student, which was pretty fucking awesome.

Most of the ‘impressiveness’ of my application wasn’t even skill but it was my presentation. Every single person who interviewed me throughout the process complimented the presentation of my portfolio, which was just work throw together in some pdf with a consistent format and well written explanations. It had clear effort, but I still think it looks like shit. but I guess if I learned anything from that rejection, it’s that putting some effort into your presentation matters and it’s definitely key to standing out.

Despite all of the rejections, and being ready to give up, I eventually got offered a design internship working at a fortune 500 company. Went through four interviews and saw nothing but green flags the whole way, very positive attitude from every worker, and after I was offered the job a few people from the team connected with me and congratulated me on LinkedIn. It feels like I suddenly won the lottery.

The best part, they chose me specifically because I had a unique background. I offered something different to their team and they wanted someone who could help them be innovative. So not only did I end up in a great company, but I also found somewhere that valued my skill set.

Not gonna lie, it still doesn’t feel real. I remember when my boyfriend found a part time job design job within a national package design agency and I was amazed because he was also only a 2nd year student. He kept telling me he wasn’t special for it, and it’s true. His skills weren’t the best and he actually applied to the job thinking it was an internship. I remember him going through a tough time looking for jobs being extremely nervous and discouraged. He didn’t think he had a chance once he realized that the position he interviewed for wasn’t an internship. But the company liked him so much that they changed their full time position to part time until he graduates. He was lucky to find somewhere that saw value in who he was. And throughout my application process he kept reminding me that if he could get a job where he did, then anyone could. Because he wasn’t that special. Just at the right place at the right time. And I guess I was too.

TLDR; Don’t give up. People like me and my boyfriend are not special, just lucky to be in the right place at the right time. Keep applying to jobs and present yourself the best way that you can. Somewhere out there exists the right company for you!"
mnawq4,13,2021-04-09,Got an internship I thought I totally had no chance for!,perhapsasitseems,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mnawq4/got_an_internship_i_thought_i_totally_had_no/,"I posted a few months ago asking how to give a salary/wage compensation expectation. At the time, I thought I was asking a useless question because after all, I wasn’t gonna get it anyways right? 

I’m both shocked and pleased to say I was absolutely wrong. I passed all three rounds of interviews: phone, coding interview with someone I didn’t realize was actually going to be my mentor, and a three hour coding interview with the rest of the team (separately) giving me a prompt each. 

I didn’t expect to get the internship offer at all because I hadn’t been diligent with coding and practicing for interviews. If I had a class for it, I would code. At my current internship under a sys. admin, I don’t usually code in C++ (the language used for the internship). So essentially, it was about 3-4 months since I had touched any C++. I beat myself up over it and got upset that I would be entering my first ever rounds of coding interviews without all my tools, compared to those who had been practicing.

I had one week to study for the first round and two weeks to study for the second round. I literally forgot the syntax to create a vector, much less any other data structure. I didn’t even remember how to declare an array. I read the OG Gayle’s book and that was super helpful... not that I remembered how a lot of it worked. Thankfully I was in an algorithms class so I was already familiar with Big O, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, etc. I went straight to Leetcode after reading and also compiling a list of syntaxes for different data structures. I could hardly handle Mediums, so I went off to do Easy. Honestly, it was motivating to be able to do the problems and it showed simple places to improve. It also helped me become comfortable again with many of the data structures. 

Anyways, I guess the most important thing I got out of this is be honest with yourself and try your best! Even if you don’t get the internship, it’s an experience to learn from. If you have one week left, that is absolutely okay. Practice and put the work in for that week. At the end of the day you did your best with what time you could!"

**Additional Information:**

I'm really happy with my decisions and think it was a big W especially for international applicants like me. **But please don't apply to 30+ schools like I did, it's stupid.** Part of the reason why I applied to so many schools is to leave some options open just in case something goes wrong (COVID and all these hate movements going on in the states) but it was dumb nonetheless. I thought I knew all of the schools I applied to well enough but it turned out I could've done a lot more school research. I only realized how little I care about half of the schools when I was waiting for my decisions. I also didn't realize how much I like liberal arts college after applications are over. ( I legit decided to apply to Haverford 2 hours before the deadline as a backup option and it was a really wise choice) My biggest regret in high school is not working harder in freshie and sopho year, if I pull that GPA up to a 3.85 I feel like I would've done better in this cycle.

I'm also planning on to change my major to engineering after freshmen year. I didn't apply as an engineering major since most of my ECs are econ/business - oriented. I definitely should've focused more on engineering than economics tbh. Most of my ECs are also kinda bluffed in my applications.

I didn't apply for any financial aid since my parents pretty much started saving for my college tuition when I was still in elementary school so... I know I'm privileged af and everything but idk how it affected me during the admission process, maybe that's why my results are better than I expected.

Currently, i am doing an internship in my country equivalent of NASA (or JASA). My job revolving around image processing - specifically denoising imageries obtained using amatuer equipments (JPEG, cr2, or FITS).  

I had a lot of expectation signing up for this internship, however, it is very underwhelming, as the job is just basic Image Processing. I have already finished my Python script, and my supervisor do not have any more work for me to do, as such, i am suffering both from feeling unproductive and impostor syndrome.  
 
So, in other to get validation, also to ask some question from people who have done internship, i have some questions:  

1/ I can only focus 100% about 4-5 hours/day, it it normal ? i try to stay at work 8 hours a day, but i dont have anything to do, or i just cannot focus in the afternoon.  

2/ The things i did is all basic Image Processing, with a little statistic and programming, this is really underwhelming as they are just implementation of course book knowledge (and a little editing Github Codes), is this normal ?  

3/ I try to fill my workday with self-studying, specifically, Data Engineer skills, is it okay to include these self-studying + projects inside my internship report ?
  
4/ I feel like i do not learn much in this internship, have my expectation been to much ?

**Essays**

Personal essay: 8.5/10

Was about my Eagle Project (building a playground), and was decently written, one of my first so not god-tier or anything. Was kinda just to flex the project and didn't really talk about how it impacted me all too much.

Supplements - these GREATLY differ from school to school

Cornell - 10/10 that shit was fire: no BS and hella specific

Brown - 8.5/10 worked tons on it but wasn't that special

CMU - 9/10

worked on the above three for a long time, did all the others in less than a day each :)

I’m not really sure where to go at this point since I’ve had 50+ applications turned down and they say I should just finish college.  I’d take minimal pay 20 hours a week solely to absorb knowledge. I’m getting close to just offering to pay for an internship even though I’m not sure how I’d afford it. 

What are the top 5 things to become competent in or do by July that I could land a basic SDE job or internship? Bonus points for Avionics related tips.

I appreciate it a lot, but it truly is a dilemma for me to decide..

I am currently working in sales/biz development in a tech company. My post-MBA goal is PM or PMM in tech industry in the United States, but I am also open to other roles in tech or PM in other industries. My plan B is to return to my home country (Asia) and work for management consulting.

&amp;#x200B;

1) UCLA Anderson

(+) Strength in tech recruiting

(+) Location (Great for both job searching and my fun!)

(+) Possibility of part time internship

(+) Nice weather

(-) No scholarship at all

(-) High living cost &amp; rent.. should buy a car

(-) Many homeless

&amp;#x200B;

2) Cornell Johnson

(+) Scholarship ($) and reasonable rent

(+) Cornell prestige (for my plan B)

(+) Alum network (including its home university) (for my plan B)

(+) Opportunity to study in Manhattan for one semester. (w/ Cornell tech MBA) &amp; increasing tech-related chances

(-) Location (Ithaca seems very small town)

(-) Weather (super cold.. right?)

(-) Relatively weak in tech recruiting 

&amp;#x200B;

3) Carnegie Mellon Tepper

(+) Scholarship $$

(+) Strength in tech recruiting

(+) I like its data-centric curriculum

(+) Living cost, reasonable rent

(-) Although Tepper is a great school and it was ranked 16th in the US news this year, but it's not the traditional T16. CMU is also not much known in my country. (when considering my plan B)

(-) Too tough(?) schedule/academic curriculum

(-) Pittsburgh is a great city, but it's not LA or NYC..

(-) small number of alumni compared to other schools 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't mention tight-knit community because all those schools seem to have very collaborative culture and students &amp; alum were very nice.

Which do you think is better for me?

I will graduate with a CompSci degree from a well ranked UK university in next summer, on track for a First (but who knows what final year will bring, let's say 2:1/First). I hold UK &amp; EU citizenship.

I messed up this year with getting a summer internship and probably will end up without one. They're fairly far and few in between in the UK anyways but I was ill-prepared, specifically for the technical assessments (companies seem to use the same for interns as graduates - I wasn't ready for that). I have 4+ years of unrelated experience (generic e-commerce position, mostly part-time during studies).

Later this year, when the graduate recruitment process starts, I aim to be better prepared. I also wanted to ask some questions about applying abroad. There's no particular reason for me wanting leave the UK and I will be applying here as well but I'll have lived here for 6+ years at that point and I like new experiences.

1. For countries where I have no residence rights and would require company sponsorship (Australia &amp; USA), is it worth it to apply for graduate/junior software engineering positions? Or is it a waste of time in my situation?
2. Switzerland is the only non-English speaking country on my list. I've spent solid amounts of time there for personal reasons and I speak conversational German but for sure not enough to actually live &amp; work there. Can anyone suggest what kind of language skills are needed for a software engineering job in Switzerland? I've read many different opinions, from the fact that there are English-only work environments to absolutely needing very good language skills to succeed (only considering German-speaking part of Switzerland).
3. Separate from my preferred countries, I've also considered the UAE, Singapore &amp; Hong Kong. I've heard that they rarely have fresh graduates in the UAE so that's probably out of the question. With SG/HK, there are quite a few (and I have an interest in finance which seems to be the majority of them as in Ireland) but I've had people suggest first gaining experience in the west. Any suggestions?
4. Lastly, if I've missed a country that is English-speaking, non-car-centric (I can't &amp; won't ever be able to drive) with good QOL and prospects for software engineering, let me know!

I appreciate any insight!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

I waived FERPA so I'm not sure, but:

CS Teacher: 9/10. I don't think I was particularly special in his class, but he seems to really like me and see potential in me, maybe out of neurodivergent solidarity? He's a great teacher and the two of us click, which might be the reason why. He promised me his recommendation would be glowing, which is very sweet of him. Took off a point because I'm not sure what exactly he'd say about me that's so great.

Lit Teacher: 10/10. Wasn't initially going to ask her for a rec letter but after I got deferred from Brown she called them with no prompting from me whatsoever to gush about me. She's a huge advocate for me, I try to participate in her class and be a good student but she really went out of her way to be supportive.

Physics Teacher: 7/10? She's a really cool teacher and the two of us got along, and she seemed to like me as a student. However, she was very busy and had to submit her recommendation at the last minute. I certainly don't blame her but I understand she was likely in a rush.

Stats Teacher: 8/10 she liked me a lot and stats is a subject I'm very passionate about but she was a 10th grade teacher. Hopefully it cancels out because it's an AP class.

Art teacher: 6/10. She is an absolutely wonderful teacher but I don't know if she ever submitted my recommendation. However she did let me put her as a reference for CMU Art last minute, which I apparently needed, plus I put her down as a supplemental recommender because art teachers are apparently not valid recommenders. **To any juniors reading this PLEASE make sure to check all your schools' recommendation policies! I didn't and it made getting reccs a nightmare**

**Interviews**

William and Mary: 8/10. Cool frat dude interning at the admissions office who told me I passed the vibe check after the first five minutes, which was just me rambling about how much I loved their stats program. Stress-free except for when he asked me what my fursona was as an interview question. that caught me off guard.

Princeton: 7/10 I don't remember much about my own performance in this interview. I think I did a pretty good job but the interviewer was really cool and charismatic and I want to travel to Princeton someday just to read her thesis.

Harvard: 7/10 interviewer was a senior partner at a big firm and I expected to be intimidating but he was very sweet. We talked about how academic interests can change and apply to different fields and he recommended me a book.

Penn: 5/10 I think I answered like two questions. The interviewer was very passionate about Philadelphia and mostly talked about how great it was. I want to visit Philly/10.

It’s an old build from 2013 but I can slap in my old leftover ram sticks and GPU to make it into a Minecraft build for my nephew. The only thing is that the PSU is one of those garbage prebuilt ones with a wattage of 300. I calculated the wattage that I need with the added parts with one of those websites and they tell me I need somewhere around 330-350 if I plug everything in. 
Now what I’ve read on some forms is that they overshoot their estimate with about 80% but on the other hand on this sub we always talk about getting a PSU with more then minimal wattage from a proper brand/manufacture. So my question is: will this build run fine if I won’t plug in the DVD and decrease the max power the GPU can draw? The reasoning being that the standard used to calculate the wattage by websites and manufacturers overshoot their estimate and that I’m able to lower the max power draw of the gpu. Would love to hear your thoughts on it.

I have two Summer internships offers from Company A (Tech - Silicon Valley F500) and B (American Industrial Giant - F500). Both internships start from May 24th to Aug 20. As an international student, I recently found out that I'll only be able to work from May 10 - July 30. 

Initially, I originally accepted the offer from Company A (my personal choice) and told Company B no due to tremendous difference in pay. However Company B, still didn't take me off the roster and extended the deadline to today because they knew I really liked the position. 

After finding out about my change in work dates, company A took a step back to reconsider things. However, Company B complied with the date changes and already sent me another offer letter. I don't want to sign the company B offer letter if company A still decides to move forward but if they decide to take back the offer then I'll have 0 offers at hand since Company B's offer expires today. Company A will let me know their final decision on Monday. What should I do?

Should I just accept the offer from Company B as insurance? 
If I accept Company B and Company A comes back on Monday with a yes then I would definitely look like a bad person in the situation. (Understandable)

I avoided writing about CS unless I had to for ""why major"" essays because I don't have many CS-related ECs and I find it hard to write about a ""CS passion"" even though I do enjoy it. My college counselor helped edit my essays, which made my shitty writing palatable. Overall I'd give my final essays a solid **8/10**

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* **University of Michigan**!! EA (dream school so I'm probably going to go)
* UC Santa Barbara
* UC Santa Cruz
* UIUC EA (as second choice poly-sci)
* Purdue EA
* Northeastern
* UC Riverside
* San Jose State

*Waitlists:*

* UCLA
* UC Davis
* UC San Diego
* UC Irvine
* Cal Poly SLO

*Rejections:*

* Columbia
* Cornell
* Brown
* UC Berkeley
* USC

**Additional Information:**

I got 2 scholastic gold keys and 1 silver key the day I got into UMich so it didn't affect that decision, but I did send the info to other schools as an update.

Really tough application year, especially for UCs. I go to a tryhard public school so everyone is very qualified but a lot of us got shafted. I'm pretty sure UCs hated my district, because everyone was getting waitlisted/rejected from the ""mid-tier"" ones even though they were very qualified and getting into a lot of other schools. No joke, I don't know a single person who got into UCI, even though I know a lot of people who got into Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Ivys, etc..

On a personal note, I'm really hyped to have gotten into UMich. For some reason I got really attached to it while researching schools and I guess all the demonstrated interest paid off! I put a lot more effort into that app which is probably a reason why I got in. I remember when I posted on chanceme people were saying that I didn't have a chance at UMich, so suck on that.

My counselor recommended that I apply CS to all my schools which in hindsight might have been a shitty idea. I didn't even apply as engineering either; if a school had CS in their humanities/sciences college I would always apply as that because I also wanted to study poli sci. And most schools put first-year students as undeclared so it didn't make a difference whether I marked/talked about CS or not. I should've applied as poli-sci to schools because I would have a lot more to talk about and it would've been less competitive and I would've been able to do CS anyway if I got in."

then i see another piece of paper that says “any attempt to login to the computer will make it incomparable and must be sent back” etc etc. i closed the laptop and put it back. im panicking as to if i should act and inform someone(which would be very embarrassing and not be good for a first impression) or just act like i did not see it.

i mostly want advice as to what i should do. experience in something like this? and if my computer will function correctly or what makes it incomparable that it has to be sent back."
mnovpa,4,2021-04-09,I have worked for a little over 2 months as a junior for a software outsourcing company. Boss told me I can change the current project (i.e. tech stacks) to React or Angular with .NET Core on the backend. Which one should I choose?,FMLhehe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mnovpa/i_have_worked_for_a_little_over_2_months_as_a/,"Right now I'm doing pretty basic backend stuff on my current .NET Core project.  But what I really wanted to do was to get into a web development project.

But now I am presented with two options:

1. Tech stack: React with .NET Core on the backend.
   1. The team will be pretty small, comprising of me, one manager and the manager of this manager. They are programmers as well and they will also code for the app.
   2. From what I understood it will be a legacy project, another company already worked on it for one of the modules. I don't know for sure if I'll be making any more UI or I'll just be dabbling in the backend. From the sounds of it I'll be doing most of the tasks together with my manager.
2. Tech stack: Angular with .NET Core

The team will be comprised of a dozen or more members, it's a pretty big project, with pretty complex stuff, the app being already in production.  They are all seniors plus senior testers.

I'd like to mention I already did an internship working in Angular, so I'm pretty familiar with it. But from what my manager mentioned, he was pretty keen on me taking the React role.

I just want to learn as much as I can and get my hands dirty. I also want to create SaaS apps in the future.

From what I can gather, I will be having a tougher time with Angular, and an easier time with React.

From your experience, where will I be able to grow more as a full-stack developer?"

mnp7u3,2,2021-04-09,Advice for stressful times,vian_jvt,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/mnp7u3/advice_for_stressful_times/,"Hi, as of right now, I am a freshman engineering student at Texas A&amp;M. The whole year so far I have been struggling with online school, and adapting to college in general. The first semester I was able to get the gpa I wanted/needed , but so far this semester I have found it very hard to find motivation to work on my harder coursework. I know this is self destructive behavior but I just find it so hard to study/work on work that I know is challenging.  I have been able to keep my grades up, and am happy with my scores so far, but many of my classes are definitely borderline. 

Despite school being a mess, I have been lucky enough to get an internship this summer as well as do undergraduate research but,

Within the next month I have 2 exams in each of my classes 1 midterm and 1 final, and from my calculations, If I were to mess up on either of them , my borderline grades could potentially drop, and cause my gpa to literally drop down the entire grand canyon.  

I guess what I am looking for is just advice from you seasoned engineering students, on how to deal with being completely burnt out from school for the first time in my life, and how I could possibly overcome this and finish my year strong?

No hooks

Intended Major: Computer Science

ACT/SAT: 1530 SAT (800 Math, 730 ERW) 
*Plan to retake the SAT with superscoring in mind next week, I’ll update when scores get released

UW/W GPA: (98.67%) 4.0/4.36 (My school doesn’t provide a weighted GPA, so I calculated it based on my AP classes, I wasn’t sure if some of my classes counted as honours so I didn’t factor that in.)

Rank: N/A (School doesn’t rank)

Coursework: 5 AP’s (I took max AP’s I could in Sophomore and Junior year) and 2 Dual Enrollment classes

AP World History (3, I got really unlucky with the SINGLE question the test was reduced to)
AP Physics 1: (4)
AP Computer Science (Not done yet)
AP Calculus BC (Not done yet)
AP US History (not done yet)

Dual enrollment:
College Russian
Forensics

Senior Course Load: Results not out yet but I’m guaranteed Multivariable Calc, and have a fairly high chance at a few AP’s like AP Physics 2 and AP macroeconomics

Awards:
Some local/regional track and field medals/awards
Applying to some CS competitions on a team

Extracurriculars:
Inducted into NHS
JV Track and Field (mainly Cross Country and Steeple in Outdoor track) for all years of HS. Pretty sure I’m running Varsity this year but my school only opened sports back up a week ago.
Internship in the summer before Sophomore year, as an IT assistant, about 40 hours of it were unpaid extra work that the school counted as volunteer work.
Worked as an IT assistant throughout sophomore year (COVID sorta put an end to that when we went remote)
Working on a school news website in a group that’ll actually be put on a domain and Brie able when we’re done.
I’m a deacon at my local church and spend 2-4 hours a week at least (not sure if that counts)
Letters of Rec: 
I got my Sophomore AP World History teacher for it, she knows me well and despite my AP grade she knows I was probably among the best students in her class with a lot of participation etc. I’d expect at least a 7/10 - 8/10 essay from her.
My Computer Science teacher, he knows me super well since I’ve worked for him basically continuously since Sophomore year and I’ve had him every year of my high school career, I’m his top pick this year for a summer intern etc. I have a feeling I can expect a top tier admission essay of at least 9/10. 
My Counselor Essay is probably not going to be the best, I don’t know her well, and she doesn’t know me well either. I’ve met her like 5-6 times ever and only for a handful of minutes. I’m expecting an average essay of 5-6/10
Essays:
I’m a pretty decent writer so I feel confident that given enough time I can write some good essays. I’ve already started a few supplemental essays for some of my lower choices to get the hang of it.

I’m not going to take a humble bragging tone here since I’m already pretty aware my situation is pretty good compared to most students. The issue is that I don’t know where I stand compared to T20 applicants, and such. In general I’d like my chances for getting into each ‘range’ since most of them will be roughly the same difficulty.

Reach: MIT (top choice), Caltech, Harvard, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Dartmouth, Brown

Lower Reaches: UPenn, Tufts, University of Virginia, Vanderbilt, Georgetown university, and Cornell 

Target: Northeastern, Gatech, NYU, Boston University

Safety: Rensselaer Polytechnic University and Rochester institute of technology.

1. Founder/head instructor of lots of computer science-related summer camps, after-school classes, and workshops at the nonprofit makerspace where I volunteer. Designed the whole curriculum + trained/led teams of counselors myself. Have been featured on local news a few times for this. 

2. President of my school’s Model UN team (largest club on campus, very competitive). Won a bunch of awards on the state/national level. Also organized/led one of the largest student-run MUN conferences in the state. 

3. Captain of my school’s team for [redacted math/CS competition]. We write math/CS research papers to solve real-world issues.

4. Only student member (invited by principal) on a committee of administrators/teachers/legal professionals that’s been revising my school’s course offerings and graduation requirements. I’ve led several town hall meetings and presentations to the School Board.

5. Captain of my school’s team for [redacted trivia competition that’s popular in my region]. We win the county championships almost every year, and I’ve been invited to our county all-star team a few times.

6. Co-president of my school’s Biology Olympiad club. (I was… not good at it. Didn’t even make it to Semifinalist status until this spring, rip.)
7. Started my own tutoring business - tutor kids K-12 in math, science, English, and programming.

8. Attended NSLI-Y China the summer before my senior year. (Was supposed to be a study abroad program, but COVID meant it was an online Chinese language intensive course instead. Still a very cool experience.)

9. All the other stuff I do (aside from teaching) at the nonprofit makerspace from \#1 - cofounded their student executive board, mentor other high schoolers and help them create their own camps/classes, lead tours/machine trainings, etc.

10. Started writing a book for middle schoolers on programming in Python. Didn’t finish before app season. Still spent a lot of time working on it, so included it as an activity (made it clear that it wasn’t finished yet, though).

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

(Yes, there are more than 5 awards here - some were mentioned in my rec letters.) 

1. National Finalist in aforementioned [redacted math and CS competition]; received big cash prize

2. Award that means I’m the top STEM student in my county/one of the top 100 STEM students in my state

3. NCWIT-AIC (Women with Aspirations in Computing) regional winner

4. Accepted five times to All-State Choir (+ was an alternate for All-National Choir once)

5. National Merit Semifinalist (am now a National Merit Scholar)

6. 3rd place in a statewide Chinese oratory competition

7. Harvard Book Award

8. USACO Silver

**Letters of Recommendation**

Can’t rate accurately, as I never saw them. Still, I imagine they were at the very least good. (Asked my Chinese teacher of 3 years and my AP Calc BC/Calc III/DiffEq teacher of 2 years that was also one of my club advisors. Counselor only met with me twice, but already knew who I was + seemed to really like me.)

**Interviews**

I’ve been told I interview well. Not sure any of my interviews actually made a difference on my application, but they definitely didn’t hurt. (Of the thirteen schools I applied to that have alumni interviews, I interviewed with eight; Duke, Vanderbilt, Northwestern, Columbia, and Stanford didn’t offer me an alumni interview.)

**Essays**

Started writing applications for EA schools in October and for RD schools in late November. (Don’t be me, kids!) 

My essays were good but not exceptional - my supplementals were, on the whole, much better than my Common App. Wrote the COVID-19 essay on keeping Model UN afloat during the pandemic.

In terms of optional videos: Didn’t do the WashU video. Did the Brown video — it was okay, just a short list of fun facts about me.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Duke RD (with a FULL-RIDE MERIT SCHOLARSHIP!!!) 
* Cornell RD
* Carnegie Mellon RD
* Vanderbilt RD
* Rice RD (with 15k/yr merit scholarship)
* WashU RD
* UVA EA (with honors; was semifinalist for Jefferson Scholarship)
* Georgia Tech EA (was semifinalist for Stamps Scholarship)
* Two in-state public schools EA (both with full-ride merit scholarships)

*Waitlists:*

* MIT RD
* Northwestern RD
* Harvard RD
* Brown RD
* Columbia RD

*Rejections:*

* Yale RD (was originally deferred REA)
* Princeton RD
* UPenn RD
* Stanford RD

**Additional Information:**

Wow. Just… wow. Applied thinking I’d get into my state schools, Georgia Tech and/or UVA, and *maybe* one of the others if I was really lucky (definitely not with any sort of merit aid). This is beyond any expectation I could’ve possibly had — I’m shocked and incredibly grateful that these schools decided to give me the time of day.

Since you’re still here, time to get up on my soapbox for a bit:

If you have good stats/ECs, a safety you really like, and the money/fee waivers to send out lots of applications, SHOTGUN. For the love of God, please shotgun. Once you’re at the level where your profile isn’t getting immediately thrown out at top universities, assuming you’re not hooked, there are no match schools for you; each application is either a safe bet or a lottery ticket. The easiest way to increase the chances of one of those lottery tickets panning out is writing as many apps as you can and writing them well. 

(Shotgun merit scholarship applications, too, if you have the time. I applied to something like 7-8 big merit scholarships; aside from the ones at my in-state safeties, I was rejected from them all EXCEPT the most competitive one I applied to???)

Another takeaway — you don’t need fancy internships, research publications, or national nonprofits to be competitive. You don’t need a “spike” to be competitive. Almost all my extracurriculars existed purely within the context of my school, and they were pretty scattered! I think the key, if you’re going the route I did, is to a) highlight specific impacts you’ve had within your extracurriculars that will last after you’re gone and b) accumulate lots of top leadership positions. 

Also, unless you are heavily hooked or God, REA is lowkey a scam. (I’m pretty sure ED does give you a boost, though.)

In conclusion: DUKE ‘25 BAYBEEEE GO BLUE DEVILS 😈💙😈💙😈"

mnsls2,7,2021-04-09,UVA or UMD for CS,collegejedi,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/mnsls2/uva_or_umd_for_cs/,"Hello! I need some help deciding where to go next year. I saw a similar post like this from last year: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bh1p9j/umd_vs_uva_for_computer_science/), but I wanted some more input. I will be posting this in both the UVA and UMD subreddit to get a balanced opinion.

I will be a cs major and OOS for both: Direct CS at UMD and CS in the E-school at UVA. My goal is to work in industry, preferably at FAANG or big N.

**UMD**

$43,166 / yr (after a 12.5k scholarship/year)

Pros:

* Better CS program -- more companies probably come to career fairs specifically for cs majors
* UMD prioritizes the cs program and gives it lots of funding
* More urban as it is close to DC
* Got into the honors program but not my preferred Living Learning Program (ACES &amp; DCC). Instead, I got into Gemstone, but I'm not really into research or the 4-year commitment
   * I do not plan on pursuing a phd, but I might get a professional masters
   * Overall, the honors program doesn't seem like a deciding factor

Cons:

* Huge school and campus
* Good/bad professors seem to be split 50/50
* Very large program meaning large class sizes and difficulty getting into good classes
* College Park doesn't seem to be the nicest area, and school spirit and the community seem to be lacking
* The dorms are pretty bad.

**UVA**

$63,773 / yr

Pros:

* Better name recognition
* Have the possibility of getting an engineering business minor from the E-school, McIntire, and Economics departments
* Much smaller program with the entire UVA CS class size being about the same as UMD CS's freshman class. This might lead to better connections with professors and better communities of CS students
* Haven't heard much about cs professors at UVA, but more seem to be on the good side
* More liberal arts approach to engineering, which I might like better actually. I hated Chemistry, and Biology was a nuisance. I never really got to explore much outside of stem in high school, but I like learning foreign languages and creative writing (hate analyzing literature though). Some history is cool too
* Campus and dorms are much nicer -- Charlottesville seems like a cool town
* UVA school spirit seems to be much better. The sports teams are pretty good, and it seems like a tighter community
* I like the colors and mascot LOL

Cons:

* Not as good of a CS program
   * UVA seems to be trying to improve its engineering school and cs program
* There might be fewer companies (particularly big N) coming to UVA career fairs?
* Not close to any cities so it might get a little boring
   * Fewer internship opportunities?
* I hear the food is mediocre, but there are good places in cville
* I'm kinda worried about the preppy/fratty culture and being Asian in a mostly white community; however, I don't think it will bother me too much because I already come from a place that isn't really that diverse

Conclusion: I think I would rather be a Hoo and have a better experience at UVA. The thing that's holding me back is money since UVA is 20k more per year. I can probably afford both without loans, but it would take all of our savings (my parents say they'll pay, but I feel guilty for being a financial burden on them). I also have a sibling that will be going to college a few years after I graduate college. I'm not too worried about the difference in CS rankings and education because I hear both places will provide similar opportunities of getting into a FAANG company? I'm a pretty good student and will have decent experience coming into college with knowledge of multiple languages, web frameworks, and Github.

If I'm wrong about any of the points above, please correct me. I will admit I probably know less about UMD because of my biases, and more people know UVA. Let me know what you guys think. Thanks!"

i’m not sure if i’m posting on the right subreddit and if i’m not, please let me know the correct place to post.

i know this is a long post so feel free to just skip to the TLDR, but i wanted to give a better picture and explain my situation as best as possible to strangers on the internet. 

i’m really going through it right now. i’m an underclassman at a large college and have been finding it hard to make friends. i mean i have some close friends from my high school days (2 of which i’ll get to see at my college next semester) and some new close friends that i made at college. but i don’t know nearly as many people as others do and i always feel left out of things. it’s hard to explain and i’m sure you’re thinking “what’s the big deal? just go talk to people”. yeah that’s true but it’s not easy for someone who has constantly lost friends due to growing apart and other factors. i’m afraid of opening up to new people bc i think they’re constantly judging me and when i do open up, it seems that they already have friends that they’d rather hang out with. 

i am in a few orgs on campus but they turned out to be less social than advertised lol

to add on, i have immense stress about eventually having to introduce my bf of almost 3 years to my parents bc they’ve already said they don’t like him in the past due to his religion and that i have to cut off all contact with him. 2 extended family members who i am close to and my friends all love him so it’s a matter of making my parents let go of their prejudice and biased upbringing. i’ve been having crazy panic attacks and stress about when i do have to tell them bc i know they’ll shut me down and call me a disappointment and blah blah blah. i’ve scoured the internet for answers and advice and am considering therapy. 

i’m already anxious around my parents bc of the situation regarding my bf. today one of my parents made a comment about me that i very much took to heart to the point where i actually started crying. they don’t see what they did wrong and won’t apologize so. 

the only thing that i have going for me to any extent is my academic/career related stuff- grades aren’t bad (could be a bit better but i’m working on it), got into some programs that i’m super excited abt, and i have an internship. 

i’ve already talked to my close friends and bf abt this and they comfort me but at the end of the day, that doesn’t make my issues go away. 

ANYWAYS, i’m not asking for advice necessarily (but if you have any, i’d love to hear it). i just want to hear from some of you who felt this way at one point and now you’re at a great point in your life and can’t believe you were once going through it.

TLDR; sad college student who needs some hope that things will get better - please share personal experiences where your life got better and you’re in a great place now"

I'm intending on majoring in CS (was accepted to L&amp;S), but in terms of a career, I'm not set on CS. I think a career in tech, consulting, finance sound interesting (right now), and I may potentially want to go to grad school (maybe for an MBA or MS in CS). 

Going to Berkeley seems like the obvious option academically. Great job placements to all the fields I'm interested in and good grad school placements as well. The big issues for me are the competitiveness (classes and clubs), safety (Berkeley does not seem safe), grade deflation (?), and dorms. 

On the other hand, UCLA seems like the opposite. A great location, good dorms and dining, and a less competitive atmosphere. However, a problem is that I was accepted for CS+Ling, not CS, so I'll have to take many linguistics courses which I'm not interested in. Furthermore, this may have an effect on internship opportunities. Additionally, from what I've heard, UCLA does not place well into consulting and finance.

Overall, I'm just lost as to whether I should attend UCLA or Berkeley. Berkeley seems great academically (if I can keep my grades up and get into some of the clubs) at the expense of some quality of life, while UCLA seems great socially at the expense of opportunities."

I'm just wondering what roles don't expect students to have side-projects?"
mntpyr,7,2021-04-09,Software Engineering Internship Interview Presentation,JavaIre99,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/mntpyr/software_engineering_internship_interview/,I have gotten to the final stage of interviews for a software engineering internship which will involve a presentation on a project. I was told to try and find a presentation that somehow has the skills in the job specification which I understand. They also specify a university project so I can't use a side project. The project that is slightly relevant is not one that is very interesting (it is CLI and doesn't have a UI). I have a project recently with a UI but the programming language it's programmed in is not specified in the job spec. Any projects using a database that they specify doesn't use an object oriented language which they require. What's the best approach to it? I was thinking of using the one that isn't very relevant and at the end suggest improvements of where I could use the database technology that the company wants to improve how data is stored etc. to show that I have knowledge of technologies to make it better.
mntrbq,6,2021-04-09,Washington University Saint Louis (the one in missouri) VS Cal (UC Berkeley) for CS,puglif,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mntrbq/washington_university_saint_louis_the_one_in/,"Hello everyone, I am a programmer who has had a ton of experience programming for a highschooler (multiple apps, w/wo backends like AWS, Firebase, and Mongo DB (even made an app for a startups for a huge chunk of change), websites for business, w/wo backends, and some AI things here and there)(I know Swift, JS, Python all as really high levels). Unfortunately, my high school counselor has not be able to help me in any capacity, and so I really need help deciding between colleges

* **Washington University Saint Louis (the one in missouri) VS Cal (UC Berkeley)**.
* pros of WashU
   * i like the school environment
      * they really care about the students
      * amazing food and dorming
   * they have research opportunities (lead to internships)
   * they have a lot more interesting classes that align w my future (business/entrepreneurship + cs)
   * seems to be a LOT easier than berkeley (im not scared of the challenge, its just that i've never been good at school, I only got into these schools because i have made some sick things and prob bc i made a funny/geeky admissions video)
   * **I believe that washu will give me a more fun 4 years but after that I am unsure. I want to accomplish a lot and I am extremely career focused and I am unsure if washu is gonna prepare for that. i genuinely want to help the world with my code, and again is washu gonna be the right school for that**.
* Cons:
   * Cost. (20k more a year than cal and im paying myself)
   * no jobs in STL ( and i get one it wont be enough to pay off my degree)
   * also im indian and when i visited i was shocked by how many ppl were staring (im a really ugly brown boy and I had my mask on so they couldn't even see my amazing smile)
   * not from STL so idk anyone there but in Cali
* **Cal pros:** I think everyone knows about UC Berkeley especially in the tech space but here is a list of some of the pros and cons of the school nonetheless
   * I know 3 people are going there and i am close to one of them
   * stronger reputation
   * Access to more opportunities than WashU
      * Ik that these opportunities are more hidden, but I am a self starter which makes this a pro
   * in the bay area so I can get access to more work opportunities which will help me pay off school a lot sooner and will be able to learn a LOT more A LOT younger.
   * only 40k vs washu's 60k
* Cons:
   * Dangerous campus
      * doesnt matter too much to me but im curious abt how bad it actually is
   * a lot of competition between students
      * This is something that I hate because I like to think of myself as a very nice person and some of the stories that ive heard are just crazy and lowkey sound dehumanizing
   * I will have a hard time getting the classes i need bc of the size of the school
   * very rigorous school
      * wont be able to really explore my interests that go past computer science
      * also im really bad at anything that isnt cs and math and I think Cal has more pre-reqs

Overall, I think that I like washu more than Cal, but the reputation of Cal within the CS and Startup space seems to be way better than washu(also cal is cheaper) so I don't know which school would be best for me."

Completed one PM internship and will be doing one Software dev internship in summer, Then graduate. Now having 2 internship experiences, will it be way easier for me to get full-time offers now just by talking about my accomplishments during my internships, or will it take still 50+ applications to get an interview or 100+ applications to get one offer?"

mnwive,2,2021-04-09,Employer is asking me to file a police report on my (soon to be former) roommates,BrumSnootles,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mnwive/employer_is_asking_me_to_file_a_police_report_on/,"Alt account here because I don’t want my name or face associated with this for hopefully obvious reasons.

I relocated to a new state last summer in order to take up a job offer post graduation. The apartment I leased is a quad, on a by-the-bedroom style leasing system meaning I was put in with 3 random roommates. The apartment complex has a partnership with a local university, and most of the residents there (including all of my roommates) are students.

Roommate K keeps to himself. He’s a weird dude but he’s quiet and I don’t see him much. Roommates C and D, however, are TROUBLE. They’re filthy. They trashed the place and used / ruined a lot of my nice kitchenware without asking. They blare deafening music all night, even after I ask them to stop as I have work in the morning. They constantly smoke both tobacco and weed inside the unit. D is a felon but deals drugs out of the apartment and owns several guns he bought stolen from his fellow gang members, and C constantly has violent arguments with his numerous girlfriends. I was absolutely miserable living with them, but I was willing keep to myself and put up with it until my lease expires.

This last Wednesday, that changed - C and D brought an older woman home from the bar who was visibly intoxicated. She was fading in and out. She was calling them all sorts of racial slurs and saying she just wanted to leave. They took her to C’s room and, despite my objections, shut the door and turned up the music. I’m almost positive they raped her. She drove home drunk after that. 

I was very uncomfortable and retreated to my room when they went to C’s room- I didn’t wanna insert myself into a situation involving alcohol with two violent guys who I know are armed. As I was trying to fall asleep, I heard C and D go outside and start yelling at some other guys. Then there were two gunshots. I hid in my closet and debated calling 911, but decided not to because I didn’t want them thinking I was a “snitch” and retaliating. As far as I know, no one was hit. No police showed up that night. I could tell the explanation C and D gave me was a lie. The next morning I called my parents and told them what happened, and they told me to let my employer know. My employer put me in a hotel for the time being, and I’m currently shopping apartment options.

Today, HR informed me that, due to their scholarship and internship partnership with the university, they feel obligated to inform campus police as to what happened. They asked me if I’d be willing to give a statement, and I said yes. I haven’t yet done so.

Now my fear is some sort of reprisal if law enforcement gets involved - most of my belongings are still in my room in the unit. All I was able to get out were my valuables (cash, watches, etc.), my glasses / contacts, a week of clothing, my work laptop, and all of my firearms. I’m afraid they’ll do something to my possessions or to me if police get involved. If they were to get caught with weed and stolen guns, I’m guessing there’d be serious charges there and they wouldn’t be too happy with me.

Are my fears rational? I’m just so stressed and the thought of them doing something to get back at me absolutely terrifies me. I don’t know what to do."
mnwpq3,6,2021-04-09,What math should I take as a rising CS major,AKadvil1,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/mnwpq3/what_math_should_i_take_as_a_rising_cs_major/,Hi I’ll be going to UMD as a compsci major this fall and I’m super hyped about it. I’m currently planning my courses out for next year and I’m wondering what math course should I take. Because of online school and covid I don’t think I’ve learned much so I’m thinking about taking math 140 so not only I could ease myself into college rigor but also focus on the compsci classes which I heard are notoriously difficult. Also is there an advantage in taking high math levels earlier when it comes to internships? LMK your suggestions!

So anytime we struggle with internship task, we can ask them for hint or help. We save tons of time struggling with task or asking our supervisor/mentor/other interns. Has anyone had this experience? Does it actually help?  


I feel like asking too many question in a remote internship may cause trouble and bad look for an intern during work."

mnzfjz,0,2021-04-10,CS at UC Davis vs CS at Cornell,TOPsArt,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mnzfjz/cs_at_uc_davis_vs_cs_at_cornell/,"So I'm a high school senior considering where to go to college for CS. My main two options right now are UC Davis for Computer Science and Engineering and Cornell for the College of Engineering, where I'll declare CS in sophomore year. My questions:

1. Is CS at Cornell (which is ranked so much higher than UC Davis) actually beneficial when it comes to companies recruiting/internship opportunities? Basically, assuming good grades &amp; all the other requirements, do a variety of companies, from big companies to Fintech to even startups, come to Cornell/recruit from Cornell for internships? I know it's not the name of Cornell that will get me any of these internships but will Cornell classes prepare me for them and offer the opportunities? Or is it equivalent/worse than the preparation and opportunities that I'd get at UC Davis or anywhere else?
2. On a scale of 1-10 (1 being easy &amp; 10 being extremely difficult), how feasible is it to get internships &amp; research opportunities at Cornell in freshman year? Sophomore year &amp; beyond? What companies/opportunities are available at Cornell that I should look out for if I go?
3. Do people from Cornell get these opportunities bc my parents know people from Davis who are in the industry and are successful but I don't know of any Cornell success stories? I'd love to hear anyone's recruiting/internship stories &amp; any related helpful advice about CS at Cornell.

The biggest issue with Cornell for me is definitely cost. As someone from a middle class family who has no financial aid (at Cornell or Davis) and intends to do a masters degree after undergrad, I barely have enough money to pay for undergrad at Cornell, let alone a masters degree anywhere. (I'm planning on somehow juggling it with applying to outside scholarships &amp; working jobs/paid internships if I choose Cornell to save up for MS). 

So yea, in that sense, UC Davis makes sense but it just feels wrong to me and I can't even really explain it. Cornell just feels like the right decision but financially, it's not. It's definitely the risky option of the two.

**TLDR:** Basically, is CS at Cornell worth that financial risk? Why is it so damn expensive? Will I gain *that* much back from how much I'll be spending on it whether that's through knowledge or opportunities etc? How does it compare to CS at a school like UC Davis?

&amp;#x200B;

Sidenotes:

I also got into the 5 year MS + BS program at UC Riverside for CS as well as Regents and the Honors program which sounded like a pretty good deal to me, but I heard that it's just not a good school for CS. Ranking-wise seems to support that and also I heard that it's hard to get recruited or just get any internship or other opportunities from there, that a lot of companies won't even consider students from there or recruiting from there. Not sure how much of that is true but yea.

I also got into UIUC for CivE with James Scholar and before I got into Cornell, I was entertaining going there and transferring to CS (thought it'd be rlly hard) just because UIUC is really good for CS and my other options weren't looking too good then."
mnzn1y,1,2021-04-10,[AU] Advice with new employee,waronwaste,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/mnzn1y/au_advice_with_new_employee/,"Hi guys


I recently stepped into a management position, managing 2 staff members. One was employed last October, another 7 weeks ago.  I am a bit torn about my second employee, Tom (alias). I am seeking your advice - am I doing the right thing and am I reasonable in my expectations of Tom? Maybe advice on a recent event would be greatly appreciated too - was I condescending?   



Firstly, do I have reasonable expectations of Tom, and is my next move a good approach? Tom recently graduated from his masters degree, he is seeking permanent residency in Australia and has a few short internships up his sleeve. Nothing more than 3 months. Because of Covid, we have a working arrangement that is 3 days WFH and 2 days in the office. We pay him well for someone with no substantial work experience - 27% more than other graduates in our organisation. His probation period is 3 months, so we are just over half way.  Personally, I really like Tom - but a lot of me thinks he is taking the piss. In addition I am not entirely impressed with his performance to date. Some points to date:  
\- As part of his permanent residency, he can do 3 months work experience which will give him points towards his application - on day one he had already enrolled into the program with out discussing whether we would support it. We did agree in good faith.  
\- He put me down as a referee for realestate agencies without consulting with me prior. I found out when I was contacted by the agent.  
\- A few weeks ago, he messaged me at 8:30am (start time 9am) on a day he should be in the office and asked if he could WFH that day because he was tired. I was disappointed, but said yes - but stressed that I need more notice. He was tired because he was getting ready to move to a new apartment..  
\- The same week, he again asked the morning he is expected in the office at 8:30, said he needed to pick up keys at 5:30. I said no, but leave a bit early if he needs to (but he lives 20 minute walk from the office - close to the realestate). He then showed up to work 15 minutes late, so obviously planned not to come in.  
\- The next week he asked me again, did he need to come in because it was raining. I said, yes - mate, it rained before Covid. Reinforced he is expected in the office 2 days a week.  
\- Last Thursday, he messaged me at 4pm, right after 1 hour meeting I had with him (not about performance, but a work task with my team), he asked me if he can finish now, he needed to pick up a tv. I went straight into another meeting so didn't respond. I told him that 0 minutes notices is unacceptable, unless of course it is an emergency. HE responded telling me that it was an emergency because his partner couldn't pick up the TV.  
\- While I was in the above meeting, he started pressing buttons in zoom, like thumbs up and putting his hand up etc, while I was talking. I said, Tom, you don't need to put your hand up, there are three of us here. He replied saying he was playing with buttons - so clearly not paying attention.   



With the points above, I plan to sit down with him and reinforce that these points have given me the impression that he is not serious about this job, and sees it more as work experience. I want to give him the remaining 5 weeks to improve, with regular touch points, and of he doesn't improve I will either extend his probation period by 3 months or let him go.



Secondly, did I cross a line, was I condescending? The same meeting I discussed above, I'll be honest, I was pretty unhappy with his attitude. I have given Tom a task to write a simple procedure following a template I have provided. I asked him to watch me do a demo and for him to go away and write a step by step guide for other staff to follow. Not a test, I will give him feedback and eventually he will know what I expect from him. I ran through the demo twice, at the end I asked if he had any questions - zero. So I asked him, 'so you feel comfortable now to go away and write a procedure'. HE said yes. And so I quizzed him, and he didn't answer waited for my other staff to answer. In the end I told him he needs to write the procedure and present it back o me, because he seemed so confident. Was that slack - I feel bad but I also felt like I needed to ruffle his feathers a bit.  



Your advice and feedback is greatly appreciated."

Classes will be starting at September and I have a mandatory internship to do. I really would like to do an internship in Germany, it can be started remotely in anytime and I can go to Germany at June soonest, I live in Turkey, I’ve been sending my resume and cover letter to maaaany companies for 1,5 months (have done over 100 applications).  Some of them rejected already, some of them still are under consideration. 

How can I find an internship? Can you help me?"

Hoping some of you can provide some input on my chances of getting into M7 school, with Stanford being my #1 top choice. 

- Why I Want an MBA: 
Honestly mostly hoping to network and gain business fundamentals to get into entreneurship and have my own startup. 

- Age: 23 

- Work Experience: 
2 years at an AI startup that’s VC backed and doing pretty well. I joined when the company had less than 15 people and now we’ve grown to over 60. I’ve had a ton of responsibility in my role and the founders regard me highly in the company. 

In college, I did internships every summer (one at a startup, two at big-name, high-profile tech companies (think Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.)). 

- Undergrad School/Major: 
T50 school but it’s like T20 specifically for Computer Science. I majored in Computer Science and Statistics and had a GPA of 3.65. 

- Extracurriculars: 
In college, I was on the hip-hop dance team and skiing club. I was also a TA for an intermediate level CS class and led hackathons on campus. 

Now, I’m still involved in dance in my free time. I also teach a CS class once a week to low-income, unemployed students looking to get into computer science. 

- Race/Nationality: 
Indian  

-Gender: 
Male 

-GMAT: 
Got a 720 on a recent practice test. 

I know I’m a little young but because of my goals and the level of responsibility I’ve had, I see no reason to apply later in my career. My main goal is finding cofounders to start my own startup and get VC funding so I feel like the best choice for me would be Stanford. What are my chances?"

Hi  guys, I've been a young developer since I was 14 dabbling in this world as a hobby, now I'm 22 yo.

For a few years, following my great disappointment in the world of physics research in **Italy**, I have devoted myself to programming in the professional field. I have always developed websites professionally to make a profit as a freelancer, then I enrolled at university in CS and found myself in the condition that I was not interested and did not have the effort to do 3 years of university to go to work.  Later I participated in a project called **Apple Developer Academy** in Naples, which is a partnership between Apple and a University in Naples. In this year I have professionally developed **ios apps** by publishing them on the store and obtaining good results.  After this experience I realized that the world of **ios app development** did not stimulate me and I wanted to move on to something else. So I took part in a training course on Java development.

&amp;#x200B;

After this training course I will do internal interviews in the course with companies that have a partnership. Unfortunately, from what they explained to me, the most they have to offer are internships, internships or apprenticeships. Not even paid initially.

I have also had interview proposals from hr regarding the position of java developer in Italy, but at the moment I cannot accept or do any interview with anyone due to the contract I signed.

2 years freelance web dev

1 year Apple Dev Academy, ios app dev 

4 month training course java development

\+ personal project trading bot and blockchain on eth 

My goal is to go to work for some company between **Holland** and **Germany**, what is the shortest way that leads me to achieve this goal?

Once I have reached the end of this training course, although the maximum offer of these companies is that of an internship paid the minimum in Italy, what is the path that I should take?

Refuse and devote my time to developing java projects and then send applications anywhere in Europe for the position of a java developer, or evaluate other offers that are coming to me from Italy as a java developer?

At the moment my question is: with 0 years of experience in java development, how much work can I find with my profile in this field in Germany and the Netherlands? Should I accept the internship and then at the same time try to accept a job offer here, get some experience and then find work around the Eurupa?

Please help me I don't really know what to do"

I like the technology industry, but I don’t want to work as a low paid code monkey for the rest of my life. I initially joined this field for the money, but I’m rethinking my decision. While I know I’m doing ok, my performance in CS classes is always below my standard of “good”. What can I do with a CS bachelors that is lucrative but more focused on something else like management or finance industries? I like math, and I am a math dual, but I want to set my foot in the right direction in college before I’m stuck in an industry that doesn’t seem to be a good fit for me. I enjoy problem solving, but I can’t identify what works for me, and I think a goal of working for a FAANG company is unrealistic in terms of career goals.

When i joined my university (which was based in china) i was told on the acceptance letter that i was accepted into an MBBS program based on western clinical medicine and through out my 6 years of med school i was constantly reassured along with a few hundred students that the course we are studying is a western medicine based MBBS (if you're wondering about if there is another kind boy are you in for a shock)   
come to mid 2020 and we find out we have lost our ECFMG accreditation (ECFMG is an electoral college that oversees foreign graduates and verifies their degrees ). this is important because when we joined we had this very important accreditation which is required for working in the US and western Europe, and even in some parts of the middle east. This affects me directly because it stated that we lost our status in 2019 but i graduated in 2020. We were told that the university is dealing with it and decided to wait it out and since a lot of us were busy doing our internships at hospitals in our home country and we couldn't go back to china owing covid and work.  
towards the end of 2020 we then find out we have now not only lost ECFMG verification we have now also lost our WFME, WDOMS (a directory of medical schools internationally) FAIMER and GMC (uk) accreditation.  
it was at this point that a lot of us started to panic as we were unable to work anywhere, even in our respective home countries. i lost my place for my licensing exams and am unable to apply for any internship at any hospital in the Middle East (where i live) or South Asia due to losing our accreditation.  
when we contacted the Chinese ministry of education we were told that the university we attended doesn't have a western clinical medicine program and thus we are unable to work as doctors and they cited the reason the university lost all its accreditation was due to the fact that it hadn't registered its program as a western medical program and was thus removed.  
this not only affects me and my batch that joined in 2014, but all the previous batches from the early 2000's.    
what do i do?"

I am a freshman in DGS right now and want to transfer to the pre-engineering program at the end of this semester. I'm here to ask if anyone has this experience and can share some details with me. Some important questions I want to know is how much do they value your GPA, and personal statement. I'm an international student and I spend this whole year at home, so it is impossible for me to have some experiences that ""demonstrate you used campus resources to explore your major of interest"". And because of COVID many companies and workplaces don't offer internships to people from outside. So all I can count is my GPA and PS I guess, because my resume is really poor. I self-nominated to be a James Scholar this semester, but I highly doubt it will be much of a deal because all students that want to ICT to engineering are top students with high GPA in their departments. If you had the experience of ICT to engineering please share some insight or what you think is important. Or if you are also preparing for ICT we can exchange some opinions and help each other out.

Well for an IT that is. Meron din naman kami netsec and automation however let's just say that hindi yun ang usual interest ng mga students. Usually puro web dev ung kinukuha na ""specialization"" or track. Now the question is madami ba options especially for an incoming grad or fresh grad na hindi magaling mag code? Let's just say na I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. I constantly have anxiety attacks on how I'll provide for my parents (retired na sila by graduation) or maybe just simply land a job that is not a call center job (hindi sa minamaliit ko mga call center agents, my brother used to be one when he was a fresh grad and mad respect for call center agents) gusto ko lang Kasi magamit din ung mga natutunan ko sa school and more importantly to learn more in the industry. 

Sabi samin usually ng mga seniors Namin back in the day was ung mga natutunan Nila sa college ay not even 10% of what they learned within the industry. So as early as now I want to invest in myself by learning new languages or skills to make me more competent. Pero as much as possible I do really want to have a dev job but my brain just wouldn't cooperate haha. Medyo mag deviate na ata ako sa main topic and so let me ask again. Ano pa nga ba ang pwedeng entry level jobs(or internships avail Kasi mag kakaron na kami OJT next sem) na pwede for fresh grads or incoming fresh grads asides from the streotypical ""coder, developer, software engineer, etc."" 

I remember my favorite prof once said that don't ever give up on your course, Hindi porket Bobo or mahina ka mag code Wala ka na pag asa sa industry. Ako Bobo ako dati tres lang sapat na pero nalaman ko andaming options sa field natin. He is now a database administrator for a company with a huge pay but still teaches part time for kicks daw and to give back towards the students because he wanted to be a prof he always dreamt he had.

Sorry for the long post but I'd really appreciate it if you guys answer or just simply share your own insights/stories about the IT industry. You don't really have to be from the industry kahit mga hearsay lang will do. I really love it when I hear other people's opinions whether it be aligned with mine or not."

I have a difficult CSCareer question I was hoping people could give me some personal insight or advice into helping me make the best decision for myself,

I am a final year Computer Science student in the UK at an average University, I managed to get a summer internship with a large bank in the UK last year and got a grad job offer at around £40k+ a year starting in July.

Even though I have this amazing opportunity I thought I would be amiss if I didn't apply to Oxford and Cambridge for their masters programs, I always felt like applying to the big 4 I was immediately blacklisted because I am not from a prestigious university and my end goal has always been working in a company such as Google or Microsoft and those universities would certainly give me a leg up in that area, as well I have a 90%+ average grade between 1st and 2nd year with a 95% average in my 1st semester of 3rd year so I felt well on track academically so I might as well just throw an application out their, no harm in it.

I just found out I managed to get into Cambridge, I'm blown away, I done an interview and thought it went okay but didn't expect to actually get in. Now I put myself in this situation I have to decide what is better for my future prospects, to take another year of education and go to Cambridge, boost my overall application and maybe help myself get into some jobs that were previously out of reach or go work at the bank I worked so hard to get into in the first place and finally get my foot in the door on my actual career.

This might be an easy decision for some of you and I'd love to understand why that is because I feel like I got blinkers on and I need some outside opinions to help me on this important decision."

mod6kf,0,2021-04-10,How should I proceed?,Turdhoarda,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mod6kf/how_should_i_proceed/,"Hey all, I’m in the process of getting my computer science degree.

I’m not sure how I should proceed in building up a portfolio or applying for internships. I’ve taken Python and JavaScript so far but I don’t feel terribly confident in my programming skills. 

When I look at the requirements for internships and jobs, it’s quite daunting to see a long list of required knowledge or experience.

So I feel like I’m stuck in the loop of not enough experience for an internship but I can’t get an internship for that experience. How would I work on little side projects or build experience and practice?

Additional information: 
I also live in a state that less tech savvy (Kentucky) which makes it harder to apply locally."
modete,1,2021-04-10,About to get a job and become semi-homeless,ThrowAWay_woodblock,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/modete/about_to_get_a_job_and_become_semihomeless/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I’m not sure of this belongs in r/Advice, but I am seeking advice so...

Since 2013 I’ve been underemployed and spent two years unemployed. It completely devastated my finances. I finally managed to get into a good university, and now I’m a MUCH older college grad, with a new family, and a decent GPA. Over the years I’ve managed to pay the bills with odd-jobs, loans, and some contracting. Since 2013, my credit plummeted, and, although I never declared bankruptcy, things got harder and harder. My parents and my in-laws are not supportive — or, more accurately, are extremely unpredictable with their support, which is rare and infrequent.

I live in family dorms on campus, and that will come into play in a bit.

I got a job! Yay! So not all is bad, and I start soon after I graduate. I’m going to be a software engineer at a pretty well-known company.

But due to not keeping up in school, I made the hard decision to quit all work and focus on school. This means of have no work history for the post nine month since my internship. 

I’m made another tough call, and pulled out all my (pitifully small for my age) retirement to pay down most of my debts, and this vastly improved my credit score, back into the “good” range. 

But now I have great credit, and no savings.

My offer letter also has a contingent clause, which has been met, but creditors, loan officers, and rental property owners all see it and basically decline negotiations. Many ask for three months of pay stubs as an alternative, but I don’t have that.

I was actually trying to be extra financially responsible and buy an Airstream to live in as a Tiny Home until I can save more for a down payment on a house, but even that loan is held up due to a contingent clause on my offer letter. (Contingent on a normal background check, which is completed and came back clear. ... So, in my humble mind, the contingency is now null — not so, apparently.)

In another bizarre twist of events, I was approved for a mortgage loan by a very good lender, BUT, due to the amount of houses that are being bought with cash by people moving in from out of state, and people with the ability to offer $5k, $10$, $40k above appraisal, I’m effectively shut out of the market, due to no savings, but great credit.

Because I live in family dorms on campus, I will be evicted at the end of May, when my license to live there expires. Because I paid a “licensing” fee to the university for my dorm for the last four years, some rental apartments don’t consider it a rental history.

Thus, I’m stuck with living in a hotel or Airbnb for the next three months or longer, despite a good job, until I can save enough or provide three months of pay stubs. So I’m not homeless, but it feels terribly, horribly precarious.

HR seems incredulous, like, it’s just so easy to find a place — I think so to, in normal circumstances, so I don’t know why this is happening.

I’m terrified of the stress of this negatively affecting my performance at work, and that it’s such a bizarre situation, it won’t be believed.

Any advice out there? Insight? Has anyone gone through something similar and has a lesson to share?

PS. The company that hired me is wonderful, and I think they’ll work with me if I make the situation more clear, but this is all incredibly humiliating. My parents and my in-laws just make fun of me for being a loser. And the in-laws are super racist, accusing me of breaking or stealing their crap all the time. Everyone keeps encouraging my wife to divorce me too, so this is all immensely stressful.

*TL;DR*: Main point up front, I’m about to graduate and start a job as a software engineer at a well-known company, but I’m stuck with living in a hotel for the next three months. I’m trying my hardest not to let that happen because it will be very expensive. My offer letter isn’t any good for financial obligations because of a contingent clause in it requiring a background check, which is completed and clear. However, the remaining presence of the clause makes all lenders and rental property owners decline negotiations. I also don’t have three months of pay stubs, because I’m a full-time student. Help?"

I used to go to he’s discussion section during early in the semester and then switched to another section. 

But ever since then, he has been sending me multiple friend requests and messages on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and snapshot. He keeps trying to ask me how I am, what have I been up to, and what courses I am taking. He would even go off on several messages about the internships he received this summer. During ever encounter, I try to be as nice and polite as I can to let him know I am busy and not interested in socializing. I tried to avoid him as best as I can by not replying but he has never stopped messaging. I would get notifications 2:00am in the morning when I would try to be sleeping. He even sent me private post once on the piazza course.

Last week, I started blocking him but then I saw him make multiple additional new accounts just to message me again.

Worst of all, I began noticing that he would show up in all my breakout rooms for homework parties. He wouldn’t be helping other students, he would just be staying quiet most of the time and making few remarks with the other GSI. You may think this may just sound like a coincidence but whenever I switch rooms he would follow me to the very same room. This has been happening 4x in the last week.

I tried my best to not provoke or get him to be angry but at this point I honestly feel totally creeped out and scared.

I am trying to find resources on campus to make a report about this because I don’t know whether to send a direct message/email to the professors (because they barley respond) or the course staff because I do not know who knows him/friends with. I don’t want other students involved, only professional representatives to address in the situation. 

I don’t want mention the course specifically here because I don’t want to attract attention. I just want to be able to maturely move on from this issue as best as I can. I am already stressed by the workload for this semester and I don’t want more anxiety in my life. I spent all week last week crying because of how horrible things have been lately with trying to find a job, family, and school. My mom recently got laid off and my dad has been juggling multiple things. I don’t want to tell them about this because I don’t want them to be even more stressed with their lives. 

I’ve only told one of my best friends about this because I needed someone to talk to. She said I should just go straight to the police at this point. 

I would appreciate if anyone could help me find the right department to address this to. I have sent only 2 emails (student affairs and eecs department) but haven’t heard any responses."

I have just one exam left, and i complete my studies at the end of April (April 24th last exam). I didn't take any co-op or internship while i was studying in school because many of my friends who took it said that it wasn't necessary to participate in to land a job. Also a part of me just wanted to get in the work force as soon as possible and finish my studies as fast as i can. I have numerous projects on my GitHub that i am passionate about and spent multiple hours on and would be willing to use those on my resume. I wanted to know if anyone had any tips and/or ideas for students who are creating a resume without any professional tech experience. I'm interested in either web development and/or data analysis with python. I will share my Github profile here for your reference of my coding skills. I have a strong passion for programming and can't picture myself doing anything else in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Inn addition, i have lots of projects from my school assignments (Parallel computing assignments, web development (made a simple version of a reddit using php, java, html, css) and even my capstone project which is a full stack project that me and my group worked for a span of 8 months. Are these valid projects that i can add to my resume, or is that considered 'School Material'. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also if your wondering why i'm so late to apply to jobs, its because mentally the pandemic has taken a load out of me and i couldn't find the courage to apply before, so i kind of pushed it off to wait until closer to graduation, so i can focus just on school and not worry about interviews while studying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear from people who have gone down a similar road as me, and would love to hear any and all tips you have for me. [https://github.com/PamalM](https://github.com/PamalM)

**Product**

Job board where US companies (mainly SMBs, start ups, and investment firms) can post job posts for Financial Analysts, Associates, Interns, etc... And top quality candidates from LatAm can apply to those jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value proposition**

US/European companies can hire great talent, with higher experience and way lower cost, than if they were to hire a local employee. At the same time, candidates from LatAm get better salaries.

Also, we will vet all candidates, to make sure companies are not wasting their time interviewing low quality candidates (i.e. english level, working experience, education, etc...).

**Revenue model**

Pay per post.

&amp;#x200B;

Would you be interested in hiring someone through our platform? What would concern you? Why do you think this would't work?

We'll be launching in two weeks.

Appreciate any kind of feedback!"

I'm looking for a summer internship but haven't been too successful so far as I'm bad at interviews. I've worked hard on getting better by mocking with friends of all experience levels and 2 career counselors at my school. I used to fail all first rounds, but now I get to final rounds most of the time. Now I just need to pass some final rounds.

I was planning to graduate in Fall 2021 so that my internship, if I got one, would convert to a full time job, potentially, but my dad was pressing me to graduate in the summer to save money on tuition and housing.

FWIW my parents don't have any knowledge about recruiting cycles or how to get a job after college nowadays and won't really listen to me at least, so I was going to get my cousin (who graduated from the same college in 2018 and works in a related field) to convince them to let me stay for the fall. 

My parents are 1st gen Chinese immigrants, and I was born here, so I'm second generation. 

And even if he didn't manage to convince them, at least I'd have someone as a third party in the talk.

However, I'm pretty nervous about the conversation. I feel like they will be respectful towards my cousin because they think he's a mature, informed adult, but they'll probably be awful to me afterwards.

Awful afterwards as in:

* My dad will likely say:
   * “You’re an ungrateful piece of shit about finances; we work so hard, you saw your mom staying up until 1 AM to work, no need to pay extra money to waste time in school because you suck at interviews.”
   * “Why would staying until Fall 2021 guarantee you have anything better? You couldn’t even get an internship so don’t you think full-time jobs will be harder to get? What if you end up empty-handed again after the fall and we paid extra money for nothing?
   * “Even when you get hired at some low-playing place, your coworkers will call you eccentric and that’s just a nice way to say you’re weird. Also, you don't do any chores at home so you'll probably be fired for being lazy.""
   * ""I don't care what happens to you after college. We'll pay until August and if you don't get a job after, that's your fault and you are on your own."" 
* Mom will likely say:
   * “I told you that you have bad social skills. I bet that’s why you didn’t get any offers after your interviews. You never talk to us about your life; that’s why you have bad social skills and your bad social skills are why you’ll never get hired at any high-playing place.”
   * “I knew you were an unlikeable person. I bet when you interview they can see you’re a bad person, and that’s why they don’t want to hire you. Look at the way you treat us. I never treated my parents the way you treat us, even when we disagreed. You’re just a really tragic kid who is disrespectful, and I bet the interviewers can sense that you will treat your bosses just as badly, and that's why they reject you.”
   * “X, your cousin, got offers at Google. X's dad knows someone who interned at Facebook. The Facebook kid didn’t always get A’s but he loves \[the school I attend\] and that’s why he succeeded. Moreover, X’s classmate at Stanford got an offer from BCG. All of those people succeeded so I don’t understand why you are struggling so much. You probably just have a bad personality, are too awkward and shy, and have and no skills.”

So yeah. I have a therapy appt Tuesday, so I'm going to talk about this with her, but I was wondering if anyone who knows what Asian parents are like can relate and/or help with some comebacks I can say."
mofusa,18,2021-04-10,Do I choose Cambridge or start my career in CS?,AintItDifficult,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/mofusa/do_i_choose_cambridge_or_start_my_career_in_cs/,"Hi guys,  
I have a difficult dilemma I was hoping you could help give me some personal insight or advice into helping me make the best decision for myself,

I am a final year Computer Science student in the UK at an average University, I managed to get a summer internship with a large bank in the UK last year and got a grad job offer at around £40k+ a year starting in July.

Even though I have this amazing opportunity I thought I would be amiss if I didn't apply to Oxford and Cambridge for their masters programs, I always felt like applying to the big 4 I was immediately blacklisted because I am not from a prestigious university and my end goal has always been working in a company such as Google or Microsoft and those universities would certainly give me a leg up in that area, as well I have a 90%+ average grade between 1st and 2nd year with a 95% average in my 1st semester of 3rd year so I felt well on track academically so I might as well just throw an application out their, no harm in it.

I just found out I managed to get into Cambridge, I'm blown away, I done an interview and thought it went okay but didn't expect to actually get in. Now I put myself in this situation I have to decide what is better for my future prospects, to take another year of education and go to Cambridge, boost my overall application and maybe help myself get into some jobs that were previously out of reach or go work at the bank I worked so hard to get into in the first place and finally get my foot in the door on my actual career.

This might be an easy decision for some of you and I'd love to understand why that is because I feel like I got blinkers on and I need some outside opinions to help me on this important decision."
mofyh4,31,2021-04-10,My mom’s conspiracy theories and right wing politics have progressively gotten worse and it’s ruining what little that’s left.,honeyturtle2091,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/mofyh4/my_moms_conspiracy_theories_and_right_wing/,"Hi, 

I’m an American in a Blue state. My parents voted for trump in 2016 (I wrote an entire thing about this in my post history) and I hate that his platform has allowed their racist, homophobic, transphobic, and islamophobic colors to fly freely. 

Especially my mom. She no longer holds back on how she thinks George Floyd is a shit bag thug high on drugs who caused chaos in Texas and asked for it, how COVID isn’t as bad as it is, how masks and vaccines don’t work, how Biden is a pedophile, the deep state, how cancel culture is Marxist, how BLM just wants to murder people, and mainstream media. I remember when I first told her police kneeled on a man and he died, she gasped in horror! Until she found out the victim was black. Then she didn’t give a fuck. 

As someone who works in healthcare and has seen COVID UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, I’ve felt insulted and aggravated for the past year because of people like her. She however, doesn’t even work let alone have stepped foot in a place to see for herself the frontline work being done and what people are going through. I chose to get the vaccine and she believes that Bill Gates is in on micro chipping everybody and controlling them with 5G later on. And how cotton swabs that are being used for COVID tests are made in China and may have pre-planted viruses on them that will get into the person as the swab is being taken then take control of their brain. 

The list of conspiracy theories goes on and on. Denying even questioning whether the Colorado shooting actually happened. Or saying that it’s because Biden bombed Syria, where the shooter was born even though the US has been doing so for years. She literally can’t get enough of right wing media. Whether she’s eating, cooking, cleaning, doing other chores, etc. she has her phone in front of her reading right wing news pages or whack conspiracy Youtube videos playing out loud in the background. She loves to rant to my dad about all this or how social media is turning kids transgender and it’s a crisis. My dad and I haven’t talked since last may over an argument over BLM and he doesn’t give a shit either. 

Best of all, she keeps saying that lockdown has “made people depressed and rates of child abuse have gone up”. *OH NOW SHE CARES?* When she’s literally been the core of my and my sister’s depression for a decade and was physically and is emotional/mentally abusive now.  

Regarding anti-Asian violence, she’s mad but for the WRONG reason: “Americans are mad at the Chinese and since they can’t tell us Asians apart, they just attack any Asian they see” - insinuating that Chinese people actually *deserve* the hate and violence and all other Asian ethnicities are just the collateral damage.

With all this, her conditional “support” relies on her political beliefs. Want the vaccine? I’ll rescind my offer of when I said I’d help you with ______. Believe in AOC and Bernie? I’ll withdraw what I said about helping with tuition because higher education brainwashes kids into being liberals - even though my entire K-12 was spent obsessing over grades which became my identity and measure self worth. I got a B+ once in a group project where I was the only one who did work and she called me a dumbass. 


She’s not my mom. We literally just argued last week where she turned a topic into how “kids should be nice to their parents” and did her smirk trying to get a dig at me. I said “Yea when it’s a healthy relationship, then yes. But when your parent literally says they never wish they had you and wish they’d held your nose so you’d suffocate and die and thrown your body into a trash bag, or said that they regret ever given birth to you, then no. They don’t have to be submissive and listen to everything their parents say no questions asked”. 

In the end, I know I’m just a horrible child. Other people (my psychiatrist, therapist, advisor) have even wondered. I’ve literally listened and gotten good grades all my life, recently graduated with a 3.95 GPA, 2 degrees (one with honors), 2 minors, a certificate, was able to secure a great FT position with good benefits that starts soon, have never gotten in trouble with the law (not even a speeding ticket), never done illegal drugs or weed, worked my ass off at internships and part time jobs, volunteered, tried my best to maintain friendships and promises, try to save most of my paycheck, and help guide my sister when she comes across something I’ve done before (ex: school, personal, medical) that my mom can’t help with. 

Isn’t that what most parents want? Or maybe I’m wrong. Idk. Parents of kids who barely passed and scraped by to get their degree because they couldn’t care enough are more proud than my parents ever will be of me. I’m trying my best to live life how I want to and work towards being self-sustaining, but she makes me feel like I’m just entirely wrong as a human being and everything I do is inherently wrong."
mogmgv,12,2021-04-10,Should I Switch Back to Decent CS School and Delay Graduation + Pay More?,Most-Aggravating,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mogmgv/should_i_switch_back_to_decent_cs_school_and/,"Hey all.

I was going to a top-50 CS university, but once Covid hit I got frustrated at the quality of the courses. It felt like I was paying $7k a semester to be told to go to W3Schools or read a Java textbook, things I was already doing on my own. So I looked around and found some no-name  (but at least accredited) online university and transferred into their undergrad CS program.

I am concerned this is going to hurt later because the school is embarrassingly unknown. I was able to land three internship offers for this summer, two small companies and one F100 financial company. But I know I only got the finance company interview because I had been going to a good school. They almost rescinded the offer when they found out I had switched. The other two knew I was at the no-name school from the start.

My question: should I switch back to the better school? Doing so would delay my graduation by about 9 months (Dec 2022 instead of March 2022) and cost at least an extra $20k. Or should I just finish here and see what happens? I am pretty self-motivated, do a lot of LeetCode, have a few side projects, and I think I interview relatively well. I'm just concerned I won't even get interviews for new grad roles.

Thanks for any advice!"

I got As in the classes that matter (Math/Calc/Physics/Biochemistry/Astronomy/etc.). I had quite a few Bs and 2 Cs RIP

\- Flyins: Programs from quite a few colleges/universities to invite URMs to learn more about their school (usually in person although all were virtual due to the pandemic). I attended Harvey Mudd's, Swarthmore's, Tufts's, Rice's, and Caltech's flyin

**Final thoughts and school choice**

I knew that this would be crazy uphill battle. My stats are quite low for t20s so I tried to compensate by  doing my best when it came to my ECs and Awards. For the most part, I would say I enjoyed my experiences and didnt really do any ECs ""for college."" If Im being honest though, I did not realize how important stats were until the beginning of my junior year, so I really changed my approach to school.

Now to comment on this application cycle, I have one word to describe it: BRUTAL. I hate to call flyins a ""guaranteed acceptance"" because it really isn't. And at least for this year, a lot of schools probably accepted more applicants to their flyins because it was virtual and they can host more people. However when I got rejected from all but one of the schools I did flyins at, I knew that I was in for a wild ride.

I honestly still am shocked with how competitive this cycle season was. I am a Questbridge finalist and I shotgunned \~20 reaches because I wanted to make sure I would not have to take out loans for my undergraduate education. I understand I got really lucky to get accepted to Vanderbilt with a full ride, and to be honest I still do not understand how it happened considering how much they care about stats (and stats were definitely the weakest part of my application). At the moment, I am still debating between UIUC and Vanderbilt, but Ill edit this post when I make a decision.

To future applicants, definitely make sure you have solid stats (GPA and ACT/SAT). Also, really do things that you enjoy for ECs, it is alot easier to write about and show that you are passionate about it.

To the Class of 2021, we made it. It was definitely one of the most brutal, if not the most brutal application cycle in history. I am so glad we finally get to graduate high school and move on to college. Wish all of you the best, and remember that no matter where you go, you are awesome 😎"

**Bentley University** \- $43k/year

Pros - Business focused, located near Boston, just a really cool sounding environment, not too expensive, honors program

Cons - Not good with name recognition, I've heard the students are kinda snobby, not known for like school spirit and stuff

&amp;#x200B;

**Binghamton University** \- $25k

Pros - On the cheaper end, classic college experience, not too far from home, really popular with kids from my HS

Cons - Not very well-known job placement wise, in the middle of nowhere, student body stereotype is not the kind of people I like

&amp;#x200B;

**Marist College** \- $40k

Pros - Absolutely gorgeous, pretty good with internships, not far from NYC, good campus culture, honors program

Cons - Not in the best area, no name recognition, business isn't a priority there

**Northeastern University** \- $50k

Pros - Amazing co-op program, dual major in business and compsci, in Boston (my fave city in the world), has the vibe I'm looking for, good ranking and recognition, honors program

Cons - Gets a lot of hate (especially on this sub), would probably graduate in 5 years

&amp;#x200B;

**Rutgers University** \- $37k

Pros - Honors College benefits and dorms, pretty good with recognition and stuff, where my parents want me to, my family's moving so I'd get in-state tuition after like the first year, school spirit

Cons - Really big, oddly set up (I'd have to take a bus from where the HC dorms are to where the Business school is), too close to home

&amp;#x200B;

**St. John's University** \- $17k

Pros - Cheapest option, my sister goes there and my mom went for undergrad and grad, close to the city

Cons - zero name recognition, way too popular in my high school (known for literally just being a repeat of what my high school was), kinda makes me feel like I'm settling

&amp;#x200B;

**Stevens Institute of Technology** \- $44k

Pros - Good location, one of the few schools I was able to visit, good co-op program, nice vibe, pretty good ranking and name

&amp;#x200B;

**UMass Amherst** \- $35k

Pros - On the cheaper end, great school spirit and vibe, I was able to visit and I liked the campus, in a good location, good dorms and food

Cons - Pretty big, not the most well known for business, doesn't have anything really drawing me in that much (I almost didn't apply)

&amp;#x200B;

**UMich** \- $64k

(I haven't heard about scholarships, not that I'm expecting anything, and I haven't heard from Ross yet)

Pros - Highest-ranked school on the list, best school spirit, student life, in a perfect college town, good alumni network, my college counselor insists its the best choice, I just love it so much

Cons - Farthest from home, job options are more based in Detroit which isn't where I wanna be, if I don't make Ross I'd have to major in economics, probably the most expensive

**Letters of Recommendation**

English Teacher: (7/10) She really liked me as a student and we shared a lot of anecdotal moments. However, I never really took the time to develop my relationship with them. That being said, I was one of the few letter they wrote, so I believe that the essay was of extremely good quality.

AP US History Teacher: (4/10) This teacher is probably one of the most popular teachers at our school, so he basically just copy-pastes information that you give him on a document. He was basically a last minute resort because none of my other teachers would be able to write a decent essay; he was basically a filler.

Music Teacher: (9/10) Being the only teacher that had me for all 4 years, I believe that they were able to capture my personal growth and also speak to my leadership abilities and growth in class. They know me by name and weren't afraid to make conversation despite the fact that we aren't close.

Counselor: (5/10) I think all counselor essays aren't that good, but I had good conversation about my college goals so I believe the essay was most likely of better than average quality.

**Interviews**

I rejected every single interview offer that was offered/given.

**Essays**

My personal statement was strange in the sense that it talked about my experience coming to understand my gender identity through dance, ethnic heritage, and school environment. I spent significant portions of time brainstorming, but had someone help that basically stitched together 3 of my essay ideas. In total, I probably spent around 30 hours writing my personal statement.

My supplement quality varied significantly with some being written in an hour and other being written over a month. I would say, however, that being honest and revealing is what all of them had in common.

I would love to go to gt even though it’s business school isnt ranked as high as unc mostly bc instate tuition plus the city would be really great for internships. but uh i got waitlisted lmfao 

unc is ranked really high but i feel like it’s in the middle of no where and internships are pretty important for my major. 

uga honors is really good too. I might go to uga for a year and then transfer to tech? (i have automatic conditional from legacy) But I feel like having a full 4 years at one school would be great. I don’t want to have to remake friends in my sophomore year when everyone already has friends.

momiiy,303,2021-04-11,Journey of a underperforming IITian,FailureMehta,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/momiiy/journey_of_a_underperforming_iitian/,"You are the typical small town kid, topper of your school, 'smart'. Your parents, your teacher, basically everyone except you knows you want to be an engineer or a doctor. You come to know of that and you decide that you want to become an engineer because ""I  can't draw"". Quite logical conclusion, right?

Your pass your boards with ""flying colors"", and you come to know about the rat race for JEE. You join a local coaching because some uncle advised you about how his sister's husband's niece got into IIT by studying there. You slog through school during the day, go for your coaching classes in the evening. Your friends are unmotivated, you start to question yourself too but there's always a ""Jeetu Bhaiya"" in every coaching who somehow catches you every time you fall.

You start to hate Chemistry, bitch about how it's not logical, and decide to leave inorganic altogether. Somewhere between Irodov, Cengage and OP Tandon, you somehow scrape through your boards, and get an average rank, not good enough for the old 5 but not bad enough for a drop.

You join an evergreen branch at an IIT, &amp; you are out of your comfort zone for the first time. Your roommates have been coding since school, while you take a whole month to understand pointers. Your self-confidence takes a hit. The unlimited wifi, skidrow and dc++ become your best friends. Why waste time with PoR and coding, everyone gets a job. The single digit average package is good enough, you reckon. You get a department slide, ""life set bro"".

The first year ends, and the juniors are here. But fuck, what do you tell them when they ask you about the things in college? You get withdrawn more, your wing-mates find new friends. Depression hits hard, your grades drops below 8, and you are too afraid to go to the counsellor. Your plan to do coding remains a plan.

Third year, and the rush for internships start. BT khatam, andha paisa flood your Facebook feed. Meanwhile, you're learning about bubble sort and hoping for a miracle, though you know deep down what the result will be. Third year's almost over and you 'land' an intern in a small firm, where you have 'commission for every sale you make'. You feel shitty talking to your friends at Microsoft and Google, but hey! Atleast you have something to write on your CV.

Final year, and you decide to learn coding in 30 days. The results - you can guess. 1st placement season ends, you are one of the few remaining unplaced in your branch. 2nd placement season starts, you fake a few projects, you get a job at small startup. Convocation, and countless promises for reunions later, you are finally a graduate.

You are at your office, and waiting for the termination letter that would come anyday soon. So, you make a switch, without that big of a pay hike and the same cycle continues. CAT - 96.xx, 95.xx, you see a pattern and quit trying. Your batch group is filled with news of college acceptances, CAT results, marriages. Depression hits you again. You know you should make an effort, but it feels as if it's too little, too late. You leave the Whatsapp group, no one notices.

Talking to your parents feel like a chore, you avoid family reunions citing office work. The only notifications you get are your office mails.

Now, you are in your late twenties, with a drink in hand on a Sunday morning, and typing away this nonsense after Average Mishra's post. You get a message on your phone "" Sir, I am your junior from ... High School. Tell me how to get into IIT."" You laugh out loud.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - I was an exception. The vast majority of the IITians turn out fine. They are not overrated, atleast wrt Indian colleges.

I went through about 10 different ways to fix the issue but couldn’t come up with the reason. And then, when I went through my code for the 11th time at my wits end, I found the bug. It was right in front of my eyes the whole time! I put two functions in the wrong order!

How do I save all that time and just notice that simple mistake in front of me the whole time? Is there like a checklist you go through of potential quick solutions to try before trying a complex way to fix the issue?"

I go to school for computer science and I’m beginning to realize how I don’t want to work a 9 to 5 hour job in front of the computer, hours on end coding my life away. In high school I was so interested in coding even though I wasn’t good in it but still tried. Stuck with it to college where I thought I get my computer science degree and start my career doing software development earning a decent income. 
However college has been very challenging I didn’t come from a high school that prepared me for it very well. Yet after fighting to pass my classes and keep my grades up I’m now here on my final two semesters of college not wanting to do computer science anymore. I don’t really want to do a 9 to 5 or a job in which I’m stuck in a office all day. I also look back at the amount of debt college has been costing. I’m even taking an extra semester to finish my degree which means more loans. I took a ton of internships where I was in many different fields, I was a assistant research scientist in wildlife for high schoolers, I worked in corporate as a intern in a investment firm and I have even canvas in New York City for a summer. Out of all my experiences,  I hated corporate America, I loved the research job and learned a lot about communication from my canvassing job. 
But I seen that with my degree I would most likely work in corporate, or a similar setting and it’s kinda depressing thinking about it. My interest for coding has also fallen as the years go by. I realize from my research job I loved moving around and loved the environment. It is by far the most fun I ever had in a job and I was getting paid for it (best summer ever)I really hate how I never pursed a career in that field, the Ecology field. That was the only 9 to 5 I loved doing. So now I’m stuck I want a career where I’m able to move around and be active as well as use my head. 
Since the pandemic started I lost my part time job but ive been collecting unemployment, since I’m saving most of it I think I should use it to invest in myself. So since I love working out and going to the gym so I started a fitness page (hopefully I can find a way to monetize it) and looking into personal training. I signed up to a subscription to a program to help start my business and a subscription to skillshare to learn more skills such as video editing, photo editing, design in general and marketing and whatever I find interesting and would be marketable in the job market. I started looking into stocks and have invested about 1000 dollars in the stock market since the money was sitting in my savings doing nothing.
I’m more of an arts and creative person than a technical person however I’ve never really seen a career that would pay well in that feild so I decided to pursue a career in coding thinking it was the best way to be creative and make money to support me and my family. Any advice I’ve considered dropping out of college and getting a trade but with the amount of debt I have collected and not knowing a trade I would pick up without paying for more school, I might as well get a degree out of it since I’m at the finish line. 
If I was to make a living with something I like I can keep working on it and keep building from it rather than get a job that pays nice and struggling to find motivation other than money to keep climbing up that latter. I want to find my purpose and grind to it."

moqif9,1,2021-04-11,I (21 F) am still sad about some traumatic things that happened years back and now I realised it's affecting my life. How to heal from it?,Hara2412,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/moqif9/i_21_f_am_still_sad_about_some_traumatic_things/,"I'm a 21 year old female. I have two elder siblings (31 M and 27 F). 

Till I was 10 years old, I have always felt like my family is the best. But when I was ten years old (in 2010), my brother had gotten an internship and my sister went out of our hometown for college. Obviously, I felt lonely. 

With them not in the home, my father forced my mother to resign her job. I was confused, and even blamed myself for not standing against him. Basically, he told her either to resign the job or to go out of the home. She loves her job and technically it would be easier for her now as both my siblings aren't living with us now. but within days, she resigned her job.

Even before this happened, my mom would always complain about his behaviour to us. At those times, I hated her since he was a super hero in my eyes. I stopped talking to him after she resigned her job.

My brother got married in 2012 to the love of his life and lived away from us.

In 2015,

My mom got another job offer from an acquaintance. It wss a good offer considering she took a career break of 5 years. I encouraged her now as much as I could and told her l will support her. When she told my father about the job offer, they started fighting infront of me. That fight ended with my father accusing my mother of cheating on him. Disgusted with my father's words towards my mother, I shouted at him to go kill himself. And I tried to commit suicide but didn't have the courage to do it.

Eventually we left home and discussed with her family. Everyone suggested that she goes back to him and urged her to think of my future. (We live in a small town in India, basically 'divorce' is unheard of here; even my mom thought of living away from him not divorcing him). As no one was supportive of her decisions, we eventually went back home. 
 
2017,

I went to college out of our hometown and was in a state of confusion for about a year. I didn't have any will to live anymore and tried to kill myself. (My family doesn't know about this) 

But then I met my awesome friends, who gave me new perspectives in life. I finally realised that I don't like what I'm majoring in. I also found that I'm extremely excited about languages (so far, I've know about 5 languages). So I'm planning to do something in linguistics side. I also do part time job doing translations.

Just when I thought every thing is going to be fine, Covid happens. Our college is closed and I'm forced to stay with my parents. My father has changed a lot from before but still they fight a lot. I realised that their relationship is basically very toxic and my mother is being submissive towards him. I found this entire situation very annoying. My both siblings basically has forgotten and forgiven everything he had done. But I just can't do that since I believe all those things are what started my depression.  

I became very depressed in middle of all this and locked myself in a room for majority of 2020. I spend all my time sleeping or binge watching dramas.  Still, I have to force myself to think about my career once I graduate this may. I wrote an exam for a government job. I passed the written test and my interview has been scheduled in September. For that I need to start preparing so that I clear their physical standards. But I just don't see the point anymore. I still think about suicide but then I want to live. 

How do I get over this emotional trauma?"

 This is a confession... as I have never talked deeply about this to anyone. I do understand that similar questions must have been asked to you before, but well, another selfish human here! I am in my mid 20s, and graduated with a tech degree in the US during covid's 04/2020. I am from another country, a small village in fact. I scored top of my class in high-school, and in the past few years at University achieved scholarships, international internship, top leadership roles with average grades. I am healthy and competitive and I work out. Did a little athletics too.   I must say that I meditate every now and then. I am very grateful for the life I have. My friends would describe me as a decent and grateful being.

Now I have a job with a startup where I just got a small raise too because of my accomplishments. As a kid I always loved AI, robotics and maybe that's why I went to University for CS. But as I grew up, I fell in love with music. I practiced 7 years straight and it was great. That is why I came to the US in hopes of making it big. But I was told music won't pay my bills.

Now the truth is that I do not know what am I doing with my life. I am racing against time. I compare myself to people who are super successful launching startups at 20. And obviously I'm guilty of watching all sorts of motivation, just do it, etc. YouTube videos. I know it's all about putting in work and not making posts on the internet but I am genuinely feeling lost. Oh and here is a small detail. *Immigration*. As a foreign student my options are limited to working in the field I graduated in and I only have 2 years before a company decides to keep me in the country. . And while my company would like to apply for a H-1B a foreign worker visa, I want to be at the FANGs or best tech companies if I decide to stay in tech. 

I am ready for any criticism or feedback. But I can reassure you that I understand it is important to take life step by step and be thankful for what I have. That is something I do understand. I genuinely want to make a lasting impact from my life and confessing that I do want to be rich(because I was born in lower middle class family), I want to be best in tech and business(because I was told I wouldn't make it) and I want to travel the world and make music and talk to people from other cultures(but my immigration restricts me). 

Sometimes I feel that these systems(universities, 9-5 jobs etc.) are just not made for me and I want to do something of my own. But I don't have a genius idea or grades to get into ivy leagues. So music, tech, business, masters degree? What should I even do when I haven't found my passion, or the so called purpose in life? 

My race is against time and I want to be the best and I put my heart and sweat into it. But now I am just demotivated settling down within the comfort of averageness and comfort.I really need some advice or I'm afraid I will burn out and waste my life not succeeding and making it big.Thank you in advance. "

**Extra Stuff:** I have a lot of really weird hobbies lol but idk if I should even mention them on my application but I like to build keyboards, make little metal models, 3D print and some other weird stuff Also taught a few other classes and IT department stuff

Sorry this a bit depressing, but I thought I'd throw my situation out there and see if any one is having a similar crisis or advice on working through one!

So, I am gradating in May with a business (marketing) and foreign language double major, as well as a secondary major and a minor and a certificate. I worked really hard in school, so have really high grades, several jobs, and have had a few internship experiences and studied abroad for a semester. On paper, my resume is pretty good. The only problem is I hate my (business) major and every time I look at marketing jobs I get super depressed and don't even apply to the types of jobs I should be looking at based on all the work I did during college. The German major jobs are generally not quite so miserable, but are more oriented towards politics and government, which are not really areas I find interesting. So, now I am getting closer to graduation with no job and no plans other than moving home and hoping something comes along.

I've never been lazy about working (I currently have 3 jobs), but the commitment of applying for and taking a miserable full-time business job for at least 1-2 years is completely turning me away. I have put so much work into my degree that I am also completely burnt out and feel like all of my work isn't paying off. I had partially stayed in the business school after kind of knowing I hated my major thinking I would make enough money to justify the torture, but it seems like even the ""good"" job offers really don't pay that much more than the entry level jobs for other majors.

On top of this, I spent so much time on academics, work, and college activities that I have very little sense of who I am or what I want to do-I am basically completely lost. I used to really enjoy art and think I would maybe like to work in the art industry, but I am hesitant to switch to any new major after spending all these years and coming out with options I hate (plus, no art program would accept me without a portfolio, which I don't have time to make). I am fortunate in that I was able to avoid graduating with debt, so do have a bit more freedom when it comes to changing careers down the road, but I am just kind of stuck and a little scared to make any changes or start graduate school without more of a direction.

Sorry to air my extensive rant out here, but I would really love any advice you can give me, even if it is just about how to figure out my interests a bit more!"

I was wondering if any of you lovely people would know of any places taking on the likes of myself. I was also looking at internships but from what i could see you need to be 2 years into your degree to be eligible. My CV doesnt have any real relevant experience in the programming field so thats another obstacle.   
Anything to get my foot in the door and start gaining experience would be absolutely perfect.

Thanks for any help! :)"

My school hasn't given us a single day off of the semester. Not a single one. ASU is just pushing through till May 1 to just end the year early for what reason? I have no idea.

I started an internship mid-semester and am going into my junior year, and have felt so damn overwhelmed because it's just a constant cycle of class and work and homework and its bullshit we weren't given anything. Guess this is how President Michael Crow treats us not to mention there's a fucking pandemic. I work partially at home and do all my zoom classes at home online so I'm cooped up in my room all day.

I have slowly began losing willpower to make myself do my assignments. All I want to do is just play video games because I get so much more satisfaction when I try my best to win in comp matches.

I have roughly less than 3 weeks left, but feel like I have no steam left in me. I try and see that I am a lucky person to be in college and I am grateful for this opportunity, but I am feeling a ton of the societal and psychological impacts right now.

Do you all have any thoughts on how I can get myself out of this slump?"

1. ***Debate*** (handful of awards listed in awards/honors section, taught bunch of students debate, youngest were like 9 and oldest were HS freshman. couple students broke at national tourneys)
2. ***Business*** (founded + filed. content production + digital strategy company. we actually ended up LOSING money (as of right now) b/c all services became free after COVID started, which is when clients started to pour in (who doesn't want free services. overall good outreach &amp; impact. Raised some money (sub-$10k for good causes).
3. ***Music Production*** (classical composer + music producer. started composing at 9 because I guess I have bad muscle memory, kept messing up on piano &amp; violin. Got tired and decided to make my own music. a couple professional orchestras in my city, my HS orchestra, and a couple youth orchestras in my city have debuted my classical works. i started producing alt-r&amp;b + rap music around 12.

I did more ECs than the 10 I listed above, but most of them were short-lived stints (failed startup, library tutoring, etc) that I either a.) wasn't passionate about or b.) didn't have the time for. One thing I'm proud about for my ECs is that besides NSHS, I genuinely enjoyed everything that I did. I dropped stuff I didn't like to do.

**Awards/Honors**

Going to be very vague here because I've had doxxing issues in the past, if you PM me I'd be very very happy to expand on each + the process of how I got to each

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. Grouped 4 international forensics competition awards
2. Grouped 3 FBLA awards (nats, state. did not include regional awards)
3. Grouped 2 debate awards (VPF @ nat'l tourney)
4. Grouped like 4 state music composition awards from 2 different competitions
5. 2x Gold Presidential Volunteer Service Award (250+ hours for each)

*In additional info, I included the below. I also swapped order of the awards and which awards I included in the 5 I put in my CommonApp for each school. I sent only 1 update to all of my RD schools in mid-February.*

1. HYP Book Award (only submitted to that specific school)
2. Coke Semifinalist (only submitted to RD schools)
3. Like 3-4 other national / state music composition awards from different competitions
4. US Presidential Scholar Candidate (sent as update to RD)
5. 1 more debate award (international) sent as an update to RD

**Letters of Recommendation**

*Math Teacher: 5/10*

* Had this teacher for 3 years. Got good grades. No relationship outside of class. Probably a generic LOR that could make sense if you just replace my name with someone else's.

*Spanish Teacher: 8/10*

* Had this teacher for 3 years too. Got good grades. Very close relationship outside of class. Was NSHS officer &amp; she sponsors NSHS. Got to read the LOR.

**Interviews**

***TL;DR for Interviews: All my interviews were just normal &amp; nothing special (with the exceptions of Penn that was bad and Harvard which was good.) Did not receive an interview from Columbia, Duke, Stanford, Vanderbilt, or MIT.***

*Penn ED: 2/10* ***(Worst)***

*Harvard: 9/10* ***(Best)***

*Dartmouth: 6/10*

*Princeton: 7/10*

*Yale: 8/10*

*Northwestern: 7/10*

*Cornell: 7/10*

*Georgetown: 7/10*

**Essays**

*Personal Statement for Early Rounds: 3/10*

* Objectively shit essay that I wrote with very minimal outside help. Wrote about music as an Asian applicant in a very narrative way, leading to a super overdone essay that lacked personality &amp; introspection.
* Was confirmed to be a very bad essay by a number of consultants / students (lmao).

*Supps for Early Rounds: 4/10*

* Not much better. Lacked specificity for each school as well as a personal connection for Why essays.
* My UChicago &amp; Penn essays were especially weak, like a 2-3/10. Vandy, UMich, MIT, &amp; UVA were decent but not special, probably like a 5-6/10.

*Personal Statement for RD: 7-8/10*

* Non-traditional structure. Did not talk about any of my ECs. Super risky essay in my opinion but after my early deferrals/rejections I felt like risking it for an excellent essay was a better strategy than writing some mid-tier stuff.
* Not 9-10/10 because essays that are true 9-10/10s are on a different level. I'm still proud of what I wrote though!

*Supps for RD: 8/10*

* Again much better than early supps, much more specific and unique overall. Added personal connections
* Talked mostly about how my interests in social entrepreneurship &amp; music production aligned w/what the school offered, and how this alignment would hopefully be a positive contribution to the school + student body there
* No fancy structure or gimmicky responses like I did a little with my personal statement

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Georgia Tech (Stamps semifinalist \[didn't become finalist\] &amp; Dean's Scholarship semifinalist \[dropped out\])
* UGA ($12k merit award)
* UVA
* UMich Ross (admitted to Ross on 2/19, $22k/yr merit award)
* Georgetown MSB
* NYU Stern
* Vanderbilt w/Cornelius Vanderbilt scholarship

*Waitlists:*

* Northwestern
* Harvard
* Cornell
* Dartmouth
* Brown

*Rejections:*

* Penn Wharton ED
* MIT EA -&gt; Deferred -&gt; Rejected
* UChicago EA -&gt; Deferred -&gt; Rejected
* Brown
* Penn
* Yale
* Princeton
* Duke

**Additional Information:**

*Weaknesses:*

* Scattered ECs. I did a bunch of stuff, and it was really hard to try and create consistency in my application.
* Essays (for the early rounds). Most of those early round essays were really, really rough.

*Strengths:*

* Stats. I had high stats that helped me a lot with OOS publics &amp; merit scholarships.
* Can't really think of anything else. Maybe music composition is unique? 

*Final Thoughts:*

I think I should've realized much earlier that a large part of the college application process is just pure luck (living in a special geographic area, having the perfect EC that the school is looking for, etc). I realized that like a couple days before Ivy Day, which helped all of those rejections / waitlists not hurt so much. 

I will be attending Vandy this fall as a Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholar. Anchor down, baby!

If you have any questions, feel free to comment or PM. I have nothing to do and I'm still stuck on admissions mode (months of A2C addiction will do that to you) so if you want essays reviewed or applications checked then I'm happy to do it for free, too! As long as there aren't too many 😅"

I am almost 21 and have been coding since 2014 and consider myself an average programmer. I am currently unemployed and am looking for at least a part-time internship in any IT-related field (I am currently doing a degree in Software Engineering). I have added some of my projects to my GitHub, made a resume and CVs, and applied to many positions (over 50) to no avail.

I understand that I will get rejected a lot but the thing that confuses me is that one of my friends had 3 years of experience and managed to get a job fairly easily (only applied to 10 places and got in).

The main difference between me and him I see is that he is really focused on web development, just recently he started doing some C# programming (he often calls me for help). I have made personal projects in web dev, game dev, and normal application programming in C# and Java, I also know the basics of the bash terminal. Would it be better if I just started focusing on one area?

What would you suggest I change that would help me in landing an internship? I am really looking for ""hands on"" experience.

Many thanks :)"

Hello, I am almost 21 years old and I am currently doing second year of my three years Business Administration bachelor and I regret it.

When I applied for my university and degree, I was basically lost on what to do, due to a chain of tragic events happening around that time, and I was lured in by the thought that this bachelor offers so many different subjects that by the end of it I would be able to figure out how to procceed with career/life.

It was somewhat recently, first semester of the second year, that I realized I may want to do something in the sphere of data analysis(haven't chosen what particulatly). However, I feel like I have spent too much time on this degree and would rather finish it than have a 2 year gap of unproductiveness.

It hasn't been a smooth slide, thought. Coronavirus and personal circumstances led to me missing out on exchange programmes and internships. I feel like this will heavily impact me in job hunting later on.

I am now considering the possibility of taking a gap year after my bachelor to focus on mental health and acquiring some skills. For example, I saw that Google has recently released a data analyst certificate course that is being really recommended. 

However, I am to this day fighting my heavy procrastination (I am a bit worried I'm going to screw up my bachelor thesis like this, hopefully that does not happen). So I feel like if I take a gap year I would just waste it and have nothing to show for it, or at the very least not use that year effectively. Even so, I do not think that taking a job in my current state is my best option for now.

Should I take a gap year to focus on extra skills and mental health that has a chance of being a waste or search/take a job when I feel a little burnt out spiritually and have no interest in jobs that I can potentially apply for with my degree?

I may take a bit longer to respond since I am writing this post at night. Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance. :)"

* Computer Science B.S. at UC Irvine, 3.2 GPA

• 720 GMAT

Background

• Race / Nationality: white, U.S. citizen

• Gender: M

• Age: 30

Work Experience

Software engineer intern at a hot” niche startup, 4 years at well known, but non-FAANG tech company (Workday, ServiceNow, Zoom), 1 year at Series B fin-tech startup with upward trajectory. I recently quit my job (mental health), but am hoping to get back in the market soon. 

Extracurriculars

Sporadic. Couple of stints with Black Girls Code, and other similar outreach programs. Was a chair of my local Women's March back in 2017 and have worked with state and federal campaigns every election year, but no leadership roles in the last few years.

Post-MBA Goals

I'd be happy to stay in tech and work on the business-side of things, but would also like to consider consulting as well. Also have a few startup ideas that could be fun to explore during school.

School Choice

I'm between a mix of two years and one years. The Cornell Tech MBA is really appealing due to their entrepreneurial focus, and students I've talked to have all been very positive and it sounds like they're making some efforts to fix their OCR efforts. I'm throwing Stern Tech and Kellogg's MBAi program in the mix as well. 

As for other two years, I think Tepper and Anderson are fairly achievable. I'd be over the moon with Sloan or Haas, but that seems fairly unlikely unless I get my GMAT up.

Any other schools I should be shooting for or could be within reach with getting my GMAT up?

EDIT: 

Did I do something wrong? :("

UC app - these were definitely my favorite essays. 1. first essay I talked about getting last place in marching band, but it didn't matter bc we still beat our own goals. Also how I did the section leader stuff during quarantine. 2. the next essay I talked about loving rollercoasters and realizing how math can literally be the barrier between if we live or die on the ride or something. tied in my experiences with  science olympiad. 3. this one was a knockoff of my common app, except instead of being mixed I talked about how my embroidery shop showed me the beauty of weaving things together and nature's intricacies harnessed in bioengineering etc. 4. talked about the cultural club and people coming together

But the pay isn't that good and when I asked for a raise last summer this was not possible, just the regular 2-3% each year. I've argued that I have more tasks and have gotten bigger responsibility's over the years. Varies from Server maintenance to handling licenses. 

Started as an intern 4 years ago and worked my way up to Internal IT Engineer. I have no degree, only papers is the CCNA certificate I took 6 month ago in hope to get more attractive in the market.

January 2021 I started to look for jobs seriously. Every IT job that had my IT skills listed I applied for. Two months passed and nobody got back to me, I then hired professional CV writer to see if there was something I was doing wrong on my side. To this day I still haven't heard back from anyone. I feel there is plenty fit, 10-20 ads per month that have many of my skills listed as a requirement. 

Not sure what happened after covid, but it seems there is a lot of fish in the IT world and I'm at the bottom even after a few years experience in the field.

Appreciate any reply and tips on how to handle the situation. In short, I know I'm underpaid at current work and getting a raise in not an option for the company. Trying to move on but no IT firms"

I was most recently studying computer science in 2013 but since then have been working as a laborer. It's time to go back to school.

I've saved up $130,000 in retirement and cash accounts, most of it in Roth accounts so I will have the ability to draw on some of it it penalty-free for tuition and rent while I'm going to school.

I completed all or nearly all of my gen eds, most of the math requirements, basic physics and chemistry, mechanics and statics, technical writing, and a couple programming courses. I felt not-quite-cut-out for the higher-level math and theory required for Penn State's CS program but I still feel I have the capacity for some STEM work. I landed a programming internship in 2013 without any programming experience and somehow trudged through, though was not invited back when they learned I had dropped out of school. I didn't have much fun but I chalk that up to my health/mental health at the time. Non-STEM careers are on the table, too, but I imagine switching gears would require more work.

Making $30,000/year and living with my parents to save money has grown old. I want a job I can tolerate that will pay the rent and help me become similarly independent as my peers who all seem to be successful professionals, buying homes and starting families. My biggest fault is this: I do not have the capacity for endless stress and tend to burn out easily. If I can work an 8 hour day, leave my stress at work, and come home to recharge, I will be happy...so long as I'm making a little more than I am now. Honestly, $50k would probably be fine.

Penn State Berks is within commuting distance and I'm hoping to find something there that will work for me, but that's just one option. [https://berks.psu.edu/academics](https://berks.psu.edu/academics)"
mp09ty,3,2021-04-11,Should I Switch Colleges?,CobaltGecko9091,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mp09ty/should_i_switch_colleges/,"I cannot decide whether or not to switch colleges, mainly because I do not know what truly matters or not for the future. I am currently working towards a computer science major and a business minor. I have my tuition paid in full at either school, so money is not much of a concern here. To help people understand my situation, I'll lay it out in pros and cons.

Pros of The College I am at:

* Prestigious school with internship opportunities
* Have a scholarship for living on campus for free if I want to
* Classes are all within 5 minutes of me
* Lots of TA hours and professors open to giving help
* Small school experience, max 40 kids in a class, typically 20
* I do not have to drive here, I live here and can walk to any class

Cons of The College I am at:

* **Extremely** difficult
* Extremely stressful
* Toxic culture with students, and some professors
* Forced into many activities/events that I do not wish to attend
* Forced into a business minor which I do not want or enjoy
* Get kicked out for getting a C in any class
* Get kicked out for getting below a 3.2 GPA (currently have a 3.8)
* The college has program-specific classes with specific teachers that I cannot avoid, no flexibility
* I do not like it here, but it may be worth pushing through for its benefits

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of the College I could switch to:

* Much more freedom
* I can graduate a year earlier
* I can focus on just getting a computer science major, no business science major required
* I could get a master's in computer science here if I want to
* Much more class and professor flexibility

Cons of the College I could switch to:

* Not prestigious at all, I would not have a foot in the door for getting good internships
* A 25-minute drive to campus for any in-person classes, since I would likely live at home
* I may have to get a part-time job to afford a condo if the drive is too difficult
* Not as much TA or teacher support since I would not be in a special program anymore
* I might not like it here either, I won't know until I go

&amp;#x200B;

To me, this choice is hard because I do not know how the real world works completely. The average student here gets 20k more as a starting salary than the average CS student. Does this outweigh the pains of going here? I'd love some advice. Thank you"

I just joined the ITCareerQuestions community as i have heard it is a good place to get help regarding Information Technology queries. I am actually wondering which IT certifications should i pursue to give me a competitive advantage in the workplace after i graduate from school. 

Here is my story:-

I am an international student in the United States currently pursuing a graduate degree in Master of Science in Information Systems. I graduated with my undergraduate degree in business administration with a concentration in management information system (MIS) last year from United States as well. I didn’t have any loans since i had multiple scholarships and my family helped me pay the rest of remaining dues for undergraduate. Since i graduated during the pandemic, i decided it was better to just go ahead and complete my Masters as well since i was offered a full time assistantship which covered all my tuition and the GRE was waived. Now, i have about a year to graduate and i have decided to pursue some IT certifications so that i can hopefully get a decent job. (60-70k a year at-least)

In terms of experience, i have about 2 years of experience at the IT help desk on campus during my undergraduate studies. I know everyone will say that i should go and search for more jobs but just hear me out. As an international student, i am unable to work off campus as it violates my visa requirements in the US. I can only work off campus legally under CPT if i get an internship as long the job is related to my field, but most of the recruiters  don’t even want to take international students as interns because they know they will have to sponsor them after graduation. I feel like most of the time my resume is just filtered when they ask “ do you need h1b or visa sponsorship during job application process”This is why i decided that maybe having some certifications under my belt would be beneficial to me.

So, do you guys think i should just build a home lab and do projects  to show some experience or should i just get some industry standards certifications. I know CompTIA A+ would be useless since i already have 2 years of help desk experience. So do i go with Cisco’s CCNA, CompTIA Sec+, or Amazon’s AWS. I am interested in networking, security, and cloud. However, in school i am just learning mostly about data management, data visualization, and managing projects. I have experience with SQL, tableau, project management (waterfall, agile, scaled agile), sas enterprise miner, r studio, statistics. 

Any feedback would be appreciated. Also, i am sorry for my bad english since it is not my native language. Thank you."

Hey all,

My boss from the internship I worked in summer 2019 said he’s looking for someone to work that job this summer. I’m already committed to something else, so I figured this would be a good place to post. It’s in Norwood Massachusetts and you would be working for probably around $20-25 an hour doing either coding projects in Java or C#, or electrical engineering projects (depends on what you know) in the manufacturing division of a company called Instron. 

I had a lot of fun working here- if you’ll be in eastern Massachusetts for the summer / would be willing to relocate and want me to get you in contact with them, shoot me a PM!"
mp1igj,6,2021-04-11,Second thoughts on career choice from a graduating senior,No_Birthday_5018,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mp1igj/second_thoughts_on_career_choice_from_a/,"I'm graduating next month with a 3.9 as a finance major from a target school. I interned as a financial analyst at a FAANG this past summer, and I got and signed the return offer. The FT offer is a rotational at the headquarters, which is across the country from where I'm from and go to school.

Over the past few weeks, I started having some second thoughts about taking this job. I didn't particularly enjoy the work over the summer, but I  figured that was because it was virtual. I also never really ""enjoyed"" finance throughout most of college -- I was good at it and was encouraged to do it, but I thought tech was the future. That's why I decided to do this internship and ultimately sign the full-time offer: I saw it as the happy medium between tech and finance.

More recently, something in my head clicked. I'm taking two deal-oriented finance classes this semester, and I finally understand why people pursue IB/PE. For all my time at college, these careers never appealed to me so I never pursued it. I now think it would be better for me to start my career at a financial firm that services corporate clients, rather than being an in-house financial analyst. I can't shake the idea that I should start my career as an IB analyst, like so many of my classmates are doing. I know I'm at the tail end of my college career and that most recruiting has been done for months, if not a year or more.

I talked to a professor and he said I would be able to go from IB to FAANG, but the inverse isn't really an option without an MBA. Another professor suggested I do the rotational, then enter a deal team at the FAANG, and then I could get a VC job.

What do you guys think of the rotational? I don't want to be pigeonholed as a back-office finance guy for my career. Has anyone done a program like this/know anyone who has? Is VC realistic? Should I even bother looking for an IB or any other job at this point? Am I even allowed to renege on my offer (not sure if it matters, but I applied on Glassdoor, not through OCR)? What would set me up better for a top MBA down the line, should I choose to pursue that?

I would appreciate any input on this dilemma. I know that all things considered and in this economy I am extremely fortunate to have any job offer at all. I think the cross-country move is at least somewhat contributing to my cold feet, but I also want to make sure I'm setting myself up for the right career. Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you all in advance."

Background: 4th year (doing a 5th year) Purdue student (Big state school in Indiana, decent CS program, or so I’ve been led to believe) majoring in Physics with a CS and math minor. Pretty much done with the physics major and math minor, but taking an extra year to finish my CS minor and figure out what I wanna do professionally. I went to an uber shit rural high school where maybe 30% of my class went to college and I didn’t have access to good courses or teachers, so I had a limited scope of my options in terms of college major. Took AP physics and decided to major in it since I was decent in high school and enjoyed it. Low and behold I get to higher level physics courses in college and learn that it fucking blows, except for the programming required in my computational physics course. So I picked up a CS minor and here we are.

I’ve currently only finished the intro Java OOP course, finished with an A+ and feel like I’ve learned a decent bit. All your basic OOP stuff and a little taste of DS&amp;A and GUIs, made a simple calculator and a little knock off of basic MS paint. Also used Python to analyze data taken in physics labs, matplotlib and pandas mostly, as well as writing programs to compute physics simulations.

Now my questions:

1) Had an internship a few summers ago working for a department of energy contractor, nothing related to software. Was curious if having had an internship already, although irrelevant to my future interests, makes any difference for my future outlook?

2) I was curious how I should market myself to interviewers. I know there’s a decent bit of physics majors working in software dev roles but I’m unsure how they market themselves. Do I just pitch myself as someone adept in solving difficult problems, and in doing so developed critical thinking skills?

3) Had two interviews with a salesforce consulting company that I heard about through a friend and I’m waiting to hear back. If I don’t get that internship or any others that I happen to shoot for this summer what should I do instead? I was thinking doing some research that involves programming while I work part time at my job at Target, or should I just work on personal projects, or both?

4) If I’m just looking to get an internship in Indianapolis for whoever will take me, and not a FAANG, do I need to worry about leetcode? I have no aversion to it, just curious if it’s worth my time.

Thank you for reading! Sorry it’s a long read, just trying to sort myself out and this seems like the place to do it.

TLDR: Read title, skip to questions."

Parents each picked 1 college for me to apply to (can u guess which ones? Lol). Rlly crazy apps season. Visited all these schools (except USC), I did regret shotgunning at first but holy hell would you look at all those rejections! Unpredictable for the most part

Advice: Take advantage of schools with no app fees, fee waivers, etc, sometimes you can just email them explaining your situation./These 'top' schools have the best aid I realize now... (in-state for Rutgers and they didn't give me enough but 'elite' schools gave me full rides)

My mentality--this may be a tad arrogant , but I mostly met rejections with more confusion than disappointment (‘I’m special, so why did this school not want me?’) bc I think it’s important not to define yourself by their decisions , that no matter who says no or yes you’re still the same person(!)

I live in a very safe wealthy suburban town, I got SAT tutoring, my parents even hired this guy to do all our financial aid documents , so I am privileged enough to receive this help/resources. Kudos to those who had no access to things like this/were disadvantaged during this process, anyone applying to college next yr feel free to PM for help or to know more about my app/see essays/whatever! (Though I was unsuccessful for most schools so IDK how much help it’ll be lol)

Wondering if these same properties exist in Vue.js. I’d like to demo my findings to ours devs working on front end if they do.

I went to an unimpressive state school and got unimpressive grades: mostly B's with the occasional A or C. I had one mediocre internship that paid me $11/hour, but I took it as seriously as other people take their $40/hour internships and learned everything I could. I'm from a tech hub, which most people would kill for. But during my last semester of college, practicing Leetcode alongside my schoolwork was too stressful, and I couldn't keep up with the competitive interview processes. Living in a tech hub seemed to be working against me and making the job search more difficult than it needed to be. So I decided to start searching in the midwest, and often wasn't asked to do any coding questions at all. I was able to get a $70k offer in a LCOL area with only a very simple Leetcode problem, and one simple system design problem. It wasn't a great offer compared to other people, but it was enough money for me to do pretty much whatever I wanted.

I didn't last in that position long because of Corona, and my next job was for $75k in another LCOL area with a similarly easy interview process (even easier, no coding problems at all). It was for a big defense contractor, which this sub often shits on, but my experience there was awesome. I made a good salary, my mentor was helpful, and I was paid overtime on the few occasions I was asked to work more than 40 hr/week.

After a year of professional experience, I decided I wanted a better position, and started applying. Job searching has gotten progressively easier as I've added more experience to my resume, and this time it was a breeze. I only applied a handful of jobs, got a few interviews, and signed an offer I'm really excited about that pays $110k. I answered a lot of conceptual questions and a few Leetcode-style, but my anxiety about solving problems like that has really dissipated as I've gotten more professional experience. I literally *never* thought I'd be able to solve those kinds of problems, but it comes more naturally when you've been coding for longer, which isn't something I've never seen anyone on this sub say. After years of stress and self-doubt, I finally feel good about myself as an engineer. I'm ready to call myself a success story, and I did it without following any of the traditional advice I see on here.

This subreddit can be stressful, but I just wanted to remind students that there are a lot of ""average"" people in the middle of the spectrum, who don't work that hard and still have successful careers. Also, the shit you do in undergrad doesn't matter as much as you think it does. Just because your first job is mediocre doesn't mean you're locked into a life of mediocrity. I literally went from an $11/hour internship to a $110k salary in a year.

LMK if I can answer any questions!"

Some of the students are still in college, some have finished it and some are working in other fields (mainly engineering).

So most of them have yet to experience an internship in CS, but the final purpose of the program is to offer a paid internship by the time it ends.

I expect the group to have a very diverse base of programming knowledge, and be familiar with some OOP concepts, but perhaps to not know when and how to apply them to real life scenarios.

Any suggestions on important topics that are sometimes neglected by universities?
Also, suggestions on the format of the class? 
Should it be more hands-on than focused on theory or should it be the other way around?

If you are a recent grad, how would you like the class to be?"

Is there something like Spring Boot, that is able to take care that the used versions are compatible ?

I am getting my PhD in math this semester, and my research is in pure math (specifically functional analysis).  Early on in grad school, even though my interests were in pure rather than applied math, I realized that I needed to be ready to switch away from academia in case it didn't work out given its dismal job prospects + the fact that I was already starting a family.  So I did some internships along the way that gave me working experience with data analysis, programming, etc.

Fortunately, thanks to this experience, I got and accepted an offer for a sweet job in defense.  It is a signal processing engineering position and I will be working on stuff that actually relates well to my applied experience.  I'm pretty excited about it, but it's definitely going to be an adjustment for me in terms of acquiring other skill sets. For those of you who are already in the workforce, what sorts of tips would you give for people moving into this line of work who come from more theoretical backgrounds?  I already have some basic knowledge as described above, but what are some ways that I can more easily make this transition when I start my job?

During my time as an intern, I realized at some point that I wasn't always the most careful with how messy real world data is, and it took some time to acquire some more finesse.  In pure math we can play around with assumptions and keep things ""nice,"" but in the real world, one has to learn how to manage noise, uncertainty, imperfect data, all sorts of variables/ influences, etc., and understand the implications/ real world consequences of a mistake (especially for stuff related to defense, security, etc.)."

mp52yl,1,2021-04-11,Should I Switch Colleges?,CobaltGecko9091,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mp52yl/should_i_switch_colleges/," 

I cannot decide whether or not to switch colleges, mainly because I do not know what truly matters or not for the future. I am currently working towards a computer science major and a business minor. I have my tuition paid in full at either school, so money is not much of a concern here. To help people understand my situation, I'll lay it out in pros and cons.

Pros of The College I am at:

* Prestigious school with internship opportunities
* Have a scholarship for living on campus for free if I want to
* Classes are all within 5 minutes of me
* Lots of TA hours and professors open to giving help
* Small school experience, max 40 kids in a class, typically 20
* I do not have to drive here, I live here and can walk to any class

Cons of The College I am at:

* **Extremely** difficult
* Extremely stressful
* Toxic culture with students, and some professors
* Forced into many activities/events that I do not wish to attend
* Forced into a business minor which I do not want or enjoy
* Get kicked out for getting a C in any class
* Get kicked out for getting below a 3.2 GPA (currently have a 3.8)
* The college has program-specific classes with specific teachers that I cannot avoid, no flexibility
* I do not like it here, but it may be worth pushing through for its benefits

Pros of the College I could switch to:

* Much more freedom
* I can graduate a year earlier
* I can focus on just getting a computer science major, no business science major required
* I could get a master's in computer science here if I want to
* Much more class and professor flexibility

Cons of the College I could switch to:

* Not prestigious at all, I would not have a foot in the door for getting good internships
* A 25-minute drive to campus for any in-person classes, since I would likely live at home
* I may have to get a part-time job to afford a condo if the drive is too difficult
* Not as much TA or teacher support since I would not be in a special program anymore
* I might not like it here either, I won't know until I go

To me, this choice is hard because I do not know how the real world works completely. The average student here gets 20k more as a starting salary than the average CS student. Does this outweigh the pains of going here? I'd love some advice. Thank you"

I really don’t know how to start this, but I’ll try to be short and sweet.

The only thing I focused on in school was... school. I made it my entire life, from getting the best grades I could, doing a shit ton of clubs and EC’s, getting internships, etc. I knew I wanted to get into a great school (T20) and I had the stats to back my profile up. I sacrificed a lot for my stats, from not spending time with friends/family, to rotting my mental health, and the whole 9 yards. The only downfall was that I couldn’t take the SAT (even though I studied it back right and center) because of COVID. My test was cancelled on 8 separate occasions so I had to file SAT optional. 

I only got into my 2 safeties. 
Fairly, I got waitlisted from a T20, but they are infamous for not accepting anyone from the waitlist.

I don’t know how to feel. People with worse stats than me (I don’t mean to sound pretentious, sorry :/ ) got into the T20’s that I’ve been looking at with beady eyes. 

What does this say about me? What does this mean for my future? I’m genuinely afraid, as I know that there are much less resources and opportunities the further down the ladder you go. 

Should I try transferring? 

Are T20’s worth reaching for at this point?

I have so many questions, and I understand that I can’t get the answers to all of them, but I need help/advice. I’m in such a deep hole, and it feels like there’s no way out. School was the only thing I knew, and it feels like this is the price I pay for not living my life."

**Letters of Recommendation**

**History teacher** \- I participated a lot in class and lead class discussions, talked outside of class/in office hours about stuff unrelated to school, she told me she wrote about leadership, participation, and work ethic in her letter. (8.5/10)

**AP CS teache**r - I was the buildmaster for like every single class project, had conversations with him about his previous career/work in the CS field, he helped me get some opportunities outside of school, joined the club he was advising but didn't have leadership/didn't get too involved. (8/10).

**AP Calc AB teacher** \- Her class was kinda boring ngl, but I always participated in class whenever she asked questions, she would usually call me to show my work in front of the class, I got high scores on all of her tests. Didn't really connect with her on a personal level but I didn't  have any other teacher I felt comfortable asking. (6/10).

**Research mentor** \- vibed with him a lot during our internship, but we were only paired for like 3 months over the summer. We talked mostly about questions I had about my project, although we did talk about his past and how he ended up at \[insert T5 university\]. (7/10).

**Interviews**

**MIT** \- was my first interview so I was kinda nervous and did a lot of research beforehand just to be safe, but we ended up talking more about my personal activities/hobbies rather than the school itself. I asked a few questions towards the end. He seemed like he was decently satisfied with my answers to his questions, but I probably wasn't the greatest candidate he had ever seen. (7/10)

**Harvard** \- went really well. The interviewer and I shared a lot of hobbies (talked a lot about piano because she played at an international level during HS/college). Also went to UCLA for undergrad which was one of my top choices back then, talked about her academic past and how she ended up at Harvard. Asked for a resume after the internship since she was interested to learn more about me (8.5/10).

**Princeton** \- kinda bad tbh. Didn't connect with interviewer at all, we had vastly different views on topics and there were a lot of awkward moments. It was mostly like an information session tbh, I asked questions and he told me about his experiences at Princeton. Probably my worst interview (5.5/10)

**Yale** \- My interviewer monologued about Yale, but he talked about a lot of random people and things in pop culture that I honestly had no idea about. I'm pretty sure he thought I was super uninformed and dumb, but in reality I was kind of just freaking out and had no idea what to say half the time. Although it was a little better than Princeton cuz his stories were funny and I related his experiences to my vision of myself at Yale (6.5/10)

**Essays**

Common app essay was just a simple story about me cooking with my mom and learning some life lessons about not underestimating easy-looking jobs/not being content with a first impression. Supps were decent all around but not great, I struggled with conveying my voice because I'm not that good of a writer. (7/10)

As part of my internship, I am tasked with implementing a driver for the STM32H743's Ethernet interface. I am aware ST microelectronics already provides one in their STM32Cube library, but my company wants me to implement my own.

The Ethernet interface contains two queues (FIFO), one for transmission and one for reception. I am currently trying to understand the behaviour of the receive queue when it overflows, or when it is close to overflowing. However, two things puzzle me:

* The ETH\_MTLRXQMPOCR register provides a counter of frames that are dropped because of receive queue overflow. The documentation says it resets itself after being read. I use it to compute the total number of frames lost to overflow. However, the number of frames lost to overflow I get is HIGHER than the number of frames I actually do not receive on the software side (which uses my driver). How is this possible?
* The interface can be configured to trigger an interrupt whenever an overflow in the receive queue occurs. However, this interrupt appears to be delayed. For example in my application, this interrupt is triggered a long time after I either start to see dropped frames, or the counter in ETH\_MTLRXQMPOCR gets &gt; 0. I am talking enough time to receive dozens of frames and reception complete interrupts.

I'm afraid I fundamentally misunderstand the behaviour of the interface under overflow conditions. Is this expected behaviour?

Thanks."

I am going to graduate very soon, I am actually doing my internship to obtain my master, and I am scared about not finding a job after my internship.

I have studied chemistry, and I am doing a master in analytical chemistry, so I am at masters level.

Anyways, I am finishing my internship in less than four months and I don't think I will be able to find anything because of the high amount of people that wants to work. Recently I applied to an offer, but 200 people had alreadly applied before me!! That's absolutely crazy. Even for unqualified jobs, like working in a fast food company, there are a lot of people trying to work there too.

I also tried to look for a job abroad, in another countries in Europe and the situation is quite similar, so I don't know what should I do.

I am scare because I feel that I won't be able to accomplish my goals and dreams without a job. At this moment, I don't really care what kind of job, I just want to have something to do everyday. And please don't tell me that not finding a job is not a problem, or you can relax or work on yourself, I really hate spending the whole day at home without anything useful to do.

And also please don't tell me to ask in the same company that I am at this moment doing my internship, because that wouldn't be possible, my boss already told me, they aren't looking for anybody at this moment.

Is it possible to find a job before than my intership ends (4 months)? How can I do it? I'm so confused, I feel lost...

Thanks in advance."

Always appeal. Always get a lawyer through FIRE or the school if you have to.,No_Cicada_6246,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/mpb2xr/do_not_help_oscr_investigations_do_not_talk_to/,"I want to emphasize that I do not condone any harassment of OSCR. I am expressing an isolationist approach here that emphasizes due process. Looking for trouble is risky and easy in situations like this, and it defeats the whole point of this post. If OSCR and SCSD can destroy your academic career like another tuesday spin class, what do you think will happen if you piss them off? What do you think OSCR will do to you if you do something dumb and you are labelled a threat? Additionally, bothering them about specific cases may cause them to entrench their beliefs and leave students with worse outcomes.

Do not help OSCR investigations. Do not talk to OSCR employees or members of the SCSD in official or unofficial capacities. They are not your friends. They can and will ruin your life, even with an innocent conversation or when you go to them for help. Even if you think you are on friendly terms. Especially if you think you are on friendly terms! Always appeal. Always get a lawyer through FIRE or the school if you have to. If you are going to fall prey to a kangaroo court, put up a fight first within the boundaries of your legal obligations as according to an attorney. 

[https://www.thefire.org/](https://www.thefire.org/) FIRE is a non-partisan group that defends your rights.

Remember, the university just lost a lawsuit. [https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/02/04/speech-org-settles-u-illinois-about-bias-response](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/02/04/speech-org-settles-u-illinois-about-bias-response)

Most people think if they are unflinchingly honest, they will be treated fairly. That's not how OSCR is designed. That's also not how police interrogations are designed. Though, the two experiences are qualitatively similar. Except for the small part where police have the decency to hand you over to a real court. OSCR is focused on robotic procedure  and investigation of guilt above all else. If you get called in front of  them, you get no representative that's able to speak - all your representation can do is take notes. This means you have no advice at all on what to say, or what the student code allows you to say and not say.  This makes the process insanely stressful if you're called in front of  them. Now imagine if you have a disability or something else to be worried about in your life.

The goal of the OSCR panel, whether implicitly or explicitly, is to prove the guilt of the student - they're supposed to get to the truth of the matter, but  they rarely spend time trying to find exonerating evidence: instead they  try to find evidence of guilt. Most courts have these roles separated:  defense attorney, prosecutor, judge and jury - but if you get called  into OSCR, the panel is your prosecutor, judge and jury, and your  defense attorney is not allowed to speak. It's not particularly  surprising in this light that OSCR keeps on giving out ridiculously  skewed punishments.

More to the  point, without any even weight given to the defense of the student, the  panel has a tendency to assume that the student is lying - there is  already a presumption of guilt in the panel, because the panels job is  also to find evidence that you are guilty. With the lack of  representation, this basically means that every word you say in your own  defense will seem biased and the panel won't listen to you, but if you  say anything at all that can be twisted against it will without any  objection towards self-incriminating lines of questioning like there  would be in a court. Add this to the general stress and anxiety of going  in a situation like this and it's very clear how awful decisions can be constantly reached.

Don't trust OSCR!

EDIT: OSCR AND THE SCHOOL LAWYERS WORK FOR THE SAME PERSON?! BRO WTF

EDIT\_2: I want to take a moment and talk about the secondary effects of collegiate discipline. Many grad schools, internships, government positions, etc. ask if you have ever been disciplined. Being disciplined in college has long term financial and occupational consequences. You will also lose your visa and be deported if you are dismissed from the university, like Ivor almost was. For those of you that were rabid supporters of OSCR discipline and have had a change of heart, how kindly do you think such a disciplinary case would be looked on in the future by someone with your former fervor? Stigma may lead grad programs to believe you are careless or anti-science.

[https://www.studentdisciplinedefense.com/record](https://www.studentdisciplinedefense.com/record)

Even the most sympathetic member will punish you. They have to. See the anonymous testimony of a former committee member here. Look at how detached this bureaucrat is. Look at the cognitive dissonance. The rationalizations. The diffusion of responsibility. This is what you can expect from even the best of them. Look at that thought process, beyond the calls for reason. They don't want to rock the boat. They are loyal to the university first. They are ""more devoted to order than justice."" They have completely turned you into an abstract, and they embody the banality of evil. You are a case file, an ""individual in question."" You think they're gonna lose a promotion opportunity or their job or the good graces of their boss over the deportation of some kid? Even this former SCSD member that wanted to ""help"" was still going to punish Ivor and was more concerned with OSCR being left alone than Ivor's immediate needs. What kind of people are attracted to these positions?--
https://www.reddit.com/user/Former_UI_Throwaway 

These people may see themselves as woke and they might profess their deep connection to and utility towards student well-being. They may go on Twitter and passionately lecture others about mental health awareness or microaggressions, before turning around and becoming complicit in an immoral process that fundamentally opposes such expressed sentiments. 
Individually, they may only commit small harms or no harms at all. Certainly, they will genuinely believe they are performing a public good. Or they may convince themselves of this over time. Or they may say nothing, but they are still complicit. They may feel sorry for themselves and tell us how concerned they are, but they are still complicit and wrongs have still been committed. Seeing as consent is about power, how effectively do you think student representatives in the SCSD or board of trustees can independently advocate for their and our interests? By extension, how much freedom do you think even well-meaning bureaucrats have under their bosses?

Notice how they changed the rules for testing after Ivor's case was revised, but did not wave his punishment. They may even talk about defunding the police, when they operate a system that is analogous to the police and has all the relevant opportunities for social harms and groupthink; being deported is worse than microaggressions and it is the ultimate privilege issue. 

There is nothing about OSCR that is ""woke."" Do you know what being deported feels like? Students are still required to pay for the costs of the semester they are losing. Imagine being sent back to a 3rd world country with 40k+ in debt and nothing to show for it. The people at OSCR are incapable of understanding deportation because they have never experienced it or been at risk for it. Do you know being deported kills a lot of people? There are literal rapists that have been treated the same as or better than Ivor Chen by the university. https://dailyillini.com/news/2016/11/14/expulsion-not-option-student-sexual-assault-perpetrators/ https://www.nprillinois.org/post/u-i-sued-over-handling-sexual-misconduct-claims#stream/0"

I've got a few questions for those of you who have had the opportunity to interview with Google as a new grad -

1. Google probably receives millions of applications for their new grad positions and getting an interview with them (as a new grad) is probably as difficult as performing well in the interviews. So, how did you get that interview? Applying online, university hiring, referral... how? Any resume tips? What kind of profile and projects you had?
2. Google interviews are probably the hardest job interviews in the world and require immense preparation. So, for how long did you prepare? Please mention your complete preparation strategy.
3. I've heard that Google only asks algorithmic based coding questions for new grads. Do they never ask questions from Databases, operating systems, computer networks, system design and other CS courses?
4. How important is having prior internship experience as a new grad? Does not having prior internships drastically affect chances of getting hired?
5. What resources did you use while preparing for the interviews?
6. Are Google interviews for certain locations easier than others? I know that not many people might've interviewed at more than one location but I'm still curious to know because I've heard/read that Google interviews in India tend to be extremely difficult and that only seasoned competitive programmers have a chance of doing well in the interviews.
7. What kind of questions were asked in the behavioral/Googlyness round? Any resources to prepare for this?
8. I've heard that even after completing all interviews there's the HC and team matching which can even take many months. Any tips on doing well in team matching?

Please share your interview experiences and feel free to mention any other information that might be helpful to aspiring candidates."

I'm sad to see that EE doesn't have any more CS classes after COMP 250, and has very little coding courses altogether. I see with the new SE program they suggest to get software experience we could take an SE minor with EE. I see in the SE minor upto 2 courses(6 creds) cab be considered for double credits, towards the major and the minor, making it about only 12 creds of extra courses for the minor. Sounds doable. But the question is, is it a good choice? And how helpful will it be in the long run if I want to land SE internships or jobs in the future? Do I need a minor for that or could I get involved in design teams or personal projects to gain similar employability status in SE fields?"

I really need your advice here, so here's my situation.

I have started working as an intern at a Big N company a year and a half ago, I was supposed to finish my studies this semester. so a few months ago, the company offered me a new contract, which says that I'm no longer an intern, and I work now as a software engineer as a part job (which is different on paper than an intern, higher expectations, higher pay, and also moved to a new team) until the 1st of August, that's when I start working as a software engineer (because I'm supposed to finish my degree in June/July). 

The problem is that I failed an exam one month ago, which will mean that I won't be finishing my degree until the next semester (I can't retake it this semester). I still haven't told my manager yet, I don't know how to tell them that I failed and I won't be graduating now. and I don't know what will happen to the contract. I'm very anxious and all I think about is that how they're going to fire me, and in the best scenario they will extend my part time job but I still have disappointed them.

I have a meeting with my manager on Thursday, I'm thinking of coming clean and telling them at the meeting, but I don't know how, I'm extremely nervous and since I knew I failed my exam my performance at the job got really bad. what should I do? what will happen to me? what are my options? how should I inform my manager? I know that I was good as an intern because I got the offer and I accepted it, but my manager doesn't know that, and I'm still new at my current team and for the last month I really didn't do anything."

The recruiting timeline for quant positions starts quite early, so [HRT](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/careers/job/?gh_jid=3008603) already posted their summer 2022 internships and [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/working-at-optiver/career-opportunities/4929322002/) posted their expression of interest forms for 2022 positions.

Most roles open up in May-July and peak interview season tends to be around August-October. While it's better to apply early, most top firms are usually happy to interview you way later as well (e.g. Jane Street, HRT and Two Sigma all interview well into the winter months).  

We'll keep updating the list as new jobs are posted in the coming weeks. Feel free to submit a pull request for any suggestions and good luck!"

The full time job search back then was bad, I did not get many interviews, but I eventually got a job.





However, I compared my outcomes to a lot of CS undergrads who were applying for full time jobs, and I did not even get 10% of the interviews they did.  We all had well done resumes, 1-2 internships, and were going for degrees in CS.  It makes me wonder if companies prefer hiring people who did not have to change careers?"

1. ***Founder/President of Women in STEM Club*** (started the club as a freshman and brought in 2-3 speakers per year. expanded a lot in junior year and did lunch-n-learn sessions, partnered with Young Women In Bio, and planned/hosted a female alumni in STEM panel for every female student in my HS; not really the most impressive EC but helped me grow a lot as a person)
2. ***YWIB Ambassador*** (1 of 22 ambassadors in the inaugural class. program run by Women In Bio/Young Women In Bio, an international organization that advocates and provides opportunities for women in STEM. I planned and hosted online events, including one with MIT lecturer Natalie Kuldell which was super cool!! I also co-led a group of girls through the BioBuilder program where we researched synthetic biology and created a plan for a new functional cell that would yield spider silk for wound healing)
3. ***Writing Intern @ American Oil Chemists' Society*** (month-long internship over the summer before senior year. I helped the head editor of the AOCS internal magazine conceptualize and write the main article of the September edition. I also did research on the topic (the impact of climate change on the oilseed industry), contact and interview sources, and wrote a pagelong sidebar to the article that has my name on it!! so I'm \~technically\~ published)
4. ***UPenn Chemistry Research Academy*** (your typical ivy/ivy-adjacent STEM summer camp. not too selective, not too rigorous. i had fun though)
5. ***Cheerleading*** (this one is kinda out of left field but I've been a flyer on my school's varsity team since freshman year. I'm not particularly talented, but I'm committed, so I won a Coach's Award as a junior and lettered every season)
6. ***CTY Neuroscience*** (summer after freshman year. again, not super rigorous but I had fun and met my s/o of nearly three years lol)
7. ***Science, Technology, and Society Online Program w/ Brown*** (four weeks of very fun Zoom debate)
8. ***St. Baldrick's Volunteer*** (raised $4,500+ for childhood cancer research and donated hair three times. awarded ""Squire of Hope"" and helped plan/set up the event in the final year I participated (it was cancelled junior year due to covid)
9. ***Cognitive Science Camp*** (this was a weeklong online program run by my school, and I participated because my favorite math teacher led it. very interesting but not at ALL rigorous or competitive; really just for fun)
10. ***Band*** (first clarinet as a sophomore but I quit that year to free up more space in my class schedule. our band was pretty successful in local competitions and in MPA)

I was set to do SSTP at the University of Florida, a relatively competitive summer research program, as a rising senior, but... y'know, covid. In the end, it was a very good thing for me, since I was pushed to find other summer activities and ended up doing a lot of interdisciplinary STEM/humanities stuff (my writing internship as well as the Science, Technology, and Society and Cognitive Science summer camps). That summer's activities helped me figure out that I didn't want to be a hard STEM major and that I wanted to incorporate my love of the humanities into my academic and professional careers. This all made me a better fit for the school I eventually committed to as well. I elaborated on this point about being \~interdisciplinary\~ in my Common App Additional Info section.

**Letters of Recommendation**

*Math Teacher: 8/10*

* I had this teacher for three of my hardest classes (H. Calc BC, AP Calc BC, AP Stats) as a sophomore, junior, and senior respectively. We were very close and I came to her with personal problems and brought her baked goods lmao. She also saw me grow a lot in math, as I didn't get my first solid A average until my second junior year semester. I also participated in the Cog Sci camp with her, so she probably had a lot of personal experiences to talk about in the letter.

*APUSH Teacher: 9/10*

* We were basically best friends. I had him for Gov as a sophomore and APUSH as a junior, and I know he noticed I genuinely loved history. I regularly stopped by to talk outside of class, and I put in an absurd amount of effort into classwork and projects. I also made a poster referencing one of our class' inside jokes that he laminated and stuck on the wall. It is my legacy. Side note: I asked for this rec letter late because MIT required a letter from a non-STEM teacher, and I ended up submitting it to all of my schools. The teacher in question stopped grading current students' tests to write my LOC because it ""sounded more fun"" lmao

*Chem Teacher: ??/10*

* I had this teacher for Honors Chem as a sophomore and AP Chem as a junior. He was very hard to read and covered 99% of his emotions with sarcasm, but i THINK he liked me. Our AP Chem class was kind of wild, and I was one of the few students not constantly creating a ruckus. I dropped a few beakers, never had higher than an A- average, and made a B- on a semester exam, but I was the only student in the class looking to study chemistry after high school and that didn't actively hate the subject. But I seriously can't imagine what he could've written in the LOC because he was so stoic.

*Writing Internship Boss: 6/10*

* I don't think she had ever written a LOC, so she might not have stuck to the most \~effective\~ template. She did send me a post-internship write up separate from the LOC that praised my work ethic and writing skill, though.

**Interviews**

*MIT: i don't even know man/10*

* This was my first interview, and I got an interviewer who was young and quite similar to me. That resulted in me kind of treating her as a therapist and I unloaded a LOT of funky trauma onto her. We had gone through a lot of the same problems growing up in the conservative South, so we bonded a lot but it definitely wasn't a traditional interview. 1/2 of the interview was spent actually talking about MIT. Also we had the same breed of dog. Definitely a hot mess of an interview, but I really want to be friends with her now.

*Penn: 8/10*

* Relatively standard but good. I had another Southern female interviewer with the same childhood difficulties as me, but I was PREPARED this time and didn't treat her like a best friend/therapist. We had a lot to talk about, both because of our similarities and because I had spent time on the Penn campus and knew a lot about the school.

*Northwestern: 6/10*

* Interview started with me being very anxious, but I had an extremely sweet interviewer who made sure I was comfortable. The interview was nothing special, but I managed to get out the reasons I'd be a good fit for Northwestern and connect personally with my interviewer.

**Essays**

*Personal Statement: 6.5/10*

* Technically well-written, but semi-cliched. I wrote about cheerleading as well as my logical, independent approach to problem solving and how I learned to be more \~collaborative\~ through my sport. Boring, but very polished since I worked on it all summer.

*Supps for Early Rounds: 4/10, 5/10, 9/10*

* My MIT supplementals were BAD. That's it. I definitely came off as entitled. Never thinking about those essays again.
* I applied early to my state school and early in the rolling process to my safety. None of these essays were particularly brilliant, but they got the job done.
* I was and am quite proud of my UChicago essays. I had written multiple ""quirky"" UChi essays in prior years for classes and for fun, so even though the one I submitted was written and edited over the course of maybe four hours over two nights, I'd had practice. Definitely a solid ""Why UChicago"" essay too. I also submitted a video profile for UChicago where I baked croissants and talked about my \~growth mindset\~.

*Supps for RD: 8/10*

* I mostly copied the early supplementals that I had written for my safety school, my state school, and MIT. I wrote every ""Why School"" essay originally, though, to avoid being repetitive and bland. I was proudest of my ""Why Northwestern"" essay that I framed through my walk through the campus I did.

* Contrived essays (mainly for MIT/early schools/non-""Why School"" essays). I think part of my success with UChicago was because I didn't  submit those typical leadership/community/etc prompts.
* Largely underwhelming ECs. No national competitions or Ivy League internships. You get the picture.

*Strengths:*

* Stats. These definitely helped me at my state school and safety school with Honors Colleges/scholarships.
* Interdisciplinary profile (for UChicago specifically). I know they look for students who want to study many subjects across the academic board, so my ECs and classes that focused on both humanities and STEM were probably appealing.
* Women in STEM maybe??? I don't know if that's so much of a hook, but I had multiple ECs that strengthen the point.

*Final Thoughts:*

I couldn't be happier with my decision to switch from the RD to the EDII pool after being deferred EA from UChicago. I don't think I would've been accepted without the ED bump, so even though I wasn't 100% confident in my decision then, I would choose it again in a heartbeat. I think I'm a great fit for the school, so I'm glad my application profile ended up showing that.

Looking back, I'm surprised that my frankly mediocre ECs landed me a spot at a \~T10\~. Combined with my lack of awards or 4.0 GPA, my acceptance seems like a miracle to me. At my school, I've seen students who are honestly much smarter than me get waitlisted and denied at top schools they would flourish at. Originally, I felt competitive about college applications. I wanted to go to the best college out of my class to ""prove"" my worth to my peers. Looking back, I was an idiot. I couldn't be more grateful for my acceptance, but hearing about rejections and waitlists handed to equally and more competitive applicants that I know is painful. I don't believe anyone ""deserves"" a spot at any university, but some of these rejections and waitlists truly don't reflect the amazing strength of the applicants. This year was brutal. If I hadn't switched into the EDII pool, I don't think I'd have been spared either.

On that depressing note, I'll end this post. If you have any questions or want advice about writing essays/seeking internships/the application process in general, feel free to reach out!

mpfooo,2,2021-04-12,Should I Switch Colleges?,CobaltGecko9091,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mpfooo/should_i_switch_colleges/," I cannot decide whether or not to switch colleges, mainly because I do not know what truly matters or not for the future. I am currently working towards a computer science major and a business minor. I have my tuition paid in full at either school, so money is not much of a concern here. To help people understand my situation, I'll lay it out in pros and cons.

Pros of The College I am at:

* Prestigious school with internship opportunities
* Have a scholarship for living on campus for free if I want to
* Classes are all within 5 minutes of me
* Lots of TA hours and professors open to giving help
* Small school experience, max 40 kids in a class, typically 20
* I do not have to drive here, I live here and can walk to any class

Cons of The College I am at:

* **Extremely** difficult
* Extremely stressful
* Toxic culture with students, and some professors
* Forced into many activities/events that I do not wish to attend
* Forced into a business minor which I do not want or enjoy
* Get kicked out for getting a C in any class
* Get kicked out for getting below a 3.2 GPA (currently have a 3.8)
* The college has program-specific classes with specific teachers that I cannot avoid, no flexibility
* I do not like it here, but it may be worth pushing through for its benefits

Pros of the College I could switch to:

* Much more freedom
* I can graduate a year earlier
* I can focus on just getting a computer science major, no business science major required
* I could get a master's in computer science here if I want to
* Much more class and professor flexibility

Cons of the College I could switch to:

* Not prestigious at all, I would not have a foot in the door for getting good internships
* A 25-minute drive to campus for any in-person classes, since I would likely live at home
* I may have to get a part-time job to afford a condo if the drive is too difficult
* Not as much TA or teacher support since I would not be in a special program anymore
* I might not like it here either, I won't know until I go

To me, this choice is hard because I do not know how the real world works completely. The average student here gets 20k more as a starting salary than the average CS student. Does this outweigh the pains of going here? I'd love some advice. Thank you"

I got accepted into Purdue's comp sci program and I am currently living in TN, USA. I am here on an H4 visa and I plan to transfer to an F1 visa by my sophomore year. I have a few questions that I was hoping to get answers from:

1. How hard is it for international students to get internships? What percent of all int students get internships by their sophomore year? (P.s. I have never really done any coding before, I am planning to learn java over the summer though)
2. I also got into UTK for which I got instate tuition and a ton of scholarship so it is way cheaper than purdue. But this only applies if I stay on an H4 visa which means I cannot do internships at all. I was planning to transfer to F1 by my sophomore year-ish if I don't get my green card yet. Do you think I would be better off going to the University of Tennessee (which is ranked 75 for comp sci) or Purdue for comp sci?"

Now this isn't exactly my main interest, and I've never considered this career path. Considering most of my country is dealing with a third wave of Covid, internships are hard to come by so I don't have a lot of options at the moment, and I really don't want to accept the offer simply to turn it down if something better turns up.

How beneficial/detrimental would an internship in cyber security be if I'm trying to become a software developer / data scientist in the long run?"
mpgql8,3,2021-04-12,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (4/12/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/mpgql8/weekly_job_qa_thread_4122021/,"Hi all,

Here is the fifty-ninth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

I was very well prepared for the interview, and did well enough that I expected to get the position. I'm enjoying it and very happy to be in this internship as I'm learning a lot, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm not good enough for the tasks I'm assigned. 9/10 tasks I do I need to ask a question at some stage, or get help, and I really feel like I'm wasting a developers time/annoying them with my questions. The tasks I'm doing currently feel very daunting, I usually need someone to point me in the right direction when getting started on them. It makes it difficult for me to feel like I'm impressing anyone enough for me to get the job at the end of this, especially when there are many other interns. I felt I was middle of the pack earlier but now I'm not too sure. Whenever I do manage to do something completely by myself I feel great, but extremely deflated whenever I have to give in and ask for help.

I guess the reason I'm making this post is to ask has anyone had similar emotions to these, and if so how did you deal with it? Please share your stories. I can recognize they're completely irrational ways of thinking/feeling. On a related note, what things did you do to be a better intern in general? Or perhaps more concisely how do I lay a path for myself to get better?"

Often when I make just a small change to their code base there ends up being hundreds of other lines which get changed as well due to Prettier. 

Then in GitHub, instead of seeing the one small change, there are many changes... even after excluding white space. 

I can imagine this would make things more difficult for the code reviewer. 

Should I just disable Prettier? Or at least disable things like line-wrapping, etc.?"
mph916,7,2021-04-12,Resigned from my first job today,kyway2fly,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mph916/resigned_from_my_first_job_today/,"Today I put in my two week notice for my first job post college. I’ve worked here for two years and they have been nothing but great to me. I started as an intern, went full time, and got a raise during Covid. I have been on my team for about a year now and my manager has been great - trusts me, built my confidence, and has been very easy going. 

Another company reached out to me a couple of months ago and after my interviews I eventually signed my offer today for almost a 25% promotion and moving up a level for my career. I told my boss this morning after I set up some time (we work remote) and we started the convo with small talk, which made it far worse. 

I ripped the bandaid and told him I was putting in my two week notice because I had decided to accept another opportunity that would further me along in my career. He told me he understood, that when he first started his career he would move jobs more frequently. He also said I’d be missed and could tell I was visibly upset and my voice was cracking. He was reassuring it would all be okay and even called me right after to say I was about to be promoted and it had already been approved by our VP. He told me the salary and it’s still much less than my new offer. I told him I had accepted my offer this morning and that I could not accept, to which he understood. I have been crying all morning and feel extremely sad to leave something I love, but know it’s for the best for a huge raise and opportunity. Not to mention the team is already so understaffed and under significant stress. Any tips on getting over the guilt and dealing with these next two weeks?"

mpiosl,1,2021-04-12,Can I have some honest feedback for my situation,prospectivecoder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mpiosl/can_i_have_some_honest_feedback_for_my_situation/,"About me: 

I have 6 years experience in unrelated finance type field. I have always been interested in computers and did some c++ when I was 12 or 13 but had a hard time progressing past a certain point. I have taken some basic courses in javascript/html/css over the years.

A little over a year ago I started doing some freecodecamp and then found a little project I wanted to make for myself and friends. After making that, my friend invited me to work on a project with him and a few devs with decent experience in the industry. I started working with node and react and was able to learn from the more experienced dev and started contributing code to the project. 

About 6 months ago I left my full-time job (probably big mistake), and have been programming 8-10 hours a day either working on my projects or taking classes/doing leetcode. I finally finished a self-guided project about a month ago and thought it would help me get my foot in the door at companies since it is a little different than a lot of projects I sometimes end up doing on online courses. 

Fast forward, I have been applying a lot and haven't really gotten any serious looks from employers. They definitely brush off the fact that I don't have any real cs experience. I guess I should have predicted this by reading the stories on here and knowing how hard it would be, but I guess I got caught up on the things you see on youtube pitching that anyone can get a dev job, etc. 

So anyway, I'm at the point where CS is my passion and I  get a lot of enjoyment out of doing it. Although if I can encounter a problem/something I need to build I can usually figure out a way to make it, since I'm working on my own I'm always questioning whether I am building things the right way and up to industry standards. I was hoping to find a job/program that would provide a little bit of mentorship so I could make the right architecture decisions. 

So there it is. The Tldr is basically, been coding 8-10 hours a day for about a year, have built a few larger type projects and have worked in a sort of internship role at a startup. I started applying for jobs about 2 months ago and it has been rejection after rejection. I'm not sure whether to (1). Continue what I'm doing and hope to land a job (2) attend a code bootcamp, or (3) try to land a job in a different industry and continue to code on the side while I build my skills. The (4) would be get a cs degree which I'd love to do, but would be difficult for me since I'm 29.

mpjy6c,0,2021-04-12,Should I join the national guard and make my family upset?,PopCandy420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mpjy6c/should_i_join_the_national_guard_and_make_my/,"So at the time I am writing this, im meeting with a recruiter in the afternoon to talk about the opportunities with the national guard and I have yet to determine whether or not Ill go for this or not.

Background info: i was born in another country and my family moved to the usa after 6 months afterwards for work. Due to the nature of this, i ended up having 2 citizenships. When my dad applied for us citizenship, he ended up needing to revoke his other citizenship while I didnt need to since his naturalization gave me us citizenship without revoking my native one. 

now unto the current issue: my native passport expired so now I have to go stay in my native country for at least 3 months in order to renew it (no i can't do it in an embassy here in the us because i no longer have a green card in order to process the paperwork for it to renew it for another 10 years) 

I recently got accepted into a university here in the us i really want to attend, but my parents for whatever reason are being difficult when it comes to discussing how to pay for school (giving me their tax info for fafsa, discussing if they will help pay for it either partially and how much each semester, and making it hard to find a job for me since they want the job to fit their wants and needs, NOT MINE). Last time I talked to them about needing loans and college, they told me its useless and they aint gona let me take loans just so they will end up paying it back since they dont think i will get a job after college.

its a lose lose situation, and as a result i am looking at alternatives to pay for it such as the guard. I always wanted to do something for my country and get an adventure that not every person gets. If my parents are going to be that way, I really can't do much but salvage my situation.

the guard also has lots of benefits such as paying for school, helping you gain skills for the workforce as well as others like retirement, healthcare, etc etc.

**Here is where I might upset my family:** ***If i join the guard, it would mean that I can't exactly stay in another country for 3 months for renewing the passport cuz that could cause trouble.*** I am serious about what I do and value sticking through thick and thin if i am passionate about doing something. I don't want to get an AWOL or anything that can negatively impact my future. She told me many many times how its more important to renew the passport than any business I have going on here. In addition, we have family in europe so it might be important to just have it.

this would upset my mom cuz the year my native passport expired, we tried to go for 3 months but my mom wasn't able to stay for 3 months and we had to go back 2 earlier so we couldnt do the paperwork. This previous summer, it was lockdown so we couldnt fly to do it without safety concerns and covid impacting europe a lot. 

This summer, It might be possible to renew it and flying to the country but I also applied for a job and an internship for this summer. If i get in, I wont be able to go anyway. Same situation if i go to the guard.

I really don't know what i should do as I really want to finish my degree and get that bachelors degree to move out given how limited with what I can do at home.

any advice?"

All job searches have been in this state that I’m not currently in. Most of my applications have been for remote / temp remote positions. 

got a internship offer at this events company, but it gave off so many red flags. “We work hard and play hard”, long random lists of things I can “work on”, not very good reviews. It was also super salesy which I wasn’t really wanting in terms of internship opportunities. 

I got past the second interview for this non profit internship, was super competitive. The interviewer liked me, but today he sent me an email saying they chose another candidate. I was really wanting this position. 

I feel like I have such bad luck when it comes to the job market. I have revised my resume many times, do well in the interview. But I need some guidance on what to do next. 

I have an online shop, it does pretty good. Ranges anywhere from $1000-2800 a month. I also do contract work for a marketing company that I set my own hours at- it can be a little bit mind-numbing since it’s almost like data entry using zoominfo. That pulls in usually $1000. I am also a full time student. 

I don’t know what to do. Do I just prioritize what I have? My fears are 1) my business income can fluctuate and 2) I don’t know how long I will be able to work for this marketing company. I started in December and my main role is to work on this one project solo. I had a family member help me get this job, which they work at. 

Just feeling overwhelmed. People say you need to find a job before you move anywhere, but it’s like I am in a double bind of “can’t get a job when you’re not in the state” and “being frivolous if you move to state without job”. 

I have savings, worst case scenario I just work at a store or restaurant. But even then, it’s like: will I even have luck with that? I’ve worked in restaurants and shops before. But even those it was usually because I knew someone that worked there before. 

Any guidance?"

I feel compelled to take this route, but I am concerned that it may not be ideal to try to rush to get everything done so soon (for example, I haven't participated in any internships so far, but I plan on doing one next summer. If I finish my MS the following spring, this would mean I only had one internship throughout the entirety of my BS and MS degrees). I was wondering if anyone may have some advice on which route I should take. Thank you!!!"

Unfortunately, for awhile now I have struggled to find an internship role. Ideally, I would like to swing an internship to become my eventual full time job.

My course work has been dominantly theory based courses. That is not to say I do not code in my courses, I have been working with Java since I was 17 and have also become very skilled with Python. However, all my programming experience is just coding and developing the algorithms that one typically learns in their undergrad. Now that it is time to search for jobs, it seems I can't get a call back anywhere because they are all looking for students with a good amount of work/class experience in some form of software development, something that my coursework has not offered to me thus far. I do have some base level knowledge and experience with web development (can build a simple web page with React), but based on what I have heard in interviews this is far from sufficient to earn an internship role.

So my question is, how did you all get your start in your career, and what are some good options/resources for growing my skills as a developer and becoming qualified for at least an intern role? More specifically, if you are a full stack web developer, what web technologies do you know and where did you learn them? If you are a mobile developer, where did you learn to develop in andriod, swift, objective-C? These are some fields I am interested in (just to name a few) but I am feeling a bit lost as to where I can learn the necessary skills to find a job one day, and I am starting to become very worried about being unemployed after graduation."

mpnhmy,4,2021-04-12,Transferring to Ann Arbor,superkoolman123,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/mpnhmy/transferring_to_ann_arbor/,"I currently go to a terrible CS school (ranked like 150th in the US) and really hate the quality of the curriculum. It is essentially very time-consuming with a lot of tasteless busy work. For example, we are never told to write test cases for our software, graded for them, or even have our software tested against edge cases. I try my best to test my software well and make sure it is as good as possible, yet other students just hand in broken software and we all end up getting 100's. 

I have the option to transfer to Ann Arbor. The issue is, I don't live in Michigan so I will have to pay out-of-state tuition. I would also graduate a semester late. After calculating the cost from the very little fin-aid I get, the difference between the two degrees (counting the money I lose from the extra semester I'm in school versus working full time at a company) is about $160K. My parents can afford it and don't mind paying the money (so I don't need to take any loans or pay them back) but obviously don't want me to pay a ridiculous amount of money on something where I won't make it back. 

I have interned and will continue to intern at a F500 company, and have a good chance of getting a return offer. So I will hopefully have some sort of job lined up if I stay at my current school. 

However, I hope to cover up all the holes in my knowledge (writing good test cases, learning how to deal with large codebases, etc) and work at a FAANG (doesn't everyone). Since I will be pushing back my graduation date and have already taken a lot of advanced (although poorly run) CS classes and already have internship experience, I think I will be a pretty competitive applicant for the higher-tier companies if I do transfer. Any advice on whether transferring is worth it?"
mpnlu3,69,2021-04-12,APs want you to try but they don't want you to succeed,IamWhatonearth,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/mpnlu3/aps_want_you_to_try_but_they_dont_want_you_to/,"After a lifetime of trying to please my mother and eventually mostly cutting her off, I finally realized what the real problem was. She is basically the most miserable and bitter person I've ever met in my life so it was difficult to unpack because there are so many reasons why she is unhappy.

I figured out the obvious reasons first (these are reasons she told me to my face): she wanted a son because she already had a daughter and she got me instead, she never wanted kids and only agreed to have some so my dad would marry her but later she decided she didn't like him either and she was still stuck with us, she wanted us to be prodigy children to make it worth her while to raise us and we weren't.

But there's tons of less obvious, more hidden reasons: She secretly is deeply insecure and thought the only way she could get praise (mostly from her siblings) was to talk about how hard she worked for a family that didn't care about or appreciate her and was full of underperforming, delinquent children. I remember being at a party while she sat sullen and sulking while her siblings tried to say nice things about me like they were comforting her that I was her daughter. I have so many memories of her on the phone complaining about us being such bad kids while her sisters sang her praises for being ""such a good mom"".

But wait! There's more!

I eventually realized that my mom wanted me to try to do all these things that would make me an impressive and ideal Asian woman but she didn't want me to succeed. If I try to do something, she can feel like she got a second chance to try along side me but, if I succeed she looks bad in comparison and it makes her jealous and insecure. Basically, I was supposed to be her second chance at life but, I wasn't supposed to show her up.

1. She wanted me to try to get a good husband but she didn't want me to have a good marriage. The first time she pressured me to leave my now husband wasn't when she found out what his major was (what she claims) but, the time I told her I talked to him everyday. She didn't come to my wedding and called me a month after I got married to ask me if I had any problems in my marriage. When I said I didn't, she acted sad. She also kept insisting that I'd get divorced soon.
2. She was supportive of me doing art when I was a little girl and said it kept me out of trouble but, once I got good at it, all I got was scolding that it was distracting me from my school work and it was worthless for income so I shouldn't have any hobbies until I'm retired. I was confused why she didn't seem phased if I watched tv or was on my computer all day but would freak out if she saw me making art. Then, in my mid 20s, my mother started talking about how she wanted to learn my skills when she was retired. I realized that my mother became jealous of me having a unique skill once I got good at it and it wasn't really about me not studying enough.
3. I went into healthcare to make her happy but, she was never supportive of my studies. She mostly just criticized me for things like taking too long to graduate. When I did graduate and was looking for internships to get licensed, she told me to do whatever it took, including applying out of state. When I talked about finding an internship location out of state that might accept me, despite my lower grades, and how it was a few hours of my now husband she freaked out and told me not to apply. I realized she didn't really want me to do whatever it took. I wasn't about to move out of state to the middle of no where, where I knew no one so I accepted a lower internship with the plan to get a higher one later or grandfather in but, even hat didn't make her happy. Once I started working, all she could talk about was how I didn't make as much money as her. Then after working briefly, I realized I hated the field and I only went into it because she wanted me to. Despite throwing away my own ambitions to please her, all she had ever done was talk badly to me about it anyway. I realized then, that she never really wanted me to get a better job than her, she just wanted me to try.

I wanted to share because I think this is a common dynamic in APs. Many APs are immigrants or people that feel bound by culture. Many APs give up on their own dreams and ambitions to please their families and maintain the status quo. The burden to carry their lost dreams then fall onto their children to fulfill. Its a toxic cycle and a cause of intergenerational trauma. If you suspect you are throwing away your own hopes and dreams to please your parents, you should consider if it is even truly what either of you want. You might be surprised when they turn on you once you are about to become the profession they always told you was ideal. Good luck guys.

I realize I don't really enjoy my job, and it's really easy to feel like just another cog in the system. My boss even told me that most projects don't even make it to production, so to me, it doesn't seem very rewarding. 

In college, I was a Computer Engineering student until the end of my sophomore/early junior year and have taken some courses such as: Intro to Logic Design (FPGA, verilog, boolean logic), Intro to Microcontrollers &amp; Microprocessors (arduino, raspberry pi, propeller board, PICkit), Physics Electricity and Magnetism, and a Circuit Analysis class. I moved to Computer Science because I thought I enjoyed it more, and because it allowed me to graduate a one year early than had I stuck with Computer Engineering.

I had an internship at Intel before where I worked with SSDs (updating the firmware, delivering ssd's to/from customers, benchmarking, debugging issues) and that was more fun than what I am currently doing. I also interned at HPE as a network engineer intern where I debugged network switch issues, updated them, and created a script that would let us remotely control them. Playing with microcontrollers, and fpga's were also more interesting to me, but I know that's not all there is to it when it comes to the actual job. 

I talked to a friend of mine, who is a controls engineer, and she said since I have the background, I might be able to take PLC, SCADA, and AutoCAD courses to pivot my career in that direction. Can anyone give me some sort if insight, and if it seem feasible? My first thought was to go towards a Master's in Electrical Engineering from Purdue's online program and doing that while working so I wouldn't lose my current income, but that program seems more theoretical than practical. I feel like I just think that the grass is greener, and might not actually enjoy switching."

I will be graduating with my MechE at the end of August and I have been searching for jobs lately. I have had several internships- I am currently a project engineering intern at a large auto supplier, however I am currently looking for MechE positions as I would like to be on the more technical/engineering side of things vs project management.

I recently interviewed for a CAD designer position at a large automotive OEM, and I am currently in a wage negotiation with them and I expect to get a reasonable offer soon. I am afraid that accepting a CAD job now will hurt my chances of finding an actual MechE job down the line or that it will reflect very poorly on me to leave a job several months after starting if I find another position, even within the same company. My main motivator is the pay and experience I will get, since I do not have much professional/industry CAD experience. However, the pay is not on par with an entry level engineering position (I didn't expect it to be, but it is more than I am making now). The job is a contracted position.

I was wondering if anyone has been in this position before, or if anyone has any advice.

Thanks!"

I love the Big 10 environment, its a great school for STEM majors, and I cannot be more excited to get on campus this fall. However, I also accepted my waitlist offer to UIUC. Now, I have wanted to go to UIUC since 11th grade.

Before a couple days ago, I have been set on the idea that if I got off of the waitlist for UIUC, I would 100% go.

However, I've been thinking about it, and I realized that other than the slightly higher ranking in CS and slightly more diverse population, I love Purdue and UIUC for almost of the same reasons. They are both Big 10 schools with pretty great sports teams and school spirit. They are both in rural areas and college towns. They are both the same distance from Chicago. They both have a great name in the STEM (especially CS) field and provide amazing opportunities for internships and jobs after graduation.

Now part of me wants to say that even if I get in, I'll just go to Purdue because it's $10k/year cheaper and if I work hard enough, the difference between them in ranking wouldn't matter. So, I might as well just deny my waitlist offer then, right?

But part of me still feels an attachment to this school, for some reason, even though there's no logical reason to. There's not even a difference in feel, fit, or excitement to be there.

My thinking is, if I just deny my waitlist offer now, I won't feel as bad as getting in and not going. If I get in, I probably won't go, but I'll feel awful about it. If I don't get in, I'll feel pretty sad as well. If I just cancel it, I can just take it out of my mind and focus on my success at Purdue.

Am I being stupid? I need an outside perspective on this."

I'm likely to go to Oxford with Leeds as a backup in case of financial issues. I assume Oxford will give me the best chances to score a top-paying jobs, but it's not enough in itself.

I first started learning to code at 12 (currently 18), and have a long history of part-time/freelance coding along with a software eng placement/internship I'm doing this year at a relatively large tech consultancy in Cambridge before going to uni next year. From what I've seen work experience really helps with getting a decent job after graduating so I believe I've got a decent level of work experience for an undergrad.

As for personal projects my github is relatively weak compared to the rest of my profile but it's still got a couple web projects using modern frameworks (React, Vue etc), but that's something I'll be focusing on this summer and at uni.

For summer internships my current company guarantees me summer placements during my entire degree (some are required though), so I'm set for the experience, although I'm still hoping to shoot for some other internships like Google if possible since they seem to massively increase your chances of getting a return offer.

I understand that most UK grads start on £20k-£30k but it seems that there are jobs that pay so much more. I also know that those jobs are highly selective and so I shouldn't count on them. That said, I'm highly motivated and still hopeful that I can score one of those jobs no matter what it takes (Leetcode? Grades?). What are the best ways to improve my chances, and do I have a realistic shot at landing one of those £60k+ jobs in London after graduating? Would also appreciate IB-specific feedback as it seems that field pays massively as well as big tech."

So  around late November I accepted an internship offer from  BIGDEFENSECOMPANY. Was super excited about the opportunity as it aligns  well with what I want to do later on in my career and I've been doing  all the onboarding stuff (security clearances, drug testing, etc.) ever  since.

If that were the end of the  story I wouldn't be here. Turns out in the many months since then I've  been able to secure a part-time job for the school year. I was recruited  for this job with my manager/HR knowing full well that I still planned  to intern at BIGDEFENSECOMPANY. While things have gone well so far, I  recently found that my manager is willing to take me full-time this  summer and even part-time into next school year if I so choose.

So  that's basically why I'm here. Does anyone have any thoughts/advice for  someone in my situation? I understand that reneging here would be  terrible for my reputation (especially since I'd be doing so extremely  late given that clearances need to be made) but I feel like the longer  term employment would be more beneficial/useful to me in the long run.

(I  should add that the place I'm working part-time at is definitely a  place some would consider a 'dream job' as well. While what I'm doing  right now may not be MY dream job, through networking/movement around  the organization I think reaching my dream job is not out of the  question)."

Now at the time, everything seemed fine and all, and moving wasn't a concern at all and so I had accepted the conditions, and started the offer process.

HOWEVER, yesterday, I found out that due to a very serious family issue I MIGHT not be able to move to Ottawa and continue my internship with the company(as it requires me to be present there and all). And I am at a stage, where I have to submit my Tax forms, and the Void Cheques and all. So, if this issue that I talk about, does get resolved (we will know by end of next week). I will still be able to continue, and go ahead with the job, HOWEVER, as of now, it is uncertain.

So I was wondering if someone can guide me on what steps I could take? Should I just go ahead and submit the Tax forms and all, and then in the WORST CASE- I can't go, I would let them know and quit? OR what else should I do? and what all can I do?

Note: I can do the internship, if it was still in my city(Toronto), because I would be staying at home, and helping, but Moving to a different location, just won't work out.

Tldr; What should I do since, I've already accepted the position, and it is a question, if I can still continue with the offer or not."

**University of Illinois (Statistics&amp;CS)**

Pros:

* Very well reputed CS program
* Beautiful campus
* The Stat&amp;CS major is more tailored to data science and AI/ML, which I would like to do
* From what I hear, great internship opportunities
* Better network and recruitment opportunities to big tech companies or interesting startups

Cons:

* OOS tuition would leave me about $100k in student loan debt when I graduate (on paper, not factoring in internships or other opportunities to reduce student loans).
* Location is not ideal, but this isn't a huge factor

**Penn State (Computer Science)**

Pros:

* Still a very well reputed CS program, but not nearly as much as UIUC
* Significantly more affordable because I am in-state (could potentially graduate debt-free)
* Admitted to the Schreyer Honors College
* Much closer to home
* Would be attending with some of my lifelong friends

Cons:

* Not as highly ranked, but still a very good school for CS
* I did not like the campus quite as much as UIUC

All in all, I don't feel like I can go too wrong with either of these choices, but I'm still interested to see what advice anyone might have. I'm leaning towards UIUC because I feel confident I could pay off the (very large) loans within a reasonable time frame, and the network/opportunities could make it worth it in the long term."

For the past year I have been taking online classes and self teaching myself various computer languages:  JavaScript, SQL, Basics of HTML &amp; CSS but eventually got interested &amp; recommended to looking to DevOps and Kubernetes in particular. I have been branching out to the different aspects of a complete CI/CD Pipeline but lately I have been getting a little discouraged since I don't have a degree in CS which seems to be a fairly universal prerequisite. I am not against getting one but I need a job now to help assist in supporting my family for the time being.  


I am looking for any advice you guys can give on what type of entry level/ intern type jobs I should start looking for to get my foot in the door to eventually lead to a DevOps career. But something that is feasible now with my current skill set.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read and any advice you can offer!"

I'm a Junior Computer Science student. Have some experience now have written thousands of lines of frontend code. Did a somewhat large MERN project. A handful of smaller React or full-stack (with React) projects. Did a Vue &amp; Vanilla project at my last internship, this summer I'm going to Amazon where It seems I'll be doing some sort of a Full-Stack internal tool.

I feel like I both know a lot and very little about the frontend. Compared to my peers, I'm the expert, I'm the only one who can confidently take something from start to finish that works. But something just feels like I've scraped the surface. I like to think my Javascript fundamentals are strong for a student (ES5+). When I look deeper into some npm libraries I use, it uses Javascript modules that I'm not familiar with. I wouldn't be able to make such libraries myself without some extensive Stack Overflow support. I feel like i'm missing knowledge about structure &amp; design patterns that would be involved in maintaining or working on ultra-large frontends like say Facebook Web. I want to be able to master frontend cause it's what I want to go into and I think it's necessary for me to be able to land something of higher prestige than Amazon.

So what are the best resources out there for learning this level of Frontend development?"

My main, final goal in life would be to work either in tech (I'm starting to learn alot about cloud software) or as a CFO. One of the best routes for an apprenticeship seems to be accounting (taking my AAT and then ACCA exams). 

During my gap year , I would like to land work in either of these roles however due to covid apprenticeships are incredibly scarce right now however I have some family connections that might allow me to get an internship over the summer. Will this increase my chance of getting hired in the future, or is this and accounting a bad idea in general?"

Im 38 yrs old with 20+ yrs of kitchen/hospitality experience and am burned out on it. In 2016 i went back to school on a whim for coding. Had a class involving web design, and pursued that instead since a majority of the class track was the same. At the end of 2019 i got my A.S. in web design and a web dev specialist certification.

Then covid hit literally as i finished, so any further schooling stopped, and zero job opportunities came as a result.

My frustrations lie with shit instructors that never explained frameworks or anything other than basic HTML, CSS, and super low tier javascript. My internship, that took me 6 months to find, was with VR and AR through my school and a museum, ZERO to do with websites or coding, so ZERO job placement or help finding one. Pretty much ""figure it out, you owe us 17k"". By me saying average/mediocre i meen i can do the basics, what i know is basically self taught. I have a portfolio with projects through my github to show. Never got in tune with any kind of mentor or anybody that i personally know who does web dev or any kind of coding, because i dont know anybody who does. So my basic questions are left up to google, stackoverflow and the likes.

I feel school was an absolute waste of time, and an even bigger waste of money. I have literally hundreds of applications out since january 2020...ZERO callbacks or responses to any of them.

Basically, i dont know what to do, and im asking this sub for advice, or guidence, or fucking anything honestly...."

All job searches have been in this state that I’m not currently in. Most of my applications have been for remote / temp remote positions. 

got a internship offer at this events company, but it gave off so many red flags. “We work hard and play hard”, long random lists of things I can “work on”, not very good reviews. It was also super salesy which I wasn’t really wanting in terms of internship opportunities so I declined.

I got past the second interview for this non profit internship, was super competitive. The interviewer liked me, but today he sent me an email saying they chose another candidate. I was really wanting this position. 

I feel like I have such bad luck when it comes to the job market. I have revised my resume many times, do well in the interview. But I need some guidance on what to do next. 

I have an online shop, it does pretty good. Ranges anywhere from $1000-2800 a month. I also do contract work for a marketing company that I set my own hours at- it can be a little bit mind-numbing since it’s almost like data entry using zoominfo. That pulls in usually $1000. I am also a full time student. 

I don’t know what to do. Do I just prioritize what I have? My fears are 1) my business income can fluctuate and 2) I don’t know how long I will be able to work for this marketing company. I started in December and my main role is to work on this one project solo. I had a family member help me get this job, which they work at. I’m trying so hard to better and smarter about my online business and overall outside income.

Just feeling overwhelmed and very disappointed in myself. People say you need to find a job before you move anywhere, but it’s like I am in a double bind of “can’t get a job when you’re not in the state” and “being frivolous if you move to state without job”. 

I have savings, worst case scenario I just work at a store or restaurant. But even then, it’s like: will I even have luck with that? I’ve worked in restaurants and shops before. But even those it was usually because I knew someone that worked there before. 

Any guidance on this? I feel like I am never going to find an employer who wants me at this point."

I'm a high school student who's expecting to go to Arizona State University for a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I've always been interested in STEM, but I'm also a multipotentialite, so I'm fascinated by many things :). I'd like to start preparing for a career in the tech industry, even if it's just a little on the side of everything else going on in my life.

Basically, I'm deciding whether I should study software engineering (more specifically, web development—or at least to start—in my case) or data science. On one side, software engineering is a more well-established field, it has a clearer roadmap, and an overall safer option (e.g. more job opportunities and a larger community, as well as more resources). Moreover, I already know I like software engineering; I enjoy programming, and I've tried it before multiple times. There's just a part of me, however, that is really intrigued by data science. I've always been very analytically and scientifically minded. I love logic and argumentation. Being swarmed in data points and using it to develop logical, well-thought-out business claims sounds more fulfilling to me than software engineering. Unfortunately, it's much more of a risky move. Since data science is such an umbrella term and it still has a while to go before it's fully diversified and specialized, I'd likely feel insecure about the value of each lesson I learn. I could do an entire course on some particular technology or area of statistics and then never use it because no one data scientist has the same tasks or uses the same tools. Overall, I feel like data science would allow me to express my creativity more. Part of me wants to try out data science through an online boot camp like Dataquest, or maybe some other starter courses. I could continue learning it throughout the rest of high school. Then, maybe I could get hired as a data scientist (more likely analyst) intern in college to get some work experience. And because I'd be pursuing a CS degree, I'll be exposed to plenty of programming and software engineering principles too.

Any directional insight would be appreciated (even if it's just life advice). Thank you, especially if you managed to read this whole post. If couldn't already see, I'm having a bit of an early identity crisis."

Currently on a gap year due to health reasons &amp; being extremely vunerable from covid-19.

I'm interested in becoming a front office quant as I find developing models to pricing assets super interesting and also enjoy maths a lot, esp calculus, probability and algorithms. 

I've learnt Java, and the basics of maths for engineers and computer scientists from first year as well as data structures and database systems. I've also learnt Python in my spare time as well as learning the basics of capital markets through Linkedin Learning (service is free via my university). I learn C++ &amp; Scala in second year as part of my course as well as about theory of computation, algorithms such as kruskals, primms, etc. I also learn about Signals and Systems.

I've got a mentor who is a quant analyst @ an American BB &amp; another who is a software developer at a hedge fund, provided by my university, who both went to my university if that helps(?)

I was thinking on how to best gear myself towards summer internships, we don't have dedicated quant/strat UG internships in the UK so the most appropriate would be tech or trading I'm guessing? Any tips on how to prepare for internships and enter the field? Applications don't open until August for most BBs.

P.S. for posgraduate qualification I am most keen on is data science since this field really interests me and I don't think I can stomach the time or cost of going to PhD."

UT Austin for Computer Engineering is pretty good too and wayyy farther from home (20hrs if I drive). The campus is amazing since it's literally in the heart of Austin and it's more lively i think atleast. 

BOTH schools have great job opportunities post college or even when I'm still in college for internships. UIUC is a little bit higher ranked but I heard ranking doesn't matter. Austin is a great city for doing a job because it's a blooming city.

You may remember my post about getting an internship with a healthcare organization [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/l9jrni/internship_at_hospital_org_and_some_questions_for/)

Apparently, I haven't broken anything badly enough because I am starting month 3 of my internship and have learned a tremendous amount of information. For example, I've never worked on a PC used for medical dictation in a surgical room with a patient on the table or done troubleshooting on a blood pressure monitor in an actual COVID patient's room before... 

I've been tasked with a Windows Server 2012/R2 Active Directory issue, (I assume this is just to keep me busy, but I don't mind.) The information relayed to me is that when the organization fully upgraded to Win10 in ~2018 that new mapped user drives were autopopulated by Active Directory. 

For example, every user had a network drive titled `username` and after they migrated to Win10 every user now had an additional network drive named `username.orgdomain`.

As you can imagine, this has created slight chaos within the userspace. The documentation that I've looked at here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/askds/using-group-policy-preferences-to-map-drives-based-on-group-membership 

and some conversation on Spiceworks here: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1610401-server-2012-map-user-drives-automatically-no-matter-where-they-login-from have led me to believe that it's simply a default setting enabled via GPO, but I'd welcome any feedback from AD pros. I'm not at all familiar with AD as we mostly trained with Linux in school and my org is purely a Microsoft shop.  

Thank you for any responses, and happy Tuesday."

I have used python to work on data science projects and am comfortable using it there.
I have an internship in a few months where I will be needing to code in Java. 
So I started on the language couple weeks ago thinking that I would be able to get proficient in a week at max considering I'm not new to coding and how everybody says that it's an easy language to learn.

It's been 2 weeks and I'm bored of the language, it's not that it's completely going over my head but for some reason, I just am not able to grasp on to it. I understand the concepts of OOPs and functions and other stuff but for some reason I'm not able to catch on it as quickly as I could with C++ or python. 

I know I have to put in the hours to learn it but everytime I try to put in the effort, my mind just tells me how I could be coding in a language I already know.

I'm just ranting ig, I know it's one of the best and most lucrative languages out there but still.

Could you guys recommend me some course, method or even a set of questions that could motivate me to enough to get comfortable coding in Java."

What next?",General_Wonder3857,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/mq4ckr/didnt_enjoy_software_engineering_consulting_and/,"I'm in my early 20s. I have a degree in computer science. In my free time, I love tinkering with software, servers and programming. I've tried multiple career path over the last years, but can't find what I enjoy doing. 

# What I've tried

## Software Engineer
During my degree, I did an internship as a software engineer in a large company and quickly found out that I don't want to program 40 hours per week for someone else.

## Technology Consulting
I then decided to go on a ""higher-level"" and did an internship as a technology consultant at a Big 4. I didn't like it either, because it was essentially boring project management and I hated it.

## Sales Engineering
For the last ~2 years I've been working as a sales engineer, helping sell enterprise software in a large enterprise. I wanted to improve my social skills and be closer to revenue and the customer.

However, I hate my sales engineering job now too. Maybe it's because I'm depressed (working with a therapist already), but I don't enjoy it. 

I mainly don't believe in the products I have to sell. And I can't focus on my work. I seem so unproductive and can't get to the important tasks. I feel overwhelmed. And I'm more of a night owl and would love to wake up at 12pm or work during late evening. That's when I'm most productive. I hate the tasks I have. It's less about pitching the software and doing demos, instead I answer boring technical questions about the product. 

If I decided to quit within the next year, I would have to pay a fee to stop the contract. And I currently have a really good salary and career opportunities. 

# What I've also considered

I think I should stay in the software ecosystem, because it's what I understand and like.

Software Sales: move up, be closer to commercial aspects, instead of technical details. Maybe. But this is way more responsibility, which I don't think I could take at the moment. 

Strategy consulting (Big 3): just no. I don't want to work 60 hours per week. 

Software product management: no, wouldn't like it I think. Weird position between customer and engineering. Not for me.

Marketing: probably no

VC: maybe... Analysing startups and their technology. Haven't put too much thought into it. This could also help me build a network for my own startup.

**My own startup**: Everything pulls me towards doing my own startup. I think this would be the best option for me. I previously worked on a couple startup-like side-projects and it was really fun. However, so far I don't have any projects I could commit to. This would also allow me to put on different hats throughout the day: can't focus on programming after 3 hours -&gt; I can work on sales for the next hour. I would love to have this flexibility.

If I could pick, I would probably prefer working less hours and get a pay cut, instead of stressing over my job and working 50 hour weeks.

* Which career could I switch to based on my experiences so far? What other options are there?
* Alternatively, how can I make my current role in sales engineering more bearable? 
* How can I get to the point where I can quit my own job to work on a startup?"
mq5e3g,411,2021-04-13,I was rejected/waitlisted by every single college (17+) -- other than my safeties. Reflections from someone who dedicated their entire life to getting into college and what happened after their worst nightmare came true.,throway3471992,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mq5e3g/i_was_rejectedwaitlisted_by_every_single_college/," 

*A) How it felt to get rejected*

In December, I got rejected from my ultimate dream school, UChicago. In March, I got rejected from my later dream school and rejected/waitlisted from every other school except for my state schools. Of course, every rejection hurt like a b\*\*ch. Every rejection meant another opportunity lost and another possible timeline of my life ended. Another step closer to being forced to my state school (no it's not a public ivy). I know that a lot of us can and have related to this, especially in 2021.

I felt humiliated, cheated, and scared. My whole high school career was dedicated to getting that 4.0, highest SAT, getting that internship, etc. And I followed every “step” I was supposed to. So what did I do to deserve this fate? It felt like my whole high school experience was wasted and my future job prospects were undoubtedly doomed.

*B) These rejections disillusioned me*

This isn’t meant to bully [u/abbycat1590](https://www.reddit.com/u/abbycat1590/). I ~~think~~ know that a lot of us continue to share the same toxic mindset as her. I remember distinctly reading her unpopular opinion post after my stream of rejections and agreeing. Here are some quotes from her posts ""Prestige Matters"" "" Unpopular Opinion: If you worked your ass off during High School and end up going to the same university as most other people, you DID waste your time and energy "" "" For those saying that ""developing a work ethic"" is worth all these years of stress, I think burnout is a major issue for those who tryharded during high school and got nothing in return ""

For the next 7 days, I had to take a hard reevaluation of my goals and priorities in life were. Why should the last four years of my life be in vain because I didn't get into a school whose admissions are at best arbitrary and at worst racist, classist, and obviously UNFAIR. (a youtube video by Quon Howery put this into perspective)

Let's all be honest with ourselves. A lot of us want to go to these prestigious colleges because its a status symbol. Tangible proof that we're this or that. A pathway towards getting rich! Sure, some of us really do want to go to explore the intellectual possibilities but that's not the case for all of us (me included).

*C) Post mortem thoughts*

There's always a silver lining to every situation. It took getting rejected from schools I thought I'd love to take the rose-colored lenses off. The sheer amount of cut-throat competition and toxic hustle culture that prevails in these settings can definitely take a toll on one's life quality. Going to an ivy-league college doesn't solve all your problems. If that were the case, why does Cornell have suicide nets under their bridges and a huge number of depressed students? Exactly.

**Snap out of the prestige rat race.**

It doesn't end after April 6th. It never will if you keep chasing external validation like an elite college acceptance. Also, please reconsider what you really think is the most important thing in life is. It's not the highest-paying career or the biggest house. It's the loved ones you laugh with, the friends you help, the shared moments that make life beautiful. 

\---

Please don't waste your life living for other people by DEDICATING your life to chasing prestige, college acceptances, money, status, etc. Another thing is, your college doesn't determine your future success --- your work ethic does. Many of you want to go ivy to get a job in investment banking, Goldman Sachs. Well, the CEO of Goldman Sachs graduated from Hamilton College. But please, remember that being ridiculously rich is not the end-all-be-all for happiness. Don't worry. You got this :)"

My exams are over and I have a QA internship at a very small company (sadly couldn’t get anything better) this summer, but would also like to prepare and apply for summer 2022 internships over the next four months in my free time.

So, what should I focus more on side projects or Leetcode? I understand both are important, but was wondering to learn full stack web dev (already know HTML/CSS/JS and basic Bootstrap/React)

1) should I spend the summer to properly learn full stack by taking an online boot camp like free code camp or Odin project and build my own projects from scratch (giving me a stronger knowledge) or 

2) should I just take a Udemy course or two that teach the mern stack and are project based (the projects are like a full stack e-commerce application)/follow and put tutorial projects on my resume?

The second option seems better to me since almost every common side project idea has a yt video or Udemy course on it and that seems hway faster of a path compared to the first path (building the project on my own), allowing me to focus more on leetcode, which this sub makes seem so important. 

Also note, haven’t started any leetcode yet/struggle with LC easies. 


Would appreciate any advice.

I am currently a junior pursuing a BA in Biology and Health and am hoping to apply to genetic counseling masters programs next year. However, the second half of my sophomore year and the entirety of my junior year have essentially been screwed up due to covid. This is extremely unfortunate for me, as I was counting on these years to build rapport with professors and secure future recommenders. Classes I took in my first year and a half of schooling were large and impersonal, and I formed no relationships with professors. With the transition to zoom classes, I have found it extremely difficult to connect with my professors, even in smaller classes. Office hours have been by appointment only, and many classes are asynchronous. Due to this, I find myself performing well, but not developing any personal relationships.

Anyway, here are my current prospects (I need 3 LORs): 

\-My most solid one is from a zoom class I had last semester where I got to know the professor a bit by going to office hours, and performed well. The class also directly related to my field of interest. I am pretty certain she will write me a decent recommendation. 

\-I could probably ask one of the directors my internship program, who I have been working with for a while since my internship rolled over from last summer to this summer due to covid. I am hoping this relationship will build throughout this summer as I have my internship and will become more solid.

\-I am currently taking a class with a professor I like a lot, but he doesn't really know me personally. I've spoken to him on several occasions after class and always try to participate but thats about it. And get this- I was hoping to take his lab class next semester where an older friend of mine told me she really got to know him.... but today I found out he is going on paternity leave and the class will be taught by a different professor. Of course. 

\-I joined a research lab this semester and was hoping to get to know the director, but due to covid restrictions, all I've been able to do thus far is husbandry tasks like prepping and cleaning mouse cages, and I have had minimal contact with the lab's director.

&amp;#x200B;

So, as you can see I'm not completely out of luck. However, I feel as though neither of the first two references I could possibly secure are ""strong"", and the last two prospects would need a lot more development before I could even ask.  I hear all the time about people having close, personal relationships with their professors and I feel as though I do not have that, and I'm scared it will hurt me in the application process. How much will this hurt me? Is this normal? And how can I go about strengthening my relationship with these possible references with only a month remaining in this semester and a little bit more time in the beginning of next semester before I need to ask for recs? Any feedback, help, or advice would be appreciated!"

I've been receiving a lot of helpful information searching through this reddit so I'd like to thank everyone that takes the time to help people like myself who need advice.

**Information about me**
I'm 25 years old and the last 4 years I've been working in a luxury highrise condominium in South Florida as the ""IT"" or the ""Operations Admin""  for the building. In this job I was able to learn how employee databases work internally, some networking, and other small things here and there. During this time I have also been studying at my University for my B.S. in Cyber Security but only been able to take 1-2 classes every other semester since I can't afford more due to not having financial aid or any scholarships/grants.

In terms of knowledge, I studied and took a Net+ course but never got to take the exam, so I know some information. A+ I need to study as well but I'm pretty sure with just self-teaching and things I already know I can pass the A+ pretty easily. 

**What I'm seeking**
I would like to start an entry level job that's secure and I can be exposed to the field more. I was recommended an ""Analyst"" job but they seem to require years of experience on the job and some certifications. I don't want to set myself up for failure and want to be careful with job choices since I just recently moved out and have accrued new bills. My former manager recommended a Hospital entry level IT job but I'm not sure if that's necessarily going to teach me anything since it might just be too basic.

I was also recommended to look for an internship but I'm not sure if there are any internships outside of the 8-5 work hours or only on weekends. I have no problem with an internship from 6pm+ or any time on weekends but they are pretty rare.

**Learning**
I'm trying my best to use my free-time to listen to Professor Messer, podcasts, advise channels of the career, and others while I drive or I'm at home. I would love to get my A+, Net+, Sec+, Linux+, OSCP, Pen+, etc. 

**My goal**
My goal is to work in a government agency in the future as I build my experience and resume. Or even some sort of red-team. 


**TLDR/Questions**

1) What's a good pathway in terms of certifications/studying to go in?

2) Where can you find good internships or entry level jobs for cyber security while working a fulltime monday-friday job? Or a good paying job in Miami/SFL. (Are there any pre-reqs I should have before applying for one?)

3) Other suggestions of things I can work/study on for a Government-related job? Good sources on YouTube or Podcasts that guide you in a good direction?

4) Other advice from personal experience I can take?"
mq7yc1,1,2021-04-13,How to properly leverage another offer at my current job?,juvenile_josh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mq7yc1/how_to_properly_leverage_another_offer_at_my/,"So I started a new job last August as a FullStack Dev. It rolled over from an internship and I have really have loved my job thus far and am making good money (70k) with solid benefits in Norfolk VA (which is pretty low CoL). We've been remote thus far and at first I wasn't too keen on it cause I was locked in my house and couldn't go anywhere but I ended up moving in with my parents again and building a life in my childhood hometown in NoVA over covid while working remote. I also reconnected with a friend from college and we began seeing each other over covid and I've built a really solid community too here that I wasn't expecting but am so thankful for.

Although for the time being I haven't really been looking for a job, a smaller company contacted me for a fully remote position in Data Engineering (what I really want to do) for 90k and an 10% sign on cause they saw my LinkedIn and Hired.com profiles and wanted to chat. The interview is tomorrow but I've already been talking with some of the engineers and they seem really genuine and I like the work there too.

At first it was just to gain experience in interviewing and stuff. But I've reached the point where I am dreading the day I was gonna be asked to come in to work again in person cause that would make things long distance (3hr drive) with my girlfriend and would move me away from my friends at home. I love my job and my team and we just started a new project so I really would hate to leave them so soon, but the new job is exactly what I wanted (smaller company, less bureaucracy, data engineering, remote, better pay).

Out of a sense of duty, I feel bad just throwing my old team away but I want to leverage this opportunity to ask to be fully remote. I don't necessarily want a pay raise or anything (although it would be nice) but I just can't see myself going back in person anytime soon. I love the freedom to work from wherever and I like being able to be in my hometown with my girlfriend and friends and family and not feel tied down at the same time. I'll keep the old job if they let me stay remote but otherwise I think I want the new job.

Tl;dr I want to leverage another offer to my existing job for the opportunity to be fully remote due to changing life circumstances. How do I leverage that with my current job properly? Is it a shitty thing to do after only 8 months?"

I started the MSc in 2019, and completed all exams with a good grade, but had to defer the dissertation which was meant to be completed over that summer due to illness, thus have the opportunity to complete it this summer between June-September (12 weeks). 

Since 2020 September, I have been applying for internship roles at companies so I can gain experience as a jr developer but have had no luck, and since February I also started applying for graduate roles. In the last few days, I have received two separate offers. 

1) One being a minimum wage internship at a startup for 6 months part time (20 hrs per week). This would allow me to earn money whilst working in my dream role part time, and give me time to work on my dissertation over the summer period as I'm only doing 20 hours per week.

2) Another company has offered me a 2 year contract, where I'd be working 40 hours per week, on £30,000 per year for those two years. The way the programme works is, I would be trained inhouse for 3 months intensively, then sent to work with clients for the remaining 21 month period. However, it's very unlikely I would complete my dissertation if I take this role as I doubt I'd have enough free time to do the work, and my tutor has advised against full time roles whilst doing this.

I guess the issue I'm having is: the point of my MSc was to get a jr developer role, which I have now gained, and I don't have to wait 6 months to complete my studies. However, I am a little worried about the salary (£30,000 isn't on the upper scale, especially in London), and the sunk cost of my MSc programme (around £11,000). Further, the company is a startup - very similar to Digital Futures, and I would be the first cohort.

Is there much benefit to completing the programme if I've achieved my goal of getting a jr developer role?

I've been given exploding offers from both companies as they want me to start as soon as next week, so I appreciate any and all responses to my situation."

Is it worth mentioning my school in education if I withdrew?

I attended the best school in my country and I have several of these 4 month internships on my resume which raises an eye brow to some interviewers. I've left out that I attended this school and withdrew from it for personal reasons but I wasn't sure if it's worth putting on my resume or not.

It comes from a fear of interviewers looking at it and seeing how I'm a drop out (although I have 3 years of experience by now in total) and passing on me. 

I was recently told by one to mention since the school is quite well known in the US especially among FAANG but then again I did not complete my degree and I withdrew so I don't know if its in my best interest to mention it. 

I attended this school for a degree in comp sci so it is related to the work I do but didn't get past 3rd year.

I am graduating in May with my bachelors in comp sci. I interned for a year at a company and liked it a lot, and we discussed me coming back after my final semester, as I wanted to leave so I could focus on school.

However, now they have messaged me asking if I intend to come back and work with them full time once I graduate. I want to keep them in mind as a last resort, but what they have offered other interns (\~60k / year) is about 20k lower than what I want to receive in terms of salary ideally. They  have not offered this to me yet, but my fellow interns have told me that is what they were offered upon being brought on full time. 

I have some other companies which I plan on applying to soon, and have a fair chance of receiving a job offer from. However, I don't want to simply ignore this company I interned at, just in case I do end up needing to be employed by them. 

How do I handle this situation? Do I tell my former employer I am still looking at other options? Is that rude? Also, should I bring up my offer from my former employer at interviews with new potential employers? Thanks for any help guys I appreciate it."

I'm trying to decide between the CS/BBA double degree program with Waterloo and CS at UofT St. George. I'm still doing a lot of research between the two options and I'd love to hear you guys' opinion. So far I've got this pros and cons list for each program.

# UofT:

**Pros:**

* Prestigious program
* Cheaper (I'll be commuting)
* New CS internship program launching fall 2021

**Cons:**

* Not as prestigious as a Waterloo CS degree
* POST (I'll be eligible for the new guaranteed entry thing though but still)
* Work terms are much longer (12 - 20 months vs 4 months)

# Laurier:

**Pros:**

* A CS degree from Waterloo
* 2 valuable degrees from reputed programs
* Co-op

**Cons:**

* Expensive (because of residence)
* 5 year program 
* More demanding workload (because 2 degrees)

That's all I've got so far, if anyone's got any advice for me I really appreciate it. Also, if anyone is currently in one of these programs or knows someone who is, and wouldn't mind sharing their experience with me that would be great (you can PM me if you'd prefer). Thank you so much, I'm going crazy trying to compare every single little thing on my own so your opinions are very helpful!"

   * Known for 4 years from chess, high grade in elective class but I didn't participate a LOT (still did tho), he knew me well enough though
* College Access Counselor from CBO: 8/10
   * Also a loudmouth during his meetings; I cleaned up my act because I needed to focus on colleges and got along with him much better
* Counselor Rec: 9/10
   * Based off information about my personal life that I provided; knew me and my personality very well; helped explain the reason behind why my grades were so low for a period of time

**Interviews**

* Columbia (8/10)
   * Really chill conversation, missed out on talking about a popular Netflix series that's related to an extracurricular I literally did LMFAO I regret very much that I did not watch it
* Cornell (6.5/10)
   * Was one of those informational meetings, the guy was nice yeah but it physically pained me to carry the entire convo lol
* Chose not to do optional interviews at Lafayette, Hamilton, Syracuse (yikes)

**Essays**

I think my personal statement was meh/decent, others said it was a good essay. Wrote about my pursuit of wonderment and learning. I busted my ass for my Cornell supp (for a couple hours at least) and related my interest in earth science to helping improve the environment. I wrote one really good ""Why Us"" essay and copied and pasted it for like 6 different colleges. Columbia supps weren't that good tbh I didn't even follow their instructions when submitting them LMAO

**Decisions** (all my schools are RD except Binghamton and UAlbany)

*Acceptances:*

* Cornell (guaranteed transfer) !!!!!
* BU
* Syracuse
* Binghamton EA
* UAlbany EA
* 6 CUNYs

*Waitlists:*

* Hamilton
* Lafayette

*Rejections:*

* Columbia
* Williams
* Amherst
* NYU
* Macaulay Honors
* Stony Brook (still kinda offended tbh)

**Additional Information:**

I was so hype over getting into BU because it was my dream school! At that point, I did not even think about getting into NYU or Ivy Day because I was already satisfied. Ivy Day came by and I got a rejection from Columbia and I also thought I got a rejection for Cornell and even told my family I got rejected to both ivies at first and later when I actually read the email in depth I realized it was a guaranteed transfer so I got accepted omg!!!! I'm torn between going to BU and Cornell, but I'm leaning towards picking BU.

I had no hopes for my 3.5 GPA getting anywhere because it's just so low for applying to the ivies and other T20s with all the 4.0s in the same pool. I think my personality was really able to shine through with my recs and my essays, so that made up for my GPA. Overall, I'm very pleased with my decisions!!!"
mqevoc,1,2021-04-13,Internship opportunities for CS+ECON,Accomplished-Kick-68,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/mqevoc/internship_opportunities_for_csecon/,"I am admitted to ""CS+ECON"" at UIUC, CS for few other colleges and considering UIUC due to quality of the program and job/internship opportunities it provides. At the same time a bit concerned it is not true CS program.

[1.Is](https://1.Is) the career center part of UIUC as a whole (or) is it handled at college level(LSA/Grainger)? 

2.Who organizes job fair/internship fair/HackIllinois etc? Is it hosted by career center (or) by individual colleges like Grainger (or) individual depts. like Grainger CS? 

[3.How](https://3.How) are internship/job fair(s) work? Are there any fair(s) or opportunities that Grainger CS students can participate but not CS+ECON students? 

4.For CS+ECON students, technically belong to LSA but they take more classes from Grainger CS. Also depending on how they choose courses it can be 2/3 CS and 1/3 ECON.  Does it mean they will spend more time in engineering building(s) or LSA building(s)? 

5.  I heard in other colleges internship after freshman/sophomore year can be challenge but more realistic in junior year. Is this same for UIUC as well? 

&amp;#x200B;

What is the outlook for ""CS+ECON"" students? What kind of job placement/internship opportunities are available for CS+ECON students?"

Currently I am a personal banker with a few years of banking experience. I am really unhappy in my current role and am desperately wanting to shift out of the retail side of finance industry. After some research I believe a Financial Analyst role is what I am most interested in. I am mostly seeking remote positions but have been applying for jobs since October 2020 with no luck. I have applied for well over 100 jobs and can’t seem to even get an interview. I even had my resume reviewed by a professional and still no luck. I have even applied to many internships and junior positions. I am unsure what I am doing wrong. I had my first interview this morning and I didn’t get the job due to my lack of experience. However, I don’t know how to get experience when no one will let me. It’s really starting to weigh on me especially as I see peers succeeding with great jobs and I can’t even get my foot in the door. Will I have to wait another six months just for an interview for a job I won’t get? Is the job market that bad? Or am I doing something wrong?? Any advice would help!"
mqfdp4,8,2021-04-13,Narcissistic AP read gossip tabloids religiously and love talking maliciously about people completely unrelated to them,Cinderella_894,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/mqfdp4/narcissistic_ap_read_gossip_tabloids_religiously/,"My Asian parents love gossiping about literally everybody, and often in a malicious way, about our neighbours, their colleagues, random celebrities and ESPECIALLY my classmates. The funny thing is, they always manage to find something negative to say about these people, no matter who they are. Our neighbours are annoying because they have a dog which barks every time it sees a stranger; the security guards of our residential building are idle and stupid; their colleagues are mostly evil and always plot against them (apparently they are always the innocent ones). Every time they go to a bank they manage to criticise whoever speaks to them and offers them service, complaining that the person is 'slow' and unhelpful. Even when it comes to the few friends that they have, they are always 'not smart enough' and not up to their 'perfect' standards. The most annoying thing is when it comes to my classmates or friends. They take great pleasure in evaluating everyone and concluding that nearly everyone has some serious defect and is extremely incompetent due to their age (even though they are in fact the immature and malicious ones). I'm in college now and every time I go home for the vacation they would ask repeatedly about news of my previous high school classmates, who they're dating and what they're doing with their lives. It's utterly DEPLORABLE. They even gossip together with another pair of bored parents and say really malicious things in particular about the girls who are in relationships (they're sexist so no surprise here). The thing that annoys me as fuck is WHY they are interested in people so much younger than them, who have no influence on their (or even my) lives and mock them relentlessly. The only people they like are the really boring nerds who have no romantic/social life because there is simply nothing they could comment on. Also one they somehow discovered one of my classmates did badly in college and failed to get an internship over the summer they became absolutely exhilarated and would go on hours about how stupid this person is and how he will be useless for the rest of his life. And that person is not even CLOSE to me.

My mom also believes everything she reads in tabloids about celebrities, especially the very exaggerated and fake details. Every time she reads about some embarrassing scandal she would become all excited and talk about it for a whole evening. And when I tell her something is complete BS, she would refuse to believe me and insist on digging out every detail of the story. She worships tabloids like the most devoted pilgrim and will not hear a word against even the most far-fetched stories. Indeed she spends her entire free time either soaking herself in some Korean soap drama or religiously flipping through all the tabloid sites. Not a single story that ends badly misses her attention; hearing her speak is like a faithful recitation of all the tabloid front pages. And she spends entire meal times doing that to me and my dad (who is generally on the phone cause he doesn't know any celebrity and so doesn't care anyway - he has no clue who Malala is). Either she talks about that or moans about some other person in her life (colleague, neighbour, bank clerk) being a miserable person and making her suffer. Nothing good ever seems to happen to her. However, once when I visited her at the cafe next to her firm I saw her chatting happily with two fellow colleagues over coffee and doesn't seem miserable at all.

What's worse, nothing positive ever interests her. It is only when there is someone going bankrupt, someone who is embroiled in some sex scandal or when someone who is attacked by all the mainstream media that she gleefully shares the story. You would not be able to imagine the joy sparkling from my Asian mom's eyes when she reads that Meghan and Harry have a conflict with the royal family, and she literally says: 'Look, I always knew this Meghan was no good and now she's gonna pay for it.' (She's been attacking Meghan ever since she came into media attention). Also when Paris Hilton shot that documentary about her traumatic school experience she simply refuses to believe it and says that this is yet another lie concocted by Paris Hilton to increase her fame. Oh and apparently Macron's wife seduced him into marrying him and is so lucky to have one of the most handsome men in Europe. The only female celebrity she idolises endlessly is Kim Kardashian because she thinks that it is 'incredibly brave and astute of her to create fame at the expense of her private life despite all the pressure from the public'. Ironically, she is generally a very conservative person but somehow she is convinced that Kim Kardashian is the best example of the modern independent woman who would go to any lengths to achieve fame and wealth.

Anyone else's parents have similarly weird habits/ unhealthy opinions about others? Maybe I should recommend my mom to quit her job and become a full-time tabloid journalist?"
mqfl43,5,2021-04-13,"Please help chance me, very anxious. Business/finance",TakataJyuu,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/mqfl43/please_help_chance_me_very_anxious_businessfinance/,"Okay, so my schools guidance counselor has never really helped me at all and I dont know what I'm doing. Most of my ecs have not been maintained for a while, and I have not won any major awards. Can someone give me tips on what I should do for the summer???

**Field**: **Business/Finance**

**About me:**

* From Northern Virginia/DC-Metropolitan Area (which means that everyone here is **super** competitive, **super** involved and has **super** good ecs and stats). 
* competitive public high school w/ 2500+ students
* Japanese and Asian (wasian, but more asian than white, **would it help to put only white**, or both???)
* Mother is an immigrant, no relatives in USA which makes this college process really difficult for me because i dont know what I'm doing...
* Parents went to CC 
* 200k+ income however we live in an area where everything is extremely expensive and most money is spent on rent and basic utilities so in reality is much lower..

**Recognition/Certification:**

* Academic Honor Roll
* AFR/ANG Classic Teen Leadership Summit 
* Japanese Language Proficiency Test N5
* Hoping to get AP awards from this year

**Grades/Academics**:

* All As. two A minuses in biology HN freshman year and chemistry HN sophomore year.
* 3.95 UW 4.34 W (the way my school weights classes, no one in the entire school has above a 4.6)
* 6 APs (taking four APs 1 DE senior year), all honors classes except math in freshman and sophomore year
* 5 on AP World exam, 3 on AP Comp sci exam, haven't taken the rest yet
* College credit in  MEC 195 Special Topics in Engineering Technology
* Took SAT the same day i figured out my grandma was dying. Got a low score, 1340. Will retake in a month. 
* Will get an advanced diploma with a seal of biliteracy and civics seal

**School ECs**

* Treasurer of the Computer Science Honor Society - helped teach kids how to code in the library, helped bring enrollment in club from **13 members to 53**
* Officer of the Asian American Student Association
* Officer of Key Club - started multiple drives to help children during the pandemic at youth shelters
* Student Ambassador for my school's Student Ambassador Program
* Part of student goverment
* Ive applied to be a Student representative to the FCPS school board but dont know the results yet (probably not, these DC and Thomas Jefferson kids are crazy qualified)
* Member of almost all honor societies + NHS
* Model UN
* Key Club

**Outside of school:**

* Business Professionals of America (BPA): Joined in January, scheduled to compete in open events
* Social Media and marketing intern for nonprofit Keelworks
* Marketing and public relations manager for The Vanilla House, a bakery
* Virginia Aerospace Science &amp; Technology Scholars Program (VASTS): accepted for and participated in a six-month long program sponsored by NASA
* VASTS summer academy: Invitational summer academy for program mentioned above for the top performers
* Civil Air Patrol: C/Sra and was an O-Ride Specialist. Basically youth military club focused on aerospace and emergency services-i helped in COVID-19 support. Our squadron was titled Squadron of Merit &amp; Groundteam of the year
* NSLI-Y: Extremely selective state department-sponsored program for foreign language immersion(Korean in my case)
* Figure skating (six years!!): I can do doubles, haven't started competing until recently. Part of ISIS and will compete in April and June

Extra considerations: 

* I am a military child-moved four times throughout my childhood which made me a bit hesitant to get involved in the community at first.
* I am really passionate about foreign languages! I am planning on taking three proficiency tests this summer in German, Japanese ( already have N5) and Spanish. Studying Chinese Spanish and French as of now. In senior year of high school I will take Korean 1, AP German, and ASL.

Schools: 

* Reach: Columbia, UPenn, (will apply ED to either Upenn or Columbia, cant choose..), UVA, Brown, Yale, Harvard, NYU, Oxford, Cornell, University of Texas, UC Berkely, UChicago, Umichigan
* Safeties: University of North Dakota, Virginia Tech, Penn state

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So that's it. I am 100% aware that I pretty much have nothing that really distinguishes me ( I was planning on making it my ability to work well with languages but i dont think colleges care much for that) 

Can someone tell me if I should even bother applying for ivies? It has been my dream to go but Im not a national competitor or anything...or I would appreciate any advice in general :(("

mqh6b2,11,2021-04-13,How much free time do you have?,External_Brief_6829,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/mqh6b2/how_much_free_time_do_you_have/,"This is kind of a silly question. 

I have just received big4 internship offers and am excited to start my audit internship in Winter 2022. I will either be in Chicago or NYC (have offers in both and I just haven’t decided yet). I will then join the firm for a full time position (if all goes well) in Spring of 2023. While this is still quite a bit away, I am already looking forward/planning for it and I have some questions regarding free time.

In a lot of the Reddit posts I’ve read or coffee chats I’ve been on with people in Big4, it is obviously well known that people in public accounting are over worked, especially in busy season. I’ve heard the stories of working until midnight, working on the weekends, being stressed all the time, etc.

I’m just curious if I will still be able to do things like get to the gym everyday? Will I be able to go to dinner with (non-accounting) friends? Will I be able to sleep in on Saturday? Can I spend my evenings relaxing and doing personal things or will I really be constantly working? Is going out to bars on a weeknight out of the question?"
mqhibx,1083,2021-04-13,Job Offer after 1 Year and Over 900 Applications,ChrevanGohas,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/mqhibx/job_offer_after_1_year_and_over_900_applications/,"Hoping this inspires hope to some of you out there, whether you graduated last year or maybe you're nearing graduation and neck deep in the job search. I have a lot on my mind so I just want to dump some thoughts here while it's all fresh in my head.

**The Lore** (optional)

I graduated in 2020 (MechE) and was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed despite the recent lockdown. At that point, I hadn't had internship experience but did have solid research/team leadership experience. So early in the lockdown days (Mid-March) I was fervently sending out my resume, confident that my background would attract attention within a couple months. From Day 1 I was putting out 10+ applications a day using Indeed, LinkedIn, Handshake, etc. The first month passed with nothing to show but a long list of rejection emails.

No matter, I thought. The pandemic is in its peak, unemployment is at a high, I'm competing against applicants with many more years of experience, for companies who are cutting risk wherever they can to stay afloat. With around 100 applications out, the battle rages on.

Soon, my graduation rolls around. Many of my friends in engineering have a connection to the industry which allows them a job right out of college. I'm feeling the frustration and pressure well up and begin to think people will start to judge me soon for not getting a job. There's still time, I think. I revise my resume several times. I'm over 200 applications out. The battle rages on.

I pick up a small office job. Just something for the summer, I tell myself.

The summer comes and goes.

400 applications.

I stop recording the exact number in my excel sheet but can't help but make a mental note after every 10 applications.

I'm asking my friends, family, friends of friends, friends of family of friends, if they have any connection to the industry. I get a few emails to send my resume to. I get an interview with a company that promptly ghosts me within a week. Soon it's November.

550.

The holiday season and the new year give me a second wind. Seasonal depression is kicking my ass but we keep pushing forward. People at the office are starting to ask more frequently when I'll be getting my engineering job. My friends are asking the same thing. And so are my parents. The pressure keeps mounting. 

750.

It's January now. A couple more interviews and a couple more ghostings amidst the sea of rejection emails. It's becoming apparent that I can't use COVID as a primary excuse any more. The days feel empty and the nights feel hopeless.

900.

Present day. For whatever reason, 900 was where I really entered into despair. It felt like nothing was good enough. I kept getting these glimpses of potential, and I'd allow myself to get my hopes up only to constantly get pushed back to square 1. It got bad. Really bad. Anyone who struggled to find their first job knows the complex mix of emotions when that stage lingers on too long. I wasn't sure if the day would ever come.

But it came. With sweat on my brow and all down my back staining my dress shirt, I walked out of the building, the last words I heard (or registered, maybe) ""Congratulations."" Not just an offer, but an offer at my dream position, at a dream company, at a dream location. The page was flipped to a new chapter, and for the first time in a very, very long time, my shoulders relaxed and my whole body felt nothing but relief. My mind stopped racing, my heart was beating out a slow rhythmic beat, and it felt like Sisyphus had finally gotten the rock to the top of the mountain. 


**The Takeaway** (also optional)

This will be similar to many other posts in this subreddit, but I figured I'd include it. Finding a job is hard, even in engineering where there's an expectation that engineers are sought after in the job market. It's even harder to find a job in a pandemic. I'm not sure if you're a student or employed or in limbo with the job search, but in any case here are some little knowledge nuggets I picked up along the way.

* Fuck COVID-19
* It might be worth getting your resume professionally reviewed. I noticed a pretty significant increase in callbacks after I had my resume revised. It costs a pretty penny depending on where you do it but if it means your best shot at a dream career, it's probably worth it.
* Talk about your frustration. Be honest with yourself and those close to you about how you're actually feeling about the process. The amount of times I said ""Oh, ya know, no job yet but we're still pushing on"" made me want to rip my hair out. Some weekends I just went and got a drink with my buddy who was also struggling to find a job and we were always just able to talk about our frustrations and be like ""yeah man this whole thing sucks and I hate it"" and it always made me feel better.
* Don't compare your progress to others. Just don't. You'll be miserable 24/7. Try your best not to care about what others may think of you and just focus on doing the most with what you have.
* If I can do it, trust me. You can too.

Best of luck out there, guys and gals. Feel free to PM me with your job search frustrations if you have any yourself. I hope your new chapter comes soon, and I look forward to reading all your success stories on this subreddit as the months continue.

All the best."

The captain wakes up hearing someone banging on his door to get up and deal with something. 

An intern that was only there for another week to help him graduate his military theory school. Now stuck there until the first contact is made and it's guaranteed to be peaceful. Otherwise he'd be a statistics officer.

Was banging on the door of the captains office. Ever since the one ""incident"" the intern hasn't been allowed in his office without his permission. The captain stands up groggily needing some of his favourite dor'vah juice.

He opens the door seeing the tra'dorg intern standing nervously. The captain immediately snaps out of his sleepiness and is getting the same nervous look the tra'dorg is. The only time he's ever seen one get nervous is when it had a feeling that it was going to fail its entire species.

The tra'dorg the captain is talking about is the reason the tra'dorg are equals among the thor'vaxians. They even have their own symbol alongside the medal that is given to throx'norns because of him. 

The captain rushes the intern to lead him to the area he needs to be. The intern takes him to the diplomatic room and inside he sees a very clear prey species. The captain all of a sudden understands why the tra'dorg is so nervous. 

The captain prepares himself to meet the small prey species. he puts on his diplomatic attire. He tries to calm himself down and try to give the prey a sense of calm so it doesn't try to flee and cause a giant misunderstanding. The captain steps in not allowing its teeth to show and takes a seat across from the 5 diplomats. He almost greets them with a smile but stops himself before he shows off his teeth. 

The prey creatures in front of him seem to be confused for a second before they look at their tablets. Then they all look at each other and look up at him.

""We know you are a predator species. You do not need to hide this fact. We have spent most of our species existence as friends with predators and do not have the flight response you are so used to.""

The captain is surprised at the bluntness of the prey species. which he quickly looks for in the database he was given access to. The species is called kylanna. It is described as looking similar to the Earth's ferret but only in looks. The diet is similar in that they are omnivores, but research has found they became omnivores from being protected by a larger predatory species that used them to protect their children. The kylanna fed off the meat scraps, insects, fruits, and parasites that would hurt the predators children. These parasites would either give the child infertility or a defect in their growth.

The captain then smiles and relaxes at that as he now knows he will not cause a diplomatic incident. 

The captain then asks, ""do you have a pack bonding then since the predator kept you as its protectors."" 

The kylanna nod ""yes one of our biggest markets is the adoption of the Fjall, we have since eradicated the parasites though. so there is no need to keep an eye on their children as we once did. The Fjall to the [untranslatable] looks like a mix of a [untranslatable] and a dog.""

The captain then says: ""two of those words didnt translate the one where you said the mix of the two animals and what the fjall to a certain species looks like."" 

The kylanna looks confused for a second before looking at their tablets after a few seconds one speaks up. ""Sorry we used our language equivalents to the Mammoth and the Humans""

The captain then looks at the database and looks for Humans but doesn't find an entry. ""Who are these Humans they do not show up in the database""

The kylanna look at eachother then to the captain. ""The humans weren't the first ones to introduce themselves""

The captain shakes his head no

The middle kylanna looks at his tablet and types something and sends something off. After a couple minutes he then types something else and the captain receives a transmission.

The captain looks down at his tablet and sees a book called. ""Humanity the coin with more than 2 faces"" and a second with a diagram of what's supposedly a human and a description.

The kylanna then offers a gift of an ornate lamp. ""This diplomatic discussion has been a great experience thank you. Safe travels sir.""

The captain barely acknowledges their departure as he's staring at the diagram in confusion. He reads a bit of the description and it says. Humans started at the bottom of the food chain even before they grew a brain. Humans were prey and lived in the trees to hide from predators. This fact made Binocular vision beneficial instead of the typical eyes on the side of the head. Humans after a point started to grow in intelligence but that fact made them lose a lot in physical strength and physical defences as well as offensive parts on their body. This not only made them resent their own weakness, but made them strive for more. Their predators began to run from the humans as they learned to throw spears and Rocks which made the hunters the hunted. This adaptation was quickly used on other humans as well causing many conflicts between tribes. This led to humans branching off into multiple areas. 

The captain stops their already flabbergasted that this creature he is looking at is marked as an Apex predator. this thing has no teeth sharp enough to break a tough hide or even claws strong enough to scratch tree bark. There is nothing that leads him to believe that something that started as a prey became a planet's top predator. He sees pictures of the primitive weapons and shows the first sign of emotion since he became a captain. He stares at the weapons with a sense of fear as they looked primitive but were way more advanced from what his people made. These tools were made for war before they even had a word for it.

The tools were named a spear, a bow and an axe. Were all weapons his people created after making a spoken language.

He continues to read the diagram.

There were multiple species of humans; only one exists today. Homo sapiens as they call themselves. There once were pygmy humans but they were killed off by the sapiens. Then there was homo erectus which was one of the first to be eradicated. Homo neanderthal was eradicated but in a special way. They either died off from being outcompeted by the sapiens or joined the sapiens in clans or tribes. Even though homo neanderthal was the seemingly best human being, stronger, smarter and faster. They lacked the ability to have a large social group leading to their downfall.

Humans then conquered the majority of their world that they knew of. There was lots of conflict in this time they got into the bronze age and quickly went into the iron age this went on until the 19th century or year 1800 ad when they entered the industrial age And only 100 years later entered the space age.

This statement floored the captain. It took his civilization 400 years to leave his planet after making it to the industrial age. He continues to read completely disbelieving everything he is reading but too curious to stop. 

The description then says. Although before the space age there were 3 major conflicts leading in the entire planet going to war with each other. Two were marked with great bloodshed one of these conflicts even ended in 2 nuclear blasts the 3rd ended with only a couple proxy wars but there was no fighting between the two major powers. One of these major powers was the one that landed on the moon and the one we will be focusing on from now on. This country is named the USA, United States, or America. If you meet humans you will be mostly interacting with this country's military. Although they will not be under this name they will be called the EUC or Earth's United Countries. 

The captain knew about nukes but, their scientists could never crack the science behind them. 

He kept reading into their later history only to be woken up still in the room. 

The tra'dorg that woke him up earlier is there in the room with him. ""Sir you've been in here for half the day just reading the tablet, you falling asleep was the first time you put it down."" 

The captain looks harrowed. ""We need peace with these Human people"

**Reflection:**

**Why wasn't I accepted into my dream schools? What could I have done better?**

1.	I didn't have a very strong ""spike."" My ECs were spread across the board in economics, visual arts, and journalism. While I did explain the causes and significance of my interest in various fields, I failed to mention why my other passions were relevant to my pursuits in business.
2.	I should have considered applying for film to more schools since that is a relatively unsaturated field compared to economics. A hunch of mine is that I could have applied as a film major to Northwestern and gotten in, then switched to Econ. This isn't talked about very much but it definitely seems like a possibility.
3.	When reviewing my application I realized that it wasn't formatted very well. Even though I applied for economics to most schools, my awards were almost completely visual arts awards. Even though AOs say not to repeat information said elsewhere, I wish I would have omitted some of these awards and replaced them with my most significant economics/business awards so that it would be at the forefront of my application.
4.	Like I mentioned before, I prioritized quantity over quality which was probably a mistake given the importance of essays, especially this year. It takes time for me to put a personal voice in my essays, and for some supplements, I just did not spend enough time just researching the college rather than just name-dropping specific classes, professors, and programs. This likely showed and was the reason I was rejected from the schools I did not want to go to as much.
5.	While my standardized test score is strong, my ECs and grades are both pretty subpar compared to admitted students, especially of my background. Part of me blames my competitive school environment, but I also failed to reach the goals I set for myself and burnt out. In retrospect, I should have prioritized what classes and ECs mattered most to me and built my application around those strong points.
6.	Didn't ED or REA anywhere due to a sudden change of heart (don't waste this opportunity!)

I knew that rejection was inevitable, but this college admissions process was definitely a humbling experience. I had the unrealistic expectation that my test scores would carry my application, but AP test scores and SAT II scores are virtually meaningless and ACT/SAT scores were weighed less heavily this year. Overall these results are very expected and I'm glad to have a place to go to this upcoming fall.

I hope this post helps a few of you out!! Feel free to ask questions.

Edit: Thank you for all the kind words. I am headed to NYU Stern so definitely pm me if you want to link up!"

mqlcbl,367,2021-04-14,I FINALLY GOT AN OFFER!!!,moonymoody,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mqlcbl/i_finally_got_an_offer/,"Been applying since December of 2019 and almost 1000+ applications and 33 interviews later, I finally have an offer. The last year has been nothing short of a nightmare, especially considering I am a fresh grad in a foreign country with no previous experience and and my last work experience was an internship that got over in March 2020. The salary itself isn’t the greatest, but I’m just glad to have been offered a role that I really wanted in a good company (my major is semiconductor manufacturing). 

I know to say “keep applying” and “it’s all just a numbers game” sounds very cliched. But it is what it is. I did everything remotely possible to get interviews-kept updating my resume, did a ton of online courses that’s needed for people in my field, tried networking (college alumni, parents’ associates, relatives, friends). Hell I even went to the extent of texting a recruiter on Reddit, although that amounted to nothing. And most importantly, I worked on improving my interview skills. To that regard, Reddit has been incredibly helpful. It took me a while to understand that you cannot be completely honest during interviews, it has to be 60% you being yourself and 40% saying what the interviewer wants to hear. This might be debatable in some cases, but it worked in my favor. 

The last year and half has been mentally exhausting. All the rejections, ghosting, false hopes had ruined my mental health to no ends. When it got too overwhelming I’d take a week’s break, invest in some show and then get right back to it. These little breaks did wonders tbh. Made me realise how I had just reduced my 20s to finding a job and my happiness only revolved around that? 

So to all the people still looking for jobs, I wish you the very best of luck! Hope everything works out for you. 

TLDR: sorry if this was too long, but I just got an offer and I’m really happy about it."
mqnk34,0,2021-04-14,clusterProfiler result - undergrad lab intern needs help,moritsih,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/mqnk34/clusterprofiler_result_undergrad_lab_intern_needs/,"Hey fellow bioinformaticians!

I'm currently doing a small internship at a lab. Looking for new things to do, I got a set of files called ""clusterProfiler result\_BP\_xxx"" from the PhD student I'm interning for (he's a wetlab scientist and the files were left behind by a previous PhD student, so my current ""boss"" doesn't know anything about them either).   
Being unfamiliar with the package at the time, I browsed the net and came accross clusterProfiler. I realized, that the output of the enrichGO function is exactly what I have on my hands. 

I have multiple files (20 in BP, 20 in CC and 20 in reactome; it's a study on caloric restriction in mice) that each contain columns like ""geneRatio"", ""BgRatio"", ""pValue"" and functional cluster names - that's how I identified them as the enrichGO-function output. 

Now, I've tried a lot of things in R, attempting to import them to visualize the data using cnetplot/dotplots etc, but I'm just not getting there. After days of googling and exhausting the search results connected to clusterProfiler, I'm turning to you, dear bioinf community.

I'm not a shabby programmer - I'm quite good in python, but I'd like to get comfortable in R too.  
A few questions I have are:

1. Is the result of the enrichGO function a certain type of R object? (or am I too pythonic here and it's just a Dataframe?)
2. how do I visualize the imported dataframe (from a .txt document) using cnetplot, when my columns are ID (in GO:xxxx form), Description, GeneRatio, BgRatio, pValue, qValue and gene names?

I really have no clear directions on what to do with that data, which I also find a bit curious. Any thoughts on that?

I'd be super happy if I got some responses. I'm also on the Slack channel (Morits is my name there).

Thanks and cheers!"

i haven't met a single one i haven't wanted to punch because i see them running through reds or when i had my cargo trike they would complain i was going too slow and that i actually stopped at red lights.

having worked for fire and rescue during an internship i found out that majority of the accidents that were caused by bicycles 9 out 10 times it was someone on one of those stupid ""sports bicycles"" 

they should be banned from being used on public roads due to the brainless usage by the people that usually ride them.

if you use them on a track well congratulations you at least have 1 braincell in your head... still hate you for owning one.

and if you're one of those that wears the damn skin tight fucking shorts and shirts whilst riding your sports bicycle on public roads YOU ARE NOT IN A TOUR DE FRANCE!!!! YOU WILL BE DOING TOUR DE HOSPITAL IF YOU RUN ANOTHER GOD DAMN RED!!!!

seriously it's not hard to just grip those special little things on your handlebars called brakes when you approach a red light.

plus it's a fucking bicycle if you want to go fast on 2 wheels get a motorbike, seriously why the hell were a lot of these sports cyclists complaining that i was being slow on a fucking cargo trike?

then theres the fact i have seen them brag about how ""tough"" their sports bicycles are... they are not tough i have actually bent one over my knee and i am fucking disabled.

the cargo trike i had was tough and had a very solid metal frame with puncture proof tires (i have ridden over shards of broken glass and nails without issue) so cargo bikes are tough.

Feeling a bit lost and hoping for some sage advice or shared experience (I imagine anyone reading this might be able to add their own tuppence).

  
I am doing a Software Development Springboard (previously no experience of coding) and really enjoying it. I have a gap from end of May-Sept for summer and, as a mature student, I'm wondering how I might best use this time. 

  
Mainly, I've been thinking I should get an internship, but with only half a year of intense introduction to coding (Java, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, SQL) I'm not even sure I can meet the criteria here. Any thoughts on this? Perhaps my idea of what an internship would demand it too high. Also, being new to all this, I'm finding it hard to even locate internship postings (though I might be late to the game for this summer - some companies are now posting offers for summer 2022!). I wouldn't have been even able to draw together an application earlier than now, as I say having no knowledge or experience. But now with my, admittedly rudimentary searches across the main job sites, I'm finding few companies currently advertising (Amazon, Salesforce) and reading their apps, I'm intimidated by the spec, tbh. Is there a better way to go about this? Or even if anyone reading this, would you know of any intern positions yet to be filled in your company? 

  
Failing securing an internship, any thoughts for a good way to plan out these months? I would think to work on exercises on coding sites (HackerRank) or developing my own projects and uploading to GitHub. But is there anything else here you might suggest.   
Cheers, for reading this far - really, any advice welcome!"

Hi All,

It  been almost 8 months I am in the process of scouting for Job  opportunities and unfortunately couldn't find any. Even during my  masters, I couldn't end up in any of the internships and most of the  projects and thesis were done at the university so didn't get a chance  to gain any relevant experience. The only silver lining during my  masters is I got my thesis published in a reputed conference.

Below is the brief Timeline:

2015: Completed my under graduation

2016-2017: Worked in a IT company.

2017:Applied for masters in Sweden in EE and got my degree in May 2020.

From  March 2020, I have been searching for Jobs parallel while doing my  master thesis. My student visa got expired in Jan 2021 and had to return  back to my native country, India. Back in my country things have become  much worse, most of the companies are IT and since my masters is in  Niche field I couldn't find any Jobs and the available job requirements  happen mostly within the universities and  me having a foreign degree, I  need to apply to Jobs as a off-campus applicant which is very much  complicated back in my country. I have also approached people on  LinkedIn and requested them for a No-Pay internship just to have them  access my skills and then decide.

I  have lost all the motivation and sometimes feel doing masters was a big  mistake.  My Mind is behaving weirdly too as I am unable to stick to a  proper decision and work on it. Sometimes I feel to shift to IT which is  again highly competitive as I am over qualified and not relevant as I  am EE graduate and need to start from scratch competing with the recent  graduates who are 5 years younger(I am currently 27). I am also scared of PhD as the  chances of finding a Job after PhD is quite difficult too. Above all these the society is highly toxic. All my friends and contemporaries who  are now in IT got promoted to higher positions with pretty good  packages and the comparison is very painful.

It would be really helpful If someone can suggest me what to do next."

I am a 2nd year student doing Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin, just finishing up the year now. 

I have tried to get software engineering internships this year, and have been rejected/ghosted by every company I applied to. I know how hard it is, especially now with COVID, to get internships. I’ve applied countlessly and I have brushed up my CV and put many projects on my GitHub, and I have sort of excepted the L at this stage. 

Maybe it’s because I’m not experienced enough, maybe it’s because I’m not talented enough, or maybe it’s simply because no company wants to get a 2nd year for an internship.

At this stage, I just want to work on my skills over the summer to become even more experienced, and guarantee an internship in 3rd year at a really good company - and that’s what I need advice on.

What should I do to guarantee this? Even if it’s a smaller company that I do an internship with, that’s fine, I just want to get my foot through the door and get some experience. I was thinking of doing leetcode over the summer and learning a modern stack (maybe the MERN stack) to get some experience with full stack development.

What else can I do?"

I’m an upcoming undergraduate student debating whether to study Data Science at UCSD or Computer Science at Emory (Atlanta campus). My career goals are to enter the workforce in the tech field after receiving my undergraduates, which from what I’ve read is more achievable with a Computer Science degree over a Data Science degree. However, Emory’s Computer Science program is much smaller and lesser recognized compared to the Data/Computer Science departments at UCSD, which I worry will provide fewer internship and employment opportunities at recognizable companies (e.g. FAANG companies). There're a few other pros/cons about both schools that I’m considering, which I’ve summarized below.

**UCSD**

\+ Entire institute dedicated to Data Science (Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute)

\+ Placed in Sixth College, easy GEs and writing circuit

\+ Connections to Silicon Valley

\+ Cali / Bay Area

\- Data Science, a Master’s degree is recommended to be marketable which would

**Emory**

\+ Computer Science, preferred major

\+ Near Atlanta, growing tech/startup hub

\+ Emory name recognition (as much as I hate saying this)

\- Lower CS ranking &amp; recognition, school has more pre-professional &amp; bio focus

\- 12 AP credit limit (with my scores, I’d have 30-40 credits off the bat by going to UCSD)

\*73k a year

I understand that employment prospects are ultimately about my technical and interview skills, which I'm willing to put the work in for. However, it’s undeniable that certain schools provide more/fewer opportunities with large companies because of their name and location. With this being said, would achieving a SWE or tech-related role be easier with a Data Science degree at a more recognizable school for the major, or Computer Science at a lesser recognized one. **I’m particularly interested in the opinions of any Data Science grads about any regrets/satisfactions with their degree!** Thanks!"

I wanted to get some outside input on my situation and see what you guys think of my current path so far. For some background, I graduated in 2018 with a CS Degree. I wasn't able to land any internships while I was there, and I struggled to find a job. Eventually, I ended up where I am now: help desk at a small (150+) company. I've been working here ever since, picking up my CCNA along the way. Recently they are trying to move me into a dev role, and I'm excited to get back on track and pursue what was my original goal. 

My question is: am I wasting my time? The reason I ask is that the bulk of our applications are coded with Business BASIC. Specifically, PRO/5 and BBj. My ultimate goal is to leverage this position into another dev role elsewhere as the growth opportunities here are not the greatest. I guess I'm just worried that it won't look good to interviewers that I haven't been using more popular languages, not to mention my stint on the help desk. 

I have a tendency to overthink things so maybe I am worried about nothing, but it would really suck to spend all this time just to end up at square one. I'm really grateful to have a job at all, especially in these times, but now that my mental health is under control I'm trying to look towards the future. What do you guys think?

I've been spending the time fixing myself and my mental and physical  health. I've always been a neurotic person, and uni just broke me along with the bereavement I was suffering during the time.

Since uni I've managed to quit alcohol, quit smoking, drop a lot of weight, fixed my diet, and now I'm running 50 miles a week minimum with accomplishments on ultra running. I've picked up some hobbies (reading, writing, chess, guitar) and I've kept myself sharp as I was with theory, calculations and autocad/revit.

However, I fear that an employer wouldn't hear anything positive in all of that. I wouldn't even want to share it. ""Yeah so basically you un-fucked myself. Great"". Whatve you been doing for your engineering career? 

Yes, covid has caused me additional problems with getting my driving test set back over a year now, and also it has hit the job market but in truth, I don't think that would save me from a harsh opinion.

Anyways, negatives out of the way! Im going to knuckle down and get a damned job whatever it takes, here's my strategy:

I've been working with an online coach to finesse my cv, it's quite long as I don't have work experience but it includes all of my personal skills and how I have demonstrated them. I'll be sending out my cv to as many companies as I can, 8 hours a day

I'm going to fix and perfect my LinkedIn profile, along with dressing up my other social medias to show an interest in engineering

I'm going to look into structural engineer volunteering so I can at least get SOME kind of engineering experience.

I've heard the government isn't picky when trying to get engineers, so I'll advance my search in that area.

I'm assuming internships are only for students, rather than graduates? If not, then I'll look into getting a bloody internship if that's what it takes.

If a year passes and I don't get a job, I might just have to shave my head and join the army!

But seriously, I'm really looking for a friend here. What advice would you offer? How can I stand out? How can I cover up / explain the time off?

I took a few programming courses in college for fun and noticed that I was pretty decent at programming relative to my peers so I decided to give programming a shot after dropping out. I put in a lot of self-study, built out some projects just using the MERN stack, and secured an internship from those projects. I ended up working three different internships before receiving my offer for a software engineering position.

This may sound kind of stupid, but I was making around ten dollars an hour at most of my internships.  My last internship ran out of funding and couldn't really pay me so I went out on the job search again. Ended up interviewing for a position that required two years of experience as well as a bachelor's degree. I had four interviews with them, absolutely killed the interviews. I could tell they were interested in me and I got along with them really well. One interview was supposed to last an hour but I ended up spending two hours on the zoom call with him talking about tech. The position is fully remote and pays \~$100k. This feels completely undeserved, I feel like I cheated my way into this or something. Even though there's no evidence for it other than I took a completely different path than most.

mqza6j,27,2021-04-14,I revolutionized my ADHD workday,veryprofessionalduck,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mqza6j/i_revolutionized_my_adhd_workday/,"***tl;dr Tips for working a desk job with ADHD!***

&amp;#x200B;

Fresh out of college, I had no idea how to function in a workplace. I had internships and a very lengthy CV but had never had to commit to a job duty for more than a semester. I had only ever worked in retail and as a photographer, so going into a sit-down desk job was insane to me.

My first position out of college was way to high-level for me. I was a 21 year old making 50k as a graphic designer. I felt like I was pretty good at the duties themselves but I had ZERO work ethic and discipline. I was unorganized and often unproductive, hyper focusing on tasks when deadlines were up or over.

When COVID hit, it became impossible for me to perform and I quit.

A few months later I took a new job as a marketing manager for a small library non profit by my house. For the first three months I floundered and relied on my alibi as a ‘newbie’ to make up for my lack of initiative and low-performance. I had just about had it with myself. My ADHD had caused me to be depressed and have suicidal ideation and killed my self confidence. I decided to do something different.

I had been behind on a few things and felt that my coworkers were beginning to notice my poor performance.

I took a Monday and worked from home after staying up way too late in a depression headache. I planned my job duties, my workflows, installed programs, consolidated tasks and files, and tried to optimize my workflow for ADHD.

&amp;#x200B;

**The following is my own experience that works for my own ADHD!**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **I signed up for a time tracking app.** It’s a free and simple and clean website called ***toggltrack*** that allows me to track my time in a fast and efficient way. Even if you don’t need to track your time, I recommend this for ADHD reasons. Simply type in what you’re working on, add a tag if you want, and press play. Pause at any time and throughout the day I can even continue a previous task with 1 click when I do something multiple times.***This has been great for my brain to keep track of what I’m supposed to be focusing on when I get distracted and click off of my work***. I can always come back to that page and remember “oh yeah, I’m supposed to be making social media posts.”What’s really great is that ***it puts my brain in work-mode.*** As soon as I press play, I’m better able to organize my thoughts and actions into results associated with the task because my ***brain knows exactly what we’re doing.***
2. **A handwritten calendar.** I don’t put all of my to-do items on the calendar. I hate using google calendar because i*t’s too many button clicks for each event.* Instead, I opted to download a blank calendar png onto my I-pad in One-note and draw on it. I can quickly add and color code and highlight and see everything in different colors and fonts if I want. It makes my brain feel so much clearer! ***I keep it open on my desk ALL DAY*** and I never have to deal with the pain of using an online calendar. This is like the ultimate sticky note for me! The one downside is it doesn’t have syncing, but I like to handwrite so I call this a big win!
3. **Reducing visual clutter.** **Adding useful clutter.** Every few days I dump all the files that land on my desktop into one folder on my desktop and deal with that eventually. I hate looking at thumbnails of old projects. ***But then I took all the important webpages that I open every day for work and dropped a link onto my desktop.*** Now whenever I have a task that requires me to visit a certain webpage, I don’t even have to bother clicking the search bar. \*Because if I click the search bar my favorite webpages like reddit and Facebook and instagram will be in my recent link and I will start to browse.\*This lets me simply look at my desktop and click a thumbnail and get on with my task. \*I removed the risk-layer!(Side Note:I stopped using troll for two reasons: 1. I prefer way overly simplified webpages. There are too many shapes and words and buttons on the troll website - it’s okay for personal use, but for work it just contributed the glaze that falls over my eyes when I become too visually stimulated. 2. I would always become too preoccupied with how to organize it and the best way to arrange my cards that I would get too into the weeds or just become overwhelmed and forget. I also would often forget it even existed!)\***Instead, I opted for Bear Notes.** It’s a simple, clean and empty whitespace for me to fill with all my thoughts and lists. I have one note that has my work to do list and I simply cross them off as I do them.
4. ***I keep a list of my job duties and things I can work on next to me at all times.*** I have a notebook that I keep open to these pages. It has a list of all the big recurring responsibilities I have that I should be thinking about daily as well as a list of content ideas and little things that take less than 10 minutes that I can do when I’m not sure what to do. This can also help me ***jumpstart a period of productivity*** so I can get in the game when a big or overwhelming project is looming. This isn't a to-do list! It's simply an idea stimulator that can help me remember that I should be sharing links on the company IG story or that I should write thank you notes to our guest writers.Examples from my list: Share writer memes to the IG story, post about volunteer opportunities, brainstorm ideas for future newsletters.
5. ***I keep fresh flowers on my desk and sit next to a window!*** If you can sit by a window, do it. I prefer one that gets afternoon sun because in the afternoon I feel so sleepy. I get some sunlight int he afternoons here and it helps IMMENSELY. But the flowers! Having something alive and fresh and pleasing to the eye on my desk everyday *helps me feel confident and alive*. It’s ***something I can look at to stimulate my eyes that isn’t my phone when I want to stop looking at my work***. Instead of thinking about Instagram as often, I look at my flowers and feel more in touch with myself and more real. Total game changer.
6. **I started taking meeting notes for every meeting** I was a part of, *even just a check-in with one other co-worker.* I found that after chats and meetings I would sit down at my desk again and not remember a single thing we just talked about and was too embarrassed to even ask them.  So I started recording all the action items - but the BIG thing is that I record them IN my DMs to that person. We use Slack at work, so I simply type the notes up in a Slack message while we’re chatting and press send when we wrap up. That way *we both are aware of the takeaway from the meeting* and when I need to remember what we chatted about I can just open the DMs. Sometimes I take the action items and just copy paste them into my Bear notes list and we’re good to go! ***It also makes me appear organized and responsible to my coworkers. :)***

The  big takeaway form all of this is that I have to simplify the way I work and communicate. No more insane cross-platform plugins and having a million apps for organization. No more complicated and thorough workflows that have me going to ten websites a day just to know what to do and do it. I can manage all my tasks from these three programs. ***One Note, Toggltrack, and Bear.*** And I’m only typing into one of them!

My work values are ‘intuitive’, ‘minimalist’, and ‘inspiring’. I’ve nailed a workflow for the first time in my two year career and I’m so happy to see how far this takes me!

Can't take it anymore.,FuckingEuthanizeMe,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mr0444/fell_through_the_cracks_cant_take_it_anymore/,"I'll keep it as brief as possible. I'm turning 22 in June, and I am extremely unhappy with my life. I've completely failed to have a social life outside of a few online contacts, largely thanks to high-functioning autism, severe anxiety, and trauma from being bullied for the first 15 years of my life. My parents pushed me to socialize far more than I was actually capable of, and I eventually became a recluse that mainly coped with games and computer science research. I tend to hyperfixate on my interests instead of trying new things, even when I want to branch out deep down, so I missed out on a lot of things growing up.

As high school went on, the accumulated damage of my mental problems was too much to bear, and I basically fell off the face of the earth by the end of it. I've spent the past four years focusing solely on fixing my mental problems and getting employed, and while I did succeed in landing an IT internship, my problems won't go away. I deal with auditory sensory overload at work due to autism. Traumatic flashbacks have gotten worse. Medication has long since stopped doing anything for my anxiety. My singular focus on myself has left me nearly friendless IRL, with few online contacts on top of that. 

With few good memories, few connections, and constant mental anguish, I've lost my will to live. Most specialized therapists are booked into the new year. Opportunities to socialize are basically nonexistent thanks to the pandemic, and even if I did have any, I'd have no idea what to do since my disorder gives me such a poor grasp on how people and their social cues work. My life is joyless. I'm so out of step with everyone that it feels like it's much too late to have the things I want, like a partner or a reliable group of friends. I don't want to be a social butterfly, but I want to have something. If I knew what was wrong with me from an early age, I could have had a counselor or a therapist to help me navigate such a hostile world, but now that I'm an adult, resources are few and far between for high-functioning types like myself.

I've tried to hold on for the past three weeks,  but it's not getting better. I'm probably going to end it soon if I can't find a reason to keep going. If there is anyone out there who managed to bloom in their early to mid 20s after a troubled childhood, it would mean the world to me if you could talk about how you did it. I'm going to be dealing with mental problems for the rest of my life, but if there's potential for me to make a life for myself, I'm willing to hold on a bit longer."

How do most places treat interns in terms of time off? I was already told that interns didn't get any *paid* time off, which makes sense.

Is it common that interns are given a longer weekend once in a while? Or do we not get that kind of luxury since we're bottom-of-the-food-chain in terms of company rank."

csrankings.org places Adelaide in the top 10 in the world for it and I have a 30% scholarship available.
But, I do have to defer that to January, and there's stigma in my family about Australia being a place where people go when they have no other place to go.

I'm also excited about Utrecht, being a great place too.

And I don't really know too much about Uppsala. (I applied to it alongside KTH but I'm on a long waitlist for that)

I'm also waiting on results from NUS Singapore, NTNU Norway and ANU, uniMelb from Australia.

most engineering majors get higher paying jobs though, so i want to find one that i don’t hate doing (i’ve learned cs/programming annoys me despite the easier job hunt so not that). i also don’t mind doing the extra work/struggling through the classes, as long as I don’t hate the material I’m learning and the people around me are nice (so one major being harder than another isn’t a huge deal for me, though an easier time is always appreciated). i’m thinking between ece, materials science, aep, and very vaguely cheme.

i’m trying to apply to internships and other opportunities to explore my options and see what i think is nice enough but haven’t gotten any positive responses back. im still waiting on a few i guess so i’m still hoping, although most places seem reluctant because i don’t have much coursework/experience. i’m just a little nervous because sophomore fall is when we aren’t taking so many general courses and it’s a lot of more major-specific classes, and i’m also aware that i still might not know by the time i need to commit. i’ve spoken to my advisor about this and all he really could say was that most freshmen go through this and keep applying to places i think are interesting enough to explore. 

has anyone else gone through this and eventually figured something out? and how? because all i’m seeing right now is just sitting at home for the summer and just hoping i’ll get some realization of something i want to do :("

I am currently learning introductory object oriented programming with python as well as introductory html, css, and javascript this semester, which is my last semester, and I wish to find a job where I can utilize my skills in some way.

I'm not 100% sure what specific kind of job I'd be interested in doing so that's why I wanted to take the time off to master the languages I'm learning now, and acquire new tools and languages under my belt like Java, C++, Matlab, R, etc., research more about the field and what jobs are available, and learn more through personal projects and try to find a paid internship during the winter still as an undergrad, or the middle of the year in general where I can use my skills and learn even more. I want to get an internship because I worry that personal projects may not be enough to show for on my resume when I go looking for an entry level position and/or full time job?

I haven’t taken too many programming classes besides a few Java and Python beginner courses. Which, makes me feel like I don’t entirely understand coding well without finding myself on StackOverFlow looking up examples of algorithms I’ve seen in class. Which, leads me to recognizing I need to start applying myself to learn how to actually code. 

My plan: Create a portfolio and small projects. I’ve recently completed FreeCodeCamp and understand basics and have created a (extremely) basic webpage that I felt took a lot of research to complete. I’ve also created some crappy tick-tack-toe/snake games. So, my current plan is to start working on an outside of the box project and refine my webpage to be pleasant for a potential recruiter to look at. Also, to get myself doing at least a few LeetCode problems daily. 

Is this a good plan going forward over the next few months before my university’s career fair where I’ll have plenty of interviews for internships? Would love some feedback as I want to put my motivation to good use.

Hello everybody,

I just graduated in Dec with my Master's degree in Env Science, and I have nearly a year of experience in this field (mostly internship). Fortunately, I got lucky, I got interviewed with two companies but I still need some career advice, insight thoughts of some experts in both fields.

Firstly, EHS technician, They have offered me a good salary compared to other entry jobs, I had passed three interviews and they are waiting for my response! Another one is the Environmental Analyst/Programmer position with the expected salary could up to $80k/ year, but i still need to pass two more interview rounds before signing a contract.

I love and can able do both of these fields but I have only a week to respond to the EHS position while I have no ensure that I will successfully pass the Analyst position! Should I take the EHS position? or take the risk and try to pass the Analyst position?

It would be great to hear your advice so that I can make a final decision! Thank you in advance!!!!"

I'm 22 years old, about to be 23 and in my last year of college majoring in information systems. I don't have any relevant job experience in IT, just your typical retail job experience. 

I'm already about 2 years behind compared to peers when it comes to college. I should have graduated in 2020 (4 years) but I spent a lot of times working almost full time and going to school part time during community College. 

I currently don't have a job anymore because I wanted to pursue school full time and finish my degree already, but i can't seem to land any internships or entry level positions.

I've been studying for the Comptia sec+ but had to stop because it is just interfering with my school studies. 

I just feel like its going to be a very long time before I'm in a good place in life... I always imagined being highly paid and fully independent by the time I graduated college, but I will probably have to do help desk and entry level positions for at least another year or two.

Just feeling kind of lost, most days I feel good about myself because I see people posting about career changes in their 40's and 50's (no disrespect to them) but then I also see posts from younger people than me that already have managed to get entry level positions and even dread that, while I can't even find an intership.

Just needed to vent it out I guess. Any tips on what I can do and what kind of mindset I need to adapt to?"

I am trying to take both PHYS 213 and ECE 211 to get on track to graduate within a 4 year timeline. I know what I'm about to ask is a tall order, but I'm willing to do what I need to.

I have a summer internship that's going to have me working essentially from 8:30 to 5:30, so any of the traditional summer classes would have me working during this time, so that's not an option.

I'm wondering if anyone knows of a Transferology accredited online course that I could complete at my own pace by the end of the summer for either of these courses. If I complete one then there's a possibility of doing the other later.

One again, I understand that this is not the most likely thing in the world. I understand the low likelihood, but if anyone could offer any options, it would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"
mr3ooz,1,2021-04-14,I've got a crazy aunt who seems to have it out for me.,Resident_Koala_6558,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mr3ooz/ive_got_a_crazy_aunt_who_seems_to_have_it_out_for/,"So my family is just like any other chaotic mess- everyone has their secrets and there is always drama. My family is essentially split into three families- due to my mom, uncle, and aunt having their own families. My aunt is the oldest out the three- with my mom and uncle being twins. I am the first grandchild born and nine months after I was born, my cousin (from my aunt) was born. 

Now my cousin and I were raised much like twins- we went to the same schools (expect middle school &amp; now college). While my parents never got into the habit of comparing me to anyone- always encouraging me to do better, however on the other end of the spectrum my aunt has always compared her son with me- which is something that the rest of our family is aware of. Personally, I have always been a very creative person but always do whatever I have to do. I do admit, I usually always have the upper hand- the ""golden child"". My uncle told me that once my cousin had told him and his wife about how his mother (my aunt) always compares him to me. Just recently, I had gotten an internship at a tax firm, which made everyone really excited and proud of me. My grandma was the first one to know this news and after my parents and I broke the news to the rest of the family members, the very next day my aunt called my grandma and asked her every single question possible- about me and the internship. Couple weeks later, she and my grandma were on the phone and she mentioned how all her son did was go out with friends. There was a clear indication that she was jealous of how much more successful I am, which had been a theme. For example, my cousin and I share a similar friend group and after have a friendsgiving, my aunt made a comment to my mom about how ""it was so nice my cousin to let me into his friend group"" when in reality I had already known a few of the people in the group. 

Now, my grandma had informed both my mom and me about how my cousin went for an interview- which was something both my mom and I had expected to happened. I should also include into the factor that growing up whenever she would take me to family dinners- everything my cousin would be getting a full meal and I would get a smaller plate that she would put a few pastas on there- never a full meal. Unlike, when my uncle invited me to lunch with his wife and daughter and let me order a full meal with extra shrimp (that cost extra too). 

Whatever I do, she always has either of her children (there is also a daughter- which is a whole other story) do the same thing. Whenever I say something, she always undermines me. I am a very hard worker with good work ethics- while my cousin never really really worked for anything. 

I should also mention how the cousin has told me multiple times how I would be ""poor"" in the future and go through many divorces. There was also one incidents where he left me at a friends house and told me to find my own back home (I had no license at the time), and the next day I told my aunt about what happened. She told me that she realized he was upset but didn't want to bother him. I told her that he left me at the friends house and my parents worried that this might happen again but at a location I wouldn't know too well, so they advised me to talk to her. When I did, she said that she would talk to him and have him apologize to me- but none of that happened. I highly doubt that she even spoke to him. 

Even the other day, for the first time I decided to go to my hair lady and have her dye my hair a natural dark brown color and get curtain bangs. When I came to my grandma's house, she was there and practically asked why I colored my hair. It always seems like she has it out for me because I'm better than her children and I always had a feeling that they constantly had like a bad eye for me."
mr44se,4,2021-04-14,Scared I might end up all alone. How do I make friends?,mellowtwinkle,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/mr44se/scared_i_might_end_up_all_alone_how_do_i_make/,"23 F I tried everything, Facebook, Instagram, my internship and even as far as tinder and came to the conclusion that you can’t chase friendship and that nobody is obligated to hangout with me.

I don’t think I’m a bad person. I pour my entirety into relationships. What am I doing wrong? 

I know negativity pushes people away and despite the fact I am extremely burnt out mentally I try. When I meet people I put my best and people tell me ‘oh you’re so friendly/sociable/energetic’ but why is it that I don’t have any friends here? (Asia) 

Most of my friends are back in the states, I’ll get to see them next month. I should be happy but I’m not. it only made me realize that I’ll lose my friends to distance. (I’ll move back to Asia after I graduate) My biggest fear is that ill be left behind or that I’ll end up like my dad. My dad is the loneliest person I know and to know that I might end up like that scares me. 

I hate the fact that everyone I care about is so far away  

It’s so strange to me that I grew up and lived here all my life so why is it that I don’t have a single friend? 
The ‘friends’ I thought I had back in high school weren’t really my friends we hung out because of classes 
Am I just expecting too much? 
Either way, any advice would be greatly appreciated! 🥰"

I have a pretty clear idea of what I want to spend my summer doing, but my parents have a pretty different idea of what would be more beneficial. My parents want me to get a random part-time job in my town, with their logic being that I need to be making money over the summer, and that having a part-time job will be beneficial to my resume as well as giving me standard on the job skills (even though I've already worked part time before). 

What I want to do instead is develop an app I've been pretty excited about starting, learn new technologies, study for technical interviews, and really buckle down on applying to internships for next year. While I already have some personal projects on my resume, I feel like adding an app that I launched on the app store is a way bigger resume booster than some random retail part-time job, and because I'm going to be taking a summer class as well I don't think I'd be able to balance both the job and internship preparation.

What do you guys think?"

Data science and ML align much more with my interests but I’m not sure if I will regret not having Option 1 on my resume as it is a household name (not FAANG though). They are both great options and both will likely lead to full time offers, I’m just not sure what to do. This is certainly a good problem to have but I would like some input. Thanks."

mr5xc4,3,2021-04-14,Will becoming a test engineer count as software engineering experience?,ez_dub,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mr5xc4/will_becoming_a_test_engineer_count_as_software/,"Hi all, I'm almost done with school, I have two job offers and I'm having a tough time thinking about which is the best path to take and I'd like some external input!

Offer A) My current internship has offered me a full time position as a Software Engineer II for 70k with great benefits --fully covered health/dental/vision, profit sharing bonus (which was 35% of YTD earnings last year, but I know its not guaranteed every year), 401k matching

Offer B) Software Test Engineer (develop and execute test plans for an enterprise software system) for 100k, 5k signing bonus, and benefits aren't AS great as offer A-- I'd pay part of the premiums for Health/Dental/Vision through deductions, potential for 3-5% bonus based on performance, and 401k matching. 

After some number crunching, offer B seems to be the financially better option. My concern with it though, is that it seems like more of a QA type of role as opposed to ""coding"". Nothing wrong with QA, but I want to be a great Software Engineer in the long run (and it seems like having testing experience might be good for me as a developer anyways) but I want to know if companies would consider this as ""Software experience"" when I apply to other Software engineering positions in the future? Or would taking offer A probably be the better option if Software Engineering is what I want to do in the long run?"

I ended up nailing the interview and got the position despite not having a lot of experience or personal projects.  I am due to start in a couple of weeks, however, I am really feeling inadequate and nervous about not performing well in my first internship.

This year, I reached out to them to see if they will continue their internship virtually, and they did and automatically offered me an internship to honor their previous offer. I accepted immediately because I was afraid that covid would make finding internships harder. I graduate next year, so finding an internship is pertinent. 

However, I had a fear that they may cancel their internship again because the internship manager was getting relocated to a different region, so I continued looking for other internships as backup. I interviewed for and got an offer from Company B, which is a large renowned consulting company. They offer full time positions after graduation to their interns, and also provides opportunities for me to grow in different directions (possibly in consulting, which I’m very interested in). 

Company A is a large pharma and the role is financial analyst. Company B is a large consulting firm and the role is client management financial analyst.

I am much more interested in Company B, but I feel scared and guilty about reneging because I reached out first and already accepted their offer. I hear bad stories about the reneged company reaching out to the other company and both internships would be trashed. I know that this is highly unprofessional, but interning at Company B would greatly benefit my career path more, since they offer full time positions. 

How can I, in the most polite way, renege on an internship?"
mr962t,8,2021-04-15,Why keep going?,throwaway43643442324,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mr962t/why_keep_going/,"Title. I don't see a reason for trying in school anymore, and to a broader extent life itself. The burnout, indifference to learning, not retaining what I learn, etc. is too much. I think I hate my major. I just want to do media editing, but am trapped in these bullshit prerequisite courses where I learn all these boring things about film theory and social justice that don't relate to it. I need to get through these courses to get to the upper division editing ones, and fuck me I don't even know if I'll like them once I get there. I don't want to direct student films, or work alongside exhausting student creatives/auteurs, or pick up a million unrelated, unpaid internships just to stay competitive in the job market, but my degree basically demands it. I guess I owe this all to my shitty planning...well, that and college is a scam. I wish someone warned me.

So, I have to get so far into my major to actually experience classes I might like, and if I don't, then switching majors from that point on will be a massive waste of time and money I don't have. No realistic backup major or anything of course, unless I'm prepared to go hungry. And that's just college; I'm so fucking unprepared for the real world. It takes all the effort I can muster just to get all As in classes, and every few days I give up on having a work ethic. I've got nothing else. There's no positives in my life anymore, and if there's no positives, why keep going? Tell me, I legitimately need some reasons to not take the easy way out of this bullshit. This post is just me narrowing down if there are some left. Don't post that dumbass suicide hotline, it's intensely unhelpful, almost makes me want to do it out of spite. How do you keep going?

But first, please don't bother with the ""it will get better"" pep talk. That's a lie people have been telling me for ~10 years now and I hate it. I'm downright resentful of it. I was told college is so much better than high school, then went into easy but unfulfilling and lonely community college. I've now transferred into my university and spent 2 semesters of painful Zoom U here. I've set foot on the campus once. My school's mostly back to normal next semester, but because I've been absorbed by the amorphous blob-like thing called online school I don't know if I can adapt.

My peace of mind is ruined; Physical classes means I'll have to commute to them. What are the three most nerve-wracking activities I've ever experienced? Driving in general; people are assholes, working shitty retail to pay for my insurance, and stressing through all the errands my mom will inevitably heap on me.

My sleeping schedule is ruined; how the fuck do I adjust to early classes after a year of asynchronous ones.

My study habits are ruined; I can't imagine memorizing things for a test anymore when they've all been open-book for so long. I think online school actually gave me ADHD- my attention span is shot and I can't pay attention to anything. I gave up reading any scholarly articles, i've tried and tried, I just can't. All I have is blind hope that it disappears when physical classes arrive.

My social life is preemptively ruined; Making friends online is and has always been a farce. Everyone's too hesitant and everything feels too awkward. I don't know my school, I don't know kids in my major. I do know I'm not going to have time for socializing and clubs once back because I now know how oppressive the college workload. Never mind that I'm socially stunted to begin with.

I hate online classes with a passion. I want to get away from them, but it's very likely I'm exchanging one shitshow for another by transitioning to physical. Different stressors, same quantity of them. Don't tell me things will get better. I understand as strangers you can't promise me many things with substance behind them, so if you can only post empty encouragement (#wegotthisfam #slayit), I'd rather you just not post anything at all.

Please don't bother to suggest therapy either. I've always been a little suicidal, but until this semester I never felt desperate enough to need therapy for it. What did I find when I looked for help? My school's counseling program has a 50/50 chance of actually helping me, or locking me up in an institution that could only make life more miserable. I can't take those odds. They're always trying to push you out to private therapists anyways.

I looked up those- I was gently told to fuck off by one organization in the consultation call because I couldn't afford the standard 12 weeks of sessions (over ~$1000). Fucksakes, I only wanted a few. Low-cost organizations are happy to have me...if I can wait 3-4 months. I wish they told me to fuck off too, honestly, because it's not like most people desperate enough to seek out therapy can just postpone their problems.

I discovered therapy in the U.S. is as much a joke as our traditional healthcare is: available but too expensive, or inexpensive but always unavailable. It's not an option, for me at least. Finding that out after so, so many people said it's worked wonders for them, hurt. It really hurt.

But, at risk of going beyond subreddit parameters, how do you keep going in life? I like to think I've ""accepted"" that I'll never live up to my unrealistic pipedreams, or that I won't find love, or have my own place, etc. but I still get sad over these things. I don't know what it's like to be content with life, but so many others do and persevere through the bullshit under worse circumstances than me. The reality is, as nobody has ever disproved it to me, is that you hustle and suffer through college, internships, and extracurriculars, just for the chance of a tolerable job and retirement plan. First world problems and all that, but I can't envision living like that. I'd rather not live at all. How? just how do you deal with this shit?"

I used to fantasize about it all the time. Fantasize about my future. It was my way of escape.

One due to a suicide attempt. I still pushed on and barely graduated high school, after receiving mostly A’s my entire grade school career. 

Anyways here are my failures after high school: 

•got fired from 2 jobs and not given a reason why I was fired 

•stopped going to a film internship I was hired at due to suicidal depression

•film I wrote didn’t get made because I was broke and didn’t know enough people to help

•stopped writing films altogether

•hospital once again

•more self harm cuts on my leg

•still have never been in a relationship 

•lost a friend I actually liked being friends with because I was needy

•dropped about 7 classes in total

•the friends I made in college had to see me in the hospital, something no one should ever see

•lost all friends from college

•won’t graduate with friends from college

•3 years behind in college

•rarely talk to my little brother because he never calls even though we used to be very close

•Had a psychiatrist try to get me hospitalized for the 4th time

•Same psychiatrist dumped me as a patient

•probably won’t ever get to enjoy sex due to a sexual side effect I wasn’t warned about. Docs said the side effect would go away after cessation but they never did

•Have not been able to hold down a job

•all my hard work in grade school was meaningless. It amounted to nothing

•lonely majority of the time, a type of loneliness most won’t ever experience

mrabor,15,2021-04-15,[Poly] AMA SP Aerospace Electronics / EEE &amp; scholarship,syncinruss,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mrabor/poly_ama_sp_aerospace_electronics_eee_scholarship/,"As the year 1s are going for their respective faculty's freshmen orientation programmes and a start of a new acad year for everyone, just thought it would be helpful to have this sharing session of my poly journey to juniors who are looking forward to having a great fruitful semester ahead.

About myself

&amp;#x200B;

* Graduated with Diploma with merit in Aerospace Electronics 
* Received scholarship offer from NTU
* Completed additional modules (Additional Mathematics I, II, III, Physics) + Diploma plus  in Aviation Management
* NYAA gold recipient
* Came from a normal sec sch as an average student who missed the opportunity of gg to the affiliated JC

Very often, we define success in poly as getting a good GPA, getting good CCA records, having outstanding contributions to the community, winning competitions and other factors that would boost one's portfolio. But today I'm here to share 3 main tips to those who may not have such a portfolio and what they could do to improve it.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Think Big Start Small**

Only you can decide your measures of success as ultimately, you are the one who will be graduating from poly. Honestly, success does not necessarily define having a good acad portfolio. Well, it is good to aim to study well, it is more fruitful to have a goal of having a strong engineering foundation so that you can harness it when you are working or pursuing higher studies. Don't just sign up for CCAs or take up courses just for the points or the cert. Do it because you are passionate abt learning the skill set. 

Simple things like I hope I can improve my presentation skills in front of a group of ppl by grad is a means of success already. We all get too hooked up with focusing on the big measure of success but in reality, it's these small goals that will help us achieve the big ones progressively.

Having well-defined goals as well as the measure of success are important because they underline the reasons for your passions &amp; motivations to execute the required actions well. 

Think Big, Start Small. Having a big goal, as well as having smaller attainable goals that progress to the big goal is important. 

For example, your goal may be to learning to code in a particular language. Start having simple goals by learning the syntax, then apply your acquired knowledge in some practices and progressively moving on to the next levels before mastering it. Or if you are in an OJT setting, layout what are the things u need to know and develop a plan whereby you only master the essentials functions and map out how you can apply them in your job/intern. It's perfectly fine if you make mistakes, even I make mistakes, in the process. These mistakes will be important in improving your style of learning.

From my experience in poly, this mindset was beneficial in being consistent in learning new things, be it studies or CCA or intern. 

Whatever grade u may be in, if u can master this simple technique of learning and adapting the goals to overcome challenges, you are bound to excel in future.

This course in Coursera (free btw) provides useful ways to develop an effective learning mindset in which I learnt some useful techniques. Highly recommend for ppl who want to improve their learning style. It's a good, verified resource that anyone can do it OTOT.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Develop good networks with people**

Very important. A lot of progress I made in poly would not have been possible without the support of my classmates, friends I made in diff camps, seminars or events besides my family. Having a positive group of friends who are willing to help each other out is essential as it is near to impossible for someone to just solo project work &amp; assignments or even exams throughout poly. 

Not only you will make progress, but you will grow as a better person. Now u may ask, how can I find such ppl? Well, you can do your best to try to network with people, and that includes lecturers and industry ppl as well. A lot of times, we don't try to network ppl after events and camps coz paiseh of the fear of rejection &amp; prejudice. As the saying goes, never try never know.

This is important for those guys who want to self source internship, where contacts with industry ppl or seniors or current students can potentially help you land at the internship of your choice. The same applies to scholarships.

My recommendation is to attend those general or industry-related seminars, events, camps, workshops, zoom meetings that normally comes in ur ichat. Linkedin is also a good place to start. Once I randomly just signed for a talk abt Learning Express without even knowing what is it abt. And guess what? I learned that there was such a thing as called overseas social innovation project (OSIP) and the application procedures. And Voila! Managed to get in through and had such meaningful experiences throughout the trip. Made good connections with my project mates and overseas counterparts whom I am still in contact with this day!

Sometimes you may not understand what's gg on, but these are golden opportunities to meet new ppl and get new perspectives. If you make the effort to understand, ppl are more likely to help you.  Try to network on a neutral note first, and once the communication between you and the other party is well established, then only you can attempt to ask for what u want.  It makes the connection more meaningful and lasts longer. 

The key here is to be open and be bold to network ppl who may or may not be in the same frequency as you. This can come crucial in interviews in jobs or scholarships where your portfolios may be outmatched by better portfolios. Networking can give you an edge over others in these situations.

P.s: In fact, your networking can start right here in Reddit, and in this very subreddit forum itself :)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Consistency IN Explore OUT**

There are things that I did that went well and some that didn't turn out well wish I wished I could have done better. I'm being brutally honest, it wasn't an easier journey here, nor it was something I visualised when I started in poly as I never imagined doing this well in poly at Y1. The point here is, your expectations at the start and the end result will not be the same. The qn is, how willing are you to get your path set by the system or how willing are you to crave your path.

The way I went about in poly is through being consistent in academics and exploring out in learning new skills and improving them. I did my best in helping my peers and myself on what are the ways where we could improve, esp in project work, and reflect on actions. The three sub-points are my takeaways from adopting this method

***For FRESHMEN ESPECIALLY, MAKE SURE YOU DO WELL FOR FIRST SEM.*** 

I know poly is a new environment and a lot of exciting opportunities that you can experience ahead, but I, on behalf of most poly grads, advise that you may wanna spend much attention of your first sem in establishing a good acad standpoint so that GPA does not become a barrier for you to pursue your interests in subsequent semesters.

I cannot stress this point any better as I have seen my friends who have made wrong decisions and as a result, they didn't farewell for their first sem, which stung them till grad.

It's perfectly fine if you make mistakes here and there, coz that is part and parcel of adapting to poly curriculum. What is wrong is that if you did not give your best, then u have yourself to blame for. Give it your best shot. 

Eg, for me it's not that I did extremely well for all the modules in my first sem, in fact, I almost ended up getting a C+ for Narrative Writing (GE2) coz I did not understand some parts of it initially and I assumed that time that this was something not of importance to deal with. 

Having uncooperative project group members, loads of abstract theoretical knowledge and/or practical knowledge to absorb, strict lecturers, the complicated structure of mods and BELL CURVE are some of the many factors that you can't change or have limited power to change in a typical poly sem. What determines your progress is to react and change accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

***FOR CURRENT ENGINEERING GUYS OUT THERE, DO PLAN AHEAD OF WHAT YOU INTEND TO LEARN AND APPLY IN ENGINEERING WHILE STUDYING***

I would encourage you to take up mini projects if your course doesn't have FYP or you can do further improvements on past projects that you did in the course because the applied practical knowledge is far more valuable than anything. Having good theory knowledge is good for the exams, but having good team management skills with solid application-oriented knowledge is vital to be relevant in the industries.

Poly curriculum does give the hands-on experience, but if you want to be better at engineering, you have to explore it out yourself at times. That's the explore part of my strategy. Don't just depend on sch. Go further and take actions to enhance your knowledge, or innovate. Whether you fail or succeed in completing projects or initiatives doesnt matter. The process you go through counts. Focus on the process and not the product. PM me if you are looking for opportunities to build your engineering portfolio. I'll be more than happy to help you out.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the best part of my poly life was intern, where I had the opportunity to work and come up with a solution project for one of the company's challenges. It taught me far more lessons abt working life than sch would have taught. It was the period of time where I got introduced to data science, ML and python. For someone who was deeply interested in avionics, this was something out of the box. Eventually, I managed to learn the basics of data science and am interested to learn more.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, even if u do not have the time to OTOT do projects, use the internship as a great tool to expand your horizon of engineering expertise. Now I know some intern companies just ask you to do what is assigned of you and that itself can be quite the heck of a load. To this group of ppl, try to change your perspective and see whether you can explore how your role affects the company operations, or you can independently improvise conditions at your work so that you can achieve better efficiency or anything that adds value to ur internship. Don't just go and work there just for the sake of it. Would suggest gg intern with an open mind and take initiatives to improve your work experience.

**TLDR: ENGAGE IN INTERN PROACTIVELY OR INVOLVE IN ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES EITHER IN SCH OR OUTSIDE SCH CURRICULUM TO VALUE ADD TO YOUR PORTFOLIO**

&amp;#x200B;

***JUGGLING BETWEEN STUDYING AND EXPLORING SKILLS &amp; INTERESTS***   

&amp;#x200B;

This is something that all poly guys wanna be good at. Tbh, there isn't a hard and fast rule to managing studies &amp; CCAs and other commitments. ""For each, it's own"", as the saying goes.

That being said, do plan ahead of your time ahead, ensuring enough time for mods, CCAs and other stuff. The poly timetable is pretty standard, so one tool that I have used to do well is to prepare ahead. Know what are the expectations and requirements of each module and seek help from tutorial lecturers and seniors. Do ask questions and don't be afraid to ask them. 

Don't skip tutorials. Tutorials are essential to consolidate your learning. It can potentially help you to get that A from B+ in exams.

Planning &amp; time management is one thing, but another important quality is to manage stress &amp; anxiety when things do not go the way you planned them, which happens for a lot of time.

One tip would be to forge good friendships within your course as they will be able to understand and feel your stress &amp; worries. Brings back to the topic of networking.

The other would be to review your expectations and adjust accordingly; back to the topic of think big, start small.

However, the best advice is to take care of your health mentally &amp; physically. Your health comes first before everything. Make sure you take concrete steps to take good care of it. Diff people cope differently. For myself, I exercised often, like running, cycling etc. To keep stress to tolerable limits, I pause and reflect periodically on what could have been done better. I agree that at times, it ain't that easy to study for the pursuit of knowledge and would just want to do the minimum to score reasonably grades. So breaks and self-care are very important to keep you conditioned.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Conclusion**

Thanks for reading this far. I always wanted to make a comprehensive sharing of what I learnt in poly and what I wished I could have done better. I apologise if any content in this post has hurt or offended anyone as that is never my intention. 

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to comment down below any questions about scholarship interview, SP engineering experience or SP life in general and I will answer them to the best of my ability. But as I'm an NSF rn, will take a bit of time to answer your queries but will try my best to answer asap. Alternatively, you can PM me your queries too!

mrdox3,0,2021-04-15,Fulltime offer or Grad school?,kingKuntaKinteKunta,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mrdox3/fulltime_offer_or_grad_school/,"Before got an offer from a supervisor willing to fund my research and another scholarship offer to do my CS research Masters at McGill, I have been working (internship) at a (not FAANG) but applied machine learning company for the past 6 months. Now my contract ends in a month, and they're offering me a full time job offer. Taking this offer (which pays relatively well) would mean have to decline my scholarship and my offer from a potential supervisor and therefore not do grad school. I need some advice on what's a good way to handle this situation. The company declined my option to work with them part time. Should I stay for the money and more work experience or should I proceed to do my fully funded masters in CS at a prestigious Al Lab?"
mrdq92,4,2021-04-15,Transferring to University of Michigan,superkoolman123,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mrdq92/transferring_to_university_of_michigan/,"I currently go to a terrible CS school (ranked like 150th in the US) and really hate the quality of the curriculum. It is essentially very time-consuming with a lot of tasteless busy work. For example, we are never told to write test cases for our software, graded for them, or even have our software tested against edge cases. I try my best to test my software well and make sure it is as good as possible, yet other students just hand in broken software and we all end up getting 100's.

I have the option to transfer to the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. The issue is, I don't live in Michigan so I will have to pay out-of-state tuition. I would also graduate a semester late. After calculating the cost from the very little fin-aid I get, the difference between the two degrees (counting the money I lose from the extra semester I'm in school versus working full time at a company) is about $160K. My parents can afford it and could pay the money (so I don't need to take any loans or pay them back) but obviously don't want me to pay a ridiculous amount of money on something where I won't make it back.

I have interned and will continue to intern at a F500 company, and have a good chance of getting a return offer. So I will hopefully have some sort of job lined up if I stay at my current school.

However, I hope to cover up all the holes in my knowledge (writing good test cases, learning how to deal with large codebases, etc) and work at a FAANG (doesn't everyone). Since I will be pushing back my graduation date and have already taken a lot of advanced (although poorly run) CS classes and already have internship experience, I think I will be a pretty competitive applicant for the higher-tier companies if I do transfer. Any advice on whether transferring is worth it?"
mrdtn4,5,2021-04-15,Performance Reviews and Negotiating Raises,Ricardo96MC,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mrdtn4/performance_reviews_and_negotiating_raises/,"In summary I’ve been at my company going on two years (June 2019). And last year I did not receive a raise. Performance reviews came back and like most everything in life it’s good but always can be better (productivity drop in some months last year, but that was due to my dad getting COVID and being hospitalized for 4 months, amongst his other conditions, so AKA stress). But I created this WebApp (while working on our current software) that is the only reason we can sell our next product. And they’re staying how key and important I’ve been and will be once the summer rolls around as it will replace the old PC Application we use. My team is generally older so Web Tech isn’t there thing, and well myself included I taught myself Angular on the job and released a product on my own. 

I make 80,000$, and this past performance review o got a whopping 1% raise. For two years I get 800$ more which is about like 20 bucks more on my paycheck. It’s borderline costing me money to stay here (inflation).  And money doesn’t seem to be an issue here (hiring another developer and intern) so that’s not the case.

Has anyone renegotiated they’re raise, or financial package? Or is it time for greener pastures?"
mrg3f5,10,2021-04-15,When does Google stop caring about GPA?,mrpopo_3,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mrg3f5/when_does_google_stop_caring_about_gpa/,"Made a post about a week ago asking if Google cared about GPA for the New Grad position, since they asked for my transcripts and stuff after passing the coding challenge, and my GPA is 
&lt; 2.5 (due in some part to laziness, but also had legitimate issues during some semesters).

Either way, I got the rejection today, a week after sending my transcripts in, which feels bad, but also understandable. With the number of people applying, you gotta filter somehow. I was just hoping they might look past it and give me a shot.

That said, is this something that’s gonna prevent me from ever getting a job there? I had 3 previous internships, 1 at a unicorn and 2 at Amazon which I know is not as competitive/has a lower bar, but I did get some really good experience there. 

After like a year or two of experience will my GPA still follow me around at places like Google? Just feel a lil gutted because no matter how I try to make up for my GPA (with projects, internships, etc) I feel like i can’t escape it"

This is the last semester of my bachelor degree in math (i picked prob./stat./math. finance courses whenever i could choose) and i wanted to get some kind of job or internship afterwards and then maybe go back to do my master.

The school i go to is actually pretty good (ETH Zurich), but the problem is that my grades are shit (i converted them to US scale: \~3.1-3.2 gpa). I actually never thought that they are shit, i was pretty happy that i passed every course so far, but yesterday i found this sub and read other stuff about ""quants"" and it appears you need 3.8+ gpa... Maybe i can bring it up to 3.3-3.4 with this semster's courses, but more is not possible.

**Are there jobs in the financial sector, where i can apply some of the things i've learned in my studies, but don't require stellar grades and all sorts of ""projects"" and ""publications""** (whatever that even means)**?**

i like coding, math, numerical methods, statistics... and my dream would be a job where i can do those things, work 40-50 hours per week and make a decent living. where do i find this? risk management? portfolio management? there are so many different divisions, job titles,... should i just jump into something and then see if it fits me? 

What would you suggest: **a graduate program in a big bank (18 months) or an internship (6 months)?** Or should i just continue doing my master immediately? I'm a little lost, any advice is greatly appreciated!"

My problem is:  
I don't sleep, eat, take breaks and I am doing an awful job at work.  
I am working at a great company, so that is why I don't want to quit, but I feel too much pressure and I have so many deadlines that I don't know if I can meet.   


I feel like I should quit because I need to catch up on a lot of studying and I should work on getting faster. But I am afraid I won't ever get the chance to get back in the same company, which again - it's great, maybe the best in my city.

One thing that I have noticed both in internships and full time work is how getting your PR reviewed feels like pulling teeth. If I just make a PR and don’t message anyone asking them to review it, it won’t get reviewed until the end of the sprint and if they request changes then I won’t have time to complete the ticket before the end of the sprint.

Is this normal? Is my code just trash and people don’t want to review it?

How often do people review PRs normally? Is messaging people to review them normal or is that considered kind of obnoxious?"

The college also offers minors specifically in IT, CS, and Cybersecurity Certifications, if that changes anything. 

What differences would I see in coursework, study hours, and difficulty?
Is it easier to get internships, or entry level positions with a specific path?

If my current experience would make one of the three easier, or a better fit, I have dealt with computer hardware of all sorts for a good 5 years, and I mean beyond just building a gaming PC. I have also dealt with a fair amount of utility software and troubleshooting. My knowledge mostly revolves around being a tech of sorts. My programming knowledge is very basic, and there's a learning curve there for me, but I still enjoy it. I haven't had great experience with high level math due to how my school handled COVID-19, so that is something I really struggle with.

In terms of a career path after study, I'm still widely considering most things in the field, but my primary interests lie around system administration, and info security. Definitely open to suggestions though!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Sorry I had a lot of recommenders haha

1. 10th grade AP Chemistry Teacher who was also Sci Oly Coach - She's known me since my freshman year and she's seen me grow from being shy to becoming Science Olympiad's leader this year. She knows a lot about my family's financial instabilities and emphasized my FGLI status a lot. Pretty good relationship and she wanted to help me get into a good college. Long letter as well,, said it was like 9 pages - 9/10?
2. Greek Teacher - Has had me for 2 years now ? Loved how I directed the Greek dances for our class for a fundraiser. Always spoke highly of me for taking the highest level anyone's taken for the Greek language exams along with another classmate. Isn't very fluent in English. Once again, knew about my background and hardships. Worked with me and other classmates on our documentary video. - 8/10
3. AP Calc BC / Multi Professor - Worked with me in Science Olympiad as he was my building / engineering events coach for a year. Taught me in both classes, but I wasn't very active. Admired my dedication to Science Olympiad. Got an A on both classes so he thought I was very intelligent. - 7/10
4. SSP Academic Director - I didn't speak much during SSP, but I did try to lead a lot of social events and I was known for asking a lot of questions. I spent a lot of times with the TAs asking questions and did all my work on time, sorta. Made an ok impression despite SSP being virtual?? - 6/10
5. Greek Trig/Geometry Teacher - Only used this letter for MIT and CalTech. Was one of the best students in his class sophomore and freshman year as I participated a lot. Admired my hard work and knew about my background. Respected me a lot and always appreciated my honesty. - 9/10
6. Guidance Counselor - She was my AP Biology teacher and I was one of two students to get an A in her class. She liked how I was in STEM but also into creative writing. She knew me fairly well, but in her eyes, I was very shy not outspoken as I was too lazy to participate in her class. - 7/10

**Interviews**

Harvey Mudd - Very casual. It was good because the lady and I bonded a lot and she said LACs would be a great fit for me. We talked about my academics and just some extracurriculars. It was ok. I didn't prepare for it.

MIT - My first *real* interview ever. The interviewer was Hispanic so we bonded a lot over that and we talked about history a lot. I was very natural and smiled a lot, so it was a very chill vibe. The interview was like an hour and a half. I think it was a great interview, and I spoke about a few of my ECs, my love for STEM, immigrating to America, and of course, why MIT. He rlly admired when I spoke about helping under-resourced communities.

Yale - My second interview ever. It was nerve-wracking and not as chill as MIT. The interviewer and I really bonded over books and our experience growing up in a competitive school. I wasn't as relaxed because the interviewer didn't seem engaged, but it seems that was her personality. It was a nice interview where I laughed a lot. I spoke more about myself and my personality, less about achievements and ECs besides the top 3 important ones. Prepared A LOT and spoke about how I loved Yale's community and environment.

Princeton - Probably my least favorite interview. The guy was very,,, dry?? Not as exciting as the other interviews. I spoke about why I like Princeton, what I hope to do as an engineer, how I plan to learn technical skills then go into policymaking, and a few of my classes. It was a good, solid interview, but not great in my opinion.

Harvard - I loved this interview! My 2nd favorite under MIT. We bonded a lot over being from Miami and wanting to work in non-profit organizations. I talked about how I want to help other people a lot and emphasized my humanities side more than my STEM side since my application already showed I'm a STEM person. I talked about volunteering at Breakthrough, reading books, traveling, and also Science Olympiad. Interviewer said she loved our convo, wished me the best, and said she was glad to meet such a passionate, considerate person in the sciences.

**Essays**

I started my common app in October or so. I never really liked it until the January 1st deadline, but I just kept editing it as much as I could. The final draft, I think, is good and interesting. I talked about my move from my home country, my aspirations (fixing my home country, helping underdeveloped communities with engineering), and what I hope to do in the future as an engineer in the end. It was a creative narrative story.

My other essays were also good quality, but many people say I'm just a good writer and don't realize it. I spent a month on MIT's essays and from there the rest of my essays for other colleges grew. For other colleges, I usually spent 1-3 days working on their essays depending on how much I cared about the school, and for Stanford, I spent about a week on the essays. I had many many people edit my essays and give me feedback. I am not a literary master, but I did write passionately and genuinely.

**Additional Information:**

I really emphasized my family background in my application and used the additional information section as much as I could. I did not talk about being low-income or having hardships with my family in my regular essays as I wanted to come across as being other than my hardships, but I did this **because** I knew my teachers and guidance counselor would talk about it. I also banked on some of my rec letter writers to emphasize that I'm outspoken and assertive rather than shy (which I usually am and come across as).

Also, I kinda just dropped everything I wasn't interested in. I was very dead set on not taking DE just to raise my GPA and just focusing on the things I was passionate about despite not being sure about my career track in life until I had to decide something for college apps.

I also talked a lot about giving back since I'm very passionate about volunteering and making a change for minorities/low-income families/underdeveloped communities. I emphasized my interest to intersect public policy and engineering a lot in my essays since it didn't come across in my ECs or my common app and my teachers didn't know about that either.

I put in the additional info section clarifications about the other programs I did, my skills and hobbies, ALL my science olympiad medals, and how I was part of Peer Counseling, History Bowl, and the awards I received as a Greek dancer.

I think I stood out because you don't usually see a low-income, first-gen Hispanic Greek dancing engineer who wants to become involved in public policy haha.

I wish everyone good luck with their college decisions and good luck with the college process if you've just started it!!! I hope this helps a lot or inspires others!! :)) #FGLIPower #LatinasForStem #WISEGang !!"

Been a lurker here off and on for a few years. I'm going to make the plunge and start looking for software jobs again after a 2+ year break. Generally I feel like I know what I need to do to make it happen, but am back at the start of a long process. Just looking for general advice and encouragement as I feel just a bit overwhelmed by the task at hand.

A little about my background and current position. I graduated from a state school in August of 2018 with my CS bachelor and a minor in applied math. I did good in classes and graduated with a high gpa. However, I feel I fell short doing several things with my time in school, mostly networking and personal projects. I commuted to school and worked full time during, so I didn't have a lot of time to commit while still maintaining some semblance of healthy life. With a lack of projects or internships I found it difficult finding a job after school. I ended up taking a helpdesk job so I could at least be in a tech related field and get out of factory work. I got comfortable enough that I stopped job hunting and stopped programming basically altogether. I've moved up since then, but don't feel fulfilled where I'm at right now. At the end of the day I think I'll be most happy if I can build code.

So here I am now, out of practice but still wanting to make it into the software development industry. Time to start my daily coding practice. Time to start building a respectable portfolio. Time to start practicing for interviews. Time to get serious. I know it'll all be worth it in the end, but right now I feel like I'm staring up a mountain."

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Teacher (7/10) : I chose him because we had a fairly close relationship built on our fondness for Humanities. Also cause I asked him for a rec before college season for a summer program and he seemed excited to do it. I felt like I was most intellectually driven in his class (asking the right questions, and showing parts of my outside curiosity sometimes outside of the class subject). 

AP Science Teacher (6/10): Had her for two years, we would bond over asian culture and photography. She thought I was smart and driven and honestly treated me like more of a sister than a teacher at times. There was one time where I flew a bottle across the room and almost broke the ceiling but that was after she had written my rec so idk if that affected the rec. She seemed pretty chill about it and laughed it off at the time. Over the summer she kinda stopped responding to my emails (didn’t get to send her rec to Georgetown) 

College Counselor (4/10): not that close to her but she said I seemed academically vigorous. these are kinda so/so cause she manages another 500 kids in my graduating class 


&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**Interviews**

Georgetown (8/10): This interview was like early September/ Late August. I had no idea they start their interview the second you send in the request for an Application. This was my first interview I was nervous but she enjoyed my strong ties to community and my field. 

Princeton (9/10): I got a senior at Princeton and we had to reschedule a couple times but when we finally did the interview it went so well. She was so impressed with how I had time to balance three sports and do so much in school. We had a talk about pronouns and progressivism. She said that I’m going to have a lot of fun in college with political activism. 

Harvard (6/10): This one was pretty conventional, standard guy who asked about who I am what I wanted in life. He started to talk about his background and I ended up asking him more questions about what it is like to be a first gen in college. 

Tufts (5/10): she was nice but didn’t seem to know tufts really really well because her answers were short and she didn’t really seem intrigued to know me. Unlike the other schools she wasn’t from my region or my major so it was hard to find something. Ultimately we talked about media influences in politics. 

Stanford (2/10): she liked talking about herself and I kept feeling like there was never a good chance to speak. It was an awkward interview where I just nodded. Lasted like 12 minutes too

UPenn (11/10): Best interview hands down. He was very straight forward. I cracked a few jokes. He absolutely loved my questions and the stuff I did in high school. I was his last interview for the cycle and he told me that he would write me a dazzling report. I felt the most comfortable and myself in this interview. 

&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

mrl5z5,13,2021-04-15,Getting an Interview,tiverma,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mrl5z5/getting_an_interview/,"I've seen a lot of posts lately asking about certain designations, education decisions, or pursuing masters degrees etc for the purpose of advancing or obtaining a certain career path. This is not how you break into the industry. I thought I would give my perspective on how to get interviews from someone who decides who my group interviews and also interviews a large number of candidates. Keep in mind there may be exceptions to these rules but in general I think this holds true for 98% of cases. I am gearing this towards specifically new grads but keep in mind most of this holds true for experienced hires as well. Additionally, this is primarily US perspective. Finally, you may not like what I have to say but keep in mind there are 1,000s of me out there that are making accept/reject decisions.

Getting an Interview:

1. **You need to get your resume in front of a human being to have any shot.** This can be done in two ways: 1) through on-campus recruiting (relevant for summer analysts, analysts, or associates) or 2) networking. Networking is the single best use of your time. A lot of people on here talk about doing entire master's degrees to obtain the benefits that you could get from 10-20 hours of networking... Regardless, if you just apply through an online portal somewhere, you should consider your application to be in the trash can the second you hit submit. Get your resume in front of a human being.
2. **Your resume needs to be formatted correctly.** If your resume looks strange aesthetically, I'm not going to spend time reading it. I can see the cries coming in now, but if you wouldn't show up to the interview in an orange suit, then don't submit a resume that is formatted in some artistic or funky way. Your resume needs to be filled but not more than one page. Bullets should fill each line and if a line runs into two lines, then make sure it fills the majority of the second row. If you have periods at the end of some sentences, then all sentences need to have periods. Consistency is key. If you ever need help with your resume, post it here and I bet I'll review it. **I recommend the WSO resume format, just google it.**
3. **Once your resume is in front of me, I don't care what school you went to or what your degree was**. I have no fucking clue what the curriculum is at each school or if you paid a lick of attention during school, so I don't care at all. There are so many tryhards out there that will study a specific field because they think it will make them look more appealing to a financial position. The reality is, the lion's share of finance is not rocket science and anyone who is interested can learn quite quickly on the job. Ideally, I would have new hires study a wide range of topics and each be a specialist in something niche so that I can be surrounded by interesting people.
4. When presenting resumes, HR usually comes to me with a stack of resumes and says ""decide who to give 10 interviews to"". The resumes they hand me are usually the result of on-campus recruiting (i.e. target school kids) and networking (i.e. VP Brad talked to College Junior Chad on the phone. Brad liked Chad so let's get another set of eyes on Chad's resume). Once the resumes are in front of me, it's not about finding the 10 best candidates, usually there will be 3-4 that stand out. It's about making a few iterations of cuts to the stack until I get down to 10. 
5. Finally: fill your interests line

Other tidbits in rapid-fire succession:

1. Have internships - again I really don't care what they are, just have a few of them and write strong bullets for them.
2. Have a good GPA.
3. You need to have a degree or be pursuing a degree.
4. You need to be legally authorized to work in the US.
5. If all of your experience is unrelated, you need to network and have someone get to know the reason behind your transition.

Please let me know if this is helpful and if you are curious about a deep dive on a different topic (networking and interviewing come to mind) I can write more on my next slow day."
mrlw1h,2,2021-04-15,Should I return to school for software engineering?,jesusd2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mrlw1h/should_i_return_to_school_for_software_engineering/,"Hello everyone,

I'm 25, hold an Hons BSc in physics, and I currently work a blue collar job unrelated to my degree for ok income and benefits. I don't see a future at my current job because there is nearly no room for advancement and it gives me a lot of physical pain (due to unknown health conditions I'm working on getting diagnosed likely arthritis or fibro). 

I am able to return to school for a Hons BE in software engineering. It would require me to do 3 more years of class because I can carry over a year's worth of credits from my previous degree. I would also be able to take time off to do co-ops and/or internships. My school isn't the best but also isn't the worst and the program has lots of mixed reviews. The people I know personally who have taken the program recommend it and say everyone who has graduated that they know has found a job in the field.

As far as my current programming skills I have decent knowledge of python (did a Udemy course and also used it during my physics undergrad. Can do probably half of leet code easy questions), I programmed in java during high school but forget most of it, Ive recently set up a GitHub and educated myself on using git and the terminal. I was going to take the Odin project but I'm looking to get into software engineering and not web development.

My concern is that I'm better off self teaching considering 3 years of tuition would cost me at least $30k CAD but then I'm also concerned I wouldn't be able to keep myself on track or be able to find employment without work experience. My main reason for wanting to return to school is to be able to get co-op/internship positions so that I can have real work experience in the field so I can start a real career when I graduate.....I've been unable to find any work with my current degree because I don't have any experience. I'm not interested in doing a master's in physics because I think I'd enjoy software engineering more than a career in physics and I think it would be more lucrative. 

I'm wondering if anyone could provide me some guidance or reassurance about my current plan. I currently plan to return to school, work my ass off for good grades, get the best co-ops I can, use my free time to build projects, and graduate with a job hopefully already lined up. I think as long as I can get half decent job opportunities in the summer I can afford it and I still have student loans available. 

Thanks to everyone who read this."
mrmjul,1,2021-04-15,Roast me - Looking to obtain a job in Mechanical Engineering industry (Sorry for long read),dioxy186,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/mrmjul/roast_me_looking_to_obtain_a_job_in_mechanical/,"[Resume I want reviewed](https://imgur.com/a/i2GKFgs)

So I've applied to about 200-300 companies in the last ~9 months and have only had 8-10 interviews.  I have had my resume reviewed by my campus before and made some of their suggested changes and it didn't really help that much.

One of my professors contacted me and gave me a connection and that person asked me too send them my resume and background with experiences.  

[This was their response](https://imgur.com/EB3RsDu)

Now with that in mind, I'm not good at highlighting my accomplishments in just a few words.  So I guess maybe you could take what I have in my resume plus some extra points I'll list and figure out a clever way to put them together.  Below are some of my accomplishments that are not mentioned in my resume.

Safran: 

* The manufactured engineering drawings are in compliances with ASME Y14. 5.  I followed their guidelines because my designs were going to be manufactured and needed to be as precise as possible.  Mainly because these fixtures were very large, very heavy, and was primarily comprised of cold rolled 1018 alloy steel.  So they were going to be really expensive and they had a set budget for these designs.

* With the usage of my pitch and roll fixtures I potentially saved the company $150,000 a year.  And that is honestly on the low side of estimation.  These fixtures were for aircraft seat crash testing, and one of the issues I had to solve was the baggage bar below a lot of their seats sat really close to the load cell the chair was bolted upon.  So in some cases that bar would strike the load cell and cause the test to become invalid.  For most test, it was only a $500-2000 mistake that had to be ran again.  But there are cases where the test was $100,000-$150,000 and if that was invalidated due to the bar hitting the load cell... It happened once during my 4 month internship, and a few people got suspended and almost lost their job.  
* In addition to the price saving, my fixtures saved the company a lot of time to setup.  The previous fixtures had to be jerry rigged to meet certain requirements (i.e pitch/roll angles) and a lot of the time you would spend 30 minutes to an hour setting up the seat just to find out the pitch/roll angle was below 10 degrees, or the bar was close to the load cell.  So you would have to take everything apart and fix it.  

Merit Medical:

* Engineering drawings were in compliance with ASME Y14. 5.  We had to have a working proof of concept for the senior design expo and our client.  So all of our parts either had to be 3d printed, and/or sent for manufacturing.  Had to be pretty precise due to time constraints and the goals our clients and ourselves had agreed upon.
* I was the project manager of my group.  I was tasked with assigning each individual their tasks, time management, and setup weekly meetings with our technical manager and our client.  These meetings consisted of a reflection report where I highlighted what we worked on from the previous week. I stayed organize by utilizing a GANT chart.  This helped me make sure we stayed on top of our tasks, and didn't succumb to scope creep.  
* I also did most of the preliminary design work.  I came up with the ball-screw mechanism and the design for our project.  I did probably 60-65% of the CAD work and then let the other mech guys make the changes our client wanted so they also got experience utilizing solidworks.  

HVAC Design Project:

* This was basically a project course.  It required Thermo 1, Heat transfer, and graduate level applied thermodynamics course.  I was given an HVAC restaurant layout with some specifications to model my HVAC systems.  
* I zoned my restaurant into 5 zones, and then using the Heating, Ventilation, and AC analysis &amp; design book (which utilizes all of ASHRAE's updated standards) calculated the heating and cooling load for each zone.  I had to take into consideration the temperature conditions for the region the restaurant was located, sensible loads, occupant heat generation, appliance heat generation, Infiltration/exfiltration between the north/south/east/west walls, solar radiation, etc..  Once I completed the heating and cooling load for that zone.  I was then able to select the size of AHU unit for each zone, supply diffusers, and return grills.  
* All my calculations were based off charts, estimations, and formula's that can be found in the ASHRAE handbook.

Lastly, whoever takes the time and helps me out I really appreciate it."

I did it in only 3 years (6 semesters) with a 3.86 GPA and was anticipating joining a BS/MS program in the fall to get my Master's in my 4th year of college. However, I didn't get into the program because of ""a lack of academic research"" in my portfolio.

Because of this situation, I only have an internship in the summer with a good SWE company and no full-time gig for the fall, so I'm asking if I should try appealing and go back to school and get my Master's? Or would my 4th ""senior year"" be better spent building personal projects for my portfolio, working on Leetcode questions, and networking?

Even if my appeal did succeed, would a Master's in CS definitively lead to a higher starting salary or faster track into upper-level positions? My goal is just to become the best applicant I can be for a software engineering job in the next recruiting cycle.

Thanks in advance for any advice / knowledge."

I dont want to be unreasonable but also who doesnt want more money. I know I need to give a firm answer if I want a proper raise but Im getting anxious just thinking about it.
Please help."

A little background: Was doing CS major with Math and Econ minor. Messed up CS 252 thrice (rip) and I want to go to grad school for something interdisciplinary that is not so unbearably CS. Completed the math minor and now also have CS minor with Econ major.

I have a few questions:

1. I am a conditional CODO into Econ rn, what does this mean? I asked my Krannert advisor this and she copy-pasted something from the Purdue Econ website that didn't answer my question at all.
2. Is it necessary to do a concentration in BS Economics? I am thinking of the Data Analyst concentration since that aligns most with my skills and interests.
3. It's probably too late but what about internships? What kind of internships do econ majors even do? (I am still planning to graduate in 4 years) I am currently doing a Data Science internship. Is that helpful?
4. Thinking of going to grad school for econ/data science/interdisciplinary. Are top schools a possibility if I manage to do really well in this last year and somehow make it into economics honors?
5. Are Econ professors willing to take on undergrad students for research? How easy/hard is it or is it dependent on the prof?

I am taking COM 217, ECON 360 and ECON 370 over summer to try and raise my Econ gpa asap and will try to finish up most econ courses in fall semester. I have already taken Econ 251, 252, 340, 451.

Any other suggestions for which courses I should take and which I should avoid?"

I am a software engineer with ~2 years experience. Within those two years I have worked on a multitude of different projects (AI&amp;ML, DevOps, etc), with the general theme being Python. While a varied role appealed to me when I was first getting into the field, I now wish to focus into one field which caught my interest, data engineering.

During my young career, I have had some exposure to data engineering, including a 3 month internship that was solely data focused, and various projects in my current role, but it has not been the focus.

How easy would it be to transition to a full time data engineering role? How valuable is my more general software engineering experience? Any prepation/reading you would recommend ahead of interviews?"
mrnutq,1,2021-04-15,Been interning at a company for 6 months and I feel like I've been exploited - what are my intellectual property rights?,Moozeyy,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/mrnutq/been_interning_at_a_company_for_6_months_and_i/,"I joined a company to intern at in the US (NYC) back in September and have been developing a project for my boss since then. I didn't get any help, and the only thing my boss really did was tell me what to do in terms of how the project should look and give potential ideas on how to optimize it. Throughout my time spent there I saw quite a bit of red flags, but this was a field I really wanted to work in (Quantitative Finance) and I don't have much on my resume so I continued to work on it.

My contract expired on February 14th and that weekend he proposed an extension on my internship since it wasn't finished. At first I was hesitant to sign because I worked really hard on this project, days and nights on weekends too out of my own incentive and never got any compensation (I was an unpaid intern). I needed these resume bullet points to make myself more marketable to other companies and he kept giving me these promises like: I'm going to make a ton of money once we market this product out to others, he's going to make me CEO of this company, he wants to work with me long term etc. so I never ended up signing the document.

I called him a few weeks after asking him why he isn't able to pay me (the office is in Wall Street so it didn't make much sense to me as to why it wasn't possible for me to get compensation). Basically, he told me that him paying me would hinder our work dynamic, which I still don't understand. There was one week where I told him I wouldn't work because I didn't know what my intellectual property rights were and he proceeded by guilt tripping me ""Not doing work is more damaging to you in my honest opinion"", ""See, you slowed down this is what I meant"". After this conversation I asked if what I mentioned would be mentioned in the document and he said yes, and thats what got me to work again.

On a weekly basis I've been asking my boss for the contract and for several weeks he would just tell me that he's waiting on the investors to get back to him (his idea was to start a new company revolved around my product so he needed investors from the main company to help fund this, which is fair I think). But for the most part I was the only party that was actually proactive in asking for status updates on the contract and usually he wouldn't answer the question unless I was **really** pushy about it. Also in some cases when I would ask this question he wouldn't respond for 2-3 days (this happened twice).

This behavior continued until last week, where he finally got me the contract. After taking a look at it and going over it with some friends, it looks more like a transfer of ownership contract (to give IP rights to this new company we're creating) and the only compensation I'm being given is a 20% stake at the company (split into shares), but that can change in the case where we add in new workers. Of course I was disappointed by this, because I thought I would've gotten a proper employment contract with job title, salary, working hours, etc. He previously mentioned giving me a signing bonus and this wasn't mentioned in the contract either and it sounds like he didn't think of this until I pressed for it. In  some cases, he would tell me that the contract was ready and would end up not sending it (he kept me hanging on this for about 2 weeks, saying it was going to be ready really soon but never ended up sending it). He asked me to push the latest changes to the project onto the company repository because it was a technical discrepancy, so they technically have a working product under their company (I wouldn't say usable since it runs pretty slow and isn't feasible for running in real time).

The red flags I'm seeing are the following: It was a 5 page contract that looks like a regular, cookie cutter, copied and pasted contract. The only compensation I'm getting is a 20% stake which is subject to change. The lack of meaningful responses, and lack of response time. All the empty promises he had given me in regards to what's going to be on the contract, the compensation I'm getting, the lack of response time, and the guilt tripping. Also I checked the company on glassdoor, one of the two reviews came from another intern who supposedly interned there for 3 years and marked the company as a scam (he probably didn't get any compensation either). The other one was a five star review which I have a feeling came from people in the company itself. Lastly, I checked the main company website and it's down completely.

The biggest concerns I have right now is - I have the project that I made entirely by myself, do I have the right to claim this project as my own? I don't want anything to do with this company anymore, but if they end up making a ton of money off of all of my work I'm going to be pretty upset. At the same time though, I was under a contract from September to February 14th, and have not been under a contract since so they have a copy of all of my work. Am I obligated to give them the changes to the code that I wrote after that date? Also I was in the process of trying to make it faster but stopped working because of this mess. Am I obligated to give the changes I made onto their repository? If I don't, could I get in legal trouble?

I'm aware that I probably screwed myself over by working without a contract for so long. Right now I really just want to cut my losses and leave with the experience and project under my belt. I'm fully ready to start my job hunt again, but want to make sure that there aren't any issues with transitioning from working to actively searching again.

If you read this far, thank you very much. I'm not too optimistic about this situation but if there's a way I could claim rights for my work and cut ties with this company in a clean way, that would be great.

So I’d like you guys to reverse chance me for some Target + Safety schools that are more reasonable.

My only requirement is that they have a good CS or Electrical Engineering program. Location isn’t too much of an issue (although California might be a bit too far for instance, not gonna give my state).

Academics:
SAT: 1530 (730 ERW, 800 Math) 
**Retook the SAT with English superscore in mind, waiting on the results
GPA: 98.67/100 UW (4.0 GPA) Weighted not reported
Class Rank: Not reported in my school but prob top 5% (really competitive school).
Courseload: 5 AP’s, 2 DE, and the rest of my classes should be honours (10?)

Senior Courseload: Should be in Multivariable, and something like 2-3 more AP’s depending on which ones I got into.


EC’s:
- Indoor Track/ Outdoor Track / Cross Country (4 years, was a major time commitment)
- Internships over the summer and during school year for a teacher, basically IT at the school (pretty high time commitment at the time)
- Deacon at my local church (1-2 hours a week)
- Church basketball for a year
- Programmer Hobbyist, lots of Udemy Courses
- Designing a website for the school in Full Stack Dev in a group

Awards/ Honours: 
- NHS (applying to be an officer)
- Programming competition I applied to in a group, it’s May 1st so we’ll see then
- Basically nothing else, weakest part of my application

Letters of Rec: Don’t have them yet obv, but I got 2 great teachers who know me well to write them so they shouldn’t be anything below 7-8/10.

Anyway what would my target school like? I was already looking at Boston University/ NYU/ Georgia Tech but I’d like some more help narrowing down good CS programs in schools like those."

I applied only to PhDs and a few fully funded research master's degrees. Today, I got to know that I have been rejected by each of them. Since I still would like to pursue grad school, other than studying for retaking the GRE (V165, Q168, A4.5), what could I do to improve my application?

Also, I understand that it may be hard to give advice without knowing anything about me. Then, I'm an international student with an undergrad from a midwest college where I got a 3.65 GPA. I have one properly published research article, and my field is Computer Science.

I've been working at a software company for 7 months now. There are a lot of ways I feel like I've taken on a senior role, in that I'm often in the center of where responsibility lands and the final gatekeeper for uploading to git. I signed up as an ordinary developer and very quickly I feel like the center of the team.

When I came, my boss saw a potential for growth for the company, and we had a very, very rocky delivery on a product, but out of it blossomed another product that has brought a lot of opportunity and demand, so much that my boss hired 8 more individuals. 

At the center of this product is me producing the primary architecture for it - the message queues, the controllers, the databases, the caches, the automated scripts, the release management, the error logging, the documentation, the routes, some of the testing, and the security monitoring. There is nothing that I've felt I couldn't accomplish... with enough time.

Now finally, next week we will deploy our product, that I've been working on for 6 months now, at a really difficult pace even though it's been half a year, because we've been understaffed and I've been stretched very thin between operations/monitoring and development. I'm nervous and stressed out.

No one else on my team currently has the technical knowledge required to map out all the pipelines - I really need to dump my brain into documentation in case I die or something. Generally I come in at 6:30 or 7 to work and stay till about 6 or 7, sometimes as late as 12, but I often take a nap in my car. I am never not thinking about work.

My project manager who just joined last month is very different from the CEO who I used to communicate directly with - while my CEO wants things done quickly and is a risk-taker and pushes a lot for features, my project manager is much more organized, and keeping promises on deadlines matters much more to him, while my CEO will go into meetings not knowing if a feature is ready or not. My project manager has gotten extremely upset at me for getting late on things, or being wishy washy with time estimates. At the same time he has thanked me and I know he is stressed out too.

I'm excited to come to work, to build and create. I love pipelines, message queues, processing data, and learning new programming skills. But I feel like the situation is reaching a tipping point, because now we have to also manage paying customers, and I'm the only operations person, and I have my own features to develop. I have never deployed software to a customer, but people still look to me for guidance on how to do many things. The product we're delivering still has bugs and unimplemented features, but it's a race against time to fix them all.

I am constantly asked ""is this ready"", ""how come this isn't done"", ""we're gonna get a lawsuit"", ""this should be completed already"". I'm very tired and I constantly feel like I'm not a good leader. I'm often asked to help set up environments and mentor others. We need more developers but at the same time we're at a place where we're not financially stable enough to go down this path.

I would feel terrible if I 1) took a vacation or 2) departed. We started with 4 people, the CEO, myself, the tech lead and another developer, and now have grown to 13 people, 6 of whom are developers, but one is always sick (the tech lead) and the other is an intern. Not to make myself sound more important than I am, but if I shirked my responsibilities by leaving, this would set the company back 2 months, everyone would be at risk of being fired, we could never deliver on our already late product deliveries. I don't want that for my colleagues, but at the same time I'm exhausted.

At the end of this, I have only been a developer for 2 years, and in general, I am moving a little quickly toward senior level duties. I am proud and happy to be growing, but I also feel like I'm constantly hitting failure. Every week is a demo and every week something breaks. There is a 50% chance of something going wrong during a demo.

I am also lacking in a lot of skills, like CI/CD, multiprocessing and multicore programming on AWS that end up as random bugs that go unresolved, and often getting stuck during slow development due to a debugger or some other issue.

Guess I'm just venting. Have you guys had experiences like this? What did you do to overcome it?"

I'm aspiring to be a web dev. I've read around and I've heard that typically big companies don't really value your experience in smaller companies (i.e Working at spotify is way more impactful in a reusme than a noname company - despite you putting more time and work in the no name company); people mentioning that a lot of startups don't usually mentor well / let interns write ""poor"" coding practices. Another downside is that employers can't really see what you've done.

Would it be more beneficial to put more effort and time in building more side projects rather than working at a startup? Afterall, 8 hours a day for 4 months is a lot of time that could be invested in side projects!"

I was never a great student during my life, but it wasn't for lack of effort. I worked as hard as I could and even spent many hours with a private tutor. Graduating in the bottom middle of my class, I was very proud to receive my degree after 5.5 years of hard university work. However, today I am ashamed that I have it and try to avoid the topic.

In college, I had an unexpectedly short internship where the manager fired me and told me I would never become a developer. These words hit me hard and is a meeting that I will never forget. After college, I did apply for a few developer roles and even was extended an offer as a developer in test. I ended up turning down the potion with the memory of the words said to me by the manager who fired me. Instead I have only worked in customer support. As I sit in the customer support department, it has really saddened me to realize that if I was a terrible developer over ten years ago, there is no way I could get into it today. I live vicariously through the development department at my company knowing how close I came. As a consolation prize, my plan was to try to work my way up the support hierarchy, but outside new hires have always been placed above me. In the two companies I have worked for, I have never been promoted past a ""senior"" customer support agent even though I am regularly a top performer.

I am thankful for my current employment. I don't believe I could ever find a job that pays as well, plus it includes health insurance which I cannot go without. The most pressure I feel comes from the fact that I have a family that depends on me to provide for them. It is my biggest secret from my family that I am not a software developer. It is my biggest fear that I will lose my job and wouldn't be able to find an equal job elsewhere as customer support agents typically are not paid as well.

My question/advice request is, how could I get back into becoming a developer? When I finished school, docker, kubernetes, and the language Go weren't even a thing. I am way out dated. I don't know if it is the same for others, but if I don't actively use something (anything) knowledge related, I'll forget it.

You might have seen my post recently about looking for target schools, but now I'm back for a more traditional chance me.

I'm leaving a lot of parts intentionally vague bc I have some pretty niche and easy-to-id activities

I have a slight technicality in my grades. basically, every semester of hs ive been doing well, but this semester a my health condition started getting a lot worse, so i can't really get work done or even do a lot of my hobbies without some issues. Def going to be a pretty big GPA drop. I'm supposed to have some accomodations for it but none of the teachers have really taken it into account.

**Demographics/School Info:** White female, avg. public hs in northeast, LGBTQ, 

**Test scores:** 35 ACT, Math II and World History subject tests: 800

4.0UW GPA but its going down this semester (see above), no class rank

**Courses:**

Not going to get specific, but probably taking 10 or 12 aps total (a few self-studied) plus 2 DE classes 

**Intended major:** Not fully sure, something STEM-related, feel free to suggest majors you think work well with my activities!! I really like earth and enviro science tho and bioengineering!!

**ECs**

Research with HYPSM neuroscientist- super cool research from cold emailing (it actually worked??) Not getting into specifics, but paper was published

Research this summer with Caltech phd, environmental chemistry work (more cold emailing lol)

Internship- also not getting into specifics, but lead research intern for a stem media company

Engineering service project- VERY niche so no specifics, but it has a weirdly interesting backstory??? involved for six-seven years and have had a pretty big impact on community from it 

engineering club, 4 years

(Insert sate) Gov School of Sciences- it was a miracle I got in bc my psat was pretty low for the program, but my essays were phenom

ok here's where it gets kinda niche-- I sepecialize in a very specific type of art (i really hope this isnt too obvious to identify me), i have a good amount of achievements within this art form and its probably my fav thing to do. im def going to submit a portfolio to all the schools I apply to just because i put more time into this than anything else really and its very cool looking!! This is part of why I want to ED to brown, since risd actually offers some classes in this art form and id love to finally get some formal training instead of just what my grandma taught me lol

marching band- 4 years, maybe section leader ?? Really just here because its a big time commitment 

Volunteer tutor in a number of subjects, done on my own time

**Awards**:

AIME qualifier

small scholarship from women in science org

biliteracy (not specifying language)

school award

published a few articles in local newspaper (not really a big deal, theres only 1000 ppl in the town)

**LOR: (i asked the two teachers who actually care about the whole gpa drop thing im having because they can sort of explain it a bit and also wont say ""oh theyre a good student but gave up in my class at the end of the year"")**

AP Lang teacher: probably good, i'm a really good writer and she knows it. we also discussed the topic of the LOR and she is super excited about it, 

Bio teacher: favorite teacher hands down, i volunteer for her and she knows about my health issue and see how hard ive been working despite it

Maybe internship coordinator? we know each other well and shes an engineer!!

Not sure about essays yet

**Schools**

brown (ED)!!!!! Absolute first choice, love the location, the super sick trails literally 15 mins away, the OPEN CURRICULUM!!!!! risd partnership, size, nice downtown, i love it sm

EA (there's a lot so some of the reach-ier schools I'll push to RD): MIT, UVA (OOS), Northeastern, RPI, University of Vermont (one of my top schools), Wisconsin, state school

RD: Cornell, Duke, W&amp;M (OOS female, rip my chances), Bowdoin, UC Berkeley, columbia"

I am currently attending ASU online MCS program and almost complete my 2nd graduate class at ASU. Recently, I got an admission offer by UIUC online MCS program and I wonder if I should transfer?

Here are the comparisons and my goals.

\- I don't have any real-life programming experience but I want to get a software engineer job.

\- UIUC requires 8 classes to graduate and ASU requires 10 classes to graduate. Each class in UIUC is 4 units and ASU is 3 units. In my case, I would have 8 classes left to complete in ASU and around 7 classes left in UIUC (I need to confirm with UIUC with that).

\- I think I can graduate with a 3.8 GPA in ASU. As for UIUC, I think I can graduate with the worst-case scenario of a 3.2 GPA. I made this assumption based on the level of increased competition at UIUC.

\- I heard that UIUC has a good network of FANG companies and others, is that true? I am currently attending ASU and I don't see any increased opportunity for a software engineer internship. I recently applied for Walmart internship with a 4.0 GPA at ASU and got an email rejection one day later. I don't even get a coding challenge at all."

I really want to study graphic design and computer science, either through a double major or some combined degree program (other options include: UI/UX majors, computer graphics, computer animation...). I've found several schools/programs that would allow me to do that, but I'm really looking for some more matches, especially in the Northeast (though anything helps!).

**Demographic:**

Upper-middle-class female

Very underrepresented state, small rural high school.

**Stats:**

UW GPA: 4.0 (school doesn't calculate weighted)

SAT: 1570 and 1520 on my last practice tests

APs: will graduate with 8/8 offered, have only taken AP Bio so far, but I got a 4 without taking the class.

Other coursework: Will also have an additional 6 dual-enrollment classes and 3 overload classes

**Major ECs:**

* Menstrual advocacy club founder and president (15 members, ran a drive that collected over 4,000 products for a local homeless shelter)
* Art instagram (1.3k followers right now although hopefully I'll be closer to 2k by the fall haha, I've been posting weekly at minimum for about a year and a half)
* Freelance graphic design (including product and logo design for a regional branch of the Sierra Club, a law school, and a local restaurant. Learning HTML on my own to create a real website for myself)
* Graphic design competition state champion (not sharing details for privacy reasons, but it's a pretty competitive competition and I've done it all through high school)
* Student government (junior VP, good shot at senior class president)
* Research internship (working in a bio lab, first presenter on a poster)

Stuff I haven't done yet but I'm working on and will hopefully have ready by college app deadlines:

* Organizing coding camp for middle school girls 
* App development (I've been working on developing this period tracker/women's health app since the fall, I don't know if I'll be able to get it finished and on the App Store but the interface design won a competition and I've invested a good amount of time in the programming)

Again, looking mainly for matches. My list is currently dominated by wildly expensive reaches :)"

AP Chemistry teacher: 8/10, mentored me in getting internships and research positions at local universities through networking. 

AP Physics teacher: 9/10, similar upbringing and childhood. Similar hobbies. Also consoled me through the loss of my sibling. Talked about my drive, mindset, and perseverance. (Hope that didnt sound like self-praise)

Essays:

My common app was incredibly pretentious but I reviewed it and edited it so many times that I think the quality and content was A+. Talked about my sibling who I lost to a neurological illness and how taking care of them and watching them pass stimulated my drive and passion for neuroscience and neurobiology. Also included my family and how connected we are to our homeland.

-Interviews

Harvard: 5/10. Felt like I was on trial or being cross examined lol. Not awkward just very confrontational/questioning. Im sure my interviewer didnt mean for it to come across like that.

Yale: 10/10. Couldnt have gone better. Interviewer was kind and we really had a natural conversation that lasted hours. It felt like I was talking to a regular friend about different topics.

Princeton: 4/10. Kinda the same thing as harvard. Felt more like a questioning than an interview. More awkward than harvard

Upenn: 6/10. Very awkward and short but nothing went particularly wrong.

Brown: 2/10. I was out of it on this day. I woke up feeling very “fuck it, im gonna die anyways” sorry to my interviewer. Short and Q&amp;A. Definitely didnt give off the “bubbly” personality that ivies want. 

Declined interviews for all others

I graduated from college in January and have been applying to jobs over the last few months. Last week I was was given an opportunity for a 3-month contract position as a front-end developer at a small local business (with decent pay). To test my skill, I was asked to build out a React component with TypeScript and MaterialUI which I did over the weekend and submitted it on Monday. 

Prior to this, I had about 8 months of experience using React and little to no experience with TypeScript and MaterialUI (which they are aware of). I talked to them on Wednesday and they offered me the contract on the spot. This is the first real job offer I had gotten besides internships through the college. I got on a call with them yesterday where they introduced me to the project and went over my responsibilities. They were very friendly and welcoming and took the time to show me their workflow and walk me through their codebase.

However, after looking through the code, I felt extremely overwhelmed and I’m currently doubting my ability to complete the work in a timely manner if at all. It seems a lot more difficult than the task they had assigned me last week. I just can’t help but wonder why they hired me if I’m being honest.

I also know nothing about contract work. I don’t know how to invoice. Do I charge them for time spent learning? I feel like I’m in way over my head and lack the experience for this position. I’m really considering just quitting and looking for a full-time job as a junior dev but figured I’d ask what you guys think first."

Today, there was a mass shooting at a fedex facility.

its not fair. i cant stop thinking how all these people should still be here. all of these lives we have lost deserve to be alive still. it just feels like everyone is dying, like nobody is safe anymore, like nobody cares about the dignity of human lives anymore. does anybody else feel a little hopeless about the world we live in lately? im not trying to be pessimistic, i guess i just want to see if anyone else is mourning right now. if anyone has any ideas or thoughts on what we need to do. i know we are all trying to get good grades, a degree, jobs, internships, etc. but i guess i just feel a bit lost, i dont know what i can do to to fix these problems. i can get a job or make money or get good grades, but what can i do now to help. what can i do to honor the souls we have lost. what can i do to stop this from happening. sometimes it feels like i cant do anything. idk what to do, i want to change these things, i want to change this all so all of these people would still be with us. it feels like cornell doesnt care about it students. since i have been enrolled, one student has died each year. its becoming all too common. does anyone else just feel beaten down, mournful, and sad right now with all that is going on/ does anyone else feel like the world is just setting everyone up for failure. does anyone else feel like cornell just rly doesnt care about its students"

So I will have to redo a semester. I am too late to roll on for the fall semester, and the courses for the spring semester aren't too great.So I am considering taking a gap year. 
As part of my bachelor's i already had two internships of half a year, so I already have some  experience in a company. 
But I want to take a step away from engineering for a bit, because this year has been too much.
I am thinking of living abroad and doing some volunteering work. This would be for some personal development. After a year in lockdown I need to become a bit more social again. 
My question is, is such a gap year frowned upon by recruiters? Or don't they really care about it, after your first job?

Being able to apply and getting rejected would've been better in my position now, I guess.

I am undecided whether I should go on with one of the top universities in my country which are not very good (in terms of global rankings etc.) or take a gap year. Therefore, your opinions on my profile will be meaningful and they are appreciated. :)

* Mathematics Teacher (9/10): She has been my class advisor and mathematics teacher for 4 years. She witnessed the hardships I had in my personal life as well.
* English Teacher (8/10): He's been teaching English for 4 years. Even though not as much as my mathematics teacher, he knows about the hardships I had as well.
* Startup Co-founder (6/10): I don't really know what he has written but we did not have strong personal ties. We've been through a lot of challenging situations though.
* Olympiad Coach (6/10): This is a letter from the professor who is responsible for leading National Olympiads in my field. To be precise, this letter's purpose is more like confirming my skillset in the Olympiad field. So, it doesn't have personal aspects and it is an academic letter. That's why I kept the score low for this one. (If I take a gap year, I don't know if I will be able to get this letter again since I left the Olympiad track to study for National Exams and focus on a game project.)

**Interviews**

None lol

**Essays**

* Common App Personal Essay (10/10): I believe I reflected the environment I grew up pretty good and mentioned how drastically a crisis affected my family. Other than the unusual circumstances in my life, I talked about how I devised my own alternative ways to enjoy life and create intellectual value when I did not have access to some instruments, resources etc. Also, I mentioned the culture shock I had after a radical environment change and how I adapted to the new cultural atmosphere in correlation with my intellectual growth.
* ""Why Cornell"" Essay (8/10): I made my research and emphasized on the college's opportunities (events etc.) which reflected me and drew my attention. I had some pretty nice sentences which reflected my excitement through mixing computer science jargon and Cornell specific details.
* *""Why Northwestern"" Essay (7/10):* I made a thorough research and reflected the points which drew my attention and projects I can contribute to in the future etc.

*Acceptances:*

* Bocconi (Italy) (Won't be attending due to the housing fee)

*Rejections:*

* MIT
* Northwestern
* Harvard
* Cornell

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think my chances are if I reapply next year *normally*? Also, how bad does my class rank affect my application?"

I'm wondering if it's worth taking it, as I'm worried it'll interfere with academics. The only reason I would really want to take it is if it helps boost my career in any way.

In short, how much does a non-CS job impact a sophomore's resume? Is it really worth taking it?

Some info about me:

* I'm a sophomore majoring in CS wanting to do software dev

* I have side projects on my resume, but no internship or work experience

Thank you."

They announced it as if it was an internship at Discover, for whatever your interests were: analytics, marketing, business, whatever.

But instead of that it’s some ’exploration program” which I don’t even know what it means. I’m fed up because none of them can give me a straight answer as to what it is, and I received acceptance for it and they expect commitment from 9AM-3PM and I don’t even know any kind of schedule about. Anyways for those of you who got it, awesome, but it doesn’t seem like something spending your time doing, especially if your in tech and a cs/data analytics student."

I ended with a C+ in Calc 2 so I used a Pass so it wouldn't affect my GPA, I was wondering if I should use a Pass for my linear algebra class as well IF i do end up with a C+ again? How will this affect my chances of getting an internship? And if any recruiters are reading this, how important is my transcript? I don't plan on relying on college classes and I'm constantly learning languages and creating personal projects. I want to know if it's worth saving my GPA (I plan on applying to internships next fall) or to take the L and move on.

Currently I am thinking of reach out to my peers on linkedin to chip in a 2b apt during the summer, but I don't know if that's a weird thing to do. I can rent a studio which would cost 6k for three months if shared room doesn't work out. Usually during school I would avoid living by myself alone, but I don't know if that would be a good thing for an internship or work in general, especially considering that I am a software engineer who doesn't really have a social life."
ms3wpg,2,2021-04-16,Been losing a lot of confidence in my career before it ever started (long rant),CPPsBigPp,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ms3wpg/been_losing_a_lot_of_confidence_in_my_career/,"I'm currently a student at a smaller state university that's very well known within the area for its cybersecurity/information systems program. Ever since I started college, I knew I needed to get involved in order to get something on my resume, especially when a lot of my peers knew a lot of technical knowledge out the gate as opposed to how little I knew. 

I ended up signing up for a cybersecurity club that's had a very big reputation throughout the years, where a lot of recruiters will come to us for students and our alumni tend to go off towards very successful careers later in life. I was able to get enough notice to have an officer position, where I answered a lot of emails and dealt with organizing conferences/guest speakers for our events - which got me in touch with a lot of professionals within the area. 

It wasn't the most technical role available but one that I could put on my resume while I worked on certifications. The club made me happy and I enjoyed staying there, until I was voted out and could not continue next year due to losing re-elections. 

I tried to find other ways besides there to improve myself, like studying for certifications, such as the CCNA and AWS cloud practitioner - which I ended up failing twice. It was really difficult for me to stay focused without a group of friends to keep me accountable and online study groups just made it hard to stay engaged, to the point where I just stopped going. 

I also tried to find other clubs or activities where at least I could work with people but I also was rejected from tryouts there. Because of this, I couldn't find any other activities that could take me from there. 

I tried to reach out to professionals for mentorship, especially towards building my own projects because I wanted to work more with pen testing, but multiple people ghosted me and I have not heard back in weeks. I've tried to network for internships too but I regularly get multiple rejections a month for both cold outreach and referrals from people I've vaguely known in my time at school. 

Alongside these constant rejects from my competitive teams, clubs, mentors, internships, etc. I just don't know what I can do anymore. I'm about 3/4ths done with college and graduating Summer 2022 which just makes me stressed on what I could be doing wrong in my career. I've never been the most technical person in the room but I want to at least be respected and have some sort of job security later on. I'm just in a really rough spot and I'm at a loss if my enjoyment for this field is even relevant anymore if I'm met with rejection after rejected. I have marketable skills in public speaking and teaching, but even afterwards I just don't know what to do."

Sorry for the long post (I just want to give enough information)

I am a student and I graduate with my bachelor's in Computer Science in December 2021 and am trying to get a job as either a software developer or a data scientist in January 2022.  I have a few questions (not sure if the first question is one for this subreddit or the r/csMajors subreddit, so I'm posting in both haha).

Background:  I am a senior right now and I graduate in December 2021.  My highest level classes (in terms of general development and theory, no specific field) I have taken is Operating Systems (did some writing in C and in the Ubuntu OS virtualbox), a Programming Languages class (I built an interpreter in C++ to interpret TIPS (a subset of Pascal)).

Projects on my Github: 1

I built a feed-forward, multi-layered, convolutional neural network. Used Python 3.8, Pytorch, NumPy, and the Pycharm IDE. The network was trained to distinguish pictures of cats versus pictures of dogs and was trained with the Microsoft Cats vs Dogs dataset. In some pictures the dogs or cats were the focus of the picture, while in other pictures the animals were not the focus.

Internships:  I don't have a software development based internship on my resume yet.  I have one scheduled for this summer.  The only internship I have teaching kids how to program and doing a little programming on three robots. 

Questions:

1)  If one has been created, can someone please provide a link to a pitts-github for a new grad who wants to get a full-time job in January 2022?  What about a link to a website similar to pitts-github?  What I mean is a website that has a bunch of new grad positions for January 2022 that I can do a binge apply on.

2)  Given the information above, what do I need to do to better my chances of getting an entry-level new grad job?

3)  What is expected of a new-grad when they apply?  

4)  What are some typical behavioral questions for a new-grad interview?  What about technical questions for the interview?  What are some other questions (minus behavioral/technical questions)?

5)  Do you have any advice for me about applying and interviews?  Any and all advice would be appreciated.

ms88gv,634,2021-04-16,I feel like being too ambitious is going to result in me falling flat on my face.,iwanttobemesomeday,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ms88gv/i_feel_like_being_too_ambitious_is_going_to/,"I did my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. Now wanting to do a master's in Computational Science and Engineering, my interests mostly lie in studying different fields holistically. I believe that there are a lot of ways to relate one subject to another, and hence I should be able to study different systems as-a-whole from a broader perspective.

This led me to a variety of different subjects such as emergence, complex systems, etc. And now I feel like I'm slowly moving away from mechanical engineering. I have applied to different master's programs, which have further specializations within: some have CSE in Mechanical Engineering, CSE in Physics, CSE in Math, etc.  I honestly do not know where to go from here. CSE in Mech seems like a safe bet, at least I will get the admission that way. CSE in Math is where I really want to go, but I don't think I have the necessary knowledge of pure math that may be expected of me.

I see all these Ph.D. students on youtube and other magazines/blogs, writing about exciting stuff, and I want to be able to do that: write about advanced scientific stuff that I find exciting. Getting a master's, at this point, seems like such a challenge because I am just an average student. From a widely hated third world country. I used to think that a 3.40 GPA is going to come in handy someday, and boy I was dumbfounded. Last year I didn't get any admissions nor a decent job. I don't have a lot of hope left and it continues to deplete further each year. This pandemic is surely making things worse than it needs to be.

I help out my friends in their projects, they find me somewhat intelligent because I get their work done. I taught myself programming in python and made a couple of projects related to complex systems. I find my hopes and dreams too ambitious, especially because it involves getting out of this country and becoming a researcher in the field of complex systems, CSE, or dynamical systems, then coming back and provide free education, open various platforms online and locally where I can teach. After being a researcher, I feel like I can make some contributions in these exciting fields as well. I don't want to do dead-end jobs, not because I am proud, but because I feel like they don't give you happiness, they steal some artistic or creative part of you. I did some internships and I have seen people that are doing the same thing on their jobs each day. They don't find the work exciting either and are only in it for the money. Which is completely fine, if they themselves are fine with it.

This constant feeling of hopelessness sometimes gets too overwhelming, I have friends to talk about this, but it seems annoying to talk to about the same problems again and again. I'm sure they don't mind, but I do. I feel like I'm being too much. The few others I have talked to tell me that I am too ambitious, they feel I am childish in having such big dreams. And I am starting to believe them too. Each year, the financial situation is getting worse. Each year, the hope of getting admission is getting less. Each year, I'm finding it hard to look at myself.

I thank you if you've read this much."

And now I need some further advice from you guys. 

Currently I am working as an Intern as BI Consultant at sort of startup company, which was founded by consultants who fled from a  BIG4 Company. These guys are really fun to work with. There is no stress and everyone is happy and satisfied.  I would start as Junior BI soon. My responsibilties are quite easy for me.  Travelling isnt much involved. However the pay is sort of average. Although the company is expanding quickly, I dont expect higher pay. In all its stress free job , no over time but with average pay. 

Now i have also recieved a job offer for junior SAP  BW/BI Consultant. It is well paid job. After 3-4 years experience, I expect really high yearly salary. Job responsibilties are bit challenging as SAP is very complex which no one really likes to use. Boss said I should be ready to travel upto 4 days in a week.  Employees are expected to put overtime in projects(Its also written in job agreement!).

The company is well established with 200 consultants working for it. They are interested in young people who are ready to take responsibilties and stick with the company for long term. 

Both companies are reviewed well by their employees. 

Now I dont know which one to go for. What would you chose if you were in my position ?"
ms9jum,1,2021-04-16,US Citizen Doing US Internship Although He Lives in Europe,Randominternetuser_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ms9jum/us_citizen_doing_us_internship_although_he_lives/,"So I'm an American citizen and I pretty much grew up in Europe so I have definitely identified myself with the mannerisms and identity of a European. I also decided that I wanted to study Computer Science in Europe because I am still close to my family which was important to me. Deep down however, I do want to slowly move towards the American, Tech-Dense areas (eg. SF, NYC, Seattle, Austin) but I just came to the realisation that this might become a more difficult job than I thought. 

A friend of mine told me that international students really struggle receiving internships due to all the VISA issues but my case is that I'm American.. I guess what I'm asking is if anyone has experience with/knows if I, as an American citizen can still apply to internships in silicone valley for instance, if I am studying in Europe?

TLDR; American citizen living in Europe wondering if they can still apply for US internships from Europe and have a chance."
msa1dm,1,2021-04-16,"Might have to renege on an offer, advice/experience?",asvpgab,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/msa1dm/might_have_to_renege_on_an_offer_adviceexperience/,"Hey all! So I'm kinda in a bit of a pickle right now. I'm about to graduate with my Master's in Counseling (yay!!). I just had a job offer from my internship site which I've been at for about a year. I do enjoy the work and the organization, and it's only a 10 minute drive from my house. I've had a few other interviews prior and none decided to hire me, which is fine. After they offered me the job, I considered all the factors and accepted the offer. 

However, I just got a request to do an interview with a job that is much higher paying (like double the amount at the job I accepted). I know a lot about this job because a colleague works there, and she referred them to me and highly recommended me. This job would also help me gain more experience in private practice, which is an area I'm interested in for the future. The only con is that it's an hour away. If I get offered this job, would it be terrible to renege from the previous offer? The interview is a month away (the supervisor wants to wait until I'm close to graduation to interview me) so even if I had asked my internship site for more time, I don't think they'd want to wait more than a month. I'm thinking of talking to my internship supervisor when the time comes and explaining that the offer is double what I would be making, plus they would offer me free supervision whereas at my internship I would need to pay for it. I think she will understand, but I really don't want to burn bridges because it was a really valuable internship. I can imagine there are a few people here that have been in this situation. How did it turn out?"

I am currently a part time infosec intern and I love it. But the full time jobs I am looking at make me feel like an idiot. They want me to automate, know 3 programming languages, know how to pen test and on top of that have 5+yrs of experience.

msb379,2,2021-04-16,Avoiding the resume black-hole and finding work without a Career Fair [USA],h_allover,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/msb379/avoiding_the_resume_blackhole_and_finding_work/,"Hi all,

I'm graduating with my B.S. in Applied Physics this week and it's been such a rewarding journey for the last five years. However, I'm really struggling to find work right now, in large part due to my university cancelling career fairs and other job-search related programs due to the lockdowns. My job search efforts have been completely fruitless over the last few months and it's getting difficult to keep up good spirits.

To give you a little background, my research and coursework over the last five years has been heavily focused on developing machine-learning techniques that will help us predict the properties of engineering materials faster. The internships I've worked have been focused on writing scalable software for scientific applications.

How am I supposed to find work right now? Despite five years of Python and machine learning experience, it appears that I'm not competitive enough for most software jobs, and it's exactly the same situation for engineering-like positions. I just have no idea where to look for work, or where a computational physics focused undergraduate can find his niche. My wife is still in school (graduating in December) so we're in a bit of an awkward situation as far as relocation goes, but we're okay with going long distance for a few months if that's what's necessary.

I know that networking is the ""end all be all"" for finding work, but with everything being done remotely I'm finding it really difficult to make networking work for me. It could be that I'm just not very good at it, but it hasn't been any more productive than just blasting my resume out to every job posting out there.

I'd love any advice you could give me in figuring out how to prioritize my time and energy so that I can be more successful in my job search. Thanks in advance."

I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo (Canada) and I'm looking to get some feedback from the csMajors community. I've been lucky enough to secure internships at companies like Bloomberg and Facebook and many of my friends have worked at the likes of Google, Snap, Amazon, etc.

I'm considering writing some sort of content (either a blog or a short guide) that goes through the steps you can follow to land your dream internship.

What should I do?,mlgattracing,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/msbfw2/freshman_in_college_studying_cis_what_should_i_do/,"Hi, I’m a freshman in college studying CIS. I’m currently in my 2nd semester and I want to make sure I get an actual solid paying job out of college (50-60k). So far the only relevant courses i’ve taken are Intro to CIS and i’m currently taking Python programming. 

When should I start looking for internships? I was thinking finding paid ones next summer. I’m kind of confused on what to do because I haven’t gotten any guidance from my school or parents (i’m first generation college student).

Any help or advice is appreciated."
msd5bz,4,2021-04-16,How do you get internships?!,WithinButWithout,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/msd5bz/how_do_you_get_internships/,"I applied to 60+ computer science internships and didn't get an interview for one of them and didn't get a reply email from most of them. I have a fine GPA at 3.64, I'm an Honors student and I worked for the university teaching other undergraduates the principles of CS. I'm on track to graduate in 4 years and I have worked on personal projects and I'm part of several organizations. My cover letters and resumes were customized to each job. I work during school and still maintain good grades but I can't seem to get in contact with recruiters.

Then I have a friend who works at a company suggest I apply. I don't even have an interview and they just hire me because I know him. It's not necessarily an internship but it is software related so I'm lucky.

It's not what you know, it's who you know. 

Applying on company websites has yet to work in any way for me. No emails back or only rejections. How was NO ONE INTERESTED AT ALL? I even applied locally! Beforehand, I met with career advisors, friends, family, and A PROFESSOR to critique my resume and cover letters and it did nothing! Most job applications I never even heard from at all. I even applied using certain companies' APIs or posting a JSON with my resume on their server. Nothing. I used ZipRecruiters, LinkedIn, AngelList, Workday, local (virtual) job fairs. Is it supposed to be this way? Are online job posting just a formality? Are they just so the company can have the illusion of equal consideration for all candidates? If I didn't have that friend, how was I supposed to get an internship or job?! Every single person I know with a new job has gotten their job because they knew someone. I feel like I wasted months of my life applying for jobs that maybe didn't even exist."

msdks5,17,2021-04-16,Feeling extremely nihilistic. Half rant and half looking for advice.,ntxve,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/msdks5/feeling_extremely_nihilistic_half_rant_and_half/,"I was born out of wedlock and had a nonexistent relationship with my mom, but a good relationship with my dad for my childhood. My relationship with my dad went really downhill when he got remarried and it felt like he essentially put me on the sidelines and just focused on his new family. My dad got remarried when I was ten years old and since then, my family life has just been going downhill. I am in my twenties now. I also got cancer and beat it when I was twelve. My dad kicked me out of the house when I was sixteen because family life just got really bad and I went to live at my grandma's. In order to win my dad's love back, I worked really hard to get into a good college and also got some prestigious internships at well known and high paying companies. I have tried to reach out to my dad but I feel like too much has happened for us to have a healthy relationship and he just tells me to ""just go live my life."" I have extended family members like aunts and uncles and cousins who try to include me in their lives and make me feel loved, but I feel like it is just not the same as having an immediate family unit. I don't know. I just feel like there is no direction I can take my life that will allow me to live a life worth living where I feel like I have a sense of purpose. I have no desire to make money and enter the work force, as I have already done that and did not really find meaning in my job aside from having the status of making money and a brand name company. I feel like I was just dealt a bad hand in what I believe really matters in life: health (I got cancer) and having a loving family (I was born into a broken family and I am estranged from my dad). I have a variety of mental issues and also just feel a lack of will and drive to keep moving forward in life (whatever that means). I feel like I have ascended past what I believe to be superficial things: money and status. I used to value those two things a lot, but now I am really not sure what I value. I do enjoy spending time with friends and other people, so it is definitely possible that isolation due to the pandemic is fueling my depression. But, I still do not have an answer to these questions, what do I want to do with my life? How can I make my life better? To make matters worth, I think I am becoming delusional and psychotic and also I constantly have the fear of getting cancer again which makes me shut down a lot of possibilities for long term hope. For example: I should never have kids because I may just get cancer again and die early. No one would want to marry me and have kids with me anyways because I might just get cancer and drop dead. It just feels like everything in the world is stacked against me and I feel like there is no where for me to go and no where I belong and moving through each day is just a chore. 

At one point in my life, everything seemed so simple and seemed to make sense. Just go to a good college, get a good job, make a good salary, and you have the formula for a happy and successful life. On paper, my life appears amazing with my accomplishments, not to brag, but on the inside, I literally feel more soulless and empty than ever. 

I am curious what do you guys think? Do you guys have any advice? Is there something I should try? I feel like I have tried everything. Exercise, dieting, socializing, giving it time, meditation, therapy, etc. I feel like I am running out of options and I just don't know what to do. To make matters worse, I have taken time off school to try to figure things out, and I feel like that has created even more pressure on me because now some of my extended family members are criticizing me for taking time off school and also I feel embarrassed explaining my depression situation to my friends so I end up withdrawing even more and I feel more alone and I feel like I just need something to break this cycle. 

Thanks for reading and responding in advance."

That being said, while also trying to learn an API, I was wondering if it is possible to scrape data from a website, and somehow have it configured in a way that is easily imported to Excel.  Specifically, I need to put each quantity available, and the price point for each quantity from a wholesale supplier into a spreadsheet.  I also have to do the same for each size offered.  All this for several products.  I have been doing it manually, but I know there has to be a faster way.   I just need to be pointed in the right direction.  I have already installed ""requests"", and ""BeautifulSoup"".  I haven't been able to find any videos (that I can understand) that show how to parse such specific info.

msgxkd,4,2021-04-16,Internship scheduling advice,Loco_erty,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/msgxkd/internship_scheduling_advice/,"First, thank you. This subreddit has been really helpful in my cs journey.

My graduation date is Dic 2022, I had a FBU internship last summer, and a regular SWE internship at Facebook this summer (remote). Although the company is great and has very competitive salaries, especially for returning interns, I want to try somewhere else next year, without losing the opportunity at FB. 

Assuming I get another return offer this summer, there’s flexibility as to when to take my internship, it could be Jan 2021 for example, and that would leave summer free for me to be at another company. 

My question is, can I still receive a full time offer at the end of my FB internship next year (around March 2022) even though I would be starting until Dic 2022? 

Another question is, how could I have competing offers for my full time return offer? I’m assuming I would have to directly apply to other companies, without any prior internship, and time it such that I get the offers as I’m finishing my internship?

Any ideas or tips as to how to navigate this would be helpful. Ty!"

mshw2m,6,2021-04-16,ROI of attempting CS degree at 26?,SteezeNYC,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mshw2m/roi_of_attempting_cs_degree_at_26/,"I'm 26 years old and contemplating returning to finish my degree. I plan to complete my first year at community college and then transfer to a state school CS program.

However, I'm not necessarily in the best financial situation to attempt one without possibly having to work full time to support myself. 

I made two previous attempts at college. I initially went in to study psychology but dropped it because I doubted the career prospects, and I definitely do not regret that decision in hindsight. I returned a year later to a community college to study business administration, and easily passed my classes but didn't feel like I was challenged at all. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't pursue those majors but it would be easier to land ANY job with a degree to my name.

I essentially spent the last year and a half self-studying for certifications to break into the IT field. After my first 2 certifications, I went onto the job market and was quickly discouraged because every solid job required a B.S., but I actually did land a few interviews and some freelance work right before COVID hit and shut everything down. I doubled down and spent the second half of the year studying for my AWS Solutions Architect, and passed at the beginning of the year, with the intention of completing the other 2 associates and possibly a specialty to try to land a solid IT job. 

Returning to the job market for a second time though, with higher expectations for jobs, leads me to believe that a degree in a technical field will yield much better job prospects, but I'm not sure I can handle another 4 years of poverty financially. I'm only getting by because I'm getting unemployment money since I spent years freelancing and made enough money, but I'm uncertain whether a 4 year degree at this time in my life makes more sense than grinding out months of job apps and possibly landing a good job. 

If I try to work, I'll likely go for some more cloud certifications, learn Linux and finish some Python projects. I'm not expecting a 6 figure salary but I'm certain I could find a startup somewhere that would hire me.

However, I realize there would be a cap on my potential earnings, and people with Bachelor's Degrees (especially in CS) are more competitive, have more well rounded skills, and command better salaries on the job market. I'd prefer to be 30 with a CS degree than 30 without one, but 30 with a degree and nearly no work experience besides internships, while having to support myself through college with aging parents sounds like a hellish experience, as opposed to taking a lower paying job now and working my way up. 

I'd appreciate advice, and pros/cons.

I don't want to spend 4 years getting a degree, come out with 40k debt, just to find out that CS grads are no longer valuable, the market is saturated, or AI made the jobs obsolete."

5. National Honors Society

**Letters of Recommendation**

**Math Teacher: 9/10**.  Had him for honors precalc (I took regular geometry freshman year and algebra 2 with CTY over the summer) and BC Calc.  He spoke to my ability and my perseverance as a sophomore who was in honors precalc.  Said I was a fantastic student.  Idk where I'd be without this guy, he was the one who encouraged me to keep going through honors precalc, take calc BC and take the AMC.  He is a rare teacher.

**APUSH Teacher: 7.5-8/10**.  He mentioned that I was a great student and a leader in his class with great perspectives.  I think this was pretty good.

**Dartmouth Peer Rec: 10/10** got it from a friend of mine in the foster system who I'm very close with, I've tutored him a lot and as he said inspired him to improve.  He's going to our state school -- so happy for him!!!!

**Counselor Rec: 6/10** but she sent it in late to my earlies, I was extremely upset

**Interviews**

**UPenn Wharton: 9.5/10.** Instantly clicked with him, we were from the same area.  We talked for over an hour about his business, my interests and how I've made strides in becoming a better student.

**Princeton: 7/10.** Unremarkable except for a few nice exchanges about ORFE (his major).  My tech was having issues though.

**Duke: 8.5/10.**  Pretty nice interview, he said I was a great fit and would write nicely about me, I tripped on a few answers though.

**Stanford: 3/10.**  Let it slip that I was a republican and the whole thing kinda went to shit.  It stayed polite (barely) but the woman told me at the end I wasn't a good fit.  Bruh moment

**Dartmouth: 9/10.**  Honestly really clicked, interviewer said he'd fight for my admission.

**Essays**

**Common App Essay: 8/10** wrote about seeking refuge in baseball, religion and academics as my family life went to shit.  Dad is out the picture, was low income for the first half of high school (mom got a somewhat high paying job later -- God bless her).  Multiple people including a family friend with experience in admissions said it was great.  I think it was very ""me"" and even if it sounds cheesy or generic I think it was alright.

**UPenn Supplements: 10/10** these were so good

**Princeton Supplements: 8.5/10**

**Harvard Essay: 7.5/10** decent as a standalone but not amazing

**Cornell Supplements: 8/10**

**MIT Supplements: 6.5/10** these questions were trash

**Duke Supplements: 5/10** didn't even write one of the optional ones lol

None of the other ones stood out I guess.  Overall I'm a pretty good writer.  My Wharton essays were inspired, the others ranged from great to mediocre.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* **UPenn Wharton (Deferred ED --&gt; Accepted RD, Attending!!!!!!)**
* University of Wisconsin Madison (EA)
* In-state safety
* UT Austin McCombs (RD)

*Waitlists:*

* Princeton (RD), only waitlist I stayed on
* Rice (RD), withdrew after UPenn
* Cornell CAS (RD), withdrew after UPenn
* Georgia Tech (Deferred EA), withdrew after UPenn
* UMich (Deferred EA), withdrew after UPenn

*Rejections:*

* Harvard (RD)
* Columbia (RD)
* Dartmouth (RD) damn I was sure this would be at least a WL
* Duke (RD)
* MIT (EA, no hope lmao 💀)
* Stanford (RD) real shocker
* UChicago (EA deferred, RD rejected)
* Emory (RD)
* Vanderbilt (RD)
* UCLA (RD)
* UC Santa Barbara (RD)
* Swarthmore (RD)
* University of Florida (RD -- what the actual fuck?)
* Amherst (RD)
* Williams (RD)
* Northwestern (RD)

**Additional Information:**

I'm extremely confused by my results but I'll take it!!   I opened UPenn last on Ivy Day and I actually thought I was gonna explode when I saw the acceptance.  Note to future applicants -- don't put Young Republicans on the app, and don't apply to too many schools!"

Extracurriculars:

1. Red Cross Club (10-12th): President for 2 years and Treasurer for 1 year. Around 3 hours a week

4. Super big leadership position with the Red Cross Youth in my region (12th): I teach the community how to stay safe during natural disaster. I also run a committee with another person

Letters of Recommendations: 

Anatomy and Physiology Teacher (12th): I am so grateful for her because my other choice was my AP Eng Lang teacher and he basically ghosted me and never gave me my letter. She wrote the letter in a week so shoutout to her!!

AP US History: Her class was freaking hard but I passed the class with an A and an A+!!

Interviews:

WashU: My first interview! I enjoyed it. My interviewer was really nice but she graduated in ‘08 so when I told her that I applied there because of the Beyond Boundaries Program, she didn’t know what that was 

Northwestern: The interview was kinda awkward like there wasn’t a lot of back and forth conversation just him being like “Okay, cool!”

Harvard: The best interview! 🥰 My interviewer around 23 years old so she was my youngest interviewer and she seemed really interested in my work with the Red Cross! She said that she would be really rooting for me in her report! But she kept it real with me and said that interviews don’t go a long way in Ivies and that Harvard decisions are very unpredictable. 

Cornell: The WORST interview!! He didn’t ask me any questions and didn’t even seem interested in all of the extracurriculars that I did. I even slicked down my hair with gel and put it in a ponytail for the interview 😡

For statistics, I am an CS undergraduate from India with a GPA of 3.99. Despite being from a relatively unknown university, I grinded my ass off during my undergraduate years. During applications I had the following stats:

&amp;#x200B;

**GRE**: 168Q, 161V, 5.0 AWA

**TOEFL**: 114

**GPA**: 3.99/4.0

**Research**: 5 international publications in good venues including 1 AAAI workshop paper and one under review at EMNLP

**LOR**: 3 strong LORs, one from my department HoD, one from my research advisor and other from my GSoC mentor all of whom active research in the field

**SOP**: I had a seemingly strong SoP that I got reviewed by a lot of people, both my seniors pursuing MS/PhD in the schools I was going to apply to as well as professors that I had LORs from

I have also been a Google Summer of Code student and an MLH Fellow and since then have been actively involved with Kubernetes and Facebook Open source, Outreachy and Google Summer of Code mentor in the past.

Besides this I had two separate internships all in the field of my intended MS specialization within CS. I have won multiple well-known international hackathons.

I had applied to 11 schools this year hoping to get in some of them:

*UIUC MS CS, UMich MS CS, CMU (MCDS and MSCV), Columbia MS CS, USC MS CS &amp; MS AI, UCSD MS CS, GaTech MS CS, UofT MS CS (research track), McGill MS CS, and UWMad MS CS*. My primary areas of interest going into all of these colleges was social computing and NLP.  However the only accepts I received were CMU MSCV, USC MS CS &amp; MS AI with a scholarship of $ 23k and UCSD MS CS.

I had not reached out to  a POI for UIUC which I presume is necessary for a fully funded masters program but I am not sure what went wrong with GaTech. I was very hopeful to get in and the POI I reached out to from GaTech said she was surprised I got served a reject. No disrespect to those who got in but I feel I had a better profile fit for Social Computing than most of the people who got in did. I am in utter dismay and I have no idea on what to do. Do you folks thing I should reapply next year?"

1. applying next year and search for jobs meantime (I took time off for about 1 year after 2 years of experience)
2. choosing a university and work hard there to shine. I am inclined towards Umass and UCI. Please suggest which university is the best according to job, internship opportunities.

During that time, I've put in more than 200 applications and gotten back almost as many rejections 

As of today, I’ve accepted an offer for a great data science internship. 

I know better than most how difficult and frustrating the process is. Hours of applying, HR reps ghosting you, falling off after the final interview, etc. But don't lose hope. 

It only has to work once.

I know that you may hear this a lot, but it's because it's true. Just keep applying and you will find a company/workplace that fits you like a puzzle and makes the whole process worth it.

If you want my advice, be confident in your interviews, and don't be afraid to negotiate. I was able to receive a higher pay and a better title because of it. 

good luck!"

I am in a bit of a dilemma. I have received recently received an internship offer from a startup for software engineering/ML engineering. But I have already accepted the GS offer.

Now, from what I gathered, the startup(8 years old), which uses AI to design medicines, is doing some pretty interesting stuff using machine learning and considering that I want to go into ML as a career, this opportunity seems very exciting. In GS, I would be in a purely non-ML role. Also, the startup is more of an actual tech company than GS.

Regarding the pay, I would get my monthly pay cut in half if I join the startup. I do not know the Full-time pay for them. I am planning to ask them about it.

I was wondering if it is worth it to renege the GS offer and burning that bridge.

Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks!!

EDIT: I should add that I would ideally like to work at a hedge fund in the future.

EDIT 2: I should have added that I interned at GS once already. Also, the other place is not really a startup but more of a small company and have been operating for 8 years already. They have about 300 employees. Sorry, I should have been more clearer."

I saw the topics and ngl, while im confident in my coding skills, this seems a little out of my depth so if anyone could suggest some learning materials/explain a little about it, that'd be awesome.

The topic is:  

""Implement a classification pipeline prototype for global or local cluster identification (based on edge weights) within a skill graph. Along with this, you could alternatively implement a mapping model for converting edge-weight data of the graph into a physical graph model which could be displayed in a VR setting"""

I have filled most of my choices and priorities. I am in second year of engineering of Computer Science. 

There is an internship listed in Machine Learning section with description being:

""Together, we will learn Machine Learning""

That sound pretty naïve to me (No offense) as compare to other professor asking for explanation of research papers to be emailed to them.  

I have done a short course on machine learning organized by my college (which is ranked 98, in India), with guest lecturers from  my and other premiere colleges.

\[ Rank is given just to say that the college is reputed\]

Should i add that in resume or not?

If yes, then what should be the format?"

Anyways- fast forward 12 months, 1000 applications, tons of independent learning, the ibm data science course, and a few projects to showcase my new skills, i finally landed an interview for an internship, its not much, but its a step in the right direction. I would appreciate any insight you guys might have for me going into this interview, or any other interview moving forward, maybe things i should learn or brush up on, topics that might be covered, or questions that might be asked in the realm of data engineering.

Its worth noting that this being called a data engineering internship, but there are 2 roles they are looking to fill, and one is more focused on DW construction, etl pipelines, and data cleaning, and the other role is more data analysis and dashboard development."

As someone who has managed quite of few interns since past couple of interns, one of the best indicators of a high performer is their resourcefulness. Now this point is only valid because we have well document processes, code, system design and product requirements. It also however extends to figuring coding issues as well.
Not being resourceful and asking for help at every minor roadblocks/stumbles can lead to lot of cumulative time wastage for the team.

* Think about why - Always think about why something is done the way it is. For this, don't be afraid to ask if you can't figure it out. It is always important to know why you are accomplishing tasks the way you are.

* Understand the product - In conjunction with the above point, have a good understanding of core product of the company you are joining and how your work will fit in with it. This would help you answer a lot of questions regarding why certain features have been scoped. Also try to understand the business implications of your features.

* Be helpful to other interns, don't be cutthroat. Being collaborative/approachable is one of the biggest assets one can have and would be pretty high up on the list for most of the managers.

* Have a plan - Come with a plan for what you want to achieve during the internship. Remember that working on production grade systems, you will learn at an exponential rate. 4 months in, you will like a completely different programmer compared to when you joined. So it is important for you to come up with a set of objectives and share with manager and track your progress during the internship. 


So that's it. Other people can share their advice below in the comments. The reason I have created this post is lot of people online and offline, asked me about how to make the most of the internship. These are some of the guidelines I share with interns who work under me."

It's my only offer so far but I'm still in the process with a few other small local companies, mostly community nonprofits organizations. I don't actually have that much experience with programming and computer science in general and was generally surprised to hear that I got an offer. 

The reason I'm hesitant is that I read a lot of reviews on the program and many point out that they didn't get enough work to do and that they didn't get a lot of experience with programming and software work but were rather stuck with administrative work. I know I'm not that knowledgeable with programming and really want to use the summer to improve my knowledge in programming and how to more quickly work toward a problem that I'm given.

Has anyone done the program before? What did you think you got out of it? Do you think you had enough work? Do you think it was well worth your time? Did you gain immense programming knowledge from it? Also has anyone done it in an virtual environment, if so how was it? Any advice would be appreciated."

Suddenly she was driving to every students’ house to bring them personalized gift bags (totally breaking any social distancing rules) and they were all coming to her house to write in her driveway with chalk about how much they love her (which we don’t exactly live in a small town so why do your students know where you live if they’re even the ones writing because the handwriting doesn’t look like a kid’s). Okay, fine. 

Then she got pregnant during the pandemic. Which is all well and good, I know like six people who are pregnant right now. And then came the daily posts about how obsessed her students are with her pregnancy and they can’t wait and they love her baby so much and it’s so magical and inspirational and so much kids touching her belly (over the shirt) to connect with her baby. And then she got put on bed rest so there were the daily pictures of her in her hospital bed, hooked up to monitors, with her laptop on and her coffee cup because she can’t abandon her kids, her kids!!!! 

She had her baby yesterday, prematurely (I think like 33 or 34 weeks, so not exactly half-baked but not full term) and thankfully both mom and baby are doing well. But now are the pictures of her with her baby and she’s on Zoom with her class and taking parent calls three hours post c-section because she’s just such an inspiration to us all (which I was on so many painkillers I don’t think I knew where I was three hours after my c-section). 

The reason I am ranting this is two-fold. If this is all true, holy shit, the lack of boundaries feels so inappropriate and creates an entirely unrealistic expectation of what teachers should do for their students. Like I definitely answered a few emails and came in for one parent meeting on maternity leave when it was urgent but definitely not immediately after my kid was born. And if it’s not true and she’s just talking to a blank computer screen to seem like she’s talking to her class, holy shit, why does she think this is inspirational and even okay? I want to say it’s a societal issue about expectations of teachers but I don’t think even my craziest parents would expect to hear from me after a major surgical procedure. 

Okay, rant over. I just needed to let this out to people who will understand."

I have posted this on other subreddits as well to get different viewpoints

I was fortunate enough to get accepted to both Sauder and Rotman, but making a decision has been much more difficult than I expected. As of right now, my desired specialization would be finance (I do regret not applying to Ivey/Queens for this reason). However, it obviously is nothing set in stone. 

The biggest concern for me, is employability. The fuzzy employment reports aren't doing much to alleviate my concerns either. While I am not determined to leave the company for work, I'm also completely open to working in the US or Asia if I am lucky enough to get an opportunity. I understand my efforts outside the classroom (networking) will dictate much of this, but I would like to give myself the best opportunity possible to be comfortable in the future. UBC's BUCS program seems very attractive in this regard, as well as BTM, but I am not familiar enough with the programs for it to hold any significant weight in my decision.

I've come up with a pros/cons list, please let me know if it seems accurate or not.

#UBC 

Pros:

-Proximity: I live in the Vancouver area

-Lower tuition costs

-Better student life (allegedly)

-More certainty, 1st year entry into Sauder rather than 2nd year entry into Rotman.

Cons:

-Not recruited by large firms outside Western Canada (to my knowledge)

-Poor job market in/around Vancouver for business grads

-Less international prestige 

-Alumni network isn't great (again, allegedly)

#UoftT

Pros:

-International prestige

-In the heart of Toronto, great proximity to multiple large companies

Cons:

-Next to impossible to get internships

-Theoretical rather than practical learning leads to getting beat out by Queens/Ivey students for jobs/internships 9/10 times 

-Bad recruiting hold for accounting

-Weak alumni network

-Education/Opportunities supposedly don't justify tuition 

I'd really appreciate you sharing any thoughts you might have. Also, I'd love it if anyone could share how the Sauder/Rotman grads in your life are doing today. Have they been able to find their dream job or do they have regrets about the path they took?

Thank you! And obligatory hiss I'm a snek"
mt3gkh,1,2021-04-17,"Recent grad advice ask: choosing, what should I do?",Phoenixfire321,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mt3gkh/recent_grad_advice_ask_choosing_what_should_i_do/,"This is a long post because I wanted to give all the context I thought important. TIA if you lend your thoughts :)

\---------

I am a 2020 grad, and currently an ""apprentice"" to the co-founder and director at a relatively small online company I'll call company C; this is a paid internship, so to speak, that I started September 2020, and my boss expects full-time hours. He is also aware I'm currently doing an executive masters program, remotely, from which I graduate August 2021.    

I truly like the work that they do, I enjoy the people in the company and the flexibility of the work, and I believe the company has huge potential to grow well. Currently my salary is not that great, especially considering that I'll have a masters degree soon (even though the masters degree is healthcare informatics, which is not directly related to the operations and logistics type stuff I'm doing here). My boss, M, said while he was searching for apprentices he preferred someone who could stick around for at least 6 months. But I think what the ""end"" of the apprenticeship would look like was left vague.    

In March, I told him I really enjoy company C and I would love to have a full time position as a long-term team member; would that be possible? He answered ""to be honest right now I'm not sure"", and told me he'd like to see growth in my ability to research and problem solve independently, my technical understanding, and my demonstrated ability to grow and learn. He said let's say you for sure will work through the end of June and then we'll re-evaluate July 1. (I did sign a contract at the beginning of this arrangement where the end date I left as some time September 2021; I believe the contract says either party can terminate it at any time)     

A week or two after that conversation, my boss M asked everyone in the company what their ideal salary would be in 3-6 months, 1-2 years, and long term 5-10 years. I asked him does this question apply to me too, given that conversation we just had about re-evaluating later my progress in terms of staying long-term? He said yes. So I said it's hard for me to say what long-term salary I would like because currently I am more focused on growing my skills so that I can stay long term full time. Then I said given that that's my primary focus, I'm ok with maintaining the same salary in 3-6 months and maybe a $10k increase in 1-2 years, if I stay.     

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so - I just received the first ever true full-time employment offer in my life, for technical account manager at Qualtrics, which is a much larger company. The salary is 50% higher than what I currently make at company C by about 50% (but it's still not super high and I'd like to negotiate it). I also believe there's structure and room for professional development with this new role. I really don't want to lose my foot in the door at company C though, because I do believe that in the future they will be much larger and there will be more awesome opportunities for me to interact with people and organizations in the niche/field that I love. (and that my salary at company C could grow too - but that's IF my boss decides to keep me on, which honestly is a big part of all my uncertainty currently - at least I know Qualtrics has actually given me a formal full-time offer). Qualtrics would also require me to move across the country to Provo, UT, but they have a $2500 relocation bonus. I'm not necessarily worried about moving - although I am a little concerned about if I can cultivate social life in a highly Mormon (?) area as an atheist - but I would like a higher salary than what they offered, if possible.     

So basically I'm really conflicted over a lot of things. 

IDEALLY I really don't want to let either of these opportunities go, even though there are aspects of both that are not ideal. I would like to do Qualtrics full-time and tell current company C ""hey I love the work we do, but may I do part-time for a while? I got another great offer at Qualtrics I'd like to pursue"". There are other people at C that do part-time. 

But, even as I'm already nervous about expressing my desires professionally (and I'm so green professionally), I'm also made anxious by the thought that I don't have the best footing anyway with my current boss. He didn't straight up say no let's end your apprenticeship when it's time, but he also didn't enthusiastically say ""yes we have a place for you"", and a few people have told me ""tbh I don't know"" is basically a really nice, non-confrontational way of saying no. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts or advice DEEPLY appreciated, please."
mt3wls,3967,2021-04-17,I received an unsettling email from the FutureMe website,peculi_dar,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mt3wls/i_received_an_unsettling_email_from_the_futureme/,"It was fifteen minutes to five, the end of a long week of work. I was seated at my desk, going through the last of my emails. It had been a busy day, but I was down to the last urgent request, and the rest could wait until Monday. As I finished up my response, I got another email. It was from the FutureMe website. The name of the site was familiar, I had seen it pop up in Reddit threads a lot. As far as I could recall, it was a service that allowed people to send a letter to themselves in the future.

I couldn’t remember ever using it though.

My hands shook slightly as I moved the mouse to open the message. The reaction was inexplicable. A quirky message from past me, what was wrong about that? I should have felt curious, slightly amused. Instead, my heartbeat faltered and my palm greased the mouse with sweat.

I stalled, my eyes darting around the open-plan office. The boss hadn’t come in that day, so my co-workers had chosen to bow out early. I was practically alone, apart from Carlee, an eager intern who was typing away at her desk on the other end of the room. Our eyes met over a sea of partitions, and I quickly looked away.

I turned my attention back to the screen and opened the email.

&amp;#x200B;

***The following is an e-mail from the past, composed on April 16th, 2016. It is being delivered from the past through FutureMe.org***

***Dear Future Colin,***

***You wife resides at xxxx Ashbury Lane.***

***The fish are in the water.***

&amp;#x200B;

I stared at the screen, dumbfounded.

“I didn’t know you had a wife.”

My arms jerked in alarm as Carlee appeared out of nowhere, sweeping my shoulder with strands of hair as she bent over me to stare at the screen.

What was she doing?

“I don’t,” I replied, my voice strained. I closed the browser and signed out of my work account, “Excuse me.”

Carlee took a step back as I stood up and started gathering my things. She took a seat in a neighboring chair and started fiddling with a bobblehead replica of my co-worker’s dog. Her eyes never left my face.

“Wanna grab a drink?” she asked, a smirk playing on her lips.

I paused to look at her. I was in my late thirties, almost entirely bald, and generally average-looking. Carlee was a buxom twenty-something with dashing red hair and emerald eyes. Her long legs in tight skirts had been the highlight of many workdays, but her asking me out felt wrong.

“Excuse me?”

“There’s a decent bar not far from here,” Carlee’s voice deepened, revealing sultry notes I had never heard before. She shifted in the office chair, flashing thigh as she crossed her legs.

“Oh,” I stammered, not knowing where to put my hands, suddenly conscious of how my shoulders were hunching forward, “That’s very kind of you, but I should get going. I have other plans.”

“Change them,” Carlee cupped her face in her hands. She leaned over the desk on her elbows, pressing her generous cleavage onto the wooden surface, “We could have a lot of fun tonight.”

“Really wish I could, but I have to go.”

I grabbed the rest of my stuff and darted toward the elevators before she could say another word. The girl was beautiful, but there was something almost predatory in the way she had approached me. Instead of being turned on, I felt rattled. Disturbed.

I took my first steady breaths only after getting home. I entered my kitchen through the garage, eager to grab a drink from the fridge. My shoulders relaxed as I thought about the night ahead. I’d watch a movie, go to bed early. Jeff’s barbeque was at noon the next day, and I was looking forward to seeing the guys. I tried to put the email and Carlee out of my mind.

I pulled a Corona from the back of my fridge, opener at the ready, when something caught my attention. The bottle cap looked as though it had been tampered with. I put down the opener and ran a finger over the ridges of the lid, testing its hold. The cap was fixed tightly on the bottle, but there were dents all around the circumference of the lid, like someone had used a tool to reseal it.

I went back to the fridge and pulled out the remaining two bottles. They were the same. I used the opener on the first one and it came off without a pop. I sniffed the beer. It was the familiar blend of yeast and herb, but there was something else too. It was very slight, and I wouldn’t have noticed if I wasn’t paying attention, but there was a medicinal note mixed in there. Chemical, almost. Something familiar, but not in the context of beer.

I opened the other two beers and emptied all three in the sink.

I sat down at the kitchen table and listened to the sounds of my house. I lived alone. My place was on the smaller side, a two-story with two bedrooms. I didn’t have a wife, never had. There had been girlfriends, I had even lived with a few back in the day, but no recent relationships.

So who had been inside my house? Who was possibly still there?

I considered calling the police, but I sounded like a mad man even to myself. *Officer, there was this email, then an attractive co-worker asked me out, and then my beers didn’t pop when I opened them. Coincidence? I think not!* It sounded stupid. So why was I so afraid to leave the kitchen and inspect the rest of the house?

I stared at the patterns in the wood of my kitchen table. They were repetitive, cyclical. Dark swirls and spots, if I stared long enough they started to look man-made, artificial. Nothing natural could be this elaborate, could it?

*Enough.*

I pulled out my phone and googled the address in the message. It was only twenty minutes from my house.

“I am a fucking moron,” I mumbled under my breath as I threw my work jacket back on and went out to the garage.

There was some weekend traffic, but half an hour later I was parked across the street from an abandoned lot. A flimsy wire fence surrounded the territory, with budget suburban houses standing on either side. The street lights came on as I climbed out of the car.

So it was just a stupid prank. There was nothing here. I couldn’t help it, I felt… Disappointed? I walked over to the sidewalk and lingered at the threshold of the abandoned property. I couldn’t just enter it, could I?

*No.*

But I did.

The lot was bigger than it appeared from the road. It was longer than it was wide, and as I walked through it I started feeling something strange. There was nothing here but dirt and weed tufts, but every now and then my eye would catch the neighboring house at an angle, or I’d see a glint of something at the corner of my eye. I would turn to look, and there’d be nothing to latch on to, but there was a sense of *something* here. What was I missing?

I had made it to the far side of the fence before I saw it.

I walked over to the lonely, man-made pond, dread guiding my every step. There was nothing threatening about this lot, about this place. But as the sun set further on the horizon, the chill of the evening crept up my spine and settled in my bones.

*The fish are in the water.*

The water was murky brown, the surface of it rippling with the breeze. I couldn’t see the bottom of the pond. Some bubbles surfaced and two bulbous eyes emerged. A fat koi poked its toothless mouth out, gulping at the air.

“Hello Colin.”

I spun around to see a woman standing not far from me. She was short, slim, her entire frame huddled in a long cardigan that ended just above the ankles. There was a blue scarf wrapped around her face and shoulders. The left side of her face was stretched over in scar tissue, the skin drooping off the edge of her jawline. She must have received those injuries in a fire. The eyes were unharmed, dark brown, bearing into mine with severity.

“Who are you?” I murmured.

A brook of memory bubbled and flowed in a corner of my mind. It threatened to flood over if I pushed too hard. *Did I know this woman?*

No.

*Yes?*

The woman walked over and took my right hand between both her palms. Her touch sent bolts of electricity through my body. It meant something. The nerve endings on my fingertips danced to the feel of her skin. I placed my free hand on top of hers, grazing the rubbery scar tissue. I wondered if her whole body had been affected by the fire, or just her face and hands.

I had a sudden urge to hold her, kiss her. Protect her. I didn’t know from what. Maybe from the past, from the things that happened to her face.

A motor revved somewhere in the distance and the woman jerked her head back to look at the empty street. Panic entered her eyes as she pulled away from me. I was about to repeat my question when I realized she had left something in my hand. I looked down at my shaking, cupped palm.

It was a pill capsule. Larger than any medicine I had ever taken, and the color was odd, metallic. I picked it up with two fingers, examining it. It felt heavy for such a small object, solid. It looked like a pill but felt more like a bullet.

I looked back up to see that the woman had made it all the way to the other side of the lot.

“Wait,” I shouted after her, but she only sped up.

The car motor grew louder and I heard wheels screech as the vehicle rounded the corner onto Ashbury Lane. A giant, black SUV appeared at the far end of the street and roared down the narrow road. I caught one last glimpse of the woman’s scarf as she disappeared behind the tall shrubbery of the neighboring backyard.

The monster vehicle pulled up in front of the lot. Every window was tinted, and there were no visible number plates on the car.

My phone beeped in my pocket.

Now wasn’t the time, but I pulled it out anyway. It was another email, this time addressed to my personal account.

I'm currently a sophomore at a top-ten school for ECE, trying to decide what courses to take next fall. I enjoy theory a lot more than practical application/coding, though am decent at both (have taken extra physics classes out of my own interest), and am completely torn between 3 possible options for courses I can take next semester. Realistically, I can max take two without dying of overwork. 

The options are: a notoriously difficult semiconductor physics class, a time-intensive Digital Systems Laboratory course (dealing with HDL's,FPGA's, and digital design), and a circuits class + lab that deals with analyzing and building amplifer/transistor circuits. I was originally certain on taking the semiconductor physics class, but several people have told me that opportunities for internships and a career are very limited after taking it, and that my time would be better spent taking the other two classes. 

Does anyone have any insight on the sort of jobs / internships opened up with a semiconductor physics class, or if they think such a class is worth taking over other options? I really need to find an internship next summer, and that should probably take precedence over my own interest in physics. Additionally, I'm not looking to go to grad school.

But I got bad grades first year and I've spent the next 3 years trying to improve my gpa... On top of that, between trying to juggle school and my personal life, I neglected to explore research opportunities or internships at first. I did some extracurricular stuff and a low quality unpaid internship which I thought would be enough as long as I can get a real internship before I graduate... then coronavirus came around in my junior year and of course killed all my chances at getting a summer internship. So I'm going to graduate with barely any real experience :(( 

I've been applying to jobs since start of fall bc I really didn't want to graduate without anything and have to go back to my home country, but I haven't even gotten a single interview despite literally more than 100 job apps. BU's career office has been so fucking unhelpful, my professors have referred me to opportunities but none of them worked out either....

One can pursue a traditional 4 year bachelor's degree, get a 2 year Masters or post-bacc, a 2 year associate degree, a 6 month boot camp, or even go the self-learning route.

But what if we combine the best of all worlds? A Bachelors in Leetcode and System Design? In other words a BLSD? One of the major criticisms of a Bacc is that it's 4 years, costs a lot of money, and contains filler courses that have nothing to do with computer science. One of the major criticisms for boot camps is that it does not instill a solid foundation in fundamentals such as architecture or DS&amp;A. Also, some companies require a Bacc and other companies also require a Bacc in order to work as a foreigner.

With a BLSD, one can earn the prestige that a Bacc confers along with the fundamentals to ace even the hardest FAANG interviews which mostly focus on DS&amp;A at the entry level and maybe some system design too.

I'm convinced other stuff like languages and frameworks can be picked up on the job or in internships. The most important thing is to get into FAANG and start accumulating experience because experience trumps theory.

If a BLSD exists from a reputable school like MIT or Stanford, I would not hesitate to enroll in it if I was still a high school student. If I was a hiring manager, I would not discriminate against BLSD candidates compared to traditional or non-traditional candidates because they clearly have strong logical and problem solving skills if they can graduate with a BLSD degree. A BLSD with internship experience has practical experience and theoretical experience."

U2 Comp Sci student here. I was taking a 300-level Comp course last semester, a “friend” I know since U0 was also taking the same course but was not doing so well. We submitted our last assignment, 1-2 days later he asked me if I could send him my code as he couldn’t do most of the assignment and was afraid he was gonna fail the final project too (which included concepts from this said assignment). As late submission was strictly not allowed and I wanted to help him understand the concepts, I sent him my assignment and walked him through my code explaining my thought process. As you could guess at this point, this person ended up submitting nearly the same code as mine - even the same spacing and comments as mine. He apparently lied to the prof about some serious thing (didn’t tell me what he said when I confronted him after learning he also got an NA) and got an extension. 

So, both him and I got NAs from this course which was resolved just 1-2 weeks ago. We both got 0s for the assignment. I did not contest the grade as the process was going to take ~12 months and I was technically in the wrong by trusting the wrong person and not waiting until grades came out. (I feel so stupid about it but I geniunely wanted to help and it was after the deadline so didn’t think much)

Now, the reason I am writing this post is actually I have a 4.0 GPA and I originally got an A in this class by working my ass off. This semester I built trust issues towards ppl and had a major breakdown at the beginning of the semester after I learned that I got an NA as this person never told me he used my work until I learned about the NA. I had an incredibly bad winter semester - didn’t take quizzes, submit assignments, enter classes etc. Around the halfway mark of the term, I realized this was not the end of the world and tried to bounce back. I worked my ass off again and grinded a lot, however, in 1 class I’m most likely getting an A-. The NA grade now appears as B+(By 79.9) on my transcript and I can’t decide if I should S/U it or not. On the one hand, I’m already losing 4.0 because I’m not planning to S/U my A- this semester although I still have 2 S/Us. On the other hand, some of my friends say S/U both, keep the 4.0(both S/Us are gonna be comp courses so idk the impact they’ll have on future internships). Some say S/U B+, keep A- and some say don’t use S/U at all it will look bad on your transcript.

When I look at my transcript and see the B+, I honestly remember bad memories of my friend betraying me with an elaborate plan, the countless all nighters I put to finish the plagiarised assignment, going down from a hard earned A to B+, this horrible semestee I had and all the personal stuff bottled up... What do I do now?"

I spent a couple of months on learning courses and creating a portfolio. And then, with the help of my friend, I was able to get a internship in an edtech company as a UX designer. I learned a lot in the intern period, and I made a lot of contribution to the company as well. The intern period was for about 3 months, and it got over last month. It was only a internship, and not a intern to job conversion one.  


I've been looking for jobs as a Jr UX designer since then, and I can't seem to get any job. I tried [angel](https://angel.co).co, linkedin jobs and everything. Apparently Indians need 2-4 years of experience for a ""entry level"" job or associate job. No one's wanna hire a intern with 3 months of experience.  


I'm stuck in a loop. I got to have experience to get a job. To gain experience I got to have a job.  


I'm not complaining about the pandemic that's affecting many companies rn. I'm talking about the companies that has several job openings, but not for freshers. So, campus placements are the only way for freshers to get a job in India? I'll have to study masters in order to get a good job?

So, i have applied for a summer research internship at a college. I have filled most of my choices and priorities. I am in second year of engineering of Computer Science.

There is an internship listed in Machine Learning section with description being:

""Together, we will learn Machine Learning""

That sound pretty naïve to me (No offense) as compare to other professor asking for explanation of research papers to be emailed to them.

I have done a short course on machine learning organized by my college (which is ranked 98, in India), with guest lecturers from my and other premiere colleges.

\[ Rank is given just to say that the college is reputed\]

Should i add that in resume or not?

If yes, then what should be the format?"

mte5zl,0,2021-04-18,BS/CS MASTERS IN 4 YEARS OR STUDY ABROAD + BS/MS masters in 4 1/2 years with a 50% tuition discount.,HourSuitable738,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mte5zl/bscs_masters_in_4_years_or_study_abroad_bsms/,"Hey y'all. 

I'm currently a sophomore doing cs. 

I need some opinions from y'all about sth.
I can finish my cs degree reqs in 3 1/2(later than most pple cause i had no aps coming in). So i have an extra semester. 


During which, i can either study abroad next spring and take the least possible workload as an eng school major(15credits) and add a math major(it's a few courses away)or i can use my final semester to take upper level grad courses and use that to satisfy my Masters in CS. My school offers an option to do a combined bs/ms program in 5 years but i can do it in 4 years. I'm on a full ride so not too keen on graduating early, mostly just about optimizing my time in uni. 



A few pros and cons i've thought of doing masters in 4 years
PROS
a) Get to graduate on time and with no debt, potential to improve my h1b visa chances/new grad salary.
CONS
1) not enough time to figure out what to specialize in? I am currently mostly interested in distributed systems/networks and a bit of ML but that might change as i do more internships.
2) I'm an int'l student and interested in working here. i'm thinking doing the masters in 4 years will reduce the number of times i can apply for h1b visa? Considering that stem masters typically have two more years for opt? Without the masters, i get three years of trying my luck out. With a masters, i get 5. Is that a huge deal breaker as i think it is?
3) i don't get to study Abroad at a relatively good CS school for free for an entire sem which tbh is something i would love to do. 

Pros and cons for doing the masters in 4 1/2 yrs.
PROS

1)I get to study abroad while taking cs coursework. Seems like a fun experience.
2) i have an additional summer to hopefully get a swe internship hence improving my new grad resume/potential for getting a return.
3) lighter course load that the former option across the last 4 semesters which i can use to grind LC more/do side projects/get involved more often with clubs and stuff.
4) Add a math major and retain my econ minor, which i (naively) believe will improve my odds?

CONS
1) I get a half tuition discount for the additional grad semester, so my total attendance costs come to about $20k ish for that sem.  Don't think i'll have to take loans to pay for that, since i can grind hard and hopefully get an swe internship that extra summer to can pay it all and have some money left. 
2) Again, i reduce the number of attempts i can make at the h1b visa.

What would y'all advise I do? Or what would y'all do?

Should i even do the masters that soon or just wait it out?(i get the same benefit of half tuition even if i do the masters at the school later on)

My goal is to make myself as competitive as possible for new grad roles at FAANGMULA and get h1b visa.

Cheers and thanks!"
mtethw,1,2021-04-18,I feel really hollow and fake and I'm not sure why.,rotten_zucchini,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mtethw/i_feel_really_hollow_and_fake_and_im_not_sure_why/,"So to start of with I am 17, trans (mtf) and I like to be alone most of my time. I hate interacting with people because not only am I really anxious but I am awful with any kind of conversation or communication.

I am constantly wanting to have a bond with people whether its family, acquaintances and maybe even a relationship but when I talk to people, I feel like I am lying about myself and I guess I kind of am because I haven't told many people about transitioning, I am just doing it quietly, by myself. So making any long lasting friendship feels impossible.

On top of not being able to make friends and all that, I am way too observant of people and their movements, gestures and even the way they structure their sentences which then intern causes me to worry that they are picking up on the same things so I panic about wording something wrong and how I talk or walk or move my hair or hands and I hate it. I hate it so much however it has me thinking that I could be schizophrenic due to using marijuana everyday since I was 15. my brain is still developing (even now) and I have had multiple symptoms that I keep brushing off, like hallucinations, hearing voices of people crying and being hurt but I am used to it so I act like its nothing when in reality its a serious issue. Doesn't help that I don't want to talk about it because 1. my family wouldn't believe me in any shape or form and 2. if it was to be schizophrenia my chances of being able to transition would be in the shitter, ruining everything I have worked on. Which is a huge problem on its own.

Just to add the cherry on the top, I'm now at the age where I'm constantly being pushed to look for jobs and I know I am in no way capable to hold a job because my mental stability just isn't there. I cant walk into a small corner store without wanting to cry never mind talking to random strangers for a few hours a day. I only talk to 2 people other than my family who I live with and I find it so hard to keep a conversation with them.

I need to do something before it gets worse but my life is such a mess right now and it's getting to the point where I can't enjoy the things I like. If you even made it this far, thank you because it really does mean a lot knowing I can come on here and let loose on thoughts I've had rattling my brain for months.

Edit: I know the title doesn't seem to fit too well but it is what it is."

I’ve had some difficulties. My capstone (undergraduate thesis) professor keeps changing deadlines for everything. He gave us guidelines for our midterm presentation two days before the midterm. With zero notice, he changed the due date for our software design, requirements, and proposals, giving us only a week to finish them. Just last week, he dropped on us that we need to submit two more documents by the end of the term (they’re not in the syllabus).

Other than that I’ve been pretty good recently. I’ve created an app demonstration for my capstone, have had successful interviews and demonstrations, have gotten a great start on my research paper and analyzing the data. My internship has gotten better. I successfully used Linux to install and configure a network security virtual machine and have finally figured out how to read the log files. The research paper for my internship is looking pretty nice as well. Finally, my Chinese professor is allowing me to turn in my assignments during finals week so that I can focus on my senior capstone and internship. I tried to tell her this was unnecessary and that I’d take the consequences, but she said she was a student once and understands the struggle of finishing major projects. 

So besides my problems with the capstone professor, things are starting to look up.

So, someone gave me a table at my internship that does this exact thing. I was impressed, since I'm pretty new to Excel this thing could solve so many problems for me now and in the future.

The thing is, I don't know how to do that. The only ways I've found are showing the duplicates highlighted in the same column the duplicates are, but thats not what I need. 

So, I need to create a column within a table that shows how many duplicates (1, 2, 3, etc) are in the previous column for that specific cell, and whenever that happens the cell changes to color red. Like, write down the data and when pressing tab to change to the next column, it says ""2"" instead of ""1"" because there was already data with the same values (that is fine, it can happen).

Hope this is understandable because english is not my mother tongue.

&amp;#x200B;

I will use a mock example so my bad wording wont difficult your understanding of my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I enter ""Central"" to a cell, It will go from ""0"" to ""1"" because now there is 1 cell with that specific data in it.

If I write ""Central"" a second time in the next cell and press Tab, then the column that says ""Duplicates"" automatically puts a ""2"" and changes color, because now there is a second cell that has ""Central"" in the column.

If theres no data in the previous cell, like the last one, then the column of ""Duplicates"" show ""0"" because theres no data.

Any info and tips will be much appreciated!

mtjatf,5,2021-04-18,"Profile Review : 27M, 740, Indian, 4 year work ex",mbathrowaway31415,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/mtjatf/profile_review_27m_740_indian_4_year_work_ex/,"Hi all,

I am planning to apply for MBA in R1, primarily focusing on 1Year MBAs. Rational for targeting 1Y MBA is that I already have a Masters in Management + less opportunity cost.  
I feel that considering my masters studies and work experience abroad, I might have slight advantage in the competitive Indian engineers segment.   
I do have some debt from my Masters and hence, scholarships would definitely be a key factor to consider. 

  
**Education :**

Bachelor in Tech( Computer Science Engineering) from one of the IITs, GPA : 7.8/10 ( absolute grading, top 20%)  
Masters in Management (top 3 MiM schools),Merit Based scholarship, GPA 3.31/4 (different from US grading: A= 4, B=3.5, C=3 ...). 

GMAT : 740 (Q:50, V:40)  


**Experience (45 months):**

20 months  at a leading hedge fund as a systems engineer in IT/Enterprise department. Location : India  
3 months internship at a cryptocurrency exchange/startup ( not Coinbase  :/). Location : Luxembourg  
6 months ( post masters internship) at a US headquartered deep tech VC ; directly involved in (DD of) 2 investments. Location : France  
16 months ( current job): Inhouse consultant at a one of the largest insurance company. Secured promotion within 6 months. Targeting another promotion at the end of the year.  Location: Germany  


**Extra Curricular ( Most likely the area of improvement)**  
1. Helped raise \~$9000 to build a library in a couple of government schools in India  
2. Communication Manager at an international event organised during Masters.  
3. Mentoring :  
a) During Bachelors, worked as a career counselor for government schools   
b) During Masters, helped prospective students with guidance, essay &amp; resume editing, interview practice for MiM admissions.  
c) Currently mentoring students of a German business school on a sustainability project with my employer.  


**Post MBA Goals:**   
Short term:

a) Change of location to the US.  
b) Move to Tech industry/startups, in an operational/ PM roles. Not sure about the visa sponsorship scene for startups, but would definitely target series D/E/F  startups.  
c) Career growth : There is a clear distinction in the US between Masters &amp; MBA and I believe that in the long run, MBA aides faster career growth, both in terms of responsibilities &amp; income. ( Please correct if my understanding is wrong)

Mid to Long Term:

Move to VC industry:  
While I am not aiming for post MBA associate roles ( reasons: no clear path to Partner role, Visa issues for internationals), I do see myself in VC industry in the mid to long run.   
MBA would help me get access to the relevant network in the US and add more credibility to my profile. 

**Target Schools :** Kellogg (1Y), Fuqua ( 1Y accelerated MBA), Cornell ( 1Y), NYU (1Y Tech MBA),  
Stanford, Harvard ( because why not?).   
Would also love to hear your opinion about my chances at Stanford ( my dream school) and things I can work on in the next 4 months to improve my chances. If it helps for Stanford, I am a first generation  student.

Thanks a lot for your inputs!"
mtjrqy,0,2021-04-18,Is UIUC worth $168k of debt?,httpantwon,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/mtjrqy/is_uiuc_worth_168k_of_debt/,"If you were in my situation and had to choose, would it be University of Illinois-Chicago or University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign? Urbana has a much higher CS ranking (#5/188) than Chicago (#67/188) 
but 30% more expensive than Chicago. It’s also in a less urban area. I would be $121,000 in debt with UIC and $168,000 with UIUC.. They both do internships but it’s like UIC puts more work into theirs. I would be closer to my family in Chicago, or be more isolated in Urbana..

I have an aunt that goes to UIC but visited UIUC, knows it has a good engineering program, but couldn’t speak on behalf of their resources or anything because when she shadowed, she didn’t really see any additional support or opportunities that grabbed her eye besides the fact that their program was good. But the acceptance rate for UIC is so high (73%), when I had the stats and personality to get into a school like Penn or USC or Washington University etc... (which still aggravates tf out of my soul)😑

With UIC they have “many different resources,” and with UIC being in the city you’re surrounded by more opportunities to give you that push, they offer the CHANCE program, which I’ve been in last year (Digital Scholars/CS100)

I know I can’t build a support system from the internet cause these people from the internet didn’t have the same journey that I had. They probably had plenty of support. Rich families, college graduate mothers and fathers, tutors, connections, and other shit. So it’s like I really can’t decide. 95% of my family is in Arkansas and the rest is either in Texas or Chicago.

Y’all know how these big timing colleges and their programs act. It can be one negative ass comment from somebody to throw you off your game just like that. You could be at one of the most prestigious schools or be in one of the best programs in the world and still not be happy. It’s nobody trying to look after me but myself. And that’s just real life for any underprivileged person 

And it’s like if I don’t go to Urbana, I would be seen as less than from an employer or associate or something/somebody else because I went to a less prestigious school/attended a less prestigious program

My aunt didn’t even go to Purdue Northwest (with a low ass acceptance rate) because they only offered to pay 1/2-2/3rds of her tuition and still would’ve had to take out a big ass loan + there wasn’t nobody she knew/didn’t seemed like she would get real support + the stuck-up culture etc. So she attends UIC and gotten internships her senior year. She works for the largest electric company in illinois. She seemed to turn out good so far

I really don’t know what I should choose and I should’ve never been in this situation in the first place. What would you do?"

My girlfriend and I are currently studying at a University in Belgium. We both want to work in several countries before settling in Australia for the rest of our lives. Because these Nordic destinations are more likely to accept us (EU citizens), we thought it would be easier to ""begin"" with one of them. Obviously, this was not the only criterion.

She is studying Psychology and will choose next year a master in Ethology or Neurosciences. Unfortunately, she does not know yet what kind of job she's interested in but it will definitely involve animals. In addition to her degree, she might try to get a certification to learn more about animal welfare. 

I will pursue a master in data science, after obtaining a bachelor in computer science. I am very interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. I will have the opportunity to start building a project portfolio and taking an internship during these two years.

Because we will stay in Belgium until we obtain our respective degree, we will probably leave the country in three or four years. This means that we have plenty of time to prepare ourselves and to make enquiries about expatriation.

We do not know yet how many years we would stay in the chosen country. I'd say between three and seven years. Unfortunately, we only speak French and English. Is this a problem to work and live in one of these countries ? We do not mind learning a new language in total immersion but it would certainly take a while.

Also, we won't have any work experience (besides internships), which can be rough for us to find a job. Even if I do not find a job in Data Science, I could take a job as a Software Engineer. However, I am a bit concerned about the potential absence of job opportunities for her as it seems to be a very narrow field of application.

Even if we may lack work experience, we are both starting to save and invest some money. We do not have a big enough emergency right now but I expect that it would be sufficient in order to be safe when we leave.

If you have any resources or guides, we would really appreciate it. Please, share your story or some pieces of advice if you've been in a similar situation !"

A) I’ve seen a lot of panicked posts realizing summer is quickly approaching and they haven’t really begun their internship search OR have received a lot of rejections.
B) In general, there are a lot of posts asking about where to look for internships.
C) I’m procrastinating on my homework. 

I’m not positioning myself as an all-knowing authority and I *hope* this doesn’t come across as unwanted, condescending advice. I’m sharing internship strategies, because as a student who was the first in my family to go through the American education system I didn’t have connections or anyone to show me how to do undertake the intimidating behemoth that is the internship process. 

So here are some of the tips and tricks I found out through trial and error: 

*Warning: a lot of these rely on LinkedIn so I recommend making an account. The first strategy I list is the one most helpful for me, but after that I don’t list it in any particular order of importance/effectiveness. 

Finding Companies and Internships

	1.	Please please please read this point carefully, because I never see this strategy recommended! There are organizations that are dedicated to creating internship opportunities for *specific* communities. There are organizations dedicated to placing people based on their identity (BIPOC, LGBTQ+, first generation, low-income, etc.), it can be location specific (ex: students from Oregon or who go to school in Oregon), it can be for people underrepresented in a specific field or industry (this depends entirely on the field), or a combination. In Portland, OR, Emerging Leaders PDX is a program that works hard to place students of color living in/attending school in Oregon with companies in the Portland/Portland metro/Vancouver area. Try and look for internships specific to your identity/community! 
	2.	Make a list of all the relevant organizations and companies in your college/university/home’s town/city/area. This is *super* helpful for finding places you can intern or work at during the school year, which is when the internship application process tends to be wayyyyyy less competitive. I did this, and I was able to go back and forth between my internship and classes fairly easily (the workload with an internship + school + anything else you have going on can be rough though, so keep that in mind). 
	3.	If you’re an upperclassmen I recommend repeating this process for all the places you’re interested in living after you graduate/wherever your graduate school is. 
	4.	LinkedIn is great for finding out where your peers work or where employees at your dream company have worked. I highly recommend combing through your LinkedIn network (or searching up your classmates if you don’t have a very large one) and going to their “Experience” section. After this, start cataloging the companies/organizations they’ve been involved in that interest you and follow those companies on LinkedIn. You can set up an alert for the company if they post a new job/internship opportunity on their LinkedIn page, though not all organizations use LinkedIn as their primary job posting site so make sure to check their actual website frequently.
	5.	This also works in reverse! Find all the companies you’re interested in interning/working at and find current employers and current interns under the organization page’s “Employees” tab. Make sure to look at what organizations they’ve worked/interned at before where they’re at now. I’m not saying to totally imitate someone’s career but A) it helps you understand what kind of experience your preferred company is looking for, and B) it will help you learn about other companies in your industry you may not have heard of before.
	6.	You should also try finding previous interns. This is a little harder since they aren’t featured under an organization’s LinkedIn page, but try searching up “company name + intern.” You can get more creative with the keywords if you’re looking at specific departments within the company. Some companies also publish the names of their previous interns on their website, so check there too. You may be wondering, “Why should I care about former interns at x company?” It’s not definitive, but looking at their career path after the internship indicates how much this internship opportunity helped them land their next job AND how many networking, mentorship, and professional opportunities the internship provides.  If you don’t ultimately end up working for a company full time after interning there, you’d still want to know how an internship at x company would benefit your career in the short and long term. And again, this will probably expose you to more companies in the field you haven’t heard of. 
	7.	Don’t forget to send LinkedIn invitations (I’ve never personalized them and it’s never been an issue but if you want to personalize it go ahead) to all the students/interns you’ve basically just stalked on LinkedIn. This is so when you apply to these companies you can reach out and ask for application/interview process advice and chat with them about their internship experience. 
	8.	You may feel embarrassed to admit you’re having a hard time finding an internship but don’t be afraid to make a LinkedIn post that says you’re looking for an internship in “x field” for “x term.” People can be very kind and give you advice or help get your foot in the door. I did this once and someone responded, leading me to my current internship! 
	9.	Take advantage of the resources your university has to offer - after all you ARE paying for it whether or not you actually utilize their services. Don’t just talk to career services (but yes, please check them out), colleges and universities offer so much more than that! Be sure to check if your school has some sort of major or college specific placement pipeline (like MECOP for engineering students); check calendars to see when they host career fairs, student-faculty mixers (this may not be a direct path to an internship, but it can help you find mentorship or get into a research position), and similar events; speak to professors and see if they have any connections or recommendations; speak to your major/college advisor and they may be able to provide you a list of organizations other students have interned at or have their own set of connections; connect with other people in your major/college and ask them about their internship experiences. 
	10.	Leadership and Mentorship programs - through your university or external organizations - are not only great for professional development, but they also connect you with other people in your field who are older and have more experience and/or allow you to meet other students with similar aspirations. Some programs may also have a direct pipeline to companies (ex: after you complete this program we will try to match you with an internship at x companies) or you can utilize connections you made to get referrals and other things that help with the internship application process. 
	11.	Use industry specific platforms. When internship and job hunting I’ve noticed people tend to recommend LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. which are useful platforms. HOWEVER, these are huuuuge sites that are inclusive of many industries and niches which makes sifting through job postings very time consuming. Ask coworkers, classmates, advisors, mentors, peers, and career center employees about the best job site platform for your industry - I especially recommend this for more niche majors/interests that have fewer job opportunities (like if you’re looking to go into museum curation). 
	12.	If you’re interested in micro-internships, which focus on short term projects go ahead and check out Parker Dewey. Personally, I haven’t tried this but my university has a partnership with them and there were some interesting projects available when I perused their site. 

When should I start looking for companies/internships?

This is entirely industry specific. Yes, large tech and business companies often start recruiting 2 terms/a year ahead (ex: apply in the fall of 2020 to secure a summer 2021 internship) but plenty of other fields and smaller companies do not practice this. If you didn’t apply in the fall for a summer internship or were rejected, there’s no reason to give up for the rest of the school year.

For humanities and some STEM majors, plenty of companies and organizations publish their internship applications late Winter to mid Spring (February to April). Is it nerve wracking to see soooo many students creating their LinkedIn posts announcing where they’ll be spending their summer in *December*? Yes, but that doesn’t mean it affects your internship opportunities at all. 

I’m studying PoliSci and Environmental Policy and I *just* secured my summer internship during the second week of April even though I started looking for internships/applying in January. My best friend is studying biochemistry (and focuses pretty much just on research) and has been applying from early March - April, and has not yet secured their summer internship. So please please please don’t lose hope just yet if you’re freaking out! 

As a general rule of thumb, I recommend starting an *intensive* search about 6 months before you want to intern (if you want a summer internship that starts June, this means start looking in January) so you can begin your application process early. 

Of course, adjust this schedule to fit your needs, but again, I just want to provide reassurance there’s no “right time” to start this process. When you’re not looking intensively - like just creating a running list of companies you might intern or work at someday - try to update this year round so you don’t have to make a mad dash every new internship season. 

I’m a Political Science and Environmental Policy major with minors in Public Health and Ethnic Studies who’s mostly interned at non-profits and government agencies, so I’m aware some of the advice I listed may be more helpful for humanities majors but I tried to be as broad as I could. If anyone has specific questions for polisci/public policy major please comment and I can try to answer. :) 

If this was helpful please let me know! I’m planning on making a whole Google doc (that will be completely free to access, I’m not trying to profit or anything) about this because I felt like all the advice available online was pretty generic and honestly not super helpful. 

I can also make another post about the actual application process if people are interested in that too!"

mtmari,3,2021-04-18,Majored in a subject I don't like because I was too afraid to pursue my true interests – how to move forward?,g3301,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/mtmari/majored_in_a_subject_i_dont_like_because_i_was/,"**TL;DR:** I'm 25, will soon graduate with a degree in a field (biology) I have no passion about, having pursued it only because I was too insecure about studying my favorite subject (math). I'm full of regrets now and don't know where to go from here or how I can turn my situation around.

A little bit of background about me: I am 25F and will graduate with a Master's degree in biology in about 6 months. I have lived in Western Europe all my life.

Throughout high school, I was interested in mathematics and when the time came that I had to decide on my major at university, I went with biology solely because I didn't have the confidence to go down the math route. I had good grades in virtually all subjects including math, but that was basically it – one of my classmates was an absolute math wiz and often went to international competitions, which I didn't. I believed that one has to have these kinds of achievements before joining university to even stand a chance to make it through. Making matters worse, I got an offer for a Math Bachelor's programme from a top school – an offer that I rejected because I didn't believe that I was smart enough to belong in there. So I joined a small, unknown college majoring in biology in the hope of maintaining my high grades from high school, which I did. After finishing my Bachelor's, I immediately joined the Master's cohort of my school, which is quite common where I'm from.

But I have huge regrets now. I had the opportunity to study the subject I love most at a top school and I rejected it because of my fear of failing. I feel like this is even worse than if I would have never had the opportunity to go there in the first place. The reason why I picked biology was because I liked my biology teacher in high school and thought it's an easy subject, but I have never had a passion for it. It was, in my estimation, the easiest subject for me to be good at. I have not done any internships and I have taken no care for my own career so far. I feel like I'm just waking up and only now realize what a mess I am actually in.

I would really like to get some advice on my situation. I was thinking about embarking on a second Bachelor's degree – this time in math – but I fear that I would be seen as a ""perpetual student"" since I've been studying since 2015 and would just add one degree to the next (not to mention that I got 2 Bachelor's already as I got one in educational psychology ""for free"" just by taking some extra classes that didn't add time to my studies, meaning that I was still able to graduate within the 4 years it would have taken me anyway). Also, apart from part-time jobs in a bar and at a restaurant, I have not gotten any work experience yet and don't know if such a decision could put me in a bad spot with employers in the future. My programme was very light on the quantitative side, the only larger exposure to math I've had since high school was every time when I was interested in a topic and then researched it on the internet. Also, I cannot code well, I have used Python in a few projects before, but only to a very rudimentary level for some data cleaning. Other than good grades and working really hard to get them, I have nothing going for me. No valuable skills whatsoever.

I regret every single decision I have taken in the last 6 years and don't know where to go from here. At the time when I finished high school, I had so much potential. I saw people close to me majoring in subjects they're passionate about, doing something they love. Meanwhile, I chose a subject that I have never liked and never really questioned it, solely because I was afraid that my GPA could take a hit. I was anxious and I have no idea how I can correct my mistakes. I have been thinking about teaching math to myself since I like it and there are many online lectures available these days. However, I feel that math is one of those subjects where a ""controlled"" environment with exercise classes with Q&amp;As complementing the lectures is absolutely necessary to get a good understanding.

I am aware that this subreddit is flooded with threads from people suffering from depression and I apologize that mine will now be added to that list. I feel terrible and have no idea which way to go. I have been having these thoughts for months now and feel stuck. I cannot talk to anyone else. My family expects me to work now and thinks that I have a clear path in mind since I got good grades and never seemed to worry about anything. I feel like my life is over and that it's too late to switch. I'm not sure how my mom would react if I told her all this – while I think she would be supportive, as she always is, I don't want to make her worry about me. She has provided for me even in my 20s and I want to give her something back now. On the other hand, I would like to have a family and children on my own sometime in the future and I don't know if it's a good idea to wait and do a career switch in my 30s or just give up on it entirely and accept that some decisions in life are final.

I need help and don't know where else I should go or what I should do. I want to change my life but don't know how. Thank you for reading my post."
mtno9c,1,2021-04-18,Might renege on new job offer and take counter offer. Am I overthinking this? (Long read/rant),jik002,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mtno9c/might_renege_on_new_job_offer_and_take_counter/,"Hey everyone! I accepted a new job last month that is supposed to roughly start in two weeks (tomorrow would be my two week notice). But, I am a very indecisive person and have asked a ton of people for advice since something felt. It felt like I was not giving my current team’s counter offer the consideration it deserved and looking at my long-term plan. I met with my boss at a happy hour to try to make peace with leaving, but he acted “as a friend” and poked holes into my reasoning for leaving, and why what he’s offering should be more compelling for me (more on that near the end of my post). I accepted the offer on the advice of some people and on the fear that it’d get pulled from me since it was an exploding offer, the belief that there’d be more internal mobility/support, and pay or course.

Background: I am currently a Registered Sales Associate in my mid-20s at a traditional wirehouse/brokerage in a major city (think Merrill/Wells/UBS). I have about 5 years of experience under my belt between my internship and full-time role at the same firm. Current all-in comp is just under $70K/yr between my firm paid base, revenue share with my team, and discretionary bonus. Not allowed to work OT unless cleared through management (which is almost never) since I’m hourly. Love my bosses, management and team but comp and role have bothered me for a while. I am passive and tend to keep things that bother me to myself. I started off with this firm as an Intern for a year before securing a full-time role upon completing undergrad. I got licensed with my Series 7 and 66 within the year. There was projected to be a lot of growth on this team, as I was working on a team of four Portfolio Managers and a Senior Assistant, with two of the Managers in question retiring soon and transitioning their clients to the ones who remained. I had a great relationship with everyone. The transition process has taken about two years and counting, with its lumps.  The Senior Assistant abruptly retired, and it was just the two Portfolio Managers and myself looking over all of these new clients, leaving me to take on increased responsibility. At the same time, one of the current I work with Portfolio Managers is aggressively recruiting new clients, and other Portfolio Manager on the team is 72 and getting contemplating retirement soon. Hypothetically, there should be plenty of opportunity. All fine and dandy, right? I wish that was the case. This was hinted at but hasn't come to pass the way I envisioned.

Despite being the jack-of-all trades for my team and a resource in best practices for other Sales Associates/Assistants in the office, including those more Senior than me, my revenue share had not increased, nor did my title. My Portfolio Managers have said that as our client base grew, I would grow, and that someone will need to be hired under me to handle most of the operational work so I can receive a title promotion and to have the daily capacity to be more ""involved"" in the business. The problem is, they DO NOT want to pay for this new hire/help, and want the firm to pay for it. Understandable. But, the firm says no; our time has to hit an $X amount of annual revenue before management bears the cost of a new hire. This tussle between team and firm has been on going for two years. I have tried to add additional value however I can, and even started studying to get insurance licensed but was told it would not help while I am in the my current role, nor would it get me a bump in comp. I have been praised by my team and market management for being one of the best Sales Assistants in the office, for having ambition to do more and for managing the transition of this legacy book of business as it hasn't been easy at all, but this hasn't translated to a promotion or increase in comp due to the desire to run lean.

I wasn't actively looking for a new opportunity, but was reached out to by a recruiter from a very prestigious Private Bank in the industry (think JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Northern Trust etc.), both looking to expand their capacity. The role wasn’t necessarily something I was looking for as it was my current client services/operational role on steroids, but it sounded appealing in its own way. Not to mention the comp and brand name is better. Becoming a Hybrid Associate/Portfolio Manager is my ultimate goal. This firm offered me a job as an Associate (skipping the “Analyst” role) based on my years of experience. This came with a large pay bump. Their offer was $90K/yr base, with expectations to work additionally paid OT each week and a yearly bonus. All-in comp would be easily over $100K/yr as a result. After two years in this new role/program, I supposedly could move internally and join another team if I am unsatisfied with the work being done in this new role. I was ecstatic and gave my current team the heads-up, but they said they wanted to keep me and counter-offered dollar for dollar. They said to keep in mind the goal is to keep growing my revenue share and the client book over the coming years. They supposedly ""meant to make me a larger partner sooner"", and wanted to bring me along slowly as the 72 year old partner contemplates retirement, and as they’re in discussions with merging with a larger team/client base. I could also bring in clients of my own and get 50% of the revenue they bring in, and get more involved on the Investment side of the business. BUT, there will be no official title change for me until either someone gets hired under me, or until we compete this supposed mega merger. I am very comfortable with my small team because it feels like family, I love my fellow co-workers, the clients etc. and I do see the opportunity for growth. I am essential to my current team since we're only three people total. However, all these plans are just that, plans with no set date as to when they'll happen (this merger has been on hold since COVID last year, older Portfolio Management’s potential retirement and all). It shouldn't be such a struggle with Management and my immediate bosses to get a raise and title change. Truth be told, if they gave me this raise back in December along with these very general, directional career plans of eventually becoming a junior partner and more involved with the business, that would’ve be enough for me.

I am a passive person but finally managed to speak to one my bosses over happy hour (the younger one who would be inheriting most of the book). He said that I sounded like a 25 year old who is not sure about what they want to do in life. That I need to be showing more initiative on my end if I want to get out of this operational role. He asked me if I was reading multiple financial periodicals every week, as he did when he was my age? And that regardless of whether I stay or go, my new salary will come with a target on my back/increased expectations. And that while I am “good” at my current job, I am not “spotless”. What will I do if the new firm’s culture is too tough for me and I get fired either from poor performance or market conditions? How much internal movement could there really be if I am just lateraling from an Operational role at my old firm to this new firm without much transferable skills (also mentioned I’d be pigeonholing myself and that my new salary is near the top of the income band for client services)? How will I reach my ultimate goal of either being an Advisor or an Investment Analyst if I’m potentially pigeonholing myself with this lateral move? If I wanted to be a Wealth Advisor, could I really be one at this new firm if their minimums are much higher than where I am, and where most people I’d be competing with come form Ivy League backgrounds? Whereas in my current firm, I know my team’s clients, the firm culture, and could be in line to be a larger partner on the team in the future as his partner contemplates retirement and as they merge with another team. He also said the former co-workers I asked for advice gave crappy advice and are people who are jaded. That they don’t want the same things in life as I do. It shouldn’t be about the money because he’s matching dollar-for-dollar, and that firm prestige doesn’t matter as much unless I’m trying to pivot out into another industry and getting an MBA.

PS: he said that with what he’d be paying me that I should be picking up tennis again and meeting potential clients or join a social club. That although my current role is a 9-5, I have to start seeing it as more than that if I am to advance in this industry and be a rain maker. He did say there could be success for me at the new firm, but going from a client services/operational role to an investment analyst/para planner role (another path) would be tough with little transferable skills. I could do it if I changed jobs again in a couple years, but it would have to be in the right situation.

Any input is appreciated! I know this has been a very long read, but I needed to get this all off my chest. 5 years of frustration and lack of proper communication needs to be let out. Keep in mind that the new firm is someone I turned down an internship offer with in University, so I’m scared that renege on their offer after having accepted, there definitely won’t be a 3rd time to get hired from them. While not completely comfortable with my decision, I was ready to leave but he now has me second guessing myself."
mtojab,56,2021-04-18,I lost most of my 20s to depression and now I'm struggling to catch up,Yagrush,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mtojab/i_lost_most_of_my_20s_to_depression_and_now_im/," 

TL;DR at the bottom

I'm  28 y/o guy and for most of my 20s I've had a huge battle with  depression that has affected most of my college and post-college life.  This was related to chronic pain that I started to suffer related to  weight loss I went through when I was around 20. Ever since then I  wasn't able to sleep well and many of the activities that I enjoyed to  do (Going out with friends, playing guitar, playing video games) became  harder and harder to do. I've had to skip friend activities and became  inconsistent with my guitar practice which I really enjoyed doing, which  slowly but surely resulted in me self-isolating without doing things  that I enjoyed. Its worth mentioning that I spent a good few years  looking around doctors, being diagnosed with fibromialga and trying out  many meds that didn't help. To this day I never had a definitive  diagnosis other than the Fibromialgia and some straightnening of the  back and some damaged disks.

College  became miserable, pain made it hard to concentrate or enjoy classes,  and the semester workload itself became that much harder to bear which  extended the 4-year college program into nearly 9 years, which came from  me switching majors around, taking breaks for mental health and  struggling with class load. I had bouts with suicidal thoughts every  single day. I started feeling mental fog which became even harder to  deal with when I mixed it with college.

This  resulted in me basically giving up on life and just going through the  motions, not focusing on studies, working on projects or businesses, or  anything at all. I was feeling around this way by the time I graduated  in Comp. Sci when I was 27. Many people were happy for me but I still  wasn't satisfied. I was still depressed and sad and the things that used  to make me feel happy did not (Videogames, guitar, anime, etc). It was  frustrating but I was able to find the energy to graduate and find a  decent job. I also absolutely and completely forced myself to go to the  one internship I went to which resulted in me meeting many good friends  and my girlfriend (Though we have broken up recently, we are still in  good terms). Many more things happened to me, like my mom having a lot  of health difficulties which caused me a lot of distress.

I have been on and off on therapy and meds with mixed results.

All  of this takes me to now. I still feel depressed, I still feel like I  need to put a lot of effort to feel happy and actually do things for  myself that will have positive impacts, however I feel like I have a  different outlook on life and I'm willing to give energy to improve  myself and feel better and keep striving to be happy.

However,  I've started to feel the effects of me ignoring my health and myself  throughout the many years. I've started to see the wrinkles in my face,  aging. Acne scars from me violently popping my pimples from frustration.  My joints hurting when I try to excercise. I have very little things to  show for my 20s in terms of accomplishments other than my 1-year job  that, right now, is more of a means to an end that I took during the  pandemic. I haven't had a passion until.. what seems to be now, as I  started to look at video game development as a career and I've recently  started spending a lot of free time into side projects, reading and  learning towards the subject, but every time I sink time into it it's  hard to shake off the feeling of ""If I only I started this sooner"", ""How  much more time should I spend on this"", ""How do I see myself in my  30s?"". I'm sinking time into putting a to-do list in terms of the things  I want to accomplish (Todoist seems really good for this), also  organizing my note taking as I learn more of game dev (Notion is also  really good for this too). I haven't had much time to pick up my guitar  though, unfortunately, and I don't think I will find time. I'm trying to  get into cooking more, as I've never bothered cooking. I'm also trying  to look more into finance.

Basically any basic aspect of your life that you can think of, I feel like I've fallen behind in.

I'm  not sure if doing this is right. I'm not sure how to go about this.  Even though I put a goal in front of me I still feel lost on many  things. I'm scared how much of what I did to hurt myself in my 20's are  gonna keep hurting me and I don't know what to do now to reduce it's  impact of my future as I keep going, in all aspects of my life: Health,  Personal, Finance, Work, Hobbies, Love life. I feel hopeful but at the  same time I feel extremely scared and sad, at the chances I've lost and  the decisions that have screwed me over and the suicidal ideations creeping in again.

I  don't want to feel regrets coming into my 30s but I don't know know  what to do to help that feeling and I'm not sure if what I'm doing right  now will help. If anybody has any piece of advice that could help with  this I would be extremely grateful. I feel like I'm still threading a  very thin line between having a failed life and redemption.

**TL;DR:  I'm a 28 y/o that has lost most of his 20s to depression and is  beginning to feel the impacts of neglecting myself coming to my late  20's and 30's. I feel like I might have a goal now but I don't know what  to do to reduce the impact of the neglect to myself in finance, health,  and personal growth as well as to how move into my 30's without regrets  and feeling something resembling happiness.**

Sorry  for the stream of consciousness style of writing. If anybody has any  piece of advice or help then I will be extremely grateful"

While this college isn't the best in education, it's best for my financial situation. I'm as well in our Student Government as of the start of my freshman year.

It's just very hard to manage my schedule as I have meetings left and right and I understand my course isn't hard right now as a freshman but at the end of the day after lectures and coursework. I have almost no free time to myself besides sleeping and eating, when I look at my Google Calendar. And while dropping Student Gov could be an option, I feel more so I'd like to stay in it as it's a good extracurricular.

I feel so behind compared to others in the field of my major, as I haven't performed any projects or practiced LeetCode.

As of this point, I'm lined up for an internship this summer at an airforce base, but it's more like an IT position.

So if anyone has some tips on how I should handle this situation it'd be very much appreciated.

mtp91w,6,2021-04-18,Keep current leadership role or try to find a more relevant internship before graduation?,PokemanBrownPro,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/mtp91w/keep_current_leadership_role_or_try_to_find_a/,"# The Problem
I'm a Computer Engineering student in my junior year. For the past 1.5 years I've been working with a company that teaches STEM classes. I joined it as one of the very first employees and the company grew rapidly after me joining. I was a pretty stand-out employee as far as skill and effort, so despite my general inexperience I was able to secure a pretty significant role in the company managing our programs. My role encompasses a lot of things, from management to designing courses for more advanced topics. What it does not contain is much ""hard"" computer engineering. I have some serious gripes with this job and am growing concerned that I'm wasting my time with a job that employers might not even see as relevant to the kind of job I want when I graduate. Having not been in an internship before, it's hard for me to judge if it'll provide much more useful skill than just saying I worked for some well known company as an engineering intern. Without internship experience to judge from, the best I can do is layout my current position and ask those with more experience in the industry if an internship is a better idea than what I'm currently doing.

# Pros of current job:

* **Leadership experience**
  * It might be a bit flawed for me to focus on this when I'm going to need an entry level job after graduating, but I'm sure as hell not getting any leadership/management experience with an internship. A lot of people make a big deal out of this, joining clubs to ""get leadership experience"" and such, but I really don't know how much this matters. 
 * This is basically the only thing making this not feel like a bad idea for my resume. If that experience is really looked upon well, I got lucky. If me doing this over getting more practice with ""hard skills"" is seen poorly, I need to get out of here ASAP. 
* **Practical reasons to stay on** (unrelated to its value to recruiters, but important for keeping me alive and in school)
 * It's extremely flexible with my full-time college schedule
     * I work year round to some degree but really put in serious time when I'm off during the summer. From what I've seen there's no way I could manage any internship outside of a summer one, and my times running out to apply for those.
 * It's a safe and reliable source of income. 
     * I'm pretty bad with ""unknowns"" and I have a job for as long as I want to stay around here, including after graduation. To add onto this, internships from what I've seen pay a little less.

# Cons of current job:

* **Barely any serious engineering experience**
 *  We actually have ambitions to develop hardware but our resources are limited on this front right now. I could probably strong-arm my boss into moving me to this kind of role but I'd be concerned I'd be a ""computer engineering intern"" in name only, without much real practice. I could probably spice it up on my resume but I find it hard to believe I'd get much real experience without help from someone much more skilled than I am to help. 
     * This is the aspect that I'm really unsure of without knowing how much better an internship at a major company would be. Without an senior figures to help me in my current job, it'd be a trial by fire trying to develop anything on my own. 
* Other reasons to leave
 * Poor leadership, awful organization. 
     * I could write an entire post about this aspect, but this is a long post as is. This is a question and not a rant so I'll save writing every single grievance here. For my own sanity I'd like to work somewhere else, but I'm not totally convinced the grass is greener on other side, especially given the reasons for staying on are pretty big for me. 


There's a lot more I could go into in explaining the situation, but I've already written more than I can imagine most can bear to read. I'd really really truly appreciate some idea of:

1. To recent grads: How worthwhile was your internship compared to what I'm describing for getting a job in the industry?
2. To those who've been in the industry for a while (and/or especially those who've hired people): Would a resume with this position as the sole work-experience be impressive or would work in a traditional engineering workplace trump my experience by a long shot?

My sincere and deepest gratitude to anyone who takes the time to read this through and offer their input. There's a lot of aspects to weigh and I don't know much of anyone who can give advice from their own experience, so this seems like the ideal place to ask.

TLDR: Would an internship be a better use of my time compared to staying with my current ""regular"" job?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the helpful comments. Judging from the universal agreement on what I should do, the right choice is more obvious than I'm making it seem to myself. Short term security is great, but that can't be prioritized over the long-term importance of real engineering experience."

(A sort of brief guide),Armaan_for_USAC,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/mtr3ns/what_is_usac_a_sort_of_brief_guide/,"This is not a campaign post but rather an educational post to explain what USAC is since I have received many messages, especially from first time Bruins like our current freshman and first year transfers. 

USAC (Undergraduate Student Association Council) is essentially UCLA's student government. We the 30,000+ students make up the Undergraduate Student Associations (USA) and each spring we elect 15 councilmembers to represent us on the USA Council aka USAC. These 15 councilmembers each have a different title and different role within USAC. I have included a brief explanation of each role below. 

**President**

The president is the chief executive officer in USAC. Constitutionally the powers of the president are to preside over all council meetings, make nearly 100 appointments to various boards, and veto powers over some budgetary issues. Moreover, since the President is also the official representative of the Association, administration will commonly seek the input of the USAC President on decisions and President has the ability to advocate to both UCLA administration and the University of California, Office of the President (UCOP). 

**Internal Vice President (IVP)**

The Internal Vice President assumes the role of the President in the event of a vacancy. Otherwise the two primary roles of the IVP are to be a liaison for student organizations to USAC and navigate the USAC constitution and bylaws. The IVP is also in charge of creating and posting the USAC agenda, making sure USAC meetings are following parliamentary procedure, overseeing that USAC meeting livestreams are running, and regularly updating the [USAC website.](https://usac.ucla.edu) Additionally, the IVP have various roles regarding public safety which includes chairing the Campus Safety Alliance. 

**External Vice President (EVP)**

The External Vice President is in charge of advocacy efforts to off-campus entities. Generally the EVP will be regularly lobbying the local, state, and federal government, as well as the UC Regents, on pressing student issues. The EVP also represents UCLA to UC Student Association (UCSA) and is a voting member of the UCSA Board of Directors along with all the EVP's of all 9 UC campuses. (Fun Fact: UCLA's current EVP was also elected as the UCSA President by the UCSA Board of Directors)

**General Representative (Gen Rep) - 3 Positions** 

The General Representatives are exactly what they sound like. They are in charge of representing to the Council general student interest and are responsible for functions not delegated to other officers. Each General Representative will usually take on 3-5 unique platforms that they hope to accomplish throughout the year. 

**Academic Affairs Commissioner (AAC)**

The Academic Affairs Commissioner is in charge of and serves as the student voice to administration regarding academic policy. The AAC also gets to appoint over 25 students to the UCLA Academic Senate, which is a body made up of students, administrators, and faculty. The Academic Senate is then in-charge of creating new majors and minors, changing graduation requirements, setting grading recruitments, and much more. The AAC is also in charge a few funds that are allocated to student organizations and individual students like Travel Grant Mini Fund, Academic Success Referendum Fund, and Books for Bruins. 

**Campus Events Commissioner (CES)**

The Campus Events Commissioner is in charge of campus events which includes Bruin Bash and various other events throughout the year. The Campus Events Commission oversees a budget of about $300,000 which it uses to put on these events. 

**Community Service Commissioner (CSC)**

The Community Service Commission oversees various community service projects on behalf of the student association. As the USAC office with some of the most funding, the CSC is an umbrella for about 30 different types of service projects. 

**Cultural Affairs Commissioner (CAC)**

The Cultural Affairs Commissioner is in charge of organizing and executing cultural arts programs. Similar to CES, CAC will put on various events throughout the year including poetry nights. 

**Facilities Commissioner (FAC)**

The Facilities Commissioner is tasked with being the student's voice to administration regarding campus facilities. FAC also gets to appoint students to various boards that concern campus facilities including the Office Space Allocation Committee (OSAC) which is in charge of allocating office space and locker space in Kerckhoff to various student organizations on campus and The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) which is a funding body student organizations can apply for Green Initiatives. 

**Financial Supports Commissioner (FSC)**

The Financial Supports Commissioner is in charge of addressing financial concerns for the student body. The FSC will advocate to administration regarding specific financial concerns as well as run programs to help alleviate financial concerns for students like lab coat and iClicker loaner programs. 

**Student Wellness Commissioner (SWC)**

The Student Wellness Commissioner promotes health and wellness for the student body. The SWC is in charge of overseeing various committees which help tackle issues like sexual health, physical wellness, and mental health.

**Transfer Student Representative (TSR)**

The Transfer Student Representative was a position created in 2014 to function as a facilitator of resources, providing advocacy and support for the transfer communities unique needs. The TSR is also responsible for bringing transfer students concerns to the administration and the council. 

**International Student Representative (ISR)**

The International Student Representative was created in 2018 and is the newest USAC position. Similar to the TSR, the ISR is tasked with facilitating resources, providing advocacy and supporting the unique needs of the international student community.

It is important to note that while I've outlined more of the official roles of each USAC elected representative, each USA Councilmember will take on their own projects throughout the year based on there interests and student needs. These projects include everything from programming and events to advocating administration on an issue of importance to the student body. All this will largely depend on the person who is elected to the given role. The rest of this guide is common questions I've seen come up about USAC.

**How many people work in each USAC office?**

Each USAC office will generally ""hire"" a staff to help accomplish the goals of the office. The structure of the office varies based on the office and who is currently elected to lead the office. Some common roles are chiefs of staff, directors for social media, directors for various platforms and projects, and even staff interns to assist the directors to help execute whatever goal (Yes, it's a lot of bureaucracy). Each USAC office pretty much functions like a student organization but access to USAC funding and administration allows USAC offices to be *theoretically* better advocates for students. 

**How much is USAC paid?**

Each of the 15 elected representative are paid minimum wage for 20 hours of work each week during the school year and a slightly smaller amount during the summer and breaks. This ends up being about $11,000 each during the entire term (Spring Quarter to Spring Quarter). People working in each office sometimes will get stipends that aren't very large and I think the maximum someone could earn is around $1,000 a quarter but most of the time it looks like it's not even close to that. Money for stipends for office directors and staff will typically come from the office budget (which is really small for most of the offices) or will be allocated by the council through surplus funds. 

**How do USAC Finances work?**

The USAC finance structure currently is awfully complex and is incredibly hard to understand. Student Fees amount to a budget of over $10 million but most of this budget is restricted meaning it gets directly allocated for the purpose the student fee was passed and USAC has limited control over spending that money. The most unrestricted funds are generally USA Contingency which is the primary funding source for student organizations. Student Organizations can then apply for this funding and USAC gets to vote on allocating it. If a specific funding pool does not get used, the money is put into a surplus fund which USAC can then spend based on the council's priorities. 

**What are Slates?**

Slates are basically like political parties for student government. Candidates will often times run for USAC with a slate of likeminded individuals as a way of being more effective in accomplishing their goals. Many students also choose to run Independently without slate affiliation. This election will feature 3 Slates: For The People, Bruin Solutions, and Bruins Adelante Coalition. For The People was created in 2018 and this is the 4th election for this slate. Bruin Solutions and Bruins Adelante Coalition are both new slates running for the first time. 

**What is the Election Board?**

The USA Elections Board is one of the three branches of the Undergraduate Student Association (USA) and serves as an independent administrator of USA Council Elections. The Elections Board Chair is appointed by the USAC President and confirmed by the rest of the council. The rest of the members of the Elections Board are appointed by the Elections Board Chair and confirmed by the council. 

**What is the Judicial Board?**

The USA Judicial Board is the third branch of the USA (so we have the council, elections board, and judicial board). The Judicial Board is in charge of ruling upon the Constitutionality of legislation and official actions of elected or appointed officials of USAC. Currently USAC can overrule a Judicial Board decision with a 3/4 vote. 

**What is ASUCLA?**

The Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) is the overarching body that makes up the entire UCLA student association. Currently 4 entities make up ASUCLA: Undergraduate Student Association (USA), Graduate Student Association (GSA), Student Media, and Services &amp; Enterprises. 

GSA is the graduate student equivalent of USAC. 

Student Media is made up of Daily Bruin, UCLARadio.com, the Bruin Life Yearbook, and seven newsmagazines: Fem, La Gente, Nommo, Ha’Am, Pacific Ties, Al-Talib, OutWrite. Student Media is overseen by the ASUCLA Communication Board, which is made up by appointments by USAC and GSA, and administrative and faculty representatives. 

The last component, Services &amp; Enterprises, means the Student Union, Event Services, UCLA Restaurants, and UCLA Store. Ackerman Union, Kerckhoff, Bomb Shelter, Lu Valle Commons, and other smaller components are all properties of ASUCLA (meaning us the students). This is all overseen by the ASUCLA Board of Directors, which is a student majority board made up again by appointments by USAC and GSA, and administrative and faculty representative. ASUCLA also checks the budget passed by USAC for financial soundness. 

**What else?**

Student Government is complicated but hopefully through this guide you have a better understanding. If you still have any questions feel free to post them below and I will do my best to answer them. USAC Elections are coming up and I hope everyone will exercise their right to vote. Beyond the election of the 15 USAC offices (2 are uncontested so technically 13), there are 3 constitutional changes on the ballot and 1 student fee referendum. 

\---

  
Lastly, I think it's important to mention that I am not part of any USAC office, committee, or even appointed to any of the boards. This whole guide is based on **public information** I have complied through my research in trying to understand the role and scope of USAC. If anyone here is more involved in USAC currently and believes I have made a mistake, feel free to comment below or message me so I can make the appropriate edits.  

Just to be safe since I am currently a candidate for USAC President. Disclaimer as required by u/uclalelectionsboard: ""Visit uclaelectionsboard.org for more information and its IG/FB social media platforms @uclausaeboard"""

I really want to work in the CS field and I know it is totally possible to get there being in Math with a little bit of extra work. But would it be easier if I transferred to other CS programs like Carleton or UBC and actually study CS there instead. Internal transfer to CS seems pretty much impossible unless you have a 95+ given 225. I have a 80ish CAV and mid 80s MAV so I think I have an okay chance for these external transfers. I also have an okay cs related coop lined up for the summer, so maybe getting future CS internships won't be as difficult? But given how brutal this term's employment for 1b math was (25%-ish), I don't really have high hopes. Should I stay put and major in a cs-related major like Stats, CO or CM and work on side projects or look to transfer out?"

Although the work they want me to do is nothing that I’m interested in and I’m worried that I’ll end up specializing in this discipline and won’t be able to get out of it later on. I also would like to move to another city (with my girlfriend. Currently we are already long distance and would like to be with one another) but at the same time it wouldn’t be the end of the world if I stayed here although I’m very far away from my family.

The pay is decent at $26 an hour but I also know of others who have received more pay directly after college and I feel that I could do the same if I look around more.

The problem is that this current internship is the only engineering experience I have and I’m worried that I might not even be able to find another job or better offer.

Should I suck it up for a year and be miserable but will be able to use this experience as a resume builder? Or do I not accept and be happy but also risk being unemployed for many months while looking for my dream job. Maybe I’m being too picky but I don’t want to sell myself short.

mtvij0,2,2021-04-19,Am I overreacting?,throwaway556475,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mtvij0/am_i_overreacting/,"So, I'm working for almost 4 months in a multi-awarding digital agency as a junior full-stack developer and I was pretty excited to work there since I was recommended to them by my ex boss despite the fact they were looking for a senior but I feel I don't fit. 

Things got pretty bad during my latest project which I was doing by myself which went way out of schedule. My manager spoke to me through phone(I'm currently working remote) with open speaker in the open-office environment to ask me what went wrong with this and if I think he overestimated my skills.

I specifically told him that I take the blame for this since I didn't plan this quite well when it comes to time management and that I also lost time in specific areas that I had already specified I lacked experience during the interview. He asked me what I think we should do and I told him if possible I would like to work more in smaller tasks related to my weaker areas of my skill set so I can improve. He told me he was ""ok"" with this but I should report everything I do regarding those tasks and if I fail again he said ""We will see what we will do then"" which sounded like a hint of me getting fired. 

Honestly, this was like the last straw for me since I feel that despite I don't hate any of my coworkers(at least I think we actually get along well but I might be wrong) I don't think their office culture is for me and I start feeling that there's no trust in me either.

Some other problems I had prior to this:

1)They have another developer which works remote for almost like 2 years but the only thing she does is adding content to Wordpress and some CSS but cannot handle anything else. I have nothing personal against her but now how am I the only one that needs to be treated like this when I'm still new and this is the only project that I failed this far? We are both in the same job position but I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick here.

2)Using timetracking system(Harvest). I have to literally fill 8 hours there per day while I also have it running irl so they can see what I'm actually working on. I feel I'm being constantly watched and monitored with this putting aside the stress and once I was also once notified in a friendly manner I have forgotten it on ""break time"". I appreciated their gesture but still didn't sit well with me.

3)Their junior project manager is sometimes asking me if I did stuff that she never sent to me which confuses and throws me out of the loop of what I'm working on despite the fact that I have told her to check before she asks me. There's also only one senior there(the other senior one that was there left because of personal problems unrelated to the job) which he is pretty good, approachable and really helpful when I'm asking him questions but I feel like if something happens to him the company despite its fame will fall like dominos. Also, everyone looks like they are workaholic there so I don't see any work-life balance as well.

So now what should I do? This is my 2nd job not counting one internship and I lasted a bit over half a year in my previous one since I was let go due to budget cuts (thus why my ex boss recommended me elsewhere). Now if I leave again I feel like I'm job-hopping too much or don't last long due to performance which might affect my future employment. Should I suck it up and stay or look for a new job before I quit? 

TL;DR: I screwed up for the first time in new job and along with other ""red flags"" prior to this point I don't feel like staying. I would like to see a more objective standpoint here and every constructive criticism is truly appreciated!

mtxuxj,2,2021-04-19,Morality of Crowdfund Campaign after a pre-seed round,swinledge,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/mtxuxj/morality_of_crowdfund_campaign_after_a_preseed/,"Hi all, so I’ve been developing a company alongside my cofounder focused on the development of unique prosthetic hand that is now well into development, and we’re at the stage where we are looking at pre-seed investment.

Doing a crowdfund campaign has been a large part of our plan recently, where the goal would be to raise money to fund various beta prototypes for several predetermined users to test over time. We were thinking 20k would be enough for us to a) manufacture several rounds of prototypes and b) hire a couple interns to oversee the beta testing program while the two founders could continue developing the business side.

However, we’ve been given the opportunity to pitch to an early stage angel syndicate which is too good an opportunity to pass, yet the time frame means that the crowdfund campaign would potentially occur AFTER a pre-seed investment.

This means that the funds from the campaign may not be completely needed (although they would still help since we aren’t raising a humungous round) yet I’m still unsure about the morality around this.

However, it wasn’t only the monetary value of the crowdfund we wanted to utilise, but also the engagement, hype and exposure a successful crowdfund would offer. Possibly having more users reach out to us who we could help out and involve in the design process, or even catch the eye of potential partners.

What are your guys thoughts on this? Still moral to go ahead with a crowdfund campaign after a seed round or nah?"

I am interested in digital system design more but I have concerns about finding a good job at that area. Is it wise move to go for digital system design or should I go for embedded software development because of its wider job market and better opportunities. 

I think that embedded software has more opportunities because they stay more close to software, therefore software job markets.

I spent a lot of money for education and ended up being worse than if I stayed in home country and did my „free” available education, which seemed to be more rigorous. But it’s not the point of me blaming the school, I am a bad person myself and didnt study as I should have. I got very depressed in college knowing that my parents spent all their life savings for me to go to a scam school that didnt care about teaching a thing. And I didnt study much, or at times I was so lost that even though I tried, I couldnt catch up with things. I ended up graduating with a bad GPA, too. 

But here’s another thing. Whatever you might think at this point, I am actually not as useless myself. If I try very hard with things, I can actually succeed. But here’s my problem, the one I need advice with. I am very determined to get what I want, but Im just not too resourceful due to concerns about self worth. Knowledge-wise. Let me super quickly explain. I applied for some internships and even to this one very presigeous finance academy programme (in my country) that I’d love to get into, and I got to be invited for the 2nd round recruitment, which is interviews, even though my resume is bad, nearly empty. I made a really good application to this financial leaders programme, and I got chosen to have an interview. Here is the problem and conclusion- I can be very wise if I can be in disguise. When I can google something, learn it, and then answer. Sometimes I can take a day and learn one completely new topic and be a master of it. But during an actual face to face interview, I cannot do anything with this fact that I actually do not know shit in finance, economics, politics, how to analyze the simpliest things quickly, and this started to be a problem already back in college and due to college (as this didnt occur before college at all, I became shit of a person in college) and more even now after graduating and looking for job opportunities. 

I dont know how to explain it. I literally have a problem that I dont know what should I do, where should I start to catch up with literally everything. I see everyone knowing so much about finance, measures, multiples, and I wanna cry knowing that it does actually take years to build up this „network” of knowledge in brain; to be able to think and reasonate so quickly. I’m not 100% behind, but honestly at least 85%. But I need to learn it all, I want to catch up, and I dont know where to start. On the top of that, yeah, I got that leadership programme (one I just mentioned) interview offer in 2 weeks which will be heavily technical about capital market and similar, and I just dont know what to do. The first round application was very tough, but it required some creative thinking, and I guess they liked what I wrote. But when they will test me on skills, they will know that Im useless. Is there anything I can do? How can I literally catch up with everything and become as smart as my acquintances are? I promise I’m a person worth explaining it to. You wont waste your time if you throw me some advice. Please and thank you. Im just so lost and every situation when I see how little I am compared to others brings me more and more downhill. I need to gather up my shit, this interview and many others to come are very important to me, but I really dont know anything.... What should I do. :( I dont know which part of finance should I even start with to have any chance on that interview. And in general, where should I being to finally stop feeling like a piece of shit. Please help me. Im so sorry for such a long post. If someone made it till the end, you deserve the world and more. Thank you. By the way, I am 23 yo. I really need to go back to living."

mu3fy5,2,2021-04-19,Important finance interview but I dont know a thing. Please help,sophiehagg,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/mu3fy5/important_finance_interview_but_i_dont_know_a/,"Hi, Thanks for any advice, both regarding to this one situation and in general for my future. Thank u a lot. I’ll keep it super short.

I graduated with BBA degree in Finance, but I dont know shit. It would take a long explanation to describe why is that, but in short, I have massive knowledge gaps, beginning in financial accounting to even private equity and lbos. Just all of that, also economics and damn it, just everything. 

I applied for a few internships and some preatigeous programme for future financial leaders, and I got invited for interviews. Here’s the thing. I can write smart things and act smart when Im in disguise, when I can take my time, google things, and once I learn, I master the topic. But because I am self-unconfident, feeling like piece of shit when I see how much I dont know in comparison to my peers, I am lost on what to do. Lost both now and in general, for the future. 

My problem is, I dont know where to start to catch up with everything. I just dont know what to do and how to fill up my knowledge gaps as quick as possible, and I do have both determination and time to do so. But Im not resourceful I guess, so I dont know where to begin, also Im now very depressed about that fact that Im so dumb and didnt study well before, and now having to pay the price. But ok, there were some more factors that contributed to that, just a long story. 

Please help me out. In 2-3 weeks I have this very technical interview, and I dont know if there’s anything I can do to prepare for it. I am at such a bad situation that even if they ask me the most basic questions, such as explain how financial statements correlate, I would not know. Damn. But I dont even know what can I do during this time, what to read, what to do to have any minimal chance... You see my point I hope. 

I was aware that I am very dumb and have massive knowledge gaps and I started to solve it by getting ready for CFA exams, which I consider as a salvation to actually force me to master basics. But what should I do considering I have this interview in a few? How can I even catch up? I am beyond desperate and sad. Im considering giving up on that interview just to not make a laughtingstock out of myself... Some basic questions I wouldnt even know what is it, and would you believe I have a finance degree? Let me be most honest with you as I could be: due to all that I think I really became suicidal. I need to do something about it all. Feeling like a piece of shit is what I cannot live up to and I just dont know, dont know at all what to do. I will start learning from beginning for the future, but that interview was a wake up call like nothing ever, and now I hold onto that dearly hoping there is anything I can do during these 2-3 weeks. 

Please, please kindly help me out. Anything helps."
mu3tld,2853,2021-04-19,I received an unsettling email from the FutureMe website. Jeff’s barbeque.,peculi_dar,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mu3tld/i_received_an_unsettling_email_from_the_futureme/,"You might be wondering how I ended up in front of Jeff’s house five minutes past twelve on a lazy Saturday afternoon. I mean, I kind of [left you guys hanging](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mt3wls/i_received_an_unsettling_email_from_the_futureme/) when the black SUV pulled up after the strange woman disappeared into someone’s backyard. An email from FutureMe.org instructed me to run, but I didn’t do that.

You have to understand something about me.

I was a simple man living a small life. I went to work every day to deal with customer complaints. I enjoyed watching sports and spending time with my friends. Sometimes, I would try out a new hobby or go on a date, but rarely. It just wasn’t all that important to me.

I’m sorry if I’m droning on. I just wanted to make it clear how absolutely wild the events of the previous day were compared to the general landscape of my humble existence. I had fully expected to find nothing and no one at Ashbury Lane. The whole reason I went there was to put a lid on the paranoia. When that didn’t happen, my mind reverted to the most basic form of sanity retention.

Denial.

I did not panic. I did not run. I calmly pocketed both my phone and the pill. I strolled back through the empty property, humming a melody to soothe my nerves. I watched my shoes sink in the sand, never so much as glancing at the black SUV that stood beneath a paling street light.

I crossed the road, got in my car, and drove home. When I got there, I didn’t stop to inspect the fridge or look for intruders. I poured myself a cup of water and went upstairs. Just your average nightly routine. Shower, floss, brush. I changed into my pajamas, slipping the metallic capsule from my jean pocket to my pajama shirt pocket.

My denial faltered there, but I kept up appearances as I turned off the lights and climbed between the sheets. In the darkness, I unbuttoned the top of my shirt and slid a trembling hand over my heart, feeling it throb beneath my skin. My fingers kneaded the pocket, tracing the shape of the pill. I had put my shirt on inside out in hopes of preventing the capsule from falling out by mistake. Or being taken.

The next morning seemed blissfully normal. There was nothing suspicious about my orange juice, milk, or cereal. There were no unlicensed vehicles parked in my street. It was the warmest day we’d had all year and it was a Saturday, so no work. No flirting interns. Hopefully, no emails.

I was excited about the barbeque. I really needed a break, a distraction.

My friend Jeff and I had met five years ago when I first moved to the neighborhood. He was the only other single man living on our street. Everyone else was settled with kids, dogs, garden gnomes. I rang the doorbell and took a step back. The door flew open less than a minute later.

“Colin, my man,” Jeff appeared in the doorway, beer in hand, “How the hell are ya?”

I wanted to go in for a friendly half-hug, but something stopped me. Jeff’s cheerful demeanor felt plastic. There was a hint of restlessness in his stance, an edge to his posture. He had always towered over me, muscular and broad-shouldered, but his big build had never felt like a threat. Until now.

“It’s been a weird few days,” I admitted, trying to shake off the gentle tremors running through my limbs.

“Ah, tell us all about it,” Jeff motioned to the living room as we walked, “The guys are all here.”

I paused in the doorway, a festering dread choking out any chance of having a normal afternoon. I could count at least eight men in Jeff’s living room, but there were more. Some were seated, others standing. The moment I walked in, all eyes were glued to me. These were not the glances of casual acquaintances dropping by for some beers and grilled meat. They were pointed, calculating. No one made a sound.

Jeff stood at my side and I turned to look at him. His face was calm, but there was a coolness in his gaze as he observed the growing panic in mine. His mouth stretched over in a friendly smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. There was no warmth there, only accusation.

“You remember Paul and Todd?”

I glanced back at the gathering, barely recognizing my two poker buddies. Up until then, Todd had been the quirkiest guy I’d ever met, always at my side with a joke or a pick me up. There was no humor in his face now. Paul was usually quite meek, subdued even. He sat in an armchair, posture upright, eyes narrowed, jaw clenched.

What had I just walked into?

“Something wrong, Colin?” Jeff asked.

“I just haven’t been feeling well lately,” I stammered, trying to keep the shakiness out of my voice, “Do you think I could use your bathroom?”

“Sure thing,” Jeff’s voice was so low now, barely above a whisper, “The downstairs bathroom is out of order. Use the one upstairs.”

I turned around and walked through the hall and up the stairs in what I hoped was a casual manner. I hated the silence that amplified every step I took, my squeaky shoes sending echoes through Jeff’s house.

Once inside the bathroom, I flipped the door lock shut and stumbled over to the sink. I held on to the ceramic edges, steadying my shaking frame. I could barely recognize myself in the reflection on the wall. My eyes were puffy from a restless night of sleep. Every facial muscle was strained, the lines on my forehead moving in agitation.

My phone vibrated in my back pocket and I already knew what to expect.

&amp;#x200B;

***The following is an e-mail from the past, composed on April 17th, 2016. It is being delivered from the past through FutureMe.org***

***Dear Future Colin,***

***Two twists right, one twist back***

***Nothing to fear with the powder attack***

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, what?

I couldn’t understand the email, and I was starting to feel claustrophobic within the confines of the bathroom. The blue tiles on the wall skipped before my eyes. They appeared to draw closer, threatening to flatten me out of existence. I was losing it. I needed fresh air, so I walked over to the narrow bathroom window and opened the blinds. I flipped the lock and threw the pane open.

I looked down at Jeff’s front lawn and stumbled back in horror. Every man I had seen in the living room was now out on the grass. They stood slightly apart from one another, positioned in rows like they were part of an outdoor yoga lesson. They remained perfectly still, heads raised toward the bathroom window, looking directly at me. One of the men tilted his head and waved.

I feigned nonchalance as I rolled down the blinds without closing the window. I felt it was important to keep my cool within their line of vision, but I wasn’t sure I was fooling anyone. I felt trapped, afraid, and entirely helpless. Above all, I couldn’t fathom why any of this was happening. Why now? Why me?

A thought occurred to me. It seemed out there, but definitely no more bizarre than anything else that had happened since I received the email. I had kept the pill on me at all times since the woman in the blue headscarf had placed it inside my hand. Somehow, the instructions made sense in the context of the capsule.

&amp;#x200B;

***Two twists right, one twist back***

***Nothing to fear with the powder attack***

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled it out from my jacket pocket.

I twisted the cap of the capsule to the right. Surprisingly, it rotated smoothly. I twisted it a second time, then rotated it back to the left. The capsule exploded in green smoke. It was so near my face that I ended up inhaling the greater part of the chemical. The green powder looped through the air and then disappeared. It was all but gone seconds after it burst in my hand. There was no residue on my skin, no stains on the bathroom walls.

The substance hadn’t smelled like anything. It didn’t sting my nostrils or throat. It tickled my lungs, but not in a bad way. At first nothing happened, and then my mind erupted in migraine. It was so acute, so painful, that I collapsed on the tile floor, keeling over on my knees. I groaned as I choked back vomit, my vision blurring and blacking. My eardrums throbbed something awful and I thought I was going to die.

It lasted less than minute, then stopped. All of it. My head was fine, I no longer felt sick. I stood back up and walked over to the sink. I needed to wash away my sweat. I turned on the tap and lifted my face to the mirror. I froze, water dripping off my chin. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. My hazel eyes had turned a luminous, sour green, like highlighter ink.

My phone vibrated again.

&amp;#x200B;

***The following is an e-mail from the past, composed on April 17th, 2016. It is being delivered from the past through FutureMe.org***

***Dear Future Colin,***

***Listen.***

&amp;#x200B;

Listen? Listen to what?

I tried though. I pulled down the seat lid and sat on Jeff’s toilet. At first I didn’t hear anything, but then I strained my ears a little, kind of like I would my eyes if a sign was far away. I was essentially squinting to hear. Todd’s voice was the first I recognized. It traveled to me from below, from somewhere in Jeff’s kitchen. I shouldn’t have been able to hear it so clearly inside my mind. The pill had enhanced my sense of hearing.

“So what does it mean? Is he back?”

“We don’t understand it yet. It’s not what the higher-ups thought would happen,” Jeff sounded agitated.

“So it wasn’t amnesia?” that one sounded like Paul, “He knew all along?”

“Look, I know about as much as you both. The subject is receiving communications from the Scientist. We have learned Alanis is still alive. We don’t know what it all means and we can’t tell how much the subject remembers.”

“I can’t believe all this is happening five years later,” Todd’s voice complained, “I was getting reassigned a week from Monday.”

“Me too,” Paul agreed.

“So was I,” Jeff replied, “But it seems the Scientist knew this would happen, that we’d be off our guard after so much time had passed.”

There was a lull in the conversation. I heard some light shuffling. I zoned in on it, realizing it was one of the men adjusting his belt. It was crazy to be able to hear in such vivid detail. I couldn’t explain how I knew what the sounds were, but I did. My new hearing shaped the world just out of reach, defining it. At the same time, it was noise-canceling. I heard only what I needed to, without being overwhelmed by the sounds of the world around me.

“Should we check on him? He’s been in that bathroom a long time.”

I heard footfall as the three men moved through the house, toward the staircase. I had very little time to make my move. I slipped out of the bathroom and down the hall. My hearing caught a radio crackling at the bottom of the stairs.

“Agents, the subject is on the move.”

Rapid footsteps ascended the stairs as I dashed into Jeff’s bedroom, to the window. I threw it open as my imposter friends reached the landing of the second floor. There was no one on the other side of the house, only a lonely grill standing at the far end of Jeff’s backyard. My heart tightened as I took a second to stare at it. It was the last pillar of normality, standing upright, black and charred. It was a gravestone to my life as I knew it. Uneventful, calm. Ordinary. Everything I had known to be real was crumbling around me, and I needed to stop playing blind and accept it.

I threw open the window and climbed onto the ledge. I latched the fingers of both hands into the gutter above, pulling myself up onto the roof of Jeff’s house with next to no effort.

That’s when I learned that the pill was good for more than just [my hearing](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/mt40kw/futureme_new_series_information_hub/).

mu4td9,2,2021-04-19,Which internship should I take?,warrior032000,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mu4td9/which_internship_should_i_take/,"Hello everyone-

I am very grateful to be in a position where I currently have 2 internship offers for the summer as rising senior. However, I am not totally certain which job I should take. 

**Option #1- Marketing Internship for non profit that advocates for Virtual Reality** 

* 35 hours a week $15/hr
* My responsibilities would involve continuing to develop and refine their monthly engagement report (which includes their social media, website, newsletter, and meeting attendance).
   *  From these reports, I will be responsible for assessing in conjunction with an employee who already works at the company as well as a hired non-profit marketing consultant what worked to drive traffic to their website and what we can improve. 
* I will also be responsible for formulating a plan to rethink their existing content and branding across various documents and outlets for the company. 
* They are also launching an industry event to be held likely in-person in November, and will need support on promoting it across all of their channels.
* **PROS:**
   * Would likely be less stressful internship 
   * Would get to working with a hired marketing consultant that graduated from my university
   * Really neat, but niche job 
   * Would have the opportunity to continue doing branding and something that I really like and continue to develop my branding portfolio
   * Would really have a lot of autonomy over my work and would truly get to work on developing their branding 
   * Would get more experience with website analytics 
   * Job would likely be more creative than other position 
* **CONS:**
   * Less diverse resume material, basically doing a very similar thing for this job as I did for my internship last summer 
   * Would be doing a lot of social media stuff which I am capable of but don't particularly enjoy 
   * Job would likely entail more busy work like many other run of the mill internships do
   * The job is in the nonprofit sector and I don't really want to work in this sector in the future
   * Less well known, much newer, less established company 
   * Less networking opportunities because its a smaller company with younger people who likely have less connections and experience 
   * Its really difficult to market for nonprofit companies 
   * No mention of company laptop, so concerns about personal data potentially but could maybe ask them about this if I concerned

**Option #2 - Marketing/E-commerce internship for very well known coffee company** 

* 35 hours week $15/hr
* My major responsibility would be to orchestrate essentially a high-level consulting project for the company.
   * 80% of their sales are currently on Amazon and they have tasked me with executing a large magnitude research project and presentation that will ultimately be presented to key stakeholders at the company about how they can deviate from Amazon to other marketing channels and sales outlets.
   * I would be responsible for implementing a lot of data and analytics into this presentation, much of the data already exists so I would just be applying it where necessary 
   * Ultimately I need to figure out where they should be in 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years and 5 years. 
      * I will need to demonstrate the necessary steps supported by data to highlight the integral steps the company must make to get to these key milestones and focus less of their sales on Amazon. 
   * As part of the internship I would be sitting on key Amazon calls and later participating in them in addition to being a part of the marketing departments weekly calls 
   * **PROS:**
      * Data analytic is really important and in high demand for entry level positions 
      * Would diversify resume more and offer great real world marketing experience from more of analytics based side
      * Would basically be working on a large presentation (a skill set of mine) and would get to incorporate and learn some new skills such as data manipulation 
      * I would be working in an industry that is related to food which is definitely up my alley 
      * I would be responsible for executing a high level consulting project that would be awesome way to diversify my marketing portfolio
      * Would have a lot of autonomy over my work
      * This internship is with a much more well-known company which could lead to greater networking opportunities
      *  Have already started building a relationship with my prospective boss through the networking and hiring process and he seems like a really nice person
      * Would gain real world e-commerce and consulting experience both of which are relevant in todays job market and transferrable experience
      * Although I am a little nervous about my proficiency in excel this internship would allow me to really work on my knowledge in excel because I would be forced to utilize it often
      * Would receive a company laptop so many concerns about personal data would be mitigated
   * **CONS:**
      * Could likely be more challenging and stressful than the other internship
      * Some hesitations about proficiency in excel as mentioned above 
      * My prospective boss said ""its a really great place to work but its a little scrappy and small internally, most executives have been at the company 20+ years.""

Any advice would be really appreciated!"

I'm in a bit of a unique situation and I was wondering what advice you might have for someone like myself. I've included the TL;DR, but if you'd like to read on I've included the story of my first experience with game development jobs out of school, and some advice for anyone who is entering the job market (especially when it comes to game development). I don't mean for it to sound like a sob story, but I suspect there are quite a few passionate and hungry young game development grads who could fall into the same trap that I did.

**TL;DR --------------------------------------------------------------------**

* I graduated 5 years ago with a Computer Science degree but due to naivete I let myself slip into a project management/marketing role and was eventually laid off. I'm hoping a coding bootcamp can help me jumpstart my programming skills and allow me to transition into an entry level software development role. Does this seem like a reasonable path?
* Will employers look unfavorably on a CS grad who hasn't had experience in a development role 5 years after graduation?

**Takeaways and advice from my experience (things that could have helped me avoid this situation)**

* CS STUDENTS, PRACTICE PROGRAMMING OUTSIDE OF YOUR CURRICULUM. I was naive in thinking that my CS curriculum would prepare me for entry level jobs. Because I focused so much on game development, I left school with almost 0 practical development experience or knowledge.
* Even if you find yourself in your ""dream job"" like I did, that is **NOT** the end of the road. Make sure that you are moving on the career path that YOU want, not the first one that some higher up offers. 
* Seek out good and knowledgeable mentors who can help answer your questions and give you good career guidance. Just because someone is your lead/boss **DOES NOT** mean they have your best interest at heart, even if they seem ""cool"" or ""nice"".
* DO NOT TRUST PERFORMANCE REVIEWS. Find people you respect and trust, schedule one on one time with them, and ask them to give you real advice on your performance and what you can do to improve. If someone tells you ""You're doing great, I have no comments!"", they are doing you a disservice. 

**LONG STORY --------------------------------------------------------------**

In 2016 I graduated college from Kennesaw State University (a decent GA state school) with a double major in Computer Science &amp; Computer Game Design and Development (with a minor in SWE). Video games have always been my passion, so naturally I focused all of my efforts into learning game engines and gameplay programming while in school. I created several game projects using Unity that built my portfolio and landed me a production internship at Cartoon Network Games and a QA internship at Hi-Rez Studios, the largest game studio in GA. After graduating, I took a QA position at Hi-Rez and life was good. I thought I was on the fast track to being a game development guru.

Unfortunately I was naive in my early 20s and had a bad case of imposter syndrome about my gameplay programming skills, so when I was offered the chance to become a ""producer"" I leapt at the opportunity. For those who aren't in the games industry, a Producer is essentially a project manager. A fancy title, salary and benefits, and the chance to work directly with a VP in a small team environment on a cool new opportunity for the company. What's not to love right?

Nobody ever taught me the ropes of production so I stumbled my way through it for years. While at the studio I changed leads &amp; projects every \~6-12 months and never had a steady mentor. I was given high performance reviews, promotions, and raises, but I always worried that people felt slighted and unhappy with me because I wasn't properly trained as a producer. The VP that pulled me out of QA was the closest thing I had to a mentor, and was the longest lead/mentor that I had during my time there. Unfortunately for me, he was just a former lawyer friend of the CEO with no production, marketing, or programming experience. I essentially became his secretary for two years. His philosophy was ""delegate to my producer and let him go piss everyone off with my unreasonable requests"".

Over time I came to find that the ""Associate Producer"" position I initially started in was a precursor for Marketing Production instead of actually development production, and I knew absolutely nothing about marketing. After 4.5 years of being shuffled between side projects, begging for help/guidance, yet getting glowing performance reviews from my peers, I finally pressed my lead to ask the reviewers to give me a ""real"" review. Lo and behold a slew of 1 and 2 star reviews came back followed by a PIP, which eventually led to me getting let go in January 2021. It turns out that for years everyone thought I was an awful producer, but gave me 3/4 star reviews because they thought I was some sort of ""golden boy"" to the higher ups.

I've taken the past few months to collect myself, reflect on what went wrong, and think about what I want going forward. I've decided that I need to pursue a career in actual software development and hopefully feed those skills into game development in the future, but now I am finding that despite having a Computer Science degree, I am lacking all of the practical programming skills that I would need to apply for entry level positions. My programming experience extends to writing C# and C++ scripts for Unity and Unreal, I'm not certified in either language, and I don't have a good idea of how to write an non-game program past the console line projects I did in school.

My current plan is to start this coding bootcamp ASAP: [https://www.digitalcrafts.com/immersive-web.html](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/immersive-web.html)

My goal is to use this bootcamp knowledge, leetcode/[algo.io](https://algo.io) practice, and lots of self study to prepare myself to job search in about 4-5 months for entry level software development roles.

Does this sound like a reasonable path to success? Or will I be given the side-eye by employers for essentially having a 5 year resume gap in programming experience?"

I'm a junior-year computer science major, and I have an internship this summer with a somewhat large company. I'll be working as an application developer and will be operating on a team learning angular. From what my supervisor explains, we will spend our summer working on projects that are actually useful for the company, and we will be split into small teams for the entire summer, so we will really get to know each other, as well as our mentors, very closely.

The supervisor notes that post-internship offers will be extended based on an intern's performance and how well they fit the team they worked in. So, aside from just performing well in the tasks you are given, does anyone have any tips to stand out in a large pool of interns in hopes to receive a post-internship offer?"

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

**Essays**

Common App was definitely the best. Basically, I used chess as a metaphor for my life, had lots of fun with this essay. Stanford IMO had the best supplements, I was able to really showcase my personality! I thought Yale and Princeton were also pretty good, everything else was alright.

**Additional Information:**

Honestly, this admission season was like a roller coaster. In December when I saw my Stanford deferral I was really optimistic. This was mainly because they only defer really strong candidates, so I had high hopes for RD. Unfortunately, I got decimated on Ivy Day. I wasn’t expecting all these rejections and waitlists, especially to some of the ivies which I spent so much time on. Luckily, Stanford came in clutch at the end!"

I'm attracted to the principles behind the idea of decentralised finance and the potential positive impact of the projects in this space.   I also have a keen interested in finance which further reinforced my interest in cryptocurrencies.

I'm just quite lost at the moment on where to start and how to go about doing this so I'd like to ask if any of you who work in this field have any advice or recommendations on it (eg: the different roles possible in the industry, programming languages to develop, books to read, disadvantages of working in this field, is getting internships or work experience possibly in this area, maybe even if you think from what I've said about it sounds like it might not really lie with my interest, any input would be useful really than having nothing to go off at all).

For background I'm currently studying electronics and electrical engineering but hopefully changing over to electronics and software engineering in the next academic year. The ironic catch is I don't actually have much programming knowledge yet, I learned to code in C via my engineering course and went through a Python course with a ""women in STEM"" organisation and work(ed/ing) on some projects, also about to start a Data and SQL course so I am slowly gaining more knowledge and experience in it but it would be ideal if I can switch to electronics and software engineering to be able to dedicate more of my time and learning to programming."

So about a year ago I, a 20 yo student, enlisted for an internship in America. My girlfriend also applied and she was the one who told me to also apply, and we were planning to go together and live there for about three months. 

I live with my mom and also currently work at her firm. She was against this internship, as the pay was minimum wage and she said that my gf brainwashed me into going there and slaving away. I told her that I wanted to do this for the experience, as I've haven't quite traveled outside my country. We had an argument and she told me that she wasn't going to interfere, but wasn't going to help me in any way.

Fast forward to today, I've had some unexpected issues and had to pay about the sum I mentioned in the title. Now I can't afford a plane ticket and the deposit I have to make when arriving in America.

I'm afraid of asking for my mom for help as she'll only try to further convince me to not go, and if I don't go my gf will probably get mad and either have to go alone or not go, because of me.

Is there any way to approach this? I'm planning on telling my mom about this situation but is there a better way to bring it about?

Here is the sixtieth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

mu7dic,5,2021-04-19,How to get out of a sales role?,allosaurus-rex,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mu7dic/how_to_get_out_of_a_sales_role/,"I’m 27 and studied English in college and ended up in a sales role at a tech company.

And I love my company and experienced so much growth and built amazing relationships but now I’m 6 months into the closing role and I’m miserable. 

I’d love to do something project management or even sales enablement or operations related. I might not have the opportunity to do this anytime soon with the company I’m at now since they expect at least 12 months in a role before moving into something else. I’m just not sure my mental health can take another 6 months of this. 

Does anyone have advice on where to even start looking or how I can learn the strategy of getting out of sales? Or how to position it to employers without sounding like I’m complaining or not “hard enough” for sales?"

mu8e3d,1,2021-04-19,Are Anxiety and Insecurity commonplaced in CS? How do people deal with it?,RogerZRZ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mu8e3d/are_anxiety_and_insecurity_commonplaced_in_cs_how/,"So I worked my ass off doing school work and interviewing to get an internship last fall and winter, and now I am still suffering from PTSD and burnout;

&amp;#x200B;

Back then when I was looking for an internship I would wake up every morning and dread about not being able to find an internship; I eventually got one, and thought all my anxiety problems would finally go away. 

That didn't happen. Several months forward (basically now), I would wake up every morning and dread about not being able to find a full-time job to the point I could not find any motivation to do anything else; (I can and do still force myself to work hard and get good grades, but it is just too exhausting)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, despite that I haven't even gotten a job yet and I can envision how life will go for me: 

1. Be anxious about not being able to find a job (not getting interviewed/performance anxiety/etc); 
2. Found a job, be anxious about being fired/piped/replaced, about not following the newest technologies and get replaced, about making mistakes and get piped, etc. 
3. If lost the job, go back to step 1; 

The idea of getting stuck in this loop of anxiety and insecurity just doesn't appeal to me... I want something that is stable, secure, and reliable; 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the fact that I have social anxiety (troublesome upbringing), am INFJ (really easy to be overwhelmed), stutters when anxious (r/stutter), and on F1 Visa in US (H1B lottery even if I can find a job) definitely didn't help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like CS and technologies in CS, I love and isn't bad at coding and building stuff, I do not mind working long hours on things I like (working 14h days isn't uncommon or unenjoyable for me back when my emotional state wasn't a wreck), I don't even mind not having a life outside of work, but I just hate feeling suffocatingly anxious every single day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this experience commonplace in CS? 

(tl;dr) **Can anyone relate or give any advice on how to not be so anxious? Any I overreacting or do I need professional help?**

mu8fi3,150,2021-04-19,My Senior Year Calendar (for all the disorganized juniors or anyone unfamiliar with the process),[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mu8fi3/my_senior_year_calendar_for_all_the_disorganized/,"I'll start by saying I have a sheet of paper in my room with boxes drawn on it, each labeled with a month. August through June. In the boxes are important dates that month, some of which are crossed off with marker. Each month that has passed has an X drawn through it with nail polish (optional) so I can see how close I am to the end and don't lose my mind. On the side: my goals, dreams, accomplishments, and losses this year. The names of people who motivate me, reminders to keep moving, checked off application/admission process boxes, a heart for my late dog and a paw for my new one, and the name of my college. This is just what works for me, but here's my loose unofficial calendar for '26.

**May 2021:**

. Look for SAT dates in your area if your schools require it or you plan to.

. Start asking teachers for letters of recommendation (it helps to know your college list now because some colleges/programs ask for extra letters).*Meet with your counselor if possible to discuss school protocol for LORs and choose teachers who know you well. Ideally, they should be from a class you did well in, where you had a good relationship with the teacher, and one where you were in person if possible. This was always going to be tricky for your class with COVID so check before doing so but you might have to go back to freshman or sophomore year teachers to get great ones (usually something that's almost never done) if you didn't have a great connection this year.*

**June 2021:**. Finalize your college list if you haven't by now (tour campuses if possible, reach out to current students, show demonstrated interest, etc.).

. Search for covid-safe summer activities or internships to bolster your resume before college.

. Start your college essay (and try to finish it before summer ends).

. Continue looking for/taking SATs if applicable.

**July 2021:**

. Work on your college essay and finish it this month if you plan to get a head start on the Common App.

. Keep up with activities and demonstrated interest. Some colleges offer interviews (alumni or sometimes with AOs) at this point so schedule some if possible.

. Continue looking for/taking SATs if applicable.

**August 2021:**

. The Common App usually opens on or around August 1st. If you have the time and have finished your general essay: fill out the general section of the Common App, add your colleges, and even start working on supplemental essays if possible because they'll take a lot of editing. You'll thank yourself later.

. Some scholarships and maybe QuestBridge are open around now? I'm not a QB kid but I know the process starts earlier.

. Continue looking for/taking SATs if applicable.

**September 2021:**

. Keep working on supplements and meet with your counselor if possible to plan out LOR dates, when you'll submit your applications, your complete list, etc.

. Continue looking for/taking SATs if applicable.

**October 2021:**

. This is the earliest I started submitting applications. Make sure you coordinate this with your counselor beforehand, have all your LORs and gave your teachers at least two weeks' notice before writing them, etc.

. Several scholarship early application dates are this month.

. Continue writing supplements and apps especially if you plan to apply ED or EA.

. Continue looking for/taking SATs if applicable.

. The FAFSA opens October 1st. This is your shot at financial aid so grab a parent and figure it out.

. If you submitted your application some colleges now open up alumni interviews to you. Make sure to request one through your portal and check your email and spam for emails from them.

**November 2021:**

. Most ED and EA deadlines are this month. Write down all your dates and continue editing/writing your supplements. DO NOT procrastinate and make sure they're submitted on time.

. Check your email for alumni interview emails if applicable.

. Continue looking for/taking SATs if applicable.

**December 2021:**

. Most ED and EA notification dates are this month! Mark the dates down on your calendar and prioritize your mental health.

. Start supplements for RD applications. Do not procrastinate and especially if you apply to schools with a lot of supps (cough cough Ivies) and/or shotgun, it's a good idea to start these early in the month and not over break. Including if you're an ED applicant.

. Continue looking for/taking SATs if applicable.

. Keep looking out for alumni interviewer emails.

**January 2022:**

. Most RD deadlines are this month. Make a list, stay on top of them, and don't procrastinate.

. Finish any supplements you haven't.

. Keep looking out for alumni interviewer emails.

**February 2022:**

. A couple schools have deadlines this month so make sure your apps are submitted!

. Several ED2 and RD decisions are available this month! Mark down the dates and prioritize your mental health.

. Keep looking out for alumni interviewer emails.

**March 2022:**

. Almost all RD decision dates are this month! Mark them down and prioritize your mental health.

. Start looking for scholarships in your community!

. Keep looking out for alumni interviewer emails.

**April 2022:**

. Attend admitted students events at the schools you were accepted to.

. Some belated RD decision dates are this month! Mark them down and prioritize your mental health.

. Start working on scholarships and applying for them!

. Talk with your family about where you want to go and finaid and commit if possible.

**May 2022:**

. Deadlines to commit are this month! Congratulate yourself on successfully applying to college.

. Work on any belated scholarships/job applications.

. Transfer student decision dates are this month! Mark them down and prioritize your mental health.

**June 2022:**

. Graduate and congratulate yourself on surviving Hell Year."

I’m wondering if it would ever make sense to accept a FTO following an internship and then reneg later if I’m able to find something I’m more interested in? I know people have mixed feelings on this topic (“you don’t owe companies anything” vs “it’s unprofessional”) but my university program has a policy that any student who renegs on an offer will be forced to attend a meeting with the faculty heads, make amends with the reneged firm, etc. Basically, the policy holds that reneging on offers is unprofessional, unethical, and harmful to other students in the program. 

Currently my plan would be to turn down the FTO and pursue other roles, but it’s scary not to have a back-up. 

Any suggestions or insight?"

I currently feel like I have job security (who really knows though) but I also feel like my role is a dead end or will take many years to advance. I'm grateful to still have full time employment with the current job market so I don't want to take that for granted but I feel like I would be stupid to pass up an opportunity that could potentially open many doors. Has anyone been in a similar position? Is there anything else I should take into consideration?
mudy5u,51,2021-04-19,When the Ice Melts,CreepyCollaborative,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mudy5u/when_the_ice_melts/," We need to stop global warming, something evil is thawing out.

I was a climatologist working in the North Pole for the last 4 years, and I quit last week. I just returned to my childhood home in Owatonna, Minnesota, where I’ve moved back into my house. You see, proving that global warming is real was my life’s passion. I’m 32 years old, and I've spent the last 12 years studying patterns of climate and their effect on the Ozone, fighting deniers at every turn. I wanted to be the one to change their minds and get everyone to give a damn about the Earth.

I didn’t find what I was looking for in the North Pole, but I found something much worse. I’m posting this here as a warning of what’s to come if we don’t change things.

My crew consisted of 6 people, myself included. We lived on an arctic barge, designed to house us while we studied various melting glaciers. The captain was known to us as Captain Patches Stacy, of the St. Lucian research boat in the North Pole.

His second in command was a girl I was sweet on. She was only 27 years old, and well on her way to being a ship captain by 30, skilled enough to traverse the frigid waters of the Arctic.

Her name was Stormy, and like the seas she fared, she was volatile and fierce. Her hair was always in a tight strawberry blonde bun, and her eyes carried the blue depth of the ocean that swore to change at every passing wave.

Stormy and I had a budding love, running deep after being together on the St. Lucian for 4 years, only leaving each other's side for the short stints of shore leave, which in the later years were also spent together.

Stormy had no family, so for holiday shore leave, she’d return to Minnesota with me and spend the holiday with my large midwestern family. It always felt like she was meant to be there.

Along with us was another climatologist named Craig, who was 30 years older than me, and somewhat of a mentor. He was the true brains of the operation, and he inspired me every day to continue our journey of learning. Tall, thin and grey, Craig would skulk around the deck in his signature yellow parka and theorize loudly about the things below the water's surface.

We had an intern, a young native Inuit girl, who was about to graduate with a degree in climatology. Her name was Yuka, and she was the bright star that kept those trips fun and positive. Watching her bloom into a gamechanger was truly beautiful.

The final member of our team was an aged crew hand named Hank, who served as our cook and “boat keeper” and, much like patches, he was about as old as the glaciers. Hank was kind though, through and through. He accidentally bulk ordered us girls just about a shipping container worth of feminine products because he wasn’t sure how many we needed.

“Is 100 a week for ya reasonable? I can get more!” I remember him saying, wholesome and kind in his concern.

Their faces will live in my mind’s eye until I draw my last breath on this earth I so love.

The last Saturday of April, 2020 was the end of the life I shared with these people.

We were running our sonar, and had sent a deep water exploration submersible drone we’d nicknamed “Floody Mary” down to map the size of a submerged iceberg, that appeared to be melting at an alarming rate. Luckily, no wildlife at all would come near this iceberg, and I can’t help but feel like that’s because they knew what was inside.

Patches and Hank sat in their “HQ” watching over us while Stormy helped me man the drone, and the sonar. We sat, leg to leg, excited and eager watching the exploration unfold before us. That’s when we heard the Blip.

The sonar Stormy operated shook as it transmitted a deep call, lower and louder than any whale we’d picked up in the past.

“What was that?” I said, looking at Stormy.

“Probably a whale, Vee, nothin' to stress about!” Stormy said with a smile.

“Maybe it’s some kind of geological activity?” Craig said putting a hand on the sonar equipment.

“I read online about noises coming from the Arctic around here. There’s like, a whole conspiracy theory. I didn't really think it was real.” Yuki said, leaning over and looking at the screen depicting Floody Mary’s footage, showing a whole lot of iceberg and not much else.

That’s when the second blip came, this time, so loud we didn’t need the Sonar to hear it, the boat rocked and creaked as the sound pushed it to its limits.

“What was that?” I shouted, holding onto my equipment for dear life.

“I don’t know, but from the sounds of it, it must be massive! Stormy, pull up the equipment, let’s move!” Craig said. He turned to Yuka. “Yuka, I don’t know what this thing is but I want you to get to the communication center and be ready to radio for help.” Then Craig finally settled on me. “Watch the screen with me, let’s try and figure out what this noise is.”

I nodded and watched the drone’s footage as Stormy guided it along the side of the iceberg and up to the boat.

That’s when I saw something in the iceberg move. Sluggish and slow, as the next 'bloop' came, so loud and powerful the boat nearly capsized. My body was thrown with Craig’s to the other side of the deck.

A loud crack signaled something breaking off of the iceberg. When the boat settled, I could hear the screams of Stormy, Craig, and Captain Patches.

I dared a look at the iceberg to see the creature that had been making the noises that were so monstrous as to nearly destroy our vessel, was partially thawed out of his icy cage.

The creature was enormous, as the iceberg was the size of a skyscraper in that cold blue water. It was black like the midnight sky, contrasting the white ice around it. Snow was falling from the sky and forming little constellations on the creatures' void-colored skin. It has one big, yellow, blinking eye and more mouths than I could count, even just on the portion of the creature that was exposed. Each one had different kinds of teeth. Some were dull like human teeth, and some were sharp like lion teeth.

“How is that thing alive?!” I screamed to Craig, who was transfixed on the creature.

Craig looked at me and let out a horrified scream, covering his eyes with his hands.

“It’s horrible! It’s horrible! God, make it stop!” He screamed. Then I heard Yuka over my walkie-talkie.

“I see what’s happening, get Stormy and come to the bridge. Patches and Hank are dead. Over.” I looked around to see Yuka standing in the control tower and Captain Patches dead in his chair behind her, and Hank with a bloodied head leaned against the glass.

My eyes darted around for Stormy, I saw her at the edge of the deck, reaching out to the creature. I ran over to her and grabbed her by the waist, and dragged her to the control tower.

“No! The old one needs me!” Stormy screamed, viciously thrashing about. Luckily, I’m a stout woman and I held her firm. As I approached the doorway leading to the entrance of the control tower, I saw Craig throw himself overboard. I winced and managed to open the door and get Stormy and I inside. As soon as her eyes left the creature, she relaxed and folded into me. She began to sob, and I squeezed her right, shushing her gently.

“Yuka is alive, we can get out of here. Can you please get us out of here?”

Stormy nodded then spoke. “I just can’t see that thing, I need to blind myself.”

“Just get us to the nearest port. Just don't look back at it” I said, prompting a nod from Stormy. I looked around the staircase and found one of the emergency kits, and grabbed it from the wall as Stormy and I raced to the control room.

Yuka snapped her head to us as we entered, and I could see she’d been sobbing.

“I’m so glad you two are safe, I just watch Craig kill himself too.” She said in a shaky voice.

I looked at Patches and Hank. Patches had a 44. Magnum in his hand. He had killed Hank, then himself when he saw this terror.

I opened my kit, pulled out a flare gun, went to the crank window on the side of the control and fired it high into the sky. As I did so, Yuka radioed for help, but quickly said. “Coms are down! Everything is down!”

Stormy made herself busy trying to steer the ship and avoid looking at the creature.

It let out a final 'bloop' that caused everything in the control center to thrash around the small room, throwing all of us off of our feet. I wound up screaming for help underneath a very dead Captain Patches Stacy.

When we resumed our stations, Stormy spoke.

“I'm okay, everything's okay. I'm going to get us out of here.” She said with a firm, determined voice. I wobbled over to Stormy and put a hand on either shoulder, holding her in place.

“You can do this. You are the best navigator I’ve ever seen, Captain Stormy. Get us to the nearest harbor. Don’t look at it.” I said, doing my best to resolve her.

“Dutch Harbor. Dutch Harbor. Dutch Harbor.” Stormy repeated to herself over and over again, as she guided us past the creature, and to safety.

Yuka operated a mapping system the whole way back, and I took the bodies of Hank and Patches to the hull. We all stayed together in control, sleeping there, eating cold meals there, too afraid to leave. Even when the water was calm, it seemed like we’d hear a 'bloop' out of nowhere at any time.

Stormy and Yuka got us to safety. All of our equipment was lost, and all of my research was for nothing, especially with Craig gone.

Stormy and Yuka lied, and told the navy officers that intercepted us that Captain Patches Stacy had snapped, killing Hank and throwing Craig and the equipment overboard. I simply followed along.

Stormy walked away with some kind of maritime medal for her brave actions, and Yuka returned to her home in Vancouver, where she swore she’d resume her studies and dedicate her findings to Craig. We spoke this morning.

I am shell shocked, living in my childhood home with my loving parents doting on me at every beck and call. I see those mouths every time I close my eyes, and I see Craig, jumping to his watery grave.

Stormy is finishing her affairs, and coming here tomorrow. We will start our lives together, as two people who have lived through something terrible but came out alive.

Stormy said we can live far away from the cold and the water, and she swore she’d take me to Albuquerque, where we can live out our days far away from the Arctic melting glaciers.

So here it is, my plea.

Please give a damn about global warming, because there are terrors in those icebergs, things that will consume mankind, and if we don’t stop global warming, they’ll be free in no time."

mueh7n,62,2021-04-19,How to Get an Internship: Step 2 - The Application Process,morenxlife,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/mueh7n/how_to_get_an_internship_step_2_the_application/,"Hi everyone! I got a lot of positive feedback on my last post so here’s the next step in the internship process.


Okay so you’ve gathered all your potential internship/work sites...now it’s time to actually *apply*. 

I understand this can be an incredibly grueling process and industries have totally different standards - for tech they’ll want to see useful projects whereas in the humanities they may be more interested in your writing and research skills - which may add to any confusion. Whatever it is the industry and organization is looking for, make sure to highlight how you meet those needs (even if you feel like you don’t meet all of the qualifications!) by doing thorough research - this will guide how you structure your cover letter, resume, other application materials + what you share in your interview.

Please remember that most students usually apply to tons of internship programs, many receive multiple rejection letters, and none of it is a personal affront. There’s always going to be someone with a better application than you and there’s always going to be someone with a worse application than you, so don’t let this define your self worth or think it’s indicative of how successful you or your career will be. 

If you want to improve, ask for feedback from the hiring committee (but they may not be able to give any), an advisor, or industry professional but *don’t* torture yourself with any mistakes you may have made. 

General Advice:
Double check eligibility! This is especially important if you’re a college freshman, sophomore, or recent grad (1 year or less out of college). A lot of internships have restrictions on who is eligible to apply, which means underclassmen and new grade are frequently excluded (or, are not considered a priority applicant) from the applicant pool. 

Double check the requirements! One of the worst feelings is missing out on a great opportunity over a silly mistake - make sure you know which documents you have to provide for an application and when you to have submit it. It doesn’t matter how great your resume is if you’re missing a letter of recommendation - to keep things fair, a vast majority of companies will automatically decline to review an incomplete application. 

If an organization doesn’t have internship information on their website buuuut you still really want to intern there, you CAN “cold email” (straight up asking if you can intern there while proving a copy of your resume, despite the company lacking a formal internship program). If possible, look for a department specific email or an employee’s email rather a general, company-wide one. This is more likely to work at a small, local company/organization and it’s also more likely this internship will be unpaid. 

If you know someone who has interned there/is interning there or is currently working at your target organization, then ask them questions about the company + application process. They may help, they may not; the conversation may be beneficial, ultimately it might not be - regardless, it doesn’t really hurt to ask (especially for organizations with a giant applicant pool).

Quality over quantity. This may vary upon your field, but applying to dozens of jobs probably means your capacity to research the company and why you want to work there is pretty limited and this subpar work tends to lead to a subpar application. I’ve seen wayyyy too many posts about students applying to 50+ companies, wasting their time and energy. Narrow down your top dozen or so choices and pour energy into creating an application someone will want to look twice. For anecdotal evidence, I applied to 8 internships for Summer, was accepted to 3, rejected by 3, withdrew from 1, and ghosted by 1, giving me a success rate of 37.5% which is pretty decent! 

If you get rejected during one application cycle this doesn’t mean you can’t apply again! I’ve received two acceptance letters and two rejection letters from the same company - if you really want to work there there’s no shame in being persistent. 

Keep your LinkedIn updated! I don’t mean that after every new resume addition you need to create a post that you’re “excited and humbled to accept an offer at Company X,” (though you may be encouraged to by the company itself) but make sure all your accomplishments and descriptions are up to date, all the information on there (including comments you’ve made) are things you are comfortable with an employer seeing, and that you’ve utilized every inch of space LinkedIn provides for an employer to get to know you, your interests, and your goals (especially your Summary and Featured sections, which tend to be woefully underused). 

Utilize LinkedIn’s “Summary” section to create a quick blurb about yourself, your school/your year in school, a bit about your personal background (ex: maybe you’re a proud Minnesotan? A first gen college student?), what you’re studying and how this connects to your interests and career goals, and any additional information you feel is necessary. 

Take advantage of LinkedIn’s “Feature” section to highlight any interesting projects you’d like an employer to learn about, any interesting achievements, (did your school write an article about you for winning an award or scholarship? link it here!) etc.

The Application Process, Step by Step:
(Organizing, Resume/Cover Letter, Letters of Rec., Transcript, Essays, Submission)

	1.	Organizing your applications. It is absolutely IMPERATIVE to keep track of deadlines throughout this process - I cannot stress enough how easy it is to get overwhelmed by school, your job, extracurriculars, and life’s many responsibilities and forget about an application deadline. It doesn’t matter how intelligent, experienced, or qualified you are - if you miss the deadline there is a 99.999% chance they wouldn’t let you turn in an application late. 
	2.	I recommend making a Google Folder where you keep alllllllll your application materials - a document to track application deadlines (a spreadsheet may be best if you’re planning to apply to a lot of companies), standard documents (recent transcript and letters of recommendation IF you are allowed to see your LOR), application questions, cover letters, etc. 
	3.	In the document where you track deadlines, note when you asked people for letters of recommendation, when the recommenders submitter a LOR, when you submitted an application, got rejected, etc. This will allow you to know when to follow up on things (ex: you asked someone a LOR 3 weeks ago and haven’t gotten a response, you can tell based on your deadlines sheet it’s time to follow up) and take the appropriate action. 
	4.	Update your resume (and cover letter, if you use a cover letter template). Your resume is one of the most important - if not the most important - component of your application and can truly make or break an application. If you don’t have one already make a “Master Resume” - this will be a large document (more than one page) that contains all your education, work, leadership, and volunteer experiences + scholarships and awards. After creating a bullet point description for each experience (and it can be several bullet points, the idea is that you can eventually copy and paste different lines to customize your resume for each application), have someone else (preferably an advisor or someone working full time in your industry) review your work and encourage them to be absolutely BRUTAL in their review. It can be a serious ego bruise, but it’s better that they catch it than realize you made mistakes after submitting the application. Repeat this step until you have a Master Resume you’re happy with. Also, make sure to update this regularly (1-2x an academic term and after every new accomplishment). 
	5.	The same principle can be applied to cover letters - create a standard formula or set of topics to cover, then adjust it to fit the organization. 
	6.	After this, you should be able to create a 1 page resume to accompany each application. When the 1 page version is completed, I still recommend having another person double check your work for any grammatical errors or formatting issues. I’m not sure if a “standard resume” format truly exists, since different countries, industries, companies, and hiring managers have their own preferences. As a general rule of thumb, limit the amount of “distractions” (bright colors, images, symbols), use strong, diverse action verbs to describe accomplishments (instead of “wrote” use “composed”), and quantify your experiences (instead of “fulfilled customer orders” write “fulfilled 10,000 customer orders on a weekly basis”).
	7.	If you don’t have a lot of previous internship experience, highlight any projects you’ve completed, completions you’ve won, papers you’ve written, research, leadership, awards, etc. If you’ve had a job before but don’t feel like it’s “relevant” (shoutout to my fellow fast food workers) still include it, but emphasize transferable skills like efficiency and customer service. 
	8.	Ask for letters of recommendation EARLY! I’ve heard 1-2 months is best practice, especially if you’re asking a professor who receives dozens of requests. I recommend doing this right after you’re done making your resume, as many recommenders may ask for your resume or another document to help guide their LOR. Be specific in what you want them to write - if you want to highlight your strong research skills then ask them to do do directly and politely, they’re not mind readers! Give them as much detail as possible about the internship - what company is it at, what are the highlights of the program, what’s the deadline, are there specific qualifications the company is searching for? This is important to know so they can write a thorough letter. Make sure to follow up with them - at the latest - a week before the LOR is due; there have definitely been students who couldn’t complete an application due to a late LOR and it’s a crappy feeling, to say the least.  
	9.	Request your transcript early, especially if the company wants a physical copy of it! At some schools, requesting transcripts can be expensive and time consuming so I recommend getting this out of the way as early as you can to make sure you have the financial resources for it and that it’ll arrive in time. 
	10.	If you’re in an industry that typically asks for essays as part of the application process *cried in humanities major* try to create a standard essay answer for questions like “Why are you passionate about x topic?,” “What are your career goals and how can x organization help you meet these goals?,” “Why do you want to intern for x company?,” “Please write about one major issue and how you envision solving it.” Again, I’m studying political science + environmental policy so these questions tend to be more geared towards humanities major,  but I would venture to say that each industry has a pretty standard set of questions, so find out what they are and be prepared to answer it. Whenever you apply for internships, SAVE all the questions and identify the common patterns - this will save you so much time in the end. 
	11.	Think of the essay/cover letter as a chance to create a strong, cohesive narrative that complements your resume and other application materials. Ultimately, the entire application is a storytelling exercise for the candidate. 
	12.	Group applications in folders based on topics to fill them out even faster. For example, at Companies A - D their internship programs revolve around electoral politics while Companies E - H revolve around climate change; develop a standard answer (using the advice in the previous bullet point) for each topic - electoral politics and climate change - and apply it to the relevant applications. Though still time consuming, it’s easier than developing something totally original each time. For my junior summer internship hunt, I did this and the essay portion of the application process was pretty much a breeze. 
	13.	After you’ve assembled all your application materials, go ahead and have someone double check it again. Yes, the name of the game here is double checking! Again, I recommend an advisor or professional of some type who’s more likely to be brutally (but in a good way) honest with you.
	14.	Make sure to submit it in the correct application portal - even if a posting is shown on a third party website (LinkedIn) they may want it submitted to their own company site portal, to a specific email, etc. Read the instructions! This is basically your first test as an intern. 
	15.	If the portal or individual you are submitting the application to notes that you are supposed to get an email confirmation (this confirms you did actually submit something) then make sure you actually get this confirmation email. If for whatever reason a company says they never received an application for you this is your “receipt.” 
	16.	*Fight* the urge to panic and demand a response from them in one week. Remember that hosting interns is a smalllllll component of an organization’s work. If they have an application timeline (ex: round 1 will be completed by x date, round 2 will be completed by y date) expect them to be late/fall behind. Is it fair that we have to submit everything on time while they may delay the response process? Probably not, but unfortunately, that’s the game. If you have special circumstances where you need to hear back sooner (ex: you’ve received multiple offers), then contact the relevant person but know they may not be able to accommodate you. 

Thanks for reading! I’m still making a Google doc and I’m planning on adding more sections about interviews, choosing the internship that suits you best, etc. :)"

It is absolutely IMPERATIVE to keep track of deadlines throughout this process - I cannot stress enough how easy it is to get overwhelmed by school, your job, extracurriculars, and life’s many responsibilities and forget about an application deadline. It doesn’t matter how intelligent, experienced, or qualified you are - if you miss the deadline there is a 99.999% chance they wouldn’t let you turn in an application late. 
	2.	I recommend making a Google Folder where you keep alllllllll your application materials - a document to track application deadlines (a spreadsheet may be best if you’re planning to apply to a lot of companies), standard documents (recent transcript and letters of recommendation IF you are allowed to see your LOR), application questions, cover letters, etc. 
	3.	In the document where you track deadlines, note when you asked people for letters of recommendation, when the recommenders submitter a LOR, when you submitted an application, got rejected, etc. This will allow you to know when to follow up on things (ex: you asked someone a LOR 3 weeks ago and haven’t gotten a response, you can tell based on your deadlines sheet it’s time to follow up) and take the appropriate action. 
	4.	Update your resume (and cover letter, if you use a cover letter template). Your resume is one of the most important - if not the most important - component of your application and can truly make or break an application. If you don’t have one already make a “Master Resume” - this will be a large document (more than one page) that contains all your education, work, leadership, and volunteer experiences + scholarships and awards. After creating a bullet point description for each experience (and it can be several bullet points, the idea is that you can eventually copy and paste different lines to customize your resume for each application), have someone else (preferably an advisor or someone working full time in your industry) review your work and encourage them to be absolutely BRUTAL in their review. It can be a serious ego bruise, but it’s better that they catch it than realize you made mistakes after submitting the application. Repeat this step until you have a Master Resume you’re happy with. Also, make sure to update this regularly (1-2x an academic term and after every new accomplishment). 
	5.	The same principle can be applied to cover letters - create a standard formula or set of topics to cover, then adjust it to fit the organization. 
	6.	After this, you should be able to create a 1 page resume to accompany each application. When the 1 page version is completed, I still recommend having another person double check your work for any grammatical errors or formatting issues. I’m not sure if a “standard resume” format truly exists, since different countries, industries, companies, and hiring managers have their own preferences. As a general rule of thumb, limit the amount of “distractions” (bright colors, images, symbols), use strong, diverse action verbs to describe accomplishments (instead of “wrote” use “composed”), and quantify your experiences (instead of “fulfilled customer orders” write “fulfilled 10,000 customer orders on a weekly basis”).
	7.	If you don’t have a lot of previous internship experience, highlight any projects you’ve completed, completions you’ve won, papers you’ve written, research, leadership, awards, etc. If you’ve had a job before but don’t feel like it’s “relevant” (shoutout to my fellow fast food workers) still include it, but emphasize transferable skills like efficiency and customer service. 
	8.	Ask for letters of recommendation EARLY! I’ve heard 1-2 months is best practice, especially if you’re asking a professor who receives dozens of requests. I recommend doing this right after you’re done making your resume, as many recommenders may ask for your resume or another document to help guide their LOR. Be specific in what you want them to write - if you want to highlight your strong research skills then ask them to do do directly and politely, they’re not mind readers! Give them as much detail as possible about the internship - what company is it at, what are the highlights of the program, what’s the deadline, are there specific qualifications the company is searching for? This is important to know so they can write a thorough letter. Make sure to follow up with them - at the latest - a week before the LOR is due; there have definitely been students who couldn’t complete an application due to a late LOR and it’s a crappy feeling, to say the least.  
	9.	Request your transcript early, especially if the company wants a physical copy of it! At some schools, requesting transcripts can be expensive and time consuming so I recommend getting this out of the way as early as you can to make sure you have the financial resources for it and that it’ll arrive in time. 
	10.	If you’re in an industry that typically asks for essays as part of the application process *cried in humanities major* try to create a standard essay answer for questions like “Why are you passionate about x topic?,” “What are your career goals and how can x organization help you meet these goals?,” “Why do you want to intern for x company?,” “Please write about one major issue and how you envision solving it.” Again, I’m studying political science + environmental policy so these questions tend to be more geared towards humanities major,  but I would venture to say that each industry has a pretty standard set of questions, so find out what they are and be prepared to answer it. Whenever you apply for internships, SAVE all the questions and identify the common patterns - this will save you so much time in the end. 
	11.	Think of the essay/cover letter as a chance to create a strong, cohesive narrative that complements your resume and other application materials. Ultimately, the entire application is a storytelling exercise for the candidate. 
	12.	Group applications in folders based on topics to fill them out even faster. For example, at Companies A - D their internship programs revolve around electoral politics while Companies E - H revolve around climate change; develop a standard answer (using the advice in the previous bullet point) for each topic - electoral politics and climate change - and apply it to the relevant applications. Though still time consuming, it’s easier than developing something totally original each time. For my junior summer internship hunt, I did this and the essay portion of the application process was pretty much a breeze. 
	13.	After you’ve assembled all your application materials, go ahead and have someone double check it again. Yes, the name of the game here is double checking! Again, I recommend an advisor or professional of some type who’s more likely to be brutally (but in a good way) honest with you.
	14.	Make sure to submit it in the correct application portal - even if a posting is shown on a third party website (LinkedIn) they may want it submitted to their own company site portal, to a specific email, etc. Read the instructions! This is basically your first test as an intern. 
	15.	If the portal or individual you are submitting the application to notes that you are supposed to get an email confirmation (this confirms you did actually submit something) then make sure you actually get this confirmation email. If for whatever reason a company says they never received an application for you this is your “receipt.” 
	16.	*Fight* the urge to panic and demand a response from them in one week. Remember that hosting interns is a smalllllll component of an organization’s work. If they have an application timeline (ex: round 1 will be completed by x date, round 2 will be completed by y date) expect them to be late/fall behind. Is it fair that we have to submit everything on time while they may delay the response process? Probably not, but unfortunately, that’s the game. If you have special circumstances where you need to hear back sooner (ex: you’ve received multiple offers), then contact the relevant person but know they may not be able to accommodate you. 

Thanks for reading! I’m still making a Google doc and I’m planning on adding more sections about interviews, choosing the internship that suits you best, etc. :)"

mugpet,1,2021-04-19,The unfortunate timing of covid has made it difficult for me to expand my resume using my schools resources,QuantumSpecter,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mugpet/the_unfortunate_timing_of_covid_has_made_it/,"I went to a community college first, but they didnt really have a computer science program or stuff like that. So I majored in mathematics and science and completed the classes I needed to earn credits for the CS major of my transfer school, the college I go to currently. Unfortunately, when I started here last semester in the fall and havent even been to campus yet. I was really hoping to use the school as a way to expand my resume, add teams I joined or events I participated in. I dont even know, I just feel like my resume is incredibly lackluster and was hoping that could help.

I see these people on linkedin who go to actual universities, some of which are god tier schools. And their accounts are packed with incredibly interesting things they've done or experience they've gotten. Im a junior and I feel like I got nothing. I dont even feel confident about applying to internships because my resume only has random job experience. Im currently a computer tech but its still nothing much compared to others. I try to do projects but it feels like theres no time. I work part time, I take 5 classes, as soon as I get caught up in my interests, I fall behind and im already a huge procrastinator. I really have no idea what to do to stand out

My original plan since I go to such a basic college, was to do as many internships as possible, small ones even as long as I have experience, make a few significant projects in fields Im interested in, do research with a professor at my school or possibly another if they let me. Try to maintain good grades. Then I graduate, I get a job for two years, go for my masters in either computer science or stats from an actual good university, then try to find work in a more respectable company if I hadn't already. Do you guys have any advice

edit: like look at this womans linkedin [account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicapointing/), absolute god tier. "
mugzl0,3,2021-04-19,I have 9 days to make the biggest choice of my life and it's tearing me apart,girlwithcowpup,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mugzl0/i_have_9_days_to_make_the_biggest_choice_of_my/,"I need help here. I have to choose a college before May 1st and I have never felt more lost, panicked, or depressed in my entire life. 

Background: I (18f) have two parents who went to college and two older siblings who did not. My siblings both have IEPs and college was not particularly stressed in my house as it was difficult for them. I, however, have worked very hard in school. I have a 3.99GPA and plans to be a lawyer. In other words, my parents have not been super helpful in the selection process and I was ambitious. 

I have applied and been accepted to a few different schools (none of my top schools) but that's fine still some good schools. At the moment the two best options seem like a state school right by house or a private school in a city that's about 30 minutes away. Both schools have a 3+3 law program and both would end in me getting a JD from the private school in nearby city. I was leaning towards the private school because it would likely be easier to get internships, a little more prestigious, and would get me away from home. 

The pandemic has changed my whole view on the situation. I am terrified of meeting new people. I'm afraid of moving to a large city. I visited the campus today and just started crying because it is so overwhelming. I have anxiety, an associated sleeping disorder, and as a result peptic ulcers partly from the stress. I feel like moving out will make all of this worse. That being said, I don't want to *not* do something just because I'm scared. 

I understand that making friends on campus and becoming a part of the community can be difficult after your first semester. I'm not sure if I want the college experience anymore. I'm just so lost. 

I would know people at the nearby state school. People from my school go there/ are going there, my boyfriend goes there, and its super close to home so it feels a lot less scary. 

This decision has my parents divided and me in emotional agony. For the past three days I've been crying, I've lost my appetite, I can't sleep, and everything feels impossible. There is no right answer here. Sorry for rambling. Please help."

I NEVER thought I'd be posting a success story, but here we are. I am making 2.5x more than what I was making at my retail job (thank goodness lol), and my job is at a large (and super cool) company as well! To pay it back to this amazingly supportive community, I wanted to talk about my journey in hopes that it may inspire/help some of you who are in the exact same position that I was in a few months ago. **This is a VERY long post.**  


**Background:**  
I studied Architecture in university and worked at the retail store of a large tech company. I've been working there for 4\~ years just to make some money as I went to school. After graduating in June 2019, I decided to not go down the Architecture route, and did a little soul searching to find what creative field I would enjoy more. I ended up deciding on Product Design.   


**The start of my journey:**  
I enrolled in an 8-month long UX design boot camp at the start of 2020. Throughout my boot camp, I continued working at the retail store to continue earning an income. When quarantine came into effect, our company decided to shut down all our stores permanently. Instead of laying us off, they created new ""digital sales"" roles for us. Same pay, same duties, same ""retail"" name, but all online. They also started making us do cold-calling (aka telemarketing) and I. was. depressed.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here's a breakdown of my journey:

**January - August 2020:**

* Immersed myself in the boot camp course. Worked part-time, and studied part-time. There were many days where I was just tired and demotivated, and I had *many* ***many*** lazy days. It wasn't a perfect boot camp, but I learned exactly what I needed to:  
1. Understand the industry and the role, 2. Figure out my weak points, and 3. Identify the next steps in my personal growth/journey.   
I also got to work on a real client project as part of the course curriculum which was cool.

**September 2020:**

* Took this month off. I was exhausted, overwhelmed, lazy, and everything else you can think of. I enrolled in a free professional development program to at least do *something* while I took this time off. 

**October 2020 - first week of December 2020:**

* My professional development program ended in November, but the career counselor kept trying to find me work. She was sending me admin jobs, or sales jobs, but I didn't take them. I wanted a design job, period. I worked on my portfolio for the majority of this time. I hated this process. I kept comparing my work to other people's work on LinkedIn (this made me hate LinkedIn lol), but after 4 iterations of my portfolio, I finally had something that I was proud enough to apply to jobs with. 

**December 2020:**

* Started networking at the beginning of December. I went from 0 networking (I'm shy, awkward, and introverted) to networking with 1-3 people every week in December. My desperation for a job - as well as my desperation to get out of my ""retail"" cold-calling sales job - kicked into full gear and my anxiety towards networking just vanished. I tried to connect with people at my current company who worked on the corporate side and tried to see if I could transition into a Design team. I knew that my chances were *tiny*, but I *at least* wanted to make sure that I took advantage of every. single. possible. opportunity. that. I. could. I started applying for jobs in the middle of December, averaging 3 per week.

**January 2021:**

* After multiple rejections from cold-applications, I knew I had to do more. I continued applying for jobs cold, and signed up for mentorships. I also did a hackathon and joined a team as a designer (this experience made me feel really far behind because everyone was a student and I was already 1.5 years out of school with the same skillset as them). I also found an internship that I was super excited about; spent 4 days on the application, and got rejected. I hated everything, but swallowed the rejection and moved on within 5 minutes because rejection is a part of the process. Finally, I got a call for an interview from one of my applications. I ended up getting rejected, but learned a lot from the interview itself.

**February 2021:**

* I continued cold applying, networking, and learned that you can post on [teamblind.com](https://teamblind.com) to ask for referrals at big companies. I got a few referrals through my networking calls and through websites like Blind, however they all led to rejections. I realized I needed to do MORE, so I applied for volunteer positions everywhere and landed one with a non-profit. I also started applying to youth employment programs in my city (again - I was trying to take advantage of *every* possible opportunity), however I wasn't eligible for their programs. The career counselor from my professional development program back in November reached out with a design job (finally!) and I applied. I also reached out to hiring managers who posted about job openings on LinkedIn and messaged them directly (this is how I got my current job). All of a sudden, almost out of nowhere, I was getting booked for interviews. I had an interview that came from the career counselor, my LinkedIn outreach, as well as my cold-applications - and this all happened out of the blue in the middle of February. I was given an offer at a really early stage startup, but I asked to wait on giving them my decision since I had interviews with *three other companies.*  I ended up rejecting the startup offer without having another offer lined up (SUPER risky, but the pay was too low, and I felt good about the jobs in my pipeline). The two companies that I really wanted to work at had a longer interview process involving take-home assignments, presentations, etc. In my interviews, I talked about my willingness to learn and grow; I was always smiling and laughing at their jokes; and I asked a ton of questions to show my interest. In the end, I was rejected from my #2 choice, and got an offer from my #1 choice!

**March 2021:**

* I told no one about my offer, except for my friend (who was there when it happened) and my boyfriend. I heard so many horror stories of people getting their offers rescinded after the background check, so I waited until everything was finalized. I have been at the job for 3 weeks now as a Product Designer, and I love it :)  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Lessons learned:**

1. Take advantage of every avenue that is available to you. Even if I knew my chances to become a Designer at my old company were 1/1,000,000, I still reached out to just *try.* I also had no shame in reaching out to the youth employment services, or getting involved in different things in order to gain more experience; things like the hackathon and my volunteer experience were invaluable to my growth. 
2. Try to network. I don't just mean asking strangers to chat -- even me messaging the hiring manager about the job they posted on LinkedIn is *technically* networking, and it got me my job! Networking can also be done through engaging in job forums (/jobs on Reddit, [teamblind.com](https://teamblind.com), and [fishbowlapp.com](https://fishbowlapp.com) were the ones I frequented to post for advice and \*try\* to get referrals). I even watched a ton of YouTube videos on ""how to get a job as a designer"" and reached out to those YouTubers on LinkedIn to ask for advice. It seems pointless now, but you learn with every conversation - trust me.
3. Learn how to write a good resume, and learn how to put together a good portfolio (if you need one for your career path). You won't get noticed if your resume can't be parsed through the system. r/resumes and [cofolios.com](https://cofolio.com) helped me IMMENSELY. 
4. Luck plays a HUGE role in getting a job. This is both good and bad. It's bad because you may be the most qualified person for the role, but someone else may get the job instead because of unlucky circumstances. On the other hand, it's good because it sort of levels the playing field. Inexperienced retail workers like me have NO chance getting a job if I were going up against people who studied this stuff in school, but with a lot of luck I was able to get a few interviews and land myself a job anyway.
5. Take breaks. Seriously. My process didn't feel as dreadful because I took care of myself. I took weeks off of doing any design work sometimes, and I spent many days just not doing any job applications because I didn't want to. In the end, I really think that taking care of myself throughout this whole process really did benefit me.
6. At the end of the day, it's all about building your pipeline of jobs. Yes, applying to 100 jobs a day is the main way to do it, BUT you'll notice that my interview opportunities came from that one professional development course that I took; that one hiring manager I reached out to; and the other two were from cold applications. There are numerous ways to build your pipeline -  through networking; getting mentorship; getting involved, etc. These methods may not seem to be direct job applications, but they still increase your chances of scoring some sort of opportunity, and who knows? Your mentor may refer you for a position, your volunteer role may turn into a full time job, or if you're like me, that hiring manager you reach out to might end up hiring you :) 

Lastly, here's the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/queeniedang/Jr-nie-02a9da6ade064ddbac945b47853311ba) where I wrote down what I did every. single. day. from January 1st, 2021 (when I started taking job applications seriously) til' when I got my job in the beginning of March. Read through it to see a day-to-day breakdown if you think that'll help you.

Good luck everyone ❤ You ***can*** do it, I promise."

I'm an absolute beginner at coding and am a senior in high school. Right now, I'm learning Java using GATech's course on edX.

For insight, my goal is to secure an internship during the summer after freshman year college for financial reasons. I was doing research and found that Hackathons count as good experience to have on your resume and to develop as a programmer. I was wondering which topics I would need to learn to attend a Hackathon and actually make contributions to the final product? Is it feasible for me to learn the necessary skills in time to attend a Hackathon during this coming summer?

If it isn't too much to ask, what are some general topics I would need to learn before I could go into an interview for an internship? Would it be feasible for me to learn how to do easy Leetcode questions by August? What about medium?

I'm inexperienced and I don't really have anyone in my life to guide me; however, I'm very motivated and willing to exploit online resources to work towards my goals. The problem is, there are so many different ways to learn online that it doesn't offer the same reassurance in pacing that a school brings.

If you want to know how inexperienced I am, I don't even know how users can interact with Java or code in general, so treat me like someone who doesn't know anything. Thank you in advance.

Feel free to recommend other courses on edX that I could learn alongside with or after I'm done with the edX Java course. If you want any clarifications or you want to clear up any misconceptions I have, please feel free."
mulpw0,46,2021-04-20,Places to look for good internships ?,rantthrowawayforreal,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/mulpw0/places_to_look_for_good_internships/,"I have been trying to look for frontend/web development internships in Linkedin, hirist, and AngelList but the market is so bad that most of the companies are offering peanuts and potatoes. I lowkey feel exploited while applying to such jobs, including the fact that some of the job descriptions still ask for being an expert in old libraries. 

Also, it sucks donkey balls to get shortlisted into some startups, only to get asked ML and other off-topic questions or a ML-based take home assignment for the required internship. I'm applying specifically to frontend engineering positions because I wanna become an expert in that area, but judging by these startups, they tryna get the whole engineering department from a person. It legit feels like they are using the pandemic to exploit as much as possible, whereas CS as a whole has flourished in this pandemic.   


At this point, I feel like contributing to major open source projects is the only way to improve but I wanna earn some money so that I can get out of my home after taking my vaccine shots (been stuck for the last 10 months). Is there any better platform to get good internships or does anyone have any leads where any unicorn staged startups are looking for frontend interns (React, Typescript, D3)?"

I really want to get a masters degree because I want to give research an honest shot and almost half the credits for the Masters in CS are research based."

He started in 2015 but was held back due to failing subjects. Since then he hasn't worked a outside of holiday work which he only did once around Christmas and has been receiving money from the government and our parents to pay for rent and food. 

He seems to lack motivation to become an active member of society and though he claims he's been applying for jobs somehow hasn't managed to land one in so long. I can't help but worry this will negatively affect possible future employment and he hasn't applied for graduate programs nor did he do internships when was still studying. He spends all his time in his room on his computer or playing video games, rarely cooks and only cleans when required.

He's been to a GP and wasn't diagnosed with a mental health issue but I genuinely don't believe that to be the case. If there's something going on I think it would be best for him to get the professional help he needs but he almost refuses to open up. 
Our parents are at their wits ends with the situation because they want to retire soon and can't keep supporting him financially and our Mom is worried he's suicidal. 

I really don't know what to do anymore. Our parents are trying to carefully push him into finding a job but he closes off really quickly and gets quite defensive. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and can see some of my traits in him. 

So should I be worried? Does he possibly have an undiagnosed condition that is affecting him? 
What's the next step I should take? All I can think of is booking him to see a psychologist and going from there.

Assuming costs are the same, which school should I pick? I'm fine with working in either coast, and I also want to keep my options open in terms of maybe going into fintech/tech.

My initial plan is majoring in CS/Applied Math for both schools (maybe Haas business for Berkeley) to keep my options open for finance/quant/tech.

Here are just some pros/cons off the top of my head:

**UC Berkeley Pros:**

\- ""No-brainer"" if I want to keep my options open in terms of tech

\- Better location (SF), so easier access to internships, etc.

\- More established opportunities for finance/entrepreneurship in general

**UC Berkeley Cons:**

\- Large school, competitive, very rigorous, my friend at Berkeley summed up this way: ""Some of the cons of Berkeley relative to JHU is that it’s academically very rigorous and with a large number of students, you will find a group of students who are hyper-competitive.""

\- Lower overall prestige

\- CS is an impacted major so I might face difficulties getting into classes I want, and Haas business is still pretty competitive to get into, so nothing is guaranteed in terms of major.

**JHU Pros:**

\- Smaller, more tight-knit, easier access to faculty

\- Higher overall prestige

\- I can do any major I want/double major very easily

**JHU Cons:**

\- Definitely not ranked as high for CS/tech

\- Location not that great comparatively

I'm also on the waitlist for Columbia, Cornell, and Duke, so if I get off any of those, I'll probably go to one of them. Thank you again for your help!"

I thought that I would create some Android apps or some beautiful websites but I have done literally nothing on it.

I feel stuck when I work on my desktop since it is not portable. A classmate of mine had a laptop and he bought it at the same time I bought my desktop and now he doing an internship and I haven't been able to get any because of less skills.

The only mistake I think I did was I took suggestion of two of my classmates who already had laptops before me and there laptops were insanely slow because of HDD and old processors. They suggested me to go for desktop and I thought it was right.....

I also live in a toxic family, no friends, dad got no job and currently struggling with finances to complete my master's in CS.

In the last two years, I have observed that I have primarily interests in web development.

and to put things simply, i am going fucking insane.

ive never been someone who's homesick easily but covid drove me insane, folks, balls to the wall insane. i open google maps just to look through the streets in my hometown. saving up just so i can order my country's food with jacked up prices. starting to grow some irrational hatred towards locals too bc of how lonely i feel being in a foreign environment. it never crossed my mind how alienating it would feel to be an immigrant. im sick of speaking fucking english every fucking day. im sick of feeling stupid bc of my accent. sick of feeling like an idiot for missing local in-jokes. sick of being left out bc im different. fuck.

and christ, im interning right now and trying to get a job to get my work pass so i can work here to pay off my student debt, n thus, ive been working desk job 9-7 for four months now. and. holy fuck. i know everyone is saying the whole spiel of capitalism sucks, capitalism this capitalism that....

and the worst thing is this: the sheer LONELINESS of adulthood. and you know what, i feel that its super unfair that no one warned us about this. about the fact that i am my own fucking zookeeper. that i have to feed myself. shower myself. keep myself in check so i dont decide to fuck it all to hell and drink bleach. like, holy fucking hell, i have to take care of ME? the suicidal maniac that's been ruining my life.... ME? its fucking crazy. like, excuse me, there is no transitionary period. i went to this country as a teenager taking my fucking diploma and then BOOM COVID and suddenly im of adult age and i have a fucking savings account???????????? HELP WTF IS THIS? someone asked me what my plans are for a future and when im getting a house......... ARE YOU INSANE? i dont even know what to have for DINNER. friend, i might jump off the window before seven pm, and you are asking me where i see myself in the FUTURE???? gee, i dont know joshua, seven feet under maybe? GET REAL.

its getting bad. its getting real bad. there is one way out, as we all know. and goddammit, i really feel like... if only, if ONLY i could get the reward of going home. if only i could see my little sister, cut fruits with my dad, eat my mom's cooking..... if only i could have that, then maybe, MAYBE i could go through this. maybe i really could handle this, because i know that i will go home in the end. 

and because of covid, because of this fucking global disaster, i cant even have that. i am tortured with the knowledge that i CANT do that. that i CANT see my loved ones, till god knows when, that EVERYTHING IS OUT OF MY CONTROL. i cant go home. i want to die, but i think i want to go home more.

I've found a lot of jobs that sound interesting on the surface but from my experience with internships and jobs, job listings are almost always not descriptive of what you'll be doing in your day to day. 

I've tried reaching out to people on LinkedIn about their jobs and how they got there but I'm pretty sure I either come across as annoying or people just have better things to. I've looked around on different subreddits and have found some good info about what certain careers are like but some of the things I'm interested in are too specific and it's hard to find people's experiences.

I've always liked the idea of shadowing someone in a position for a couple of days (although it may be a while before people are okay doing this again) but don't really know how to go about asking people to add to their workload and show someone what they do. I'm really just trying to find out how I can get more first-hand knowledge about what a job or career is really like because I'd rather have that knowledge beforehand rather than having to go through the whole hiring process multiple times just to find something I can live with.

On the other hand I have an offer for a cloud based internship and part of their assessment had coding and IQ test style questions. 

I think this would be a sign of how challenging the internships would be however the insurance company pays slightly better and they are both mostly remote. Not a lot of in-depth reviews are available online for these software positions but they’re both larger companies."

I have absolutely no idea what to do.

I have dabbled in multiple areas of software development and programming languages - web dev, mobile dev, game dev, desktop dev...JavaScript, C#, Python, PHP, Flutter/Dart, Java, and more. The one thing I know is this...I don't like web dev.

In 2018 I completed a Springboard level 7 ordinary degree in digital design, and a year ago I completed a full time level 6 higher certificate in software development, receiving distinctions in both.

However, both courses were very poor from a syllabus point of view - they both felt like level 5 courses at best instead of 6/7!

For example, our final project for the level 6 course consisted of developing a Windows Forms shop inventory application which connected to a local SQL database. Basically a Windows 95 application! We  didn't cover any frameworks, no modern stuff whatsoever. C#, Java, a bit of SQL, project management,  leadership, a couple of MTA certs.

The level 7 was even worse. It consisted of a bit of UX/UI design, graphic design, and front end web development. Literally how to install Photoshop/Illustrator and a description of what some of the buttons do, and some - basic - design theory. The web dev part literally consisted of 30 minutes worth of JavaScript lectures...plus a bit of Bootstrap and HTML/CSS. A joke of a degree!

I have been attempting to learn all the extra stuff on my own ever since finishing the level 6 a year ago. Udemy courses etc. I was attempting before I applied for it too, as I felt I needed the guidance and classroom-based aspect of a course to learn it all - which I did - but now I need guidance again and I feel I am going in absolute circles in tutorial hell. I have toyed with the bootcamp option (which I think would suit me well), but they all teach web dev, not to mention the cost...and my extremely skeptical opinion on courses given my past experiences.

I am also currently working on a software side project, for which my business partner and I have a pre-alpha in development, and are applying for grants. I have been acting as head of product for that, doing everything from coding, design, and business stuff. I have loved every minute of this, and I now feel that I would like to go into software product management as I feel it suits my ""techy jack of all trades with an eye for user and business needs"" experience. However, I have nothing to show for it portfolio-wise as the project is under NDA. And there are literally no product management courses in Ireland I can do. everything I know about it has been a case of ""learning it as I go"".

I am also in the job market as the side project is an on-going thing in the background. So far my job search has been in vain, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. I have, however, recently secured a temporary ""semi-tech"" job to keep me going for the next few months. But I urgently need advice on my long-term plan. My confidence is extremely low at the moment, and I need to get the ball rolling.

My portfolio consists of a mixture of development and design projects. Several languages/frameworks/platforms (web, mobile, game, etc.) - but they are all pretty basic and I do not possess the skills required to develop that one large project that's seemingly required to be considered for a job.

I do not know how to even get the skills as there are no good tutorial courses online (outside of web dev ones, of which I've found many!) that guide you from start to finish. You know, Udemy bootcamp course kind of stuff. .NET courses for example are much too fragmented, with bits of videos here and there on how to do one particular thing - I need focus and guidance. You could say hand-holding at this stage. But frankly, I don't even know if I even want to focus on .NET, Flutter, game dev, or even coding at all anymore and go with product management instead! I have applied for many coding and even some product management jobs - no luck with any of them.

I did an internship in a local small yet high-end bespoke software company as part of my level 6 and my boss/company director/boss said he was extremely impressed with me, particularly with my ability to learn things quickly which apparently took me weeks when other interns he had in the past apparently took 6 months. Unfortunately, the internship was cut short due to Covid, and I was not a fan of their tech stack (web) - although they made great things with it! But while I was there I didn't mind and was happy to learn - but at least I had the guidance and mentorship of my boss.

I would greatly appreciate if someone could do a call with me on Discord or whatever to discuss and advise some potential options. Looking for a 1-1 chat. PM me if you feel you can help. Thank you!"

I am also currently working on a software side project, for which my business partner and I have a pre-alpha in development, and are applying for grants. I have been acting as head of product for that, doing everything from coding, design, and business stuff. I have loved every minute of this, and I now feel that I would like to go into software product management as I feel it suits my ""techy jack of all trades with an eye for user and business needs"" experience. However, I have nothing to show for it portfolio-wise as the project is under NDA. And there are literally no product management courses in Ireland I can do. everything I know about it has been a case of ""learning it as I go"".

I am also in the job market as the side project is an on-going thing in the background. So far my job search has been in vain, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. I have, however, recently secured a temporary ""semi-tech"" job to keep me going for the next few months. But I urgently need advice on my long-term plan. My confidence is extremely low at the moment, and I need to get the ball rolling.

My portfolio consists of a mixture of development and design projects. Several languages/frameworks/platforms (web, mobile, game, etc.) - but they are all pretty basic and I do not possess the skills required to develop that one large project that's seemingly required to be considered for a job.

I do not know how to even get the skills as there are no good tutorial courses online (outside of web dev ones, of which I've found many!) that guide you from start to finish. You know, Udemy bootcamp course kind of stuff. .NET courses for example are much too fragmented, with bits of videos here and there on how to do one particular thing - I need focus and guidance. You could say hand-holding at this stage. But frankly, I don't even know if I even want to focus on .NET, Flutter, game dev, or even coding at all anymore and go with product management instead! I have applied for many coding and even some product management jobs - no luck with any of them.

I did an internship in a local small yet high-end bespoke software company as part of my level 6 and my boss/company director/boss said he was extremely impressed with me, particularly with my ability to learn things quickly which apparently took me weeks when other interns he had in the past apparently took 6 months. Unfortunately, the internship was cut short due to Covid, and I was not a fan of their tech stack (web) - although they made great things with it! But while I was there I didn't mind and was happy to learn - but at least I had the guidance and mentorship of my boss.

I would greatly appreciate if someone could do a call with me on Discord or whatever to discuss and advise some potential options. Looking for a 1-1 chat. PM me if you feel you can help. Thank you!"

I'm currently a second year studying compsci and I am strongly considering going to grad school for a masters, and I have a few questions on what to do to get a strong application. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give some context, I currently go to a top 10 Computer Science School. One of the schools in this list: UMich, UIUC, GT, UMD. I currently have a 4.0 GPA. I've done an internship during Fall and Spring of my Sophomore year (I did part time in Fall for school, Spring I didn't take any classes but I can still graduate in 2023 Spring on time). I will also be going to a FAANG-tier company during my sophomore summer as a SWE intern.

For those curious however, feel free to stalk my previous reddit posts (although I'm in a bunch of random communities that aren't just CS).

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how important is research for applying to grad school? I hear it's very important but I'm not sure how I can fit it in to my school schedule. I only have 1 summer left, and right now I'm leaning towards dropping it on another FAANG/current FAANG return offer or test out the IB world. I also have the option of doing some undergraduate research during the school year, but I'm currently involved in a startup that seems to be going rather well, and I want to stay with them during my 3rd year.

To give some context, since I am fortunate enough to go to a very solid school for CS, I intend to apply to my school's masters program (the reqs for that are not that hard to meet, I'd imagine that I would get in), and then throw hail maries to UCB, Harvard (?), CMU, and Stanford. For these tiers of schools, how important would research experience be? Would having strong internships and demonstrating that I am doing plenty of computer science outside of school (genuinely because I enjoy computer science, both the dev and theory side of it) be strong enough to have a good shot at the list of schools I would try to get into?

I’m currently 24 years old, single, and living at home with parents. Graduated with a bachelors in computer engineering in dec 2019, and have been working ever since making a salary of about 62K in Montreal. I have savings built up from working several internships back while I was in university, as well as the past year I’ve been working full time. I’m currently sitting at $80K with no debt, 40k of which is currently saved and invested in a TFSA (almost entirely VEQT) and I don’t want to touch until retirement, and another 40k sitting in cash between a savings account and an RRSP with questrade, that I’m planning to eventually use as a down payment on my first condo/home.

Long story short, parents are getting divorced and selling the house, and both of them will be forced to either rent or buy a place. Which leaves me with a couple of options. The thing about my parents, is that they are the type that would never want to see me move out, and I have a good relationship with both of them. Had we continued to keep the house, I probably would have stayed at home and saved a couple years before moving out in my later 20s, or until I meet someone I would want to buy a place with.

With the situation I am faced with now though, I have to decide whether or not I should try and look into renting and/or buying my own place for the first time with my $40k, or, both of my parents have offered that they wouldn’t mind buying a slightly larger condo or even a duplex to live in with them. I’m just not really sure what path to take."

Lately, I've been publishing lots more essay guides and tips for grad applicants, but it seems a lot easier if I just post them here (where you guys have been so incredibly awesome and responsive). So, if you're wondering how some students earned insane results in this tricky, difficult, hyper-competitive 2020-21 application cycle, I hope the following stories will give you some inspiration and action-strategies. 

-----

Some grad applicants are different. While others seem stressed, overwhelmed, and anxious they won’t get accepted anywhere, some folks breeze through the process like it’s nothing. These astoundingly successful grad applicants often earn double-digit admissions. They receive scholarships. And all the while they stay calm and composed, confident in the uniqueness of their destiny.

Makes you jealous, huh? It makes me jealous too.

Actually, I’m lucky to have known a number of these superstars, both as students and friends. Yet, they probably aren’t who’d you’d expect them to be. Sure, a few were 4.0 geniuses with stunning research credentials – the kind who cure cancer and locate hidden black holes in their free time. Others, however, were far more normal. 3.5 GPAs. State universities. No research or extracurriculars to speak of (or just normal internships).

Who were these rock stars? Well, just to name a few…

* A Master’s in Health Administration applicant, an international student, who was admitted to 7 of 8 schools and received a full scholarship from a Top-5 program.
* A hard-science PhD who was admitted to 19 of 20 schools. (No joke.)
* A Master’s in Computer Science applicant who was admitted to all 5 programs he applied to.
* A neuroscientist who received interviews from 10 of 12 PhD programs, interviewed at 7, and was admitted to 5 in the most difficult admissions cycle ever.
* Another MHA student who was offered admission and a huge scholarship in his first Zoom interview.
* And of course, Pranava, an engineer [whose SOP I’ve already gushed over](https://writeivy.com/the-sop-for-schools-in-europe-and-canada-a-rock-star-success-story/).

In getting to know these students, I’ve noticed very distinct patterns in how they approached their applications. The similarities are striking, and I wish I could teach ALL of my students to be like these superstars.

That’s why I’ve compiled this list. So you can start working in the relaxed but focused way the most successful grad applicants do.

**HABIT #1: BE PROACTIVE IN REACHING OUT TO TARGET PROGRAMS**

When I started talking to JZ (the MHA student above), she made me feel lazy. 

It was the summer before her senior year at a Top-100 US university. She’d been a pretty good student, but as an international, she’d had some trouble adjusting in freshman year. Her GPA was good, but not astounding. Also, she had this curious predicament: she was applying to Health Administration programs, but her major was completely different – Gender Studies, which she didn’t love. She had picked up a Healthcare minor though, and taken a handful of CS classes, and had one solid internship at a Medical Tech company in her home country. So, I thought she was in fairly good shape.

Little did I know, she was in *amazing* shape.

During the previous spring and summer, JZ had systematically contacted every school on her list. She’d signed up for every mailing list. She’d attended the earliest admissions webinars. One school suggested she enroll in their Healthcare Leadership summer enrichment program, and she did so immediately. She even visited three of these schools of Public Health afterward, choosing them because, in her words, “the coordinators were really cheerful and charming.”

Throughout that fall, whenever JZ had a question about a school, she never bothered asking me. She’d call the program coordinators directly. And they were happy to talk. They told JZ very pointedly which aspects of her admissions profile were weak, and exactly what she needed to do to improve them.

And she did. She improved them all, boosting her GRE and taking an extra class in Data Analysis.

In the end, she was admitted to 7 of 8 highly competitive programs, one of which gave her a full scholarship. The lone straggler made her laugh. It was the only school where she hadn’t taken the time to speak to the department directly.

**Lesson:**

Reach out to your target programs as early as possible – ideally 1 year before you apply. Attend their webinars. Get to know them. Don’t be afraid to pick up the phone. If you have questions, don’t ask a bunch of us anonymous goons on Reddit or GradCafe. Ask the admissions coordinators themselves. They want to hear from you, and it’s better to be at the top of their mind than to be a faceless name at the bottom of the application pile.

**HABIT #2: TURN WEAKNESSES INTO STRENGTHS**

As an undergrad Biology major, Dave took a handful of computer science classes and discovered that he absolutely loved them. Data analysis was particularly intriguing. Yet, with only one semester left, Dave had a problem: he didn’t have time for a double major, and he didn’t have the prerequisites to apply to master’s programs. He was in a kind of “no man’s land.”

Yet, Dave didn’t logon to social media and ask: “Are my credentials enough to get into grad school?” He already knew the answer. No. He wasn’t good enough, especially with his unremarkable 3.4 GPA. But, this is why I love Dave: he didn’t let these obstacles stop him for a minute.

Instead of shotgun-blasting applications and “hoping” someone would see his potential, Dave gave himself two years to become a supremely qualified computer scientist.

Immediately after graduation, he signed up for a 6-month Data Science Bootcamp at a local university. There, he learned Python, JavaScript, R, SQL, tableau, and bash.

Afterward, while working full-time, Dave enrolled in community college night school. Earning an A.S. in Computer Science, he studied computer architecture and assembly, data structure and algorithms, object-oriented design, and more. He earned perfect grades all the while.

Even so, Dave still didn’t feel like he was competitive as he needed to be. He wanted to study in a top CS master’s program, after all.

So, while he continued working full-time, he took online classes through Datacamp and Dataquest. He also took a weekend job at a tutoring center, where he taught programming, data visualization, and analytics to employees from the same companies where he hoped to work in the future.

After two years, Dave applied to 5 of the top-10 master’s programs in Computer Science. He was admitted to them all. Now, as a full-time graduate student, Dave thinks his life is remarkably easy. “I don’t know what to do with all of these nights off,” he laughed.

**Lesson:**

Don’t hope. Don’t feel like you have to rush into grad school. Instead, determine exactly what your weaknesses are and eliminate them. If your GPA isn’t stellar, take night classes and earn straight As. If you don’t have the lab or clinical skills, sign up for an [NIH training program](https://www.niams.nih.gov/labs/career-development-outreach/student-research-training). If you need to brush up your coding competency, enroll in a free bootcamp like [App Academy](https://open.appacademy.io/) or study for a [Google certification](https://grow.google/certificates/#?modal_active=none). With a little time and effort, you can become a rock star. This is about building a career after all, and grad school is only one step in the journey.

**HABIT #3: ASK BIG (HUMANISTIC) RESEARCH QUESTIONS**

In [this article](https://writeivy.com/the-sop-for-schools-in-europe-and-canada-a-rock-star-success-story/), I already discussed how one high-achieving engineer dealt with that all-important aspect of the SOP – elaborating a scholarly purpose. As she said to me:

“…you inspired me to formulate a research question. I read a ton of papers in my field of interest and was able to identify gaps in current research. I, then, came up with possible solutions to tackle those issues. You’ve no idea the kind of confidence boost I got knowing that I’m able to ideate and identify issues.”

This student spent over 400 words describing her research questions in detail. She explained how they’re related to overarching societal concerns – how they’re important to real people. She highlighted current research problems. She explained potential solutions she’d like to explore, and most importantly, she explained exactly how her target programs would allow her to do this.

She was admitted to 7 programs, and her experience is not unique.

Just yesterday, I received an email from a student who was admitted to 5 PhD programs in the 2021 cycle. This was the most difficult year in admissions history, and she was a magical success. When I re-read her SOP, the reason was obvious.

After explaining how she developed her neuroscience focus through two years of lab work, Martina wove all the threads together. She explained how her own experience as an athlete, her double-major in philosophy, and her deep work in neural regulation of metabolic development forced her to ask big questions about the obesity epidemic in America. By linking these specific research questions to larger public health issues, and highlighting exactly how professors at her target universities were approaching these problems, Martina proved that she understood exactly why their research is important. And she was rewarded for it big time.

**Lesson:**

At both the master’s and PhD level, successful applicants ask big questions and prove they understand how problems get solved – with many teams of researchers working step-by-step. Study papers in your field of interest. Study current research at your target schools. Identify obstacles. Don’t propose solutions (you’re not a PhD yet). But, do prove that you’re willing to work with other dedicated scholars to solve the incremental problems that already exist.

**HABIT #4: BE EARLY, ORGANIZED, AND SYSTEMATIC WITH YOUR APPLICATIONS**

This should be obvious, but I can’t repeat it enough. When I look over all the super-successful grad applicants I’ve known, all of them applied very early. Usually they finish the entire process two months before the deadlines.

Seriously, it pays to be early. Just ask Kyle, an MHA applicant who finished his applications in mid- October, when the deadlines were January 15th. On October 28th, he emailed me to say that he’d been offered admission right smack in the middle of his Zoom interview with a top-10 program. By that point, 90% of applicants hadn’t even finished their SOPs.

Or, we could learn from JZ above, who submitted every one of her applications within 2-3 days of the portals opening.

Or, you might learn from Nina, a Biostatistician who came to me 5 months before deadlines with an intensely detailed spreadsheet of application requirements for all her target schools. (And, not to mention, intensely detailed notes on Structure is Magic!) She submitted her applications 3 months early, and was admitted to both the 1st- and 2nd-ranked schools in her field, along with a whole slew of others.

Actually, I could probably change this habit to “use oddball spreadsheets to track your applications.” I don’t get it myself. Spreadsheets give me nightmares. But whenever a student contacts me months early with a meticulously cultivated Notion roadmap, I know I’ve got a rock star on my hands.

**Lesson:**

Don’t wait until the last minute. Or the last month. Or the last two months. Start planning your applications one year early if possible. Collect the deadlines, contact info, and last year’s essays prompts in a Google Doc. Call up the departments to see if they expect any changes for the coming year. Give yourself a whole summer to contemplate the essays. No one ever achieved huge success by scrambling across the finish line at the last minute.

**HABIT #5: BE INCREDIBLY DETAILED ABOUT WHY YOU’RE APPLYING TO EACH SCHOOL**

This might be the underlying theme of all my SOP advice. Whenever I read essays written by amazingly successful grad applicants, they all dive deep (and I mean deep) in their Why This Program section.

I’ve already discussed HOW to do this ([here](https://writeivy.com/the-one-thing-you-should-do-right-now-to-improve-your-grad-school-sop/) and [here](https://writeivy.com/writing-about-professors-in-your-sop-dont-screw-it-up/)). But it’s probably more inspirational to see what the most successful grad applicants accomplish when they really go deep.

When I first encountered Stephanie here on /r/gradadmissions, she’d already achieved insane results. She’d been admitted to 19 of 20 PhD programs in an intensively competitive natural science.

So, why did she seek me out?

Because she had no idea why she’d succeeded so wildly.

She sent me her SOP and asked if I could tell her what “worked.” And, it was funny. Stephanie’s SOP didn’t exactly follow the template I recommend in Structure is Magic and the SOP Starter Kit. It was kind of upside down.

BUT. It did two things that were remarkable.

First, she spent a whopping 500 words detailing her research interests (see Habit #3 above). Honestly, her experience was fantastic – she’d done tons of research. But more importantly, she didn’t just describe the research she’d done in the past. Instead, she constantly related those experiences to the big questions she wanted to pursue as a PhD. It wasn’t about her past experience. It was about her future research interests.

Then, in the coup de grâce, Stephanie wrote an additional 200 words in which she explained exactly how EACH school would allow her to pursue her interests. This paragraph was dense and tight. Her deep familiarity with her target program shimmered. She mentioned three potential PIs. For each, she wrote 2 insightful sentences. She didn’t just mention their research specialties. Instead, she talked about novel techniques they’d used in recent projects, and how those techniques could be used in her own proposed research. She showed that she’d spent a LOT of time reading her target PIs work, understanding it, and visualizing what it meant for her own future at the school.

I can’t fathom the amount of time Stephanie took to do this research for 20 schools. (Habit #4!) But, it paid off. I’ve never met nor heard of another student who achieved such remarkable success.

**Lesson:**

Now, I believe this is the single most important key to becoming a successful grad applicant. Spend as much time as necessary figuring out exactly how and why a program is perfect for you. When you’re explaining “Why this program?” don’t just flatter them. Don’t say they’re great. Look at the curriculum. Look at the professors. Plan out exactly what you want to achieve, and explain how this program will help you achieve it. If you’re unsure how, [read this](https://writeivy.com/writing-about-professors-in-your-sop-dont-screw-it-up/).

**CONCLUSION**

Success leaves clues, as the wise sages tell us. In my experience, those clues manifest as these 5  habits:

* Be proactive in reaching out to target programs
* Turn weaknesses into strengths
* Ask big (humanistic) research questions
* Be early, organized, and systematic with your applications
* Be incredibly detailed about WHY you’re applying to each school

If you can employ these habits and strategies in your own applications, I have no doubt you’ll succeed the same way all of these rock stars did. 

Thanks for reading. If you enjoyed this, you might consider my [admissions newsletter](http://writeivy.com/sop-starter-kit/). I write a weekly email full of practical grad app advice like this, and you get a free and incredibly detailed “SOP Starter Kit” just for signing up.

muzs0q,8,2021-04-20,Is a graduate degree required for ML?,asdfsflhasdfa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/muzs0q/is_a_graduate_degree_required_for_ml/,"Hello everyone,

I am 2 years into my career out of undergrad and I have been working as a research engineer in applied CV work. My day is spent reading papers, implementing models/ideas from papers, engineering pipelines, etc etc. I am also doing my masters degree at night and in the off hours at work, but it is expected to take 3 years. It is honestly exhausting having no free time out of work, and I still have most of the degree to finish. 

I feel that I have great experience with a decent amount of accomplishments. I've worked on my own contracts as the sole ml engineer, built up internal tools for the team, and lead interns and junior level engineers on tasking. However, everywhere I have applied recently has turned me down before I get an interview! All of the established companies want 2+ years of experience on top of a graduate degree, or 5+ YOE without one (if they even consider you). 

Should I really expect to work at my same company for 5+ years if I didn't want to finish my masters? Everyone says that experience trumps education, but even with what I considered good experience, I can't get any jobs that I would like.

Edit:

I have a good job that I really enjoy as an ml engineer, but for the sake of my career I don’t want to stay there forever and would like to switch it up. But I am worried that I may have just gotten lucky with my first job"

I have always been a shy and introverted person, So I haven't been the life of the party, ever. And I still am not. But after the pandemic started, things have gotten much worse. 

I have been trying to look for a job or an internship for so long, but I just cannot bring myself to apply for one because I know I will get rejected. I barely have any experience and I am horrible at interviews. I don't know what happens when I walk into an interview, I just completely blank and get so nervous that I say all the wrong things despite how much I prepare for it. 

Schools about to end soon and ppl around me are getting jobs, internships and research position and I have been ghosted by the small number of jobs that I did manage to apply for. 

I feel like I am not meant to go anywhere in life. The only thing I am good at is studying and doing well on tests and exams and even that, I have been slipping on. Ever since online school started, I feel like I have really dropped the ball on this. I went from taking 3-4 courses in high school to 5-6 in uni that are far more loaded than before and I just can't do this anymore. 

I went into engineering thinking the job prospects for this field would be better, but so far, things are looking up for only those around me. Not for me at all. Like I am not a lazy or a bad employee. All my exployers liked me and my work ethics. My teachers in high school were always impressed by my performance, but I don't know why I cannot get my interviewers or those reading my resume to think the same. I feel like I am going to graduate with no job and no experience and have to be the overqualified person working a blue collar or some average low paying job for the rest of my life. If this is what my life is going to be like, then I don't want it. I just want it to end right now."

Need advice on this situation I am in at my job. 6 months ago I was hired as a Systems Engineer at a FinTech company in the Bay Area at $115,000 with the intention of becoming IT Manager. Everyone calls me the IT Manager, even the CEO. I recently had an intern join my team and I asked verbally about being officially recognized as the IT Manager along with an appropriate raise. It was denied. 

My dumb ass didn't get in writing about becoming the IT Manager after an appropriate time. They are now saying I need to wait until the end of the year and I ""might"" get the title and raise. Now they want to double my workload...without a raise. 

I will be sending out a formal email with this request, what type of salary can I reasonably ask for? I do devops/help desk/on boarding/offboarding/IT policy/etc. 

Any support with this would be appreciated, thanks!"

However due to my 2.89 GPA and the fact that I have no internships or work experience to speak of, it seems like most companies won't even give me the time of day.

Initially as a new grad I would get a handful of responses here and there, though most never made it past the first round, and from there they became less and less despite consistently sending out applications and adding new skills and projects to my resume. I've tried applying to anything relevant to my skillset, from desktop support to software to embedded systems.

At this point I'm getting desperate to get any sort of relevant work experience under my belt and I'm even considering trying companies that are similar to revature. However as I would prefer to not sell my soul to satan, I would like to know if anyone here has any suggestions or advice?

So far in my own research, I've heard that FDM and the Genesis10 Dev10 program are slightly better alternatives. And yes, I am aware that these companies tend to prey on the weak, but after being out of a job in my field for so long, I'm feeling pretty weak myself. That said if anyone has other options besides them I would love to hear it. I just really want to make the piece of paper I spent a little over 4 years getting worth something."

I have worked here for over three years. When I started here I had a few years of college (but no degree) and a really solid co-op turned internship. I got good mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering experience at that internship. My starting job as a technician saw me spend 25-50% of my time automating small engineering test tasks in c# and the rest executing manual engineering test tasks. 

My roles and responsibilities have shifted and grown since then. I am now the test engineer here. I am responsible for testing all the devices we build. I am not drowning in my duties or struggling to do anything in particular. I have co workers to lean on for electrical engineering questions. However, I have really been feeling the lack of programming mentorship recently. I had no one to learn good programming practices from at any point in my career so far. I am reading / have read several books to try to fill the gap, but its definitely not the same. Now I have a fresh CS graduate working for me and I want to make sure I'm doing what I can to give them a good start. However, I feel like a 16 year old raising a child here. I barely know more than he does about good programming practices.

I have somewhere around two dozen solutions to maintain. Some are inherited applications and others I have built since taking my current position. All have TONS of bad programming practices littered through them. All of them have business logic scattered in the UI. All of them do super similar tasks, but are structured however the developer felt like at the time of writing the code. Since taking over I have iteratively improved the way I build new solutions. I'm learning how to apply SOLID and do TDD as I go. I know I'm headed in the right direction, but I don't know how many pitfalls and false starts lay ahead. I wish I had a coworker who I could explain my situation to and get feedback on, but there is no one else in my organization who can help. 

I think this turned into a bit of a rant, but I'd happily read about your experiences or resources you think I may find useful."

I got my college internship as a \*lead\* teaching assistant or university course assistant if you wanna be fancy. Since I was this professor's UCA before, I was given the responsibility of helping three new UCAs manage their sections of an intermediate research methods and statistics class. Much of this meant they would come to me for help with grading and I would help them calibrate so that we all had a consistent grading criteria across the board. 

One night, one of the three texts me asking for help on understanding one student's assignment submission. Since we can only describe so much through text, we decide to hop on Zoom so we can both look at the assignment. One issue is, her laptop with all her work has a broken webcam so she needs to use another laptop to actually use Zoom. Ok, that's fine. I understand. So the faces the laptop screens towards each other so that the camera is focused on the screen with the homework assignment. 

After realizing how complicated that would get and that the camera quality wasn't good enough to make out the text, I decided I'll pull up the homework on my computer and screen share that specific window. So I split my screen, left side for Zoom so I could see my colleague and the right side for the homework. In the meantime, she turned her laptop camera back around so we could see each other. The first thing I notice right when I see her face is that she's wearing an open cardigan and a sports tanktop so a little bit of cleavage was showing. So my immediate instinct was ""look away. NOW."" So I immediately turned my head to the right side of the screen where the homework was. ""Ok, I think I'm safe"", I thought, completely forgetting the fact that my colleague doesn't know how my screen is organized. So for all she knew, the only thing on my screen could have been Zoom and I just put all my focus on her tits. Next thing I hear from her is ""oh here, let me make that easier for you \*turns off camera\*"". 

oh fuck

So on the outside, I'm tryna to play it cool like nothing happened, but on the inside I'm just going ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"" because now to my colleague I looked like a fucking pervert who was getting hyperfocused on her tits. 

And I think what makes it worse for me? She's engaged and has step kids. So now, I gotta live with the fact that I looked like a pervert and that possibly someone is gonna find out I was checking out his fiance. 

After telling some friends about this incident, they say not to make too big of a deal about it since she gave me an out and just left it at that. But I still can't help thinking how big of a mistake I made. 

If you're reading this, you know who you are. And I would just like to deeply apologize for looking at your chest like that. I understand that it made you feel uncomfortable. My intent was to look away from your screen on Zoom but instead, I made it look like I was looking ONLY at your screen. Boy I fucked it up big time. 

TL;DR: I tried to look away from my colleague's chest, only to make it look like I was hyperfocusing on her chest."

I've been having an internal debate for some time about whether I should leave my current role to pursue more money / different experience. 

I'm currently working at the grad level at one of the big 4 in their consulting/digital arm as an engineer (predominantly front-end work). I've been here for just over a year, salary is $65k and will be increasing to \~$70/$75k by June via promotion. Previously I worked at a bank as an engineer, essentially I was an intern there while studying which matured into a full time role. This was paying \~80k, I decided to move into consulting as the bank work was becoming stale and I thought I would learn more / grow faster in consulting (this could be viewed as a backward step in some ways, but in hindsight it feels like the right move as I've learned a lot).

I have worked on some really interesting projects and been given a lot more responsibility than I expected here, I've grown a lot technically since joining and still have room to grow. On the other hand I am quite impatient with the low salary and the time-gated career progression process. Downtime between projects is also quite frustrating as I really like to be busy.

I know this is very common but I've been receiving a lot of messages about roles on LinkedIN. Most are mid-senior level roles at product companies / smaller consulting companies / start-ups, with salaries ranging from \~$100k - $140k. I believe my actual technical skill is at mid-level. Although I could probably manage, I wouldn't feel comfortable stepping into a senior role at this stage. So if I were to take a new role I'd anticipate a salary around $100k - $120k.

So I guess I am just seeking advice from people who may have faced similar challenges. What did you/would you do in this scenario?

Thank you for reading if you made it this far, any and all advice is appreciated."

I came in with roughly 15 credits and was exactly on track to make it out in 4 years by taking \~15-17 credit hour semesters, this place has a 4 year grad rate of like 39%.

except I keep failing classes (i've failed TWO so far. seriously what the fuck) so now I'm barely gonna make it. If I fail one more class I'm gonna need 4 and a half years. If I don't get into certain prereqs during registration I'm gonna need 4.5 years. Literally if anything grade or schedule related doesn't go perfectly I'm gonna need 4.5 years.

I'm paying for 2 years of college (my parents offered to pay the other two), I've already had jobs and internships. I should know the value of money pretty damn well.

so why the hell do I not do shit. I'll literally zone out in the direction of a WALL rather than do any work. Hell, I’ll zone out when people are talking to me. When my *friends* are chatting with me. I procrastinate online lectures, I procrastinate studying, I procrastinate homework. I procrastinate watching shows I wanna watch. I procrastinate getting out of bed. I procrastinate texting people back. I've been procrastinating changing the ink in my printer. There's a book I'm halfway through just sitting on my bed not being read. My laundry is completely folded and just needs to be put away into drawers but I'm not doing that. There's always *something else* I can/will go do. Oh i need to study? Maybe its time to vacuum the living room. I need to cook dinner? Oh shoot, guess I better change the ink in my printer. Time to watch this lecture? I'll just stare at my keyboard and think about how much I need to get done instead. New episode of the anime I've been watching just came out? I think I'll go talk to my roommate instead. Guy just asked me on a date? Guess its a good time to clean the toilet.

like seriously, what the hell is wrong with me here. why is it so hard to do anything. I make the strict time schedules but then I just ignore them. I try the Pomodoro method but then I just,,, ignore it. I go somewhere with less distractions like the library and then I just zone out in the direction of my laptop or I find myself people watching. I set alarms but I just ignore them or snooze them. I create a checklist and then I simply don't complete them. I try to tell myself to just START and its such a fight, and I always convince myself that once I start I'll be able to get in the groove. But then it's a fight to stay focused for the entire rest of the time

Everyone's always like ""theres no magic solution, its up to you to get the will power/ self control"" ok WHERE. Where do I get it. How do I make it work. What happens if my self control doesn't WORK. I'll literally be laying in bed at 9:30 am, completely awake, thinking 'ok I need to get up and watch a lecture. I am awake. I will do that now' and then I will still be in bed. I ignore me. It's like when you wake up and you concentrate as hard as you can on moving your hand and your hand doesn't move, except I'm not physically paralyzed this time, I am just not doing the thing. I'm like ""ok do it now"" and then I just don't. **How the hell am I supposed to get myself to stop ignoring myself when I always ignore myself?**

I am not smart enough to get away with this anymore. I coasted my ass off in high school and it's just not going to cut it in college. I choose a college with a phat tuition fee because it is amazingly well ranked for my major, I loved the college, and I thought it was appropriate for me because I had very good grades in high school. I knew it was going to be a high financial cost and I knew a lot of debt was gonna come with it, but I weighed the pros and cons with my parents and we came to the conclusion that a) I could handle it and b) it would be worth it. And don't get me wrong, I'm very glad to be here. It has been very worth it so far. My resume and portfolio are lookin' fairly sexy, I've had serious luck with getting internships and with how much they pay, and I really do feel like I'm learning a lot. but god damn, you would THINK i would actually commit to graduating so I don't go even deeper in debt.

and it's not like I don't actively want to make it out in 4 years. Most of my friends are making it out in 3-4 years. I, with my 15 credits, came in with the lowest amount of credit hours out of everyone I know.  My roommate came in with \~30-something credit hours and took summer classes and DIDN'T fail their classes, and are on track to graduate in 3.5 years. So if I take 4.5 all my friends will be gone anyway. So it's not that I'm indifferent to 4 years vs 4.5 years, but for some reason  I just won't do the necessary work.

I'm actually SO lazy and I don't know how to make myself unlazy. I'm honest to god typing out this rant instead of watching unit 7.2 for the diff eq quiz I've got tomorrow. I’m an entire MONTH behind in my ece class. seriously why am I LIKE THIS"

**Letters of Recommendation**

*Humanities LOR:* I had my English teacher for two years and knew her for all four years of high school. In between the two years I had her as a teacher, I grew immensely as a human being and as a writer. Overall, we have an extremely close relationship, and I see her as a lifelong mentor. I provided her a 6-8 page document with my resume, the AAMC core competency list, and an outline of all possible anecdotes for the letter and the related core competency. 10/10

*STEM LOR:* I had my physics teacher for two years and she told me that she saw me as a son. For context, one day after school we just cried together. I already knew physics, so I spent most of class time helping everyone else understand the content. I also led AP prep for my class for the 2020 test because she barely did any review. I provided her a 6-8 page document with my resume, the AAMC core competency list, and an outline of all possible anecdotes for the letter and the related core competency. 10/10

*Counselor LOR:* I didn't know him extremely well. But, from our limited interactions, I knew that he had a high opinion of me. Our school has a system where we submit a resume and answer a list of 15 questions. So I wrote about 15 pages in response to those questions. Assuming he copied/pasted some of my answers and then added some of his own thoughts, the letter had to have been solid. 9/10

*Research LOR:* My high school French teacher and my independent research mentor. She told me multiple times that I was her most dedicated student ever and that she saw me as a son. We have a very strong emotional connection and have also cried together when she was going through difficulties in her academic and personal life. Also, both of us are first-generation immigrants so we understand each other's struggles to an extent. I provided her a 6-8 page document with my resume, the AAMC core competency list, and an outline of all possible anecdotes for the letter and the related core competency. 10/10

As I'm re-reading these... why do I cry with my teachers. I feel like that's weird. Also, my principal said he was going to write a letter for me but he never did LOL.

**Interviews**

The only meh interview was with Rice. Half of my interviews were very good, but not exceptional because the interviewer was very clearly on a time crunch or had a list of pre-made questions. The other half were exceptional as I engaged in intellectual conversation or deeply personal stories for hours. I'd say my favorites were Princeton, Harvard, and MIT. I actually wrote about my Harvard interview for my Princeton supplement (but changed the context ofc).

**Essays**

Main personal statement was about my cultural music. I really played with the topic as if it was a tub of Play Dough.... Harry Potter references, self-deprecating humor, the works. It was truly an amazing essay to write.

COVID Statement was about how I applied for 13 summer research programs and then got rejected from all of them. But then, I still created an intense and enriching summer experience for myself.

Why medicine statement was this metaphor between gardening and my medical experiences. I thought it was cool... the BS/MD program committees generally did not.

Supplements were mostly about moments from my extracurriculars. Honestly, supplements were the easiest but most tedious. I had a couple of repeated topics:  Why East Asian Studies, Why Psychology, moment from my peer-counseling line, moment as a martial arts instructor, failure at a martial arts competition, presenting my grant project at the public health school, letter to my hometown, cultural experience while traveling. The structure for my Why School essay was: personal anecdote about meeting a current student or alum + specific steps I'd taken to show demonstrated interest + programs the school is known for + hidden gems at the school + clubs I'd join. Demonstrated interest was really easy to show during COVID. I just attended *all* the info sessions.

**Additional Information:**

Feel free to ask me any questions! Applying to so many places and writing over 150 pages of essays was a personal choice that I do not regret. Harvard was my first choice... but I'm not upset at all. I will say that it was really hard giving up the full ride to Emory... but I know that Princeton is right for me. In general, the BSMD process was a huge bust, the NJMS program is pretty sweet though."

The SE degree has more focus on Software Engineering while the CS is more about advanced CS theory-related topics.  I know there is not much difference in education at least at my university. I originally thought both would have no difference for job prospects or internship opportunities, but I remember reading a comment or two on this subreddit, forgot the links to them by now, how a SE degree will limit you to SE types of roles only due to the name of the degree. This led me to think and see how many job/internship postings usually only have the name CS listed even if they are Software Developer Role related while only Software Developer related roles have the SE degree with the CS degree in job postings. Does this really mean companies, ATS, or recruiters tend to limit SE degree graduates only to SE types of roles? I really did like CS because of its versatility and thought SE had the same advantage but due to the name of the SE degree itself, I am unsure now. I thought to ask people that experience here rather than just speculating or worrying."

mvaonw,4,2021-04-21,Dreams About Violence - Should I Be Concerned?,SnooRecipes1809,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mvaonw/dreams_about_violence_should_i_be_concerned/,"I feel a little ashamed of myself. Every now and then I have these sorts of horrific dreams where my life is in danger and I have to respond defensively. In other dreams, I myself may not be in danger but I get overly anxious and behave violently in the dream, even when my consciousness strictly tells me not to. I'll provide 2 specific brief examples of suspect dreams I have documented to record.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Dream A:** This is it how it opens. I am sitting in my living room with my closest group of friends and we are chilling having a drink, except I notice their faces are sort of different: they are actually lookalike dopplegangers of my friends, not the originals. Each friend's clothing, hairstyle, ethnic/facial makeup and voice is fitting of my real life friends... but their face is slightly off and I can tell it's a completely different person.  At some point, the conversation just drops dead, and every doppleganger just stares at me saying nothing. One of them lunges at me with a knife, but the moment the knife touches me the scene backdrop changes and the scene repeats again, except we are in a different room.

However, this time, a different doppleganger friend lunges at me, and then the cycle repeats until the knife is in my hand and it is ""my turn"" . I lunge to stab a random doppleganger friend but they don't react when I swing and nothing is happening... they just continue staring at me in a creepy manner, with no speech. From here, I wake up, literally shivering and breathing hard, since I had gotten stabbed in a dream 8 times. I've told my actual friend group about this dream and they deduce that it's part of my ""trust issues"" nature and it's just reflective of my stressful/defensive mental state around people. The ""doppleganger aspect"" is my primitive brain labeling my friends as fake, when this is very far from the truth and is a paranoia. This is consistent I guess, since I am described as a very composed/regulated person who is always extra conscious of myself and others, which is why I take longer to feel comfortable around even my most honest friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Dream B:** I have this childhood friend, let's call him N. Even though N and I have been honest and close all our lives, a small portion of our relationship was based on competition. If he achieved something remarkable, I would be happy for him but a voice in my head would compel me to try to outbest him in something. Whenever I would achieve something over him, he would sometimes match or exceed me on it too, but we've always been close and honest. However, nowadays, when I hang out with him, I do feel a twinge of jealousy about certain things he has going on and it frequently sends me into introspection. Even though he has said he is envious of some of my skills too, I don't think it makes him as insecure about himself like the way I get.

This is how Dream B opens: I am having a regular conversation with N catching up and cracking jokes as usual. But he starts talking about this impressive internship he scored at this hedge fund (this never happened in real life actually, he has no such job rn), and I feel a knife randomly enter my hand. A voice in my head berates myself for falling short to him, feeling like I am not doing enough in life, feeling like I am making the wrong decisions, etc. I have a mini mid-dream career existential crisis.

I slash him in the face but my mind is begging me to stop... **but my dream body doesn't listen, scarily enough**. For a good moment, it feels euphoric. I keep slashing at him immediately following his internship conversation and then I wake up, shocked and cold.

**About me:** In real life, I have no incidents of instigating, being combative, or acting violent at all. I almost never get in fights with people and every conflict I have ever had has worked out with polite words and calm reasoning. I am trying to tell you \***I am NOT like this AT ALL in real life\*.** My friends frequently tell me that they love how understanding I am with everything and that I am always willing to find something that works for everyone. I put a back-breaking amount of effort to make sure I do my loved ones justice... it's almost exhaustingly stressful. So why do I dream about killing? **Is it normal to dream weirdly like this? Should I seek help? Are dreams to be considered, or are they meaningless concoctions of the subconscious?**

TL;DR : Even though I am not a violent or hostile person, I have dreams about violence or being in danger, and I was wondering if it is normal or if I should really investigate myself."

SOS!,your_father20,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/mvaqby/halp_suggestions_for_international_aerospace/,"Hey guys, I am looking for suggestions and mentors who can guide my timid ass to my first job. I have never asked people around for suggestions to actual people outside because I'm very ashamed of my marks and looking at my own transcript makes me wanna kill myself but I understand that's what most students suffer from. I have graduated from a UK university with BEng Aerospace Engineering 2019-2020 with no internships in between, Final Year Project was on CFD analysis and 2.2 Honors 49% (omegalul). I was forced to leave by the fear of UK lockdown back in March 2020  back to my home country- Myanmar(Burma) and been stuck at home since then. Problems are I am very skeptical if I will be able to work straight away using the materials that I learnt in Uni, meaning I am not confident enough to work and still doubts that I need to learn more before going to work. I'm in a difficult situation as I am not able to work in the aerospace field in my home country as the aircraft industry is controlled by the military here and even worse after the coup where airlines, airports and even fuel companies are controlled and restricted by the military and I have no way of joining them as I am not a Burmese (It's a race in Myanmar)  but a Chinese with a citizenship (still different ID card color) where the military is strictly racist and allows only pure Burmese blood. (You may search about this online). So my only option is to work overseas and that's what my parents wanted me to do. I've been trying to find jobs in the UK and US as I could not stand Asia's heat because I'm naturally and heavily insulated so I'm looking for a cold place to work and believe me or not, I sweat big balls of sweat by not doing anything. But I have absolutely no idea of how to apply a job, the time that graduate jobs are available or even look for the right job for me. I am lost. SOS, suggestions please? I want to know how to overcome that fear, doubtfulness of what if I am not even qualified for that job. This has been my main reason to not find a job myself and my fear have kept me jobless and also I've searched for jobs in the US but if I see some interesting job title, they all require US citizenship and clearance.

mvbhxm,5,2021-04-21,Summer Internship Revoked: Not sure what to do next,throwawayrevoked,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/mvbhxm/summer_internship_revoked_not_sure_what_to_do_next/,"Using a throwaway because my situation is pretty embarrassing and my friends all know my main. 

So a few months ago, I got an internship offer from a defense contractor for this summer. I was really happy about it because it was my dream position, and whenever someone asked me about my summer plans, I was pretty happy to tell them that I had an internship secured. However, the offer was contingent on the fact that I would be able to obtain a top secret security clearance. I was pretty certain that I could get one (clean background, no crimes), so after I got the offer I basically stopped applying for internships. Well, it turns out that I was wrong. I didn't get denied the clearance, but it was taking so long to process due to foreign contacts that they notified me I wouldn't have the clearance in time for the summer internship. Now I'm out of an internship and I have very few options left. 

Out of the internships I did apply to, only one of them gave me an interview. However, this was after I had already accepted the defense contactor's internship offer, so I had to be honest with them about it. They seemed pretty apprehensive about giving me an offer after that because they needed someone to fill the position immediately to make onboarding go smoother, and there were a ton of other applicants being considered. They rejected me a few weeks later. All of my other applications either got ghosted or rejected--a friend of mine told me to follow up on the ones I got ghosted on, but I'm not sure how that would turn out.

The one solid option I do have is working for my previous summer internship employer. My manager from last year reached out to me and invited me back to come work for him, under a different position this time. Again, I told him about the pending offer I had, so he told me to give him updates on the situation and we could take it from there. Well now I'm out of an internship, so I could go back to work for the company. I am a little apprehensive about taking the position though, for several reasons:

1) My last internship was unpaid. He talked briefly about money this time, so I'm guessing he will pay me this time, but I'm not going to work for him again if the compensation isn't fair.   
2) The new position he's offering me is not related to my future career goals. My last internship was in engineering, but this time, he wants me to work in software. I guess software is useful to know as an engineer, but I'm not sure if I want to spend a whole summer doing it.   
3) My last internship was quite uneventful, to say the least. I didn't learn much that I didn't already know. Part of that was because the internship had to be taken virtual, but part of it is also because the company is a startup and the management structure is super disorganized. I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing half the time. Again, I don't want to waste my summer on an experience that I won't find valuable. 

I am honestly not sure what to do at this point. Should I continue to follow up on the applications that haven't been rejected yet? Should I start applying for internships this late into the cycle, knowing that I probably won't get anything? Should I take the software internship offer from my previous employer? Should I take the summer off? Maybe take some courses? Any help is greatly appreciated."

I know the smart choice is to avoid that much debt, but it’s so hard to turn down the opportunity to attend a top school for engineering.

I'll basically show my whole situation even though it's embarrassing. I'm 24(M). I have an Asian tiger mom who wants to put education above all else. With ADHD, my whole life I've been doing nothing but procrastinating, having no motivation, always screwing up in the class room, forgetting everything, etc (basically ADHD things). I was doing College and I did pretty bad the first semester and it plummeted my GPA badly. I ended up meeting my first ever girlfriend during my first semester. I started spending. A lot of time with her and at her family's house to which I kind of just moved in rent free. I feel incredibly guilty about this and everyday I think about how I'm nothing but a pathetic leech and I'm literally providing nothing. I help her family with their business and they work a couple of hours a day an. I make some money along with my GF. I ended up taking Online classes because I always hated going to Campus and sitting there for an hour or two when I forget everything anyways. I always try taking notes but they need stick in my head and everything a teacher says immediately dissipates from my mind. I started taking online classes. They allowed me to have much more free time and I just do quizzes, tests, or assignments every week. I would alway drop out of classes that had teachers that wanted a ton of work to be done every week that seemed insane. As I took more and more online classes and bettered my GPA, the online classes at my school started to dwindle and I would only take one or two online classes a semester. Getting the motivation to drive there and drive back while waiting there bored out of my mind when I know I won't retain anything was making me feel terrible. 

I missed being the early freshman where I lived at the dorm and I wanted to walk to class, even if I still went absent for some days because I just didn't feel like it. I may have done bad but being away for the first time made me want to go. 

I never had a job before going away to college either. My first job was as a busser for an entertainment company. I was actually excited and I would clean tables quickly and efficiently. Even the management said they liked how quick I was. Problems eventually arose as there were ZERO breaks. I would work 7-9 hours with zero breaks and my back would literally be hurting very bad. It was so bad that my back almost gave out and I almost fell. I haven't seen a doctor for it (since I'm a pansy baby) but in middle school I was diagnosed as having some level of scoliosis so it may have gotten worse. My mom always told me it will get better and it never did. 

I gave out, I was already a lazy, procrastinating, ADHD riddled mess but now, I just hated working. I hated standing there when all the tables were done and just messing with a fidget cube because I couldn't stand still. I hated all the coworkers who were just lounging around and I did most of the work in our crew. I hated how I couldn't talk to my GF for a few minutes while she was there but my boss who scolded me could talk for hours to her husband about meaningless stuff. Most of all, I hated seeing my family visit me there and seeing how miserable I was. I just broke and ended up crying so much. 

I ended up quitting and got a new job at a food place in the Mall. I couldn't work the cash register since I couldn't remember how to work it. My social anxiety kicked in when talking to customers to where I would be shaking intensively in my boots. My social anxiety can get so bad where I forget everything. One time, I auditioned for a music group and I had the whole song in my head. I usually love performing in front of people but there were only two people and a camera without any background music. I froze and couldn't remember the first word of the damn song...

I still had back pain and I always felt inclined to not go and hang out with my GF who I don't feel awkward with and I feel like I can be myself. I would have some sort of excuse for work and I feel bad because I bailed and I wouldn't go because not only did the ADHD kick in, but the unwillingness to do anything that seemed like work since I just felt empty doing it.

I stopped working jobs and just started working with my GFs family. It's an easy job and I get to be with my GF the whole time. 

(Sorry for getting side tracked.) 

Anyways, I ended up getting in a mess with my parent's tax returns and I couldn't go to college this year. Prior to that, I always told my parents I may graduate next year but it didn't come and I just kept lying because I probably have some parents problems stemming from my mom. She raised me and my siblings for the most part. She would always get angry pretty easily and I was physically disciplined a lot as a child. I was extensively scared of her and I lied a lot to get out of trouble. Now, I'm scared of her and I feel like a failure and I know telling her would make her more angry and she would probably take the car she got for me in High School away.

I'm lying to my GFs family too. I said I was a senior when I'm definitely not as this point. I didn't go to school this year because of our accountant messing up on the tax returns (because our accountant said my mom and her boyfriend were married when they weren't) but I still said I was going to school since I was afraid of working again  (as well as the usual lack of motivation, anxiety about everything, scared of messing up, etc) after all of those bad experiences.

I'm a mess. I have no idea what to do with my life. I have terrible time blindness and these past few years flew by and I don't even remember a lot of it. I couldn't even remember a combination of numbers (or anything that I needed to memorize right away) but being unable to remember parts of what happened in my life scares me. I'm going to be old and I won't remember a damn thing and if my wife dies, I will just be alone and can barely remember a thing.

I only chose my major cause I needed one. I have bad social anxiety but I still changed my degree to Public Relations because of how much time I spend on social medias like YouTube or Reddit. I know about companies that screw up on their PR and I've always thought they need to be on the good side of the public. ""Any press is good press"" is certainly something I do not agree with as bad press will cause your downfall unless you're a rare YouTuber that isn't affected by it.

Before I changed my degree, I wanted to be a game designer but programming ended up being too hard for me. 

I tried learning instruments or video editing but it always ends up in - Do you have motivation? Usually no but if yes, can you even focus on it? If yes, can you even remember it? Oh good! You remember it? Well that's only because of repetitive muscle memory and you didn't actually learn anything.

Math test? I only memorize that specific problem's work around when looking over a study sheet. When the test arrives, there are problems that throw a curve ball and I'm completely lost. 

I'm pathetic and suck at everything. The only good things I'm good or decent at are typing (hence why I just ramble and post long stuff), singing/rapping, and video games. I've also been told I'm good at acting but I'm Asian and Asians rarely get any parts in movies or TV Shows.

For each skills I always found a negative aspect. 

-Data Entry for typing? The jobs are diminishing because of AI and those jobs are few and far between

-Performing Music? I would honestly LOVE to do this one. It makes my social anxiety go away in most cases. It makes me feel good. I've gotten compliments. It makes my ADHD go away since memorizing songs are much easier and I'm able to move around instead of just standing still so it's much more viable than giving a presentation. Let's be honest though. Being a musician that makes money is a pipe dream and wouldn't come true. I don't even care about being mega rich and I would just love to make a decent living off of music but nope. Some people have said to learn music production but the same thing happens (lack of motivation, focus, memory, etc). I usually try and watch videos to learn specific stuff and I doze out, watch then forget, or just give up and put it off. (I'm also not a good song writer but I can write decent stuff).

( I know this is a weird thing to add but I've been told I look like a celebrity/famous person and some people said I should since I've got the looks and decent talent but with the pandemic going on and making money off of music being a rarity in general, I don't think it really matters)

-Video games? I'm good at games but nowhere near enough to make money off of them

- Hell, decent jobs in general seem so hard to get even if I were actively trying to find one, there are so many other people doing the same thing. They have more experience and talent than me (as well as being normal) so why would a recruiter even pick me?

I described my experience yesterday where I finally applied for 5-7 ( I forgot how many ) internships that look hours on end because a variety of problems. (Such as the websites being buggy, I had to make multiple accounts for each job position aka I had to put down my job history, information, etc multiple times. Made my resume off of a resume builder site and after putting a ton of work into it, the site tried making me pay a monthly fee when it came off as free. It should at least tell you that in order to make one, you need to pay). I didn't even have the gall to do it. I tried forcing myself and it was awful but I ended up doing it even though I know I won't be accepted. 



I forget most of the things I put off. I tried writing in my notes of anything I have to do but there are SO many things I put off that it gets lost in the sea of notes even if I wanted to do it. Even now, I'm writing this in my notes and I'm writing small sentences to make sure I don't forget what I'm going to say next.

Hyper focus is a thing for me and I only wish I could apply it to things I want to learn. I have to be fully interested in something to even enjoy knowing something new that I can apply which is usually in video games.

If you can't tell, it seems like I enjoy things that usually keep my body or mainly hands busy but that may just be a coincidence.


Honestly, if I had to pick out a dream route of how my life would actually get better it would start off like this.

###

- Make music and get decently noticed to where I have a fan base. I would love to make a clothing line and work with a person who can draw to make merchandise that people want to wear. I see many celebrities make clothes that are too odd and don't stand out from the crowd or are terrible looking. I would want something that people would wear continuously while also promoting your brand. 

(I.e. Someone asks where someone else got their hoodie or shirt to where it ends up in a conversation about music tastes which will introduce the other person into that specific person's music)

With the decent popularity, that would improve my chances into getting into acting. I would love to try and voice act. Asians get more roles in voice acting and there are a number of exquisite roles that are more exciting. I would also try and get side acting roles. I know I wouldn't get major roles but I'm fine with portraying side characters. 

I would LOVE to write stories for shows or movies. Not by myself but with a team since I bounce off of ideas because I suck at creating them. This would be amazing but these writing gigs are usually for people who network or those who have a ton of experience in writing shows. I doubt I could even get a spot on a creative writing team. 

(I know people will say go into journalism but I can only write a lot about things I care about. I wrote this whole paper on my experience during college but it's hard to write on paper for college which is ironic.)

With enough money, I would love to open a business that could have some fall backs in case it doesn't work out. I don't know what it would be but I know I want to dabble in something.

###


That's just a route that I would like but I know it wouldn't come true.

For a minute there I actually became somewhat happy when writing all of that down. I forgot that I wasn't a f*ck up that has no value in this world and all I'm doing is leeching off of those who are too good to me and I hate it. 

I just feel miserable and as a as I want to see a professional, they are incredibly expensive.

I'm a liar, I'm stupid, I'm a sloth, I'm worthless, I'm a leech, and I'm just pathetic.

I have thoughts about ending my life but no one has to worry about that because of course, I'm also a scared wuss. I'm scared of dying, scared of needles, scared of the dark, scared of heights, scared of customers, scared of literally many things.

My room with my GF's family has a ton of unwashed clothes piled everywhere. Along with being unorganized I don't have room to put them so in my mind it makes me feel justified that I don't get them done and that includes a lot of my home life stuff that normal people get done easily or right away.

That's not even mentioning my self esteem issues and even when many people compliment my looks, I am very insecure especially after some negative comments by only a few people about either my nose looking like a certain ethnicity or my acne scars. (Negative comments stay with me for a long time)

I just have so many things wrong with me and the thing is, as awesome as it is to see people like me in the ADHD Sub Reddit. There are posts who talk about being successful and those who actually persevere while working hard. I whole heartedly feel as if I can't match that at all. 

I honestly don't know anything else I want to talk about or put out there. My mind is now going blank but I feel like there's a ton I want to say but now I can't remember. I'm just constantly moving my legs up and down while refusing to read my own post because I'm afraid that I sound stupid and it's way too long.

I mean, I can't even read a long passage without skimming through it or forgetting it so my post isn't any special. I apologize if it's too long and I don't blame anyone for refusing to read it or skimming through most of it. I'll try leaving a tl;dr as best as I can. Thank you for taking any time out of your day to read a crappy post like mine..


Attempted Tl;dr: I'm a terrible worthless leech. Living and working with GFs family. Feel like a failure. Did bad at first semester of college then slowly started going to Online Schooling since because of usual ADHD problems as well as getting ready, driving there, staying in a class room for hours when I forget everything a teacher says even when writing notes, then driving back made me apprehensive. Online classes were dwindling and I started taking lesser classes and well as dropping out of them. Lied to them about college since I had two terrible experiences with working and my ADHD is gotten worse to where I can't get motivation to go. Can't learn anything because of lack motivation, focus, and I can't remember basic things (or to even do them). Lied to my Asian tiger mom because I'm scared of her as she gets angry really easily and I was physically disciplined by her a lot. I got other things like self esteem issues, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and I'm scared of a ton of things. I suck at everything and the only things I am good at don't make a career path. I don't even know what to do in life and I only chose my major out of desperation. I want to learn new things but ADHD is making it incredibly difficult. Can't go to a professional since it's expensive and I've tried doing and researching various ADHD methods of help.

I know I left out a ton of stuff but that's my best effort without reading my long post since I'll just skim through it or doze off. Thank you and sorry for the long post.

I am a fresh graduate that graduated from university last year June. Back in NS I have once considered signing on but thought I would wait out and try the civilian working life first in order to have a fair experience of both.

I have now worked about 7 months(3 months internship in an sme and 4 months in engineering mnc)

I felt that I didn't actually enjoyed working outside because it didn't gave me the sense of purpose and excitement as compared to how I felt when I served in the airforce as an air warfare officer(gbad). During my time it would be tiring when we have exercises and ops but I never dreaded it like how I do stuffs at work because there's this sense of camaraderie and teamwork. 

I am quite tempted to sign on as I am quite certain that I don't really enjoy the kind of job scopes that i will be doing with my degree. (have been looking at jobs and career reviews for so long and just don't feel any fire) 

The main issue here is usually people sign on for life. I'm not sure if I am that able to make such a commitment but it just seems to me I will never be able to find out if I don't do it. 

I can try to do another job change but I will be another year older by then... Which is also a factor when it comes to signing on. 

Thanks in advance"
mvfoz0,20,2021-04-21,From Law to CyberSecurity,Bl00dnik,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/mvfoz0/from_law_to_cybersecurity/,"Hi,

I hold a BS and MS degrees in law, and practice it for \~6 years, 2 out of which I also do asset tracing and investigations using OSINT techniques. However, besides OSINT part, I have never felt that law is my thing in terms of personal satisfaction.

Since my early years I've been interested in computers, networks, cyber security and corresponding cyber crime issues, and later in life – incident response and cyber crisis management, as well as everything related to cyber security in general, including reading blogs of CS experts, and cyber culture in a broader sense. Even though I've tried to bring more cybersecurity into my legal career (as part of my master studies I wrote a thesis, researching issues of legal attribution of state-sponsored cyber-attacks, which I really enjoyed), it actually feels that I only walk around the topic I like, without getting my hands on the technical side of CS.

During COVID I started to seriously consider making a move from law to 'real' cyber security, where my legal/consulting skills could also be of good use at a later career stage. So I think about joining a 6 month full-time 'SOC analyst' bootcamp (4 month education + 2 months internship at SOC). Here is the syllabus they gave me, which I believe must be standard for CS bootcamps.

1. SQL injection  
The hacker mindset Kali Linux  
Malware attacks  
Brute Force attacks (inc. dictionary attacks)
2. SEIM (security Information &amp; Event Management) &amp; IR (Incident Response)  
SOC simulation exercises
3. Programming/scripting:  
Python  
Working with DBs (SQL &amp; NoSQL) DevOps
4. OS
   1. Windows:  
Windows API, Win32, and windows subsystem model  
Debuggers and Sysinternal tools
   2. Linux:  
Intro to Linux &amp; Distributions  
Memory system  
Linux API

After the bootcamp I plan to get a job as a SOC Analyst, moving to IR and Threat Intelligence. In simple words, I wish to help clients to defend against cyber attacks, build resilient systems and manage cyber incidents.

My questions are:

1. Is it possible to learn topics advertised topics mentioned in the syllabus sufficiently enough during 6 month period to be able to jump into the CS field (like SOC analyst) without a technical degree?
2. The program costs about USD 5k (plus the money I won't be earning, which is much higher). Do you think getting certain certs instead would be better investment – If yes, why, what certs (besides Security+) and in which order you'd recommend taking?
3. If I won't be able to make a swith to a pure technical job, in what CS positions/companies my legal/consulting and technical skills could be valuable?
4. Any general piece of advice would be really appreciated"

*I apologize for the incoming long rant or if I sound like a little crybaby b\*\*ch. I'm just not sure what to do with myself anymore . . .* 

When I first went to college, things were super good - I'd managed to get into a prestigious university near Boston (where I live), and I had a clear plan. I would major in history and education as an undergrad and become a teacher. Worst case scenario, go get a master's in education and become a teacher anyway. I didn't really do any research in job outlook, or make any backup plans. That was the 17 year old me. Wish I could just go back and punch myself for being so naïve. Thinking that absolutely nothing would go wrong and I could just breeze through and get everything done and get my degree and get a job and live. With a side job in fast food, I can even pay for part of the tuition.

Now I'm in a bit of crisis. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic I lost a student teaching opportunity with BPS - which is a requirement for the education program. I asked the education department head about this and was told that I can't complete the program on time. That's fine, I'm actually on track to complete the history degree early. 

Nope. My dad gets sick, he can't support the family much longer. He's struggling hard medically and at most he can keep working for one or two years. He's in horrible shape. Not much left in savings because we've been trying to help me pay for college. I also overestimated my ability to study full-time while working at the same time; my grades aren't absolutely garbage, but they're not good enough for most graduate programs with an actual reputation. So if I'm going to do graduate school, I'm going to need to earn the money to do it myself, which means I need to find *a job that doesn't pay minimum wage*.

And here's where I really want to punch my 17-year-old self for not thinking things through. Because now, with the original plan out of the window and the graduate school backup plan requiring a lot of money to work, I'm stuck with a harsh reality: I'm about to graduate with a useless history degree with at best a mediocre GPA. I'm a junior, and with the incoming financial difficulties up ahead we can't bankroll a fifth year of college for me to switch majors. I do have plenty of work experience outside of fast food; I taught English abroad every summer, but working as a teacher doesn't necessarily qualify me for any corporate office job. I trusted so much in the teaching path that I never thought about taking an internship. And now that I've realized my situation, I'm scrambling to find an internship, but the only ones that will take me are fast-food management trainee programs. Of course I learned office, excel, powerpoint, etc. since those are tools I'd use all the time to teach, but I've never learned stuff like salesforce or any programming. Willing to bust ass to learn anything during an internship, but all anyone wants is prior work experience, even after I've tried bullshitting my teaching and fast food work on my resume with the keywords everyone wants.

I've unwittingly fallen into the Useless Liberal Arts Degree trap.

My mother keeps telling me to not worry, that having a degree will ensure that I get a job when I graduate. I know she means well, and she herself got a ""useless"" degree, but frankly the job market today isn't the job market in the 1980's. With all my previous 3 years' work experience teaching, with the fact that we were understaffed there so I often took on clerical and administrative work when I wasn't teaching, I figured I'd qualify for clerical/administrative/office work around Boston, so I applied for internships doing that. Nope, they want a degree from a vocational school. Fine, perhaps I qualify as an analyst - history degree, research and critical thinking. Nope, they want a business degree. Writing? Nope, English degree plus years of experience. Sales, marketing, advertising? Business degree. Youth outreach? Teaching experience doesn't count, you need criminal justice or psychology. Bloody hell, turns out even majoring in psychology is more useful than history. She tells me to commit and finish my degree, so that's what I'm going to do, both because that's what she wants and because I believe in at least getting something I started done. But it feels like with this degree I'm just driving a car straight towards a cliff, and I don't have enough time to turn away. I can see the fall coming up ahead, and I know what's going to happen, but there's no time left to stop or turn.

Yes, if I were willing to move out to the middle of nowhere, or teach abroad, I'd find steady, well-paying work. If I were willing to just not live in Boston and go abroad, I'd be rich and comfy, especially with my multilingual ability and previous experience teaching abroad. Everyone says I'm so self-centered for trying to stay in the Boston area. But I just want to be close by, so I can visit my parents once in a while, and if my father's health takes a sudden turn for the worse (as it has a few times before), I want to be able to get to the hospital in time. Maybe that is a little self-centered, I don't know. I also want to be at least able to sustain myself and not have to sponge off my parents' income years after I graduate.

I recognize that without a STEM degree and a lack of experience outside of teaching I'm already stuck outside of most jobs that would pay 50k+ (the ""middle class"" wage for a single person here in Boston). That's fine - I'm not a man who spends a lot of money on cars, luxuries, etc. The most I really indulge in is an occasional takeout run every 3 weeks or so. Heck, I don't even have Netflix or Amazon Prime or whatever. I don't use my phone super often and my plan comes out to maybe 40 bucks a month, while some of my friends roll in the 70's. I'm teaching myself how to cook basic meals, and I really require a big apartment in one of the new buildings out on the Seaport for 2k+ a month - a small cell in a small apartment in a low-income neighborhood with roommates for 900 or less is fine enough with me. The only thing I really allow myself to indulge in is a few subscriptions for streaming football games during the season, which I cancel after the end of the season. The shady sites pull about 30 a month total, and that's only for a few months.

Doing the math, even with the classic ""rice and beans"" diet, roommates in a bad neighborhood, no major shopping sprees, etc. that I'm totally fine and prepared to live, I still can't afford it. Unless I commit to having no car and using the T instead, which is fine and saves a ton of money (plus walking everywhere is super easy in Boston proper). Except that being entirely dependent on public transit also means I can't live at home, which would have also shaved off a lot of expenses. Never really was particularly attractive or interesting to ladies, so I'm mentally prepared already to live alone and give up dating anyway.

Either way, on minimum wage I can't afford to sustain myself, either living at home and having to pay for a car, or living with roommates with public transit. At minimum wage working fast food or retail, I'd be forced to rely on my parents pretty much forever, which isn't an option. At 15/hr I could *probably* make it work, but I wouldn't have much left over to save for a future education. The lowest I could probably go and be able to have hope for the future is 17/hr, which is unfortunately where all the ""experience"" and specialized degrees start appearing.

I'm stuck. I know I'm screwed, and I'll be tethered to my parents for support for the next few years - except my parents are also near their breaking point and can't sustain me that much longer either.

My mother is religious, and she keeps telling me that I'm ""lost"". Personally, I disagree. I don't think I'm lost, because I know where I am. I'm broken. I can't sleep at night because all I do is think about jobs and budgeting. Sometimes, I just go out and walk around aimlessly for hours, without remembering it. Other times, I'll spend hours and hours just browsing job boards looking for something that might take me. It drives me crazy. I'm only a junior and I'm not supposed to think so much about getting a job, but I can't stop. I'm afraid that I'm screwed, and I hate my past self and my past choices.

*Anyways, that's my long rant. Sorry about the long essay and the ""sob story"". I just had to get this off my chest . . .*"

&amp;#x200B;

I am feeling a little lost at the moment about my pathway for my future. I am finishing my junior year in college studying ComSci and I minor in Cyber Security. My main focus is with the CySec field and I would love to work on the offensive side but I understand there are more jobs on the defensive side so I am trying to gain skills on both sides. My plan this summer was to spend more time on TryHackMe and obtain at least my Net+ and by the end of the year have the Sec+ too. But I am considering just going for the Sec+ and grind for OSCP or PenTest+? I unfortunately did not gain an internship this summer either so that is why I want to spend my time wisely building my skillset so I can be ready for applying for jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any tips on how I should approach this? Thanks again."
mvkm0f,1,2021-04-21,Volunteering or Language school,Zartoshtian,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mvkm0f/volunteering_or_language_school/,"So after quite some time I decided to post here, as I have the greatest difficulties of deciding which way to go...

I know, I know, this is quite a ""luxury problem"" but you'll see later, that this decision is representative of a larger struggle.

So.

At the moment I am a medical student and I studied for 2 years. I was extremely unsure about the choice of my studies and decided to take a break half a year ago.
Because of Corona some things I originally wanted to do, obviously weren't possible anymore. Amongst them were travelling, learning languages or volunteering. Right now, I have the opportunity to either volunteer in Ghana or learn Spanish in Costa Rica.
Before presenting the options, let me give some background:
I started my studies directly after highschool and was unsure from the beginning. This and some other personal issues led to an enormeous amount of stress in the last 2.5 years.
Also, I never really made any experiences abroad (school exchanges, work and travel...) although I always had the desire to, but my family made it difficult for some time. 
At the moment I always get some sort of inferiority complex, because the people around me have made auch experiences and seem to have profited largely from it.


Why?: made cultural experiences, ""adventure"", personal growth...

I, on the other hand, feel like having wasted my life, not having made such experiences and also not being sure, what to do in my future. 
(Ah yeah, and also not being confident about relationships etc)
I.e., I feel like being behind on many things and having to compensate quickly for it. This feels super frustrating.

 I originally wanted to continue or begin new studies around October, and I also have the opportunity to study in France for a year for which I would have to continue in Medicine (which I don't know, if I want to do it) in October. Otherwise I would go to Ghana after CR and also dping some Internships etc, but then I would for now lose my place in France and would have
 to apply for it again for some time later.

I also feel somewhat frustrated, that I am not 'advancing' in life, considering career etc, i.e. not feeling 'productive' atm.

Now to the options:

Ghana: Volunteering in a school for 3 months, afraid of it being too stressful, as you have to organise the lessons and be there from 7-15 (not being able to read lots of stuff I wanted to read etc), only 1 other volunteer there, but you have more ""purpose""

Costa Rica: language school, 2-4 hours a day, possibly also doing some stuff in a rainforest reservoire, option of spending time at the coast, probably meeting more new people as there are some students and tourist at the different locations, travelling afterwards. Mostly afraid of not being occupated enough and regretting not having volunteered.

PS: I totally wrote the struggles of life and hope to solve them by travelling, maybe this is exagerrated.

Tldr: trying to find my path and solving my life struggles with one travel"
mvkukn,5,2021-04-21,Haven't landed a summer internship... what should I do???,gdwalker1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mvkukn/havent_landed_a_summer_internship_what_should_i_do/,"Hello everyone. I am a junior finance major who has no internship experience yet. Right now, I am hoping to have a career as a financial analyst or financial advisor. I have been applying to internships for the past eight months and so far only heard back from 2 and got passed on by both. My overall GPA is 3.6, and I did well in my interviews, but in the end, they were looking for candidates with more experience.

I know how important it is to have at least one internship before you graduate in Finance, but due to COVID, many companies aren't offering summer internships. Therefore, thousands of college students apply to any ""finance"" related position they can find, with only a few openings for each. I emailed 15 financial firms in my area asking them for any work opportunities this summer, and the few I heard back from said no.

My question for anyone that reads this is, what should I do? I am highly motivated to be successful and care so much about my future. If I fail to find an internship before summer starts, what should I do instead? Is there anything productive I can do during the summer that will benefit me in building my resume so that I will still be considered for a job when I graduate?

Any advice is welcome and very much appreciated! Thank you"

I personally don't know what I want so I'm open to anything, I don't think anything can harm me more now.

Before I go on to tell my story here's a bit about my childhood, I had a pretty happy childhood, I didn't care about marks and grades, I didn't feel anything when I got less marks, although the stuff I was interested in I always got good grades. I ended up easily getting a good college and good branch.

Even in college, it was the same, didn't care about anything, I always view myself as a weirdo, I never really socialise, never liked to, its too taxing but I always had friends and good ones too. In college again, I never cared about grades but eventually always ended up getting good grades, I never went to college after my first semester, my attendance percentage was always in single figures.

When I was a kid, 10th grade my brother got tangled up in some mess, and that needed obscene amount of money, like really obscene amount, and the family paid up for it by loans, we have crazy debt now. Due to that I never really got anything first hand and the clothes I used to wear then, I still wear now. But this didn't really matter to me as I never cared about material stuff but I always used to feel sad, because my brother got almost everything he wanted. He got after he got tangled up in the mess too, from the regular obscene amount the family had to pay, he took and kept a lot for him too. so he got stuff and I didn't, I believe saying I didn't care is wrong, because it did sting, in my first year I took my laptop which I had won in a competition but I spilled water on it, so I had to take his old laptop.

So life went on, after this 1st sem, 2nd sem, 3rd sem,...... and now I am in my final semester of engineering, 8th sem and this semester and the previous semester has changed everything, and now I feel like I'm just being pushed around by anyone, whoever feels like does anything to me and just goes, I see others having tremendous luck, I see others getting crazy luck, I see others happy, I see others enjoying and I am just not, I can't.

So here's what happened in my final 2 years of college. In my college, people rarely good internships after their second year and I got several offers from startups and 2 Fortune 100 companies. It might seem like a brag, and it maybe is, I just want to feel good a little bit, so please allow it. I chose one Fortune 100 and although the internship went okayish, I wasn't too sad, I was happy.

Just before I reached my final year, I finally got my own laptop and it was a great one, for techies it was MSI GL-65 9SEK, it had i7-9750 and a RTX 2060, a massive upgrade from my previous one MX950 graphics.

So things were looking up, I was in the final few rounds of getting an internship in Google and that through their online portal, out of millions of candidates, I was really up, I had passed initial rounds of Visa. So I was there, I considered myself to be up there with the best. I didn't get either and although that stung, and this was in early 3rd year of my college life, but I was never depressed.

But here comes the kicker and this started something I didn't knew then, in our college for each course there are many professors and I usually pick at random the prof, and I chose someone I shouldn't have, that professor drove me through the mud literally, I didn't know why I was made an example of but I was. I never went to class, I believe that's the reason but she did her best to not only flunk me but end my entire chance of getting a good job at the end, she did everything in her capability, that prof REDUCED MY MARKS AFTER SHE HAD AWARDED THEM, she DID THE SAME FOR MY PROJECT, she didn't even see or grade that, I was lucky that the final papers are randomised and given to different professors, I literally scraped by that paper. She had me visiting her cabin everyday 3-4 times a day, and waiting around for most of it as she wasn't present, she tried her best to mean the worst possible stuff without actually saying it, even at the end, she told me okay I will recheck your project, bring it, and then when I brought it, she said this isn't what I wanted, didn't see that, for the report, I made my best effort, she told me you shouldn't have added this, I won't accept this, and although I wasn't into comparison then, a guy who did nothing but was her favourite, just because he sucked up to her, added the same parts and he got great grades. I went to my Head of Department, he literally said ""We can't interfere with internal marks"" and even after I explained everything, he didn't even write a complaint. My uni has never been good at handling complaints about professor and students are slaves, so the earlier comment about the uni being ""good"" is in respect to the rankings, research and placement. But then the grades came out, I barely passed, I didn't want to extend this ordeal, so I just left it.

Now here's the final year of my college, the year I should be enjoying. Covid came, I went home. I studied hard for the placements, was rejected by my dream companies, but that didn't make me too sad as there were excellent companies lined up, I got in to an investment bank, a big Investment Bank, I was happy, I will join once this sem ends, if I get through to it or I am allowed to get through. My dad got a promotion to a very senior post, was offered a laptop, he took my old laptop, which I just got a few months back, and I took the Macbook Pro, its great, I got a high speed internet at my home. And although it seems I am getting everything I ever wanted after not even getting clothes for many years,  I wasn't happy with these. So I am in my final sem, doing my capstone project and it just has been something I don't understand. Although it may look I have great luck based on my paragraph, it really hasn't been, times were not bad I will concede that but it hasn't been good, during the initial days of my brothers problem, we didn't have enough to eat, I didn't have pens to write the exam, then I didn't get into colleges I wanted (yes this is a spoilt kid thing to say), I didn't have my own stuff, my shoes which I wore in college were torn, the laptop I was given, didn't have a working battery but it worked good on charge(so make of it what you want), I never had enough money on me to got out, my friends did, I always stayed at the room, sometimes they took me with them, they paid for it, grades were good but considering what others got without them even knowing anything, it was bad. So yes life wasn't too good, but it wasn't bad, I never felt too bad about this because it was what it was.

So in my final semester, I was enjoying, great job, freedom, but it changed and changed abruptly. And although I was getting stuff I never had, but the mental side of it changed, its like a reverse of what it was, now I have stuff but I am not even remotely close to being peaceful. I don't even understand know, it just feels like I'm a ball anyone is doing what they want, pushing me around, stomping on me, throwing me away, I just don't understand, for the final Capstone Project, for my first review I had done a lot especially compared to others but the way the first review went, I can't even understand how or why, my presentation wasn't looked at all, I just started and I was attacked by the panel on things that doesn't even make sense. I will say this, my presentation skills are not great, but they aren't bad and as I understand before they making assumptions I should have at least been heard, they didn't. They made assumptions, didn't let me speak, spoke over me and its just that, left it at that. The days before that weren't great either, there always was a sense of impending doom, I don't know why I just wasn't me. And although it never has been the same since I came back, it has been worse, everything that can go wrong is going wrong, everyone I see is enjoying great luck, my friends are enjoying, a friend who I know isn't even good at these stuff, copied the stuff from the internet is enjoying great times, sometimes I just don't understand what's the point of me working honestly, diligently when I have never been repaid, and when I have its not what I wanted, I didn't get the college I wanted, not the grades, not the stuff, not the Job(although the one I have is great, but it wasn't my dream one), not the girl, not anything. When others just have a great time and get what they want, what's the point of me struggling out there, trying my best when all life has done is throw me around, when I am just a ball being pushed around by anyone, any way they want, what's the point of me doing good stuffs, I believe myself to be a good person, I always donate, help others whenever I can, even went without food once because I gave my food to a needy person, help my mom with all the chores, help my dad whenever he has to write something, helped others fill in college applications, help everyone but not get anything in return, where's my karma, where's my good luck, when do I get something I want, not those electronics I could have lived without that. Wheres my good luck which everyone seems to enjoy, where's my payment of my due. I don't understand anything, there has been a lot of small stuffs going on over these period which individually is big but together has made my life miserable. I probably think I'm depressed I haven't had a good laugh in months, maybe since the start of COVID.

I know it may seem like one bad review and I was done, it isn't, I have had bad reviews, been punished. But this is just one of the biggest ones in these periods, there have many which are small individually but combined in the same time frame, I just don't understand, I can't make heads or tails of what has been going on. And it is okay to call me spoilt, I do that myself.

I know it is too long and I know most people wouldn't be bothered to read it, personally I wouldn't, I just wanted to get it out and if anyone is reading, say anything, even adding if adult life is like this.

Thank you.

TLDR: Happy but hard childhood, clueless what is going on now, nothing makes sense, nothing is good, nothing makes me happy, not items nothing.

I'm an incoming freshman and I'm having some trouble deciding between these 3 schools. Just wondering which school would be best if I wanted to go to grad school, but also want good internship opportunities. For more context, I made a pro/con list:

**CalPoly SLO (CE)**

Calpoly Pros:

\- small classes, easy to get in touch with professors

\- solid, hands-on CE program

\- $29k in-state cost per year (cost doesn't matter much to me)

\- good undergrad internship opportunities

\- really high employment rate out of college

CalPoly Cons:

\- not that prestigious outside of CA

\- lack of research opportunities (I heard they're there, but you really have to look for them)

\- I want to do grad school but at a more prestigious program, so I'll have to deal with that whole process

\- rather isolated location

**Purdue (CS)**

Purdue Pros:

\- really prestigious CS program

\- good job potential

\- know a decent amount of ppl that go here

\- gorgeous campus

Purdue Cons:

* $45k a year
* from what I've heard, its a very cutthroat environment
* a lot of the CS classes weed out people/program is super hard
* gloomy weather
* larger class sizes
* in the middle of nowhere
* food is pretty bad from what I've heard

**UW Madison (CS)**

UW Pros:

* Most of the same pros as Purdue
* More chill than Purdue

UW Cons:

* Same cons as Purdue
* $55k a year
* Even colder weather than Purdue"

I'm a junior DS transfer expecting to graduate in spring 2022. So, this summer was kind of my last and only shot I had for a summer Internship. If you are in the same situation.. Trust me,  IT IS POSSIBLE, YOU JUST GOTTA GRIND!

Tips:

1. Update your resume constantly, every time you've finished a project, make sure to add it if relevant to the position you are trying to get! In all my interviews they wanted me to talk about the projects that I did both in DATA8 and DATA100.
2. USE BERKELEY'S HANDSHAKE.  If they post in there, its because they are particularly interested in Berkeley students. Make sure to take advantage of this fact and apply through handshake as it leads to an interview most often than any other platform(In my experience).
3. Make sure to ask questions to the recruiter! Trust me, they want you to succeed. Asking them questions about the nature of the interview and how to prepare for your interview will showcase your interest in getting that role. You are standing out from the competition without even noticing!
4. Be prepared for coding questions! I know coding might not be the strongest suit for a DS major in general. And I would argue that interviewers shouldn't give that much weight to coding challenging questions when you are trying to get a DS position. But, It is what it is. So, make sure to go over your previous homework's, labs of 61a and familiarize with data structures from 61B and brush up a bit of SQL before an interviewer coding challenge. 
5. Dress to impress! I know we are way past the era of ""judging by peoples looks"" but come on man. We all have implicit biases, dressing nice for your interview never hurts!
6. DONT GIVE UP!

I'm the most average guy you will ever meet, but feel free to ask me any other questions you might have. GOBEARS!"

So I'm a CC transfer applicant who applied as math-cs as their first choice. I know this program is not a CS program nor is it a replacement for one. I applied to it because while I applied to other UCs as CS, math is my favorite subject and I saw that you still take CS courses as part of the curriculum. So this program seems to be the right fit for me. My dad, however, is not very happy with this program being my first choice as he thinks that it will be difficult to obtain a job and/or internships related to software engineering or programming. I would like to complete at least one SE/programming internship during my time in undergrad. I was under the impression that your degree doesn't matter too much for these sorts of job,  and your skills are the most important. So any input from math-cs students/graduates would be appreciated.  


TL;DR Dad thinks if I enter UCSD's math-cs program that I won't be able to find internships or a job in software engineering or programming after graduating. Would like to hear from math-cs students/grads on their experience finding software engineering internships?"

I guess my goal to make the transition easier when I graduate, and reinforce the things I've already learned, while earning money. I'm in a weird spot with the order of my degree, so I'm hoping that if there are companies that are good about mentoring, they would be open to working with me.

It's outside London and considering, the pay is in the upper bracket of what graduate can be expected to earn (excluding the unicorn, Quant type jobs).

Not going to lie. I'm here for the money. Primary as I want to achieve financial independence and explore opportunities / ideas / entrepreneurship in CS. I've long had this idea, before it became mainstream to ""screw the 9to5"".

Realistically, this is going to be really difficult to achieve taking the 9to5 route in the UK unless I get very lucky, but it's the most sensible way that impose huge risk.

I've been looking at jobs in Silicon Valley, and I'm quite frankly amazed at the compensation available over there for software developers in FANG and various other companies, I'm seeing interns and fresh graduate claiming to earn $100k + bonuses and allowances. I appreciate the cost of living is much hirer (even considering London), but all factored in, that's insane, and I wouldn't be looking at entry level positions. It would approximately take be 5 -  10 years to gain complete financial independence (via investment and property) at the rate they pay there.

Is this actually reality?

I understand that as a UK citizen, it won't be easy for me to just, get up and go there and these are the higher end ""elite"" level jobs. I'm ambitious, and have a good track record of exceeding my own expectation, so I am sure I can find a way in...

Has any non-US citizen worked in Silicon Valley? What was your process of getting ""in""?"
mvtag0,34,2021-04-21,I am at a crossroads with my career.,abacat96,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/mvtag0/i_am_at_a_crossroads_with_my_career/,"I (25F) graduated with my bachelor's degree in business administration from my state's largest university in 2018. I scored an internship at a local wholesale distribution company while I was in college, and was hired full-time upon graduating. While at this company, I have worked reception/front desk ordering, human resources, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and now credit (collections/finance). I have also been cross trained in logistics/transportation and inventory management. Basically, I am the company's jack of all trades... and I feel like the master of none. 

I have had to beg my supervisors for promotions/raises. We don't always get an annual review in my department because the managers ""forget"", and HR is a joke. It's a relatively small company with about 200-250 employees, and my department is extremely small (8 including my two supervisors) so there really isn't any room for career growth unless someone retires. I was recently blamed for the mistake of one of my newer coworkers, and this was the final straw for me. I'm going nowhere fast with this company and it makes me sick to my stomach that I've done so much for them over the past 4+ years. I also moved a year ago and now have an hour commute one-way, and I'm getting really tired of driving that far for that job. 

I've been looking to leave my job for about a year now, but I've been a bit gun shy to find something new (especially with Covid). The more I look for potential jobs, the more I realize that my business degree is pretty much worthless. I'd most likely be taking at least a couple dollar per hour pay cut if I leave my current job, and the work would most likely be mainly clerical for a few years. The jobs I typically view are bank teller, accounting (no CPA), HR generalist, administrative, etc. I'm aware that these jobs can open up bigger opportunities at many companies, but the few jobs I've interviewed for have discouraged any career growth, which blows my mind. 

I have a good chunk of debt to pay off, big dreams and the desire to grow my career. I'm not content with working an office job that just barely pays my bills and keeps me moderately miserable. When I started college, I was a nursing major and decided to switch to business after 2 full years due to cold feet about the nursing profession (I was worried about burnout, working nights/holidays, patient suffering/death). I have considered seeing if my college credits will transfer over to a community college, and maybe I could graduate with my associate's degree in nursing in less than the standard two years. I feel like I've grown a much thicker skin in the past few years and I do still have a strong passion for healthcare. But again, I have bills to pay, no support and don't know if I could make time to go to back to school and continue to work full time. 

Has anyone hit a point early on in their careers where they've made a big change? I can imagine that it only gets harder the older you get, so now is probably the time to do it if I'm going to do it at all. What kind of jobs would be good options for me to utilize my business degree and make a good income? Or should I shift gears now?

I want to get into IT but can't seem to get my foot in the door.,kingpinneapple188,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/mvtcj0/hey_i_want_to_get_into_it_but_cant_seem_to_get_my/,"TL:DR I have minimum experience but know my way around some very basic tasks. Do I really need schooling/Certificates to land a basic help desk or Repair job?

Hi! I'm sure you see dozens of these posts a day and that they all likely read the same, but I would really appreciate some advice and guidance. I love the idea of working in IT and have always been in love with computers and software. In fact, it's about all I am passionate about/care about. I love to build and repair pc's and even would like to get into soldering and repairing mobile devices and laptops. To be honest, it really wouldn't matter to me if I repaired a printer or a computer. I just love technology and learning what makes it work and how to fix it. 

A little about me, I am am in my early 20's and just recently dropped out of college. Not sure if that's a great start, but I want to be as honest and detailed as possible to get the best advice. I was in school initially for CIS and transitioned to community college for IT certificate classes once I learned the hard way that CIS wasn't for me. How did I perform? Well, not well. I passed my intro classes and even quite enjoyed the content and information in them, but I have historically hated school. Everything about it seems like a waste of time to me, even when I earnestly tried to enjoy the experience. What was a waste of time? The homework, the weekly tests, the professors etc. The whole time I was in a lecture, I would love to learn and would write notes vigorously and in great detail, do the assignments in class and go to the labs with classmates and enjoy it all! But as soon as I had homework with 55 multiple choice questions with a weekly test that was about twice as long with the same questions, I would think to myself ""I'd rather practice this and work than be here for the grade"". Eventually, even with passing grades, I'd stop coming to class and go online and learn the same or similar content on my own and find it much more rewarding without the ""game of school"" holding me down. I'm a very hands on person, I like to work with THINGS. Tangible items that I can hold and move around. Theory is great, and it's necessary to learn skills, but I don't learn from a test. I learn from opening a side panel and analyzing the components inside. 

I took a semester break to go back to work. I began to work at a supermarket chain and quickly rose to management in the online business and commerce department. This was also around the time C-19 was in full swing (March of last year). So, I began to work more, and more. I got a few raises and am making some really solid cash. Around August, my Uni called me and asked when or if I was going to re-apply for my fall semester. I declined. Admittedly, in that year or so of time, I hadn't done much research or developed any new skills in IT. However, this semester (Spring 2021) I re-applied and took a few more courses to learn the information for a couple different certificates. One being Windows apps (Excel, Word, PPT and Access) and Net Sec+. I thought maybe after a year break, my mental would reset and I would come back to school with new vigor and eagerness to pass the class. I did not. It was EXACTLY the same as before. Only this time, I took fewer courses. I have come to the conclusion that the old cliché' of ""school is not for everyone"" applies to me, but the zeitgeist is getting to me. I have been told by family I need a degree, especially without experience. Friends in the industry tell me it's all about experience and landing that first job, doing well and growing your skill set. How to go about that? Get certs. Learn Linux etc. Which is all fine and dandy, but I don't know how to go abut that without going to a school. I have found some websites that offer the material online and then after finishing the material, you can go and take the cert. test, but am not sure if that is the best approach. I have also been networking with people at work in IT, asking for available positions, what would I be doing etc. A former employee of mine has a fiancé who is working at a startup repair company and asked me to call the boss, and inquire. I have not yet, only because I don't know how professional it would be to contact someone like that after a past work history (though we worked well together and she left on excellent terms). I have even applied at about a dozen different repair shops in my area for iPhone, Computer hardware etc. None have gotten back to me. Not that I blame them.

Another issue I have with hiring is my experience. I'm just going to be honest, I have none. I mean, I have built several computers, fixed more for family and friends, can navigate windows and solves performance issues etc, but I know that those are basic skills and are dime a dozen. I would love to learn more, and want to learn more. I have an excellent work ethic, and even love to work. Learning new skills is fun to me, and mastery is something I value higher than most things in life. Unfortunately, I know that's not good enough on it's own to get a position when employers value experience so highly. Which puts me in quite the pickle. How do I go about getting said experience? Do I grind out certificates and take the hit at school? I can't really apply for internships either, now that I am dropped out. Do I network and rely entirely on finding the right person at the right time and place? I can fix a computer, I know the basics of a laptop. I can navigate windows and pilot software such as the Microsoft work suite and even apple's iWork etc. I'm sure I can do more with some training as well. I don't expect to be great, have high pay, or get a great position, I just want to start. I suppose that's the crux of my issue. Where do I start? HOW do I start? Am I even in the right field? 

Sorry for the lengthy post, but this seems to be a great place for information and insight. If you made it this far, thank you for hearing me out."

Both Schreyer and Georgia Tech have their benefits, but I'm having trouble deciding which one to finalize with. I am planning on going to graduate school to pursue my master's degree, and my goal is to work at a Big Tech company. I listed my pros and cons for each school below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Georgia Tech Pros:**

- One of the top CS schools

\- Great recognition from employers

\- Lots of opportunities

**Georgia Tech Cons:**

\- Out of state and very far away (I'd prefer to stay close to home, but not highly important)

\- 50k per year for out of state tuition

\- Very rigorous from what I've heard (I feel like this may limit my time to focus on extra-curricular stuff, such as research, internships, or other projects)

**Schreyer Pros:**

\- In state and close to home, so I can visit family often

\- 30k per year with Honors college scholarship + in state tuition

\- All the benefits of the Honors college (priority registration, honors courses, smaller classes, etc.)

\- Easier courses compared to GT, which may allow me to focus more time and effort on outside of class projects

**Schreyer Cons:**

\- Not as prestigious as GT

\- May have less job opportunities compared to GT

&amp;#x200B;

My worry is that if I go to Schreyer, I may be missing out on a great opportunity, but please let me know your thoughts.

This is my perspective of the two colleges. If anything up here is inaccurate or if I'm missing anything that could be important, please let me know in the comments.  Thanks for the help."

My goal is to get a PhD in theoretical CS with a heavy focus on math and proving the limits of computability/provability. I did do interesting internships in the summer of 2018, 2019, and 2021 (upcoming) but none of them were research-focused.

So a few bullet points about my college career since it is a bit unique:

* Fall 2017-Spring 2019: Attended Cornell University, College of Engineering for Engineering Physics. Unfortunately due to academic pressure, mental health, and bad handling on my part my last semester went very poorly and I was dismissed for poor grades. Didn't have any research both because of workload and because it's hard for underclassmen to get into a lab
* Fall 2019: Took a semester off to work and focus on recovering both mentally and physically
* Spring 2020 - present: Transferred to University at Buffalo and switched to CS/Math. My GPA has been very high (3.8+) and I am set to graduate in Dec. 2021 with a BS in CS and a BA in math. Unfortunately, Spring 2020 is also when COVID hit the fan so haven't been able to work under any professor at UB either.

Overall, I think I might be too late. I do have good rapport with several of my professors (both in and out of class) but I doubt this will lead to real work with tangible results in time. Any guidance on what I should do do make myself more appealing to grad programs (particularly highly competitive ones) would be super appreciated. Thank you!"

I made a similar post to this recently in r/chemistry, but I wanted to ask here as well. I'm currently a freshmen in college. I'm majoring in Chemistry and just changed my mind on wanting to become a doctor. I've been talking with my family about alternatives (since I'm currently continuing down the Chemistry path) and it seemed like there isn't too much to do with a B.S. in Chemistry that gives you a comfortable life. Comp Sci on the other hand is a huge field that has opportunities everywhere and pays much better. I need to make a decision rather quickly as the end of the semester is near and I need to choose classes for next semester within a week. I had a few questions regarding this major change though for anyone who is able to answer.


1) How important is the school I attend for Comp Sci. I currently attend an average-level school in Virginia (not a very good comp sci program) but I know I'd be able to transfer to any other school in the state. Does going to a better school matter a lot? I ask this because I'd have to give up a full ride scholarship.


2) How competitive are internships and opportunities within the comp sci field? I have absolutely no experience with coding and programming outside of some courses I took in high school. Does this put me very far behind?


3) What are some of your thoughts on this possible switch? I do like Chemistry a lot, but I don't know if it's worth lowering my quality of life and potential quality of life just for something that is interesting.


Thank you for reading and answering any questions that you can!"

For this year’s event, it was going to run a little bit different since the pandemic is still going on and safety measures are put in place. The event was going to run for 24 hours online, so the Quality team would have to take turns and run the event in shifts.

I think you’ll know where this is going based on the title and the background I’ve given already. Lo and behold, I got the 8pm to 8am shift of the event, though I was scheduled with another colleague so I didn’t really think anything of it. Also, every manufacturing plant has a night shift crew so I was certain it was going to feel as busy as morning. But I, being the overconfident idiot that I am, forgot that for the Quality team, our office was merged with the admins of the company who do not work night shifts.

I clocked into work at 8pm sharp that day, which allowed for the previous event shift teammates to finally go home. After that, it was just me and my buddy Shuqing in the entire admin office. Shuqing was conducting a quality quiz for the first batch of online night shift audience, so I didn’t really have anyone to talk to. Out of boredom, I started to pace around the office and notice something really weird. 

You see, within the admin office, there’s three little rooms where the site director, the site admin and the office manager sits. In one of the rooms, the office manager’s room, the light was still on and there was a muffled chanting audio playing in the background.
The door was clear glass, so I walked a little closer to peek into the room. There was a laptop on, playing something on youtube on loud speaker but I couldn’t read what it was. I thought that maybe the office manager was still here, maybe he went out for a break. 

I walked back to my seat and Shuqing was just chilling as she awaited the next group to come online. I asked her if Benny (the office manager) was in.

“Nope, he went home” Shuqing replies me, eyes still glued on her riveting game of Archero.

I asked her why the lights were on and there’s an open laptop playing something on loud speaker.

“Oh, I don’t know why but Darius told me that the lights have to be on and the buddhist chant too, the whole night. Until Benny comes back and he’ll turn it off. Also the door is locked so it’s not like we can turn it off right now, if you’re annoyed by it” Shuqing says casually.

“That sounds... freaking scary bro” I commented and she laughs. 

“You believe? I don’t” she rolls her eyes.

Things were fine after that, we took turns to play games and quizzes with different batches of personnel. It was roughly about 2:30am when Shuqing and I both heard knocking on the front glass door of the office. Shuqing nudges me with her elbow to go get it, it was probably a quality case or something. When I was walking to the front office door though, from far, I could see that there was nobody there. I turned back, thinking maybe we took too long to respond. But as I was walking back, the knocking on glass was heard again.

“Damn does it take you 5 hours just to get the door” Shuqing yells at me from the back of the office. 

“Shu, there’s no one at the door” I yelled back.

“Fuck off” she laughs. 

“I’m serious” I replied.

The banging grew louder, making me jump. I ran back to Shuqing, who was starting to lose the colour on her face.

“Look” she prompts me to turn my head towards the manager’s office that was pretty close to the main door.

The lights were off now. 

“Motion sensor?” I asked her, trying to be optimistic.

“Dude, they turned off sensor for that room specifically so that the light would be on the entire night, that’s what Benny said” Shuqing told me.

“Oh fuck you, NOW you believe?” I told her in a little bit of a panic.

Of course, the knocking was coming from inside the office, the banging was happening from the other end, the inside of the room. Whatever was knocking was doing it so strongly that the glass door itself was vibrating.

“No I don’t believe it’s a ghost, it might be a robber or something”

I rolled my eyes, this girl has got to be kidding me. The banging then stopped, and we both stared at the door. It was pretty far away from us, but we both still felt in danger.

“Fuck this, lets do the quiz session somewhere else” Shuqing told me.

But we couldn’t leave, the front office door was locked. We tried to tap our employee cards to the sensor and nothing happened, tried to push the release door button and nothing happened. The door was just not going to let us out. 

We went back to our seats and we started chatting away to try and keep the eerie office a little less imposing. I would be lying to you if I said I wasn’t scared out of my mind by this point. But finally it was my turn to conduct the quiz.

Things were going fine, Shuqing was next to me scrolling through Tiktok to try and distract herself from the possible robber in the office. But I knew that deep down, she knew this wasn’t normal. If she really did believe with all her heart that this was a robber, why hasn’t she contacted anyone else in the plant? I knew we were both on the same page about what was happening.

“Maya, can you repeat the explanation? Couldn’t hear you” one of the personnel, Elaine, said to me over Zoom as I was explaining the kahoot answers.

“Um okay...” and so I explained the answer again, only to be interrupted again. “Um can you just answer him, Maya?”

“Huh?” I asked.

“I don’t know, is that Boon? He keeps asking you why you turned the light off” Boon was the Quality director and my boss, and I can assure you Boon was not here.

I was silent on the Zoom call, until Elaine private messaged me and asked if everything was okay in the Admin office, to which I frantically typed for her to come and get us. She asked about Benny’s office, if that’s what “Boon” was referring to when he asked about the light. I told her yes, and she immediately said she’d come get me and Shuqing, leaving the zoom call promptly. I ended the Zoom not long after with a very awkward “there’s been some technical difficulty so I’ll just send an email of the answer explanations”.

I told Shuqing what happened and somehow, she got real mad, asking if this was an elaborate prank that Elaine and I were playing on her. I insisted pretty seriously that this was not at all a prank, and Shuqing stood up from our seats to look into the manager’s office.

The door was open now. And if we focused real hard we could hear something playing, it was the same Buddhist chanting but now it’s being played backwards. It was growing louder by the minute. The words were getting more and more deformed, whatever it was taunting us now by disrespecting the Buddhist chant audio that was left on.

And of course, all the lights in the office went out and Shuqing and I were left in darkness. Even our laptops went out. The only light source coming in was from the front office door that allowed for light from the corridor to enter. As if being in darkness wasn’t bad enough, there was a really pungent smell that started to fill up the office. It smelled like the back of a garbage collection truck, and I chocked a little on it.
Shuqing collapses out of nowhere, her body falling to the floor with a thud. I was frozen in place, too scared to react. I wasn’t sure if Shu fainted out of fear, or because it was doing it.

“Please, I didn’t turn off the light” I said softly to no one in particular, to the air around me, hoping to be spared.

I felt something scratch my hand, just a little scratch, a single scratch. It was slow, and it didn’t really hurt. It felt like someone used their index finger to graze their nail against it. I held my breath, wishing I could do something but I just couldn’t feel my limbs. That was the final thing I remembered before I passed out.

Nothing much happened after that, Shu and I were taken to the company medical bay to rest and recuperate, Elaine and her team kept us company the whole night till morning came. Elaine told Benny the events that unfold when he came into the med bay in the morning. Benny took one look at my swollen hand, and Shuqing’s swollen neck.

“You have to quit” was what he told us.

I was only on internship, so leaving wasn’t that big of a deal to me since I was supposed to leave in 2 months anyways. But Shuqing didn’t quit. Instead, she asked for a department transfer that wouldn’t require her to be around the admin office for the rest of her employment there. That seemed like a pretty good deal until 5 months later and I’m back in school, and see an article of a fatality in that same manufacturing plant. Take a guess who the fatality was."

Then, using the knowledge and experience I've gained through SAE, I plan on applying to an internship over the Fall/Spring, but specifically to a company that I have a connection to. 

Now, this company is like one the ""top 3"" in the aerospace industry, and considering I have a good relationship with some people who said they'd be willing to reference me, I think getting an interview is realistic.

But I guess I'm concerned about potentially having this company be my first internship in this backup plan because it just feels wrong (imposters syndrome?). 

Other aerospace companies want me to have a previous internship for ""experience"" but this company (arguably more prestigious and hardcore) doesn't care as much since my connections said that being heavily involved in SAE would definitely give me a good chance.

Now this is all a backup plan if I don't get an offer for the summer; but this is slowly becoming a real plan with each rejection email. Does this sound wise (banking on being successful on said company) or is it bad to go in this company with no internship experience?"

Some short details, i started antidepressants because of bad anxiety recommended by my doctor, i had to quit my internship because of my anxiety and since theres a whole pandemic going on i just sit at home all day doing school work. When i started antidepressants i could still enjoy little things and do my hobbies and school work properly. Now 2 antidepressants later that didn’t work and only gave me side effects, my doctor send me to a psychiatrist who made me take a DNA test (if i had some type of gene that made me react differently to antidepressants) anyway the results are gonna take a month so right now im not using any pills except for oxazepam when i need it.

Anyways heres the problem, since i got help and reached out i only felt way worse than i was. I lost all of my appetite, lost 7kg because of that. I can hardly do my school work and keep up with life. I haven’t touched any of my hobbies in weeks and the only thing i do all day is watch YouTube, sleep or watch tv. 

Mentally i feel worse than i have ever been. Since i got help i can hardly talk about my feelings at all, my doctor recommended keeping a diary but i cant even seem to write down what i feel. I almost stopped talking to most of my friends just because i just don’t feel like it anymore. I just feel like im not alive anymore but im just here, just some kind of filling.

Sleeping has been horrible, it takes me about an hour or two to fall asleep. Then during the night i wake up about 2 or 3 times with my heart beating really fast in my chest, then it takes me about an hour or so to fall asleep again.

I just cant seem to talk to anyone about how im feeling, cant even do it with my psychiatrist or therapist and when i do get something out of my mouth i just feel 10 times worse.

I simply don’t know what to do anymore.

(I don’t want anyone worrying about my safety because i know death or hurting myself is not an option, i got pets to feed everyday and my plants need water every week but i just don’t know how to enjoy life again.)"

I'm in the UK and I am in my early 30s. I am from a small industrial town with next to no opportunities at all for people who want to really get on in life in terms of having a good career and a good salary. Over 90% of everyone who lives and works in my town is in low-level menial work (mostly factories and warehouses, and also shops and labouring jobs). These jobs tend to pay the minimum wage or just slightly above that. It is a very industrial town and the majority of the town's inhabitants are employed in industrial warehouses. It is a really depressing place to live and there are literally so few opportunities or chances to do something better than warehouse work in my town. It's so sad. For anyone who dreams of a better life or who wants a nice career or to be doing something more meaningful, rewarding and fulfilling ....my town is not the place to be.

When I finished my GCSEs (in 2004), I stayed on in school to do A-levels in the sixth form, which I did and achieved really good grades (I did Double Award Business Studies and English Literature). Then I went to university in a city not too far from me, but I hated the degree and ended up dropping out during my first year of study. I went back to my hometown (the grey, depressing industrial town) and got a job in a warehouse. Despite the fact that the job was soooooooo physically grueling, and that it was low-paid (when compared to the national average, but actually a very good wage by my town's standards!) ....AND despite the fact that I was treated like absolute S\*\*T by the nasty supervisors and team leaders in there (they micromanaged everyone to the MAX....they even timed you on how long you would spend in the toilet. I'm not joking!!!!!!) ....I stayed in the job for an ENTIRE DECADE.

As I approached the tail end of my 20s and was nearing the age of 30, I really started doing some soul searching. I was long burned out from this physically grueling job, and had had enough of being treated like an animal by the bullying supervisors. I wanted to do something meaningful with my life, heck perhaps even something that I might possibly even enjoy, and something that would pay much better and just give me a better, and happier life. I wanted to improve myself so much. I had spent too long in this dead-end, low-level job being treated like dirt. I decided to go back to university and get a degree.

So, I quit the warehouse, moved to the capital city London for university, where I studied a Bachelor's degree in Journalism - and to really cut this short - I had the BEST three years of my life. I did three really cool internships at two national newspapers, I made really good friends from all over the world, met other people who were just like me (aspirational, ambitious, hard-working, dedicated to a meaningful career). And to top it all off, I graduated with a First Class Honours degree (a 4.0 GPA). I really believed my life was going in a good direction; I was so sure I was going to end up with a half-decent career at the very least, I had met the most amazing people I'd ever met in my whole life (even though most were so much younger than me), and I was so full of hope. During my three-years in London and at the university, I was the happiest I had ever been. Indeed, for the first time in my life, I knew what it was to be truly happy.

Just as I was finishing my final year of uni, the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world. I graduated at the worst possible time. Basically, to cut this short (the post is already tediously long, I know), I have been unemployed ever since graduating (it's been almost one full year since then). I briefly did some intermittent and temporary warehouse work in my hometown (yeah, I had to move back here) at the end of last year and that has been all I've managed to secure. I've had countless phone screenings/interviews on Zoom and even so many more applications - every single time rejected or ghosted (mostly the latter). Finding a graduate career - something I had long hoped for - has proved all but impossible.

I am starting to think my three-years at uni have been a waste and for nothing. I had been so full of hope. I had it all mapped out in my head. With my hard work, getting a First Class degree, and with three internships at internationally renowned and respected newspapers - I was so sure that I would end up staying in London and living there permanently (I really wanted that and still do want that so much); and that I'd be in at least a half-decent graduate/degree-level career. I now believe hand on my heart that this will not happen. Even without the pandemic, I am autistic and cannot make it through interviews. Interviews are paralysing and debilitating experiences for me - my disability means that i cannot deal with on-the-spot hypothetical abstract questions and that my nerves are amplified over 100 times that of a candidate who is not on the autistic spectrum. Looking back, my only real hope was to get one of my internships I did whilst at university converted into a full-time paid job, or to try and get somebody to ""get me in"" somewhere without an interview through nepotistic means (one of my journalism lecturers perhaps, or someone I had met at one of the internships). Going through the conventional route of applications and interviews, I must be real with myself - I will never, ever secure a job.

I feel like despite my best efforts, I am back to square one. But I am so determined not  to go back into a warehouse. I've decided I'd rather die than have that happen. I cannot take the grueling nature of that anymore and the way the supervisors treat you. Anyone who's worked in the industrial sector (in a warehouse or factory where you are micromanaged to the max, and pestered constantly over pick targets) will understand what I am talking about. I really do want to have a better life. I desperately want to improve myself.

I was thinking lately about setting up a business or going self-employed, but I have no money and I wouldn't know what to do. I've been trying to think of ideas of things to do as a solo self-employed person without any cash, but there isn't anything I can think of.

Guys, I really want advice and suggestions on what I should do with my life. I've been suffering from depression due to my unemployed situation - there are days I cannot get out of bed. Days where I contemplate really awful things. Do I just accept that I am destined to be a low-level warehouse worker here in my town who will never escape this town or this kind of crappy existence being treated like dirt? (Huge respect to people who stick those kinds of jobs out for an entire lifetime, like my now late father did and my mother is doing). Or is there maybe still some kind of hope....something that I could still possibly do to improve my situation and to have a better standard of living? I am a grown man, but I have to admit that there are days I just sit in my bedroom all on my own and cry.

I'm in total despair.

Thank you if you made it this far. It means the world."

I was recently admitted to some amazing schools like UVA, UNC Chapel Hill, USC, UCLA, CMU and Berkeley and am super grateful to have the fortune to choose.

Im dead-set on going to Business school🐍 and would possibly like to do a minor in something tech (CS, information systems etc). In the future I see myself either doing consulting, becoming an entrepreneur in the start-up space or being a media/ entertainment industry execute (very confusing I know I’m sorry😭)

Anyway, I’ve boiled my top choices down to CMU and Berkeley and cannot pick between the 2. Ignoring any cost factor, I would love advice on which school to choose.

CMU: Pros: Tepper is a 4 year program and has around 150 kids, private school w a lot more personal attention, small classes, great tech ecosystem and a minor is a part of the syllabus so I can do IS, HCI etc, also has a great design program in case I want to do product design, not curved classes/grade deflation —-&gt; I think I’ll stand out more at tepper???

Cons: Pittsburg is kinda dead, tooo cold, heard terrible things about the social life and workload (please bust the myths🥺), tepper is not as prestigious(debatable) or a feeder to consulting firms, idk how well it recruits to west coast(or internships), less school spirit so possible weaker alumni network than Berkeley

Berkeley

Pros: californiaaaaa, seems like more well rounded college experience, Silicon Valley, state school so diverse amazing people, haas dominates the west coast so recruiting and internships are easier, already have a small community of people I gel with, also road trips and food&gt;&gt;&gt;

After a lot of practice and thought, I have been learning to code and joining a bootcamp immersive soon to learn web development. It's a 6 month immersive that will require a lot of sustained focus each day + after hours study. Again, I am not medicated but have been going to therapy to reduce anxiety/depression which has made my focus a little better than it was when I was working. My therapist also has ADHD and has helped me cope with symptoms.  


I'm looking for advice from anyone who went through an education program (university/college, trade school, self-taught, apprenticeship, internship, etc) on tips regarding how to stay alert, focused, and try to avoid boredom/burnout. I'm generally good with gaining breadth of knowledge (wikipedia rabbit hole go brrrr) but struggle with depth. For this immersive I will need both and I have quite a bit of anxiety about being able to keep up.

I won't lie, I'm frustrated. I don't know how to move forward from here. I'm currently in my third year in college majoring in history (useless degree commentary incoming).

When I was just 17 everything seemed great. I'd gotten into a good university close to my home in Boston (not Ivy league but a very high ranking and prestigious school), and I'd planned out the future path. From a young age I'd always loved history, and I wanted to teach. I decided to go in with a history and education double major so I could just knock out the tests once I graduated and grab a teacher's license. Worst case scenario, I'd just stick with a history major and grab a master's in education afterwards. It would spend more time and money but I'd still get there. I was fortunate that my father saved a lot of money and had a good job, so between the family savings and me taking an extra fast food job outside of school, the only loans I'd need would be federal subsidized loans, so while I would have debt I wouldn't be sitting with 50k+ levels of debt. 

The first sign of trouble was probably the fact that trying to work fast food immediately after school until late night just wasn't good for my grades. I'd sort of cruised through high school easily and I thought it could translate into college, but it was a lot more difficult than I expected, and working on the side killed study time and left me mentally exhausted. My GPA isn't atrocious, but it's not something I'd feel confident applying to graduate school for except for the scammy for-profit schools with low reputations. That's alright, it just means I have to commit hard to the double major and just graduate. Once I have the licenses I'll still be qualified to teach anyway.

Then Covid hit, and I lost a student teaching opportunity due to the pandemic. *This was a requirement for the education major and a prerequisite for a few classes*. I called up the education department head and she said ""you cannot physically complete the education program, unless you take an extra year"". Fine, it's going to be tough to pay for since federal loans might not cover a fifth year, but me and my family can make it work out, just not much money left to spare since we've burned through the savings for college.

Right on cue, my father gets very sick. Every day he wakes up he's in severe pain. Goes to the doctor and now he needs several medications every day. It's quite clear that physically, he can't work much longer. He says he can keep going, but every day I see him like this I just want to cry, it hurts to see him in so much pain and stress just for me, and I know deep down all he wants to do is retire and enjoy his life before his body isn't confined to a hospital bed or something. Maybe let him finally buy a nice car for himself instead of constantly having to break his back trying to fix that old scrap heap he's been using for ages. Maybe let him go travel since he's never flown out for a vacation before.

So financially and grade-wise, graduate school is temporarily out of the question. While technically taking a fifth year of college is possible, I'd really rather not add to the financial burden. I could mooch off of my parents and live at home while working fast food or something, but again with my father's health in jeopardy I'd rather be able to earn enough to support myself so he doesn't. I'd also rather live in the Boston area, just so if anything happens to my father I can be there.

The problem is, of course, it's going to be hard finding a job that pays enough for me to save up for college with a B.A. in history. I really want to go back in time and kick my 17-year-old self for not coming up with a more useful backup plan. I was so committed to teaching that my only work experience is, well, teaching abroad in the summer and remotely, and working fast food. I never took any internships because I figured my teaching job would be powerful for any teaching job application. Obviously I'm trying to secure a non-teaching internship this summer, but so far the results have not been promising. I've done all the cover letters (even those that don't ask for it) and customized the resumes, and the only people who want to interview me are either ones with huge red flags or positions that pay very low on the job market with hours that wouldn't work with part-time graduate school. 

Things are at a crisis point. At the very least, I've promised my parents that I would get my degree, but lately I've been feeling less and less interested in what I study. The history classes that used to get me excited now bore me. As a junior, I don't have time to add a minor or switch majors without tacking on extra years, which defeats my whole objective. I feel like I'm about to drive right off a cliff, but I don't have the time to turn or stop. I have made some connections through my neighbors and family friends, but quite frankly I'm not sure how a doctor is going to help a history major with no science background get a job. Almost every half-decent job around here requires a specific degree and/or years of experience.

I'm deathly afraid that I won't be able to sustain myself financially and save up enough for graduate school. I spend all day and night just browsing job postings even though I'm still over a year out from graduating. I spend the time not looking at job postings fixing and firing off applications for internships. Lately I've begun wandering around aimlessly or just sitting frozen in thought for hours at a time. I don't sleep most nights because I just worry, and when I do fall asleep it's from the exhaustion of staying awake for days in a row. 

People spend so much time hating on the daily 9-5 Monday-Friday office cubicle jobs, but personally I'd love that (grass is greener on the other side, etc.). Having worked years on minimum wage fast food work, it's not something I can afford to do to support myself and save for school. I don't even need that much money honestly - I don't have Netflix, Amazon, etc. The only subscription I really ever buy is a sports streaming service for the football season, and after the season ends I just cancel. I know a few basic meals to cook and I'm trying to teach myself more, and in the worst case scenario I am fine with living off of ramen. Barely watch TV so I figure entertainment needs can be satisfied with Youtube, and at most ""fun"" activities can be limited to maybe takeout or a movie once a month, and some free museum events every year. Haven't gotten even close to a relationship since high school so I'm already mentally prepped to live alone for the rest of my life and never date, which saves even more money. Fine with living in a bad neighborhood with roommates. Heck, I'm fine with selling my car to save on upkeep and insurance, although that would limit me further geographically to just areas where the T runs. Never really big into the fashion world and my wardrobe is mostly populated with cheap plain T-shirts with a few bits of more formal wear when necessary.

Problem is, even with this level of self-denial I don't see much going for me. History degree doesn't help a lot for me. I could try to go for a generic clerical/administrative/office role but the ones that pay half decently want associate's degrees in business administration . . . the ones that don't need a degree pay minimum wage. Not much upward mobility possible either; these are all dead-end jobs that are slowly dying out from automation. Seems like these days, if you're not going into some sort of engineering, business, or computer science degree, you work paycheck to paycheck. According to the big brain folks at MIT the living wage for a single person is around 39k/yr here in Boston, and doing the math if I don't have a car, live with roommates, and otherwise stick to the no-happiness lifestyle listed above, I can barely make ends meet with 33k or so. I'll have to abandon my dream of going to graduate school, but I'll live. With no real upward path in these jobs I can expect to be at this level of pay for at least the next decade though. Ultimately, I only have myself to blame - for not thinking through what to do, for not picking a better major or backup plan, for not picking up a non-education related internship earlier to leverage into valid experience.

**tl:dr section**

In terms of the few tools I've got under my belt, I have three years' worth of teaching experience in a foreign country, and because of understaffing at that school I did also do some clerical/billing/administrative duties there, which I have a vague hope I can leverage into one of the higher paying office jobs. I've worked almost four years in fast food. On the side I also have done a little bit of work as a freelance musician over seven or so years, but thanks to an injury I don't think I can make it something I can live off of alone. And of course, I've got the useless B.A. in history that I'm expecting to secure next year, with incredibly mediocre GPA. In terms of what I need, I need something in the Boston area so I can respond to anything that happens to my incredibly sick and aging father, and something that I can afford to support myself with. Fine with living like a peasant with no TV, relationships, car, etc. Looking for something that might pay at least 30k; 33k would be a good point, 39k would be a miracle, 45k+ would be a sign from God or Allah or Vishnu or whatever. Prefer office work with 9-5 Mon-Fri just so I can have a little time to go visit parents or whatever, but if all I can qualify for is hard labor, if it pays well I guess I'll just have to get fit. And no matter what, I desperately cannot keep working minimum wage in fast food or retail. Graduate school or returning to school financially not an option unless I can earn enough to save up. Good knowledge of Google suite tools, Word, and Powerpoint through teaching work experience, somewhat rough with Excel but willing to teach myself. No internships outside of the education field, education license in my state would require an education degree. And if it helps, I've got no criminal history, no drugs, drink rarely and only on days where I won't be busy the next morning, no tattoos, and generally know how to behave in a polite manner. Had a plan to become a teacher but a variety of factors derailed it and I need to keep myself alive.

Looking for advice to just get a half-decent job where I can support myself and save for classes in the future. Bonus points for a job that has upward potential, but at this point I'm desperate. My coworker at the fast food store literally has a Ph.D. in history and can only work fast food. I don't know if I even have hope anymore. I do still have one more year before I actually graduate so I have a small window of time to prep. Not very good with numbers and science and coding, but if absolutely necessary I will give it the ol' college try.

I've also done a couple of stints with Launchcode.

I've been working in another industry (for family), and am finally looking to get into software development. I've been applying at various places at an increasing rate and have an opportunity I could take, but have concerns over the compensation. 

Initially, it's an internship opportunity, with a pretty low level of compensation ($10/hr). That would be for three months. After that, I'd likely (but not guaranteed) transition to a regular position which would  have a salary in the mid-50's. 

I don't know the average salary in the area for those with no related work experience, though the few places I have interviewed that disclosed their rates ranged from $65k to 80k+ with benefits. 

I was already hating the idea of $10/hr for three months, but was hoping the compensation on the backend would be better. So, I'm a little disappointed in the mid-50's number. 

Does anyone know what is typical in the KC area for just starting out?

I need to make a decision on this fairly soon, and I keep going back and forth on going forward with it, or waiting for something more substantial.

I am at a point in my life where I can absorb the limited financial benefits of both the salary and the internship, but in the short term it would still be a significant shortfall. It sounds like a great opportunity to learn, and the company seemed like a nice place to be, but I'm not sure it gets me to my long-term goals any faster."

* Previous experience developing web, mobile web, applications
* Experience with Java, Javascript, SQL, HTML/CSS, DevOps
* Experience with version control (git, hg, etc.)

The company I'm interested in is a popular app very similar to Myfitness pal.

Any advice on where how I should start would be greatly appreciated, I don't mind spending a couple of bucks but $600 month Canadian for Udacity is a bit(lot) to high!

Thank You."

I applied to about 60 positions and only got about 10 interviews. I messed up on a few of the interviews but 2 of them went extremely well. 

One of the places that went really well is a not-for-profit organization. They told me I would hear back within 3 weeks of my interview, but I never did so I emailed them to follow-up. I was told they wanted to bring me on for the summer, but they might not have the budget to do so. I said that's fine and to let me know if anything changed. I got an email this morning saying they were going to find out within the next 2 weeks what the situation is, but it seems very likely they will be able to bring me on and I would receive an official offer soon. They also asked if I would be able to start at the beginning of May and if I would be available to accept a contract for 35 hours/week. 

This is great news because I feel like I finally have something lined up for the summer. The only caveat is that I interviewed at a big financial firm this week and it was probably the best interview I've ever had. The hiring manager and I were having a normal conversation, all my answers landed perfectly and I had no anxiety throughout the interview. He ended the interview by telling me I seemed like a very confident and self-assured young man, and that my resume was great and I should give myself a pat on the back for being a great candidate. I was told he would finalize things with the HR/Recruiting person by the middle of next week. Nothing is for sure, but I felt very good about the interview and am hoping I will get an offer from them. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to kindly thank company A for the offer but still word it in a way that leaves the door open in case company B gives me an offer? The email I got this morning wasn't an actual offer, it's just confirming that if they are able to bring me on they will do so. Is there a way for me to say I appreciate the offer but want to wait until they can give me a concrete answer as to whether they can hire me or not?"

mwftki,23,2021-04-22,Some thoughts on private college counselors,LBP_2310,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mwftki/some_thoughts_on_private_college_counselors/,"Over the past few days, I've seen a couple of posts discussing private counselors and whether or not they're worth it. I also live in a a town where private college counseling services are as ubiquitous as SAT/ACT tutoring. I just thought I'd weigh in on the subject since I personally know many people who've hired counselors and I've read a decent amount about them. (As a disclaimer, I'm not an expert, and I've never actually worked in the industry myself.)

In my experience, there are two types of counselors. The first type are those whose focus is on helping students get into the right college for them—not necessarily the highest-ranked one. They work with students to help them develop a college list based on both personal fit and credentials. Some counselors might actually visit different schools or attend info sessions to get a better idea of what each school is like. They also help students stay organized and meet deadlines. If they offer essay help, they usually don't get too involved—they will help you brainstorm and act as someone to bounce ideas off of, and they will offer feedback on your essays to ensure you present yourself in the best way possible. They won't edit the essays directly though, nor will they tell you what to write.

The second type, and the type that's most common where I am, are those whose goal is to get students into the most competitive colleges. Unlike the first type of counselors who mainly work with students during the application process, these counselors take on an active role in their students' lives starting as early as 8th or 9th grade. They're able to use their professional networks to get their clients crazy extracurriculars. For example, one of my friend's counselors had connections to an Ivy professor and was able to hook them up with a research opportunity. Another friend's counselor used their position in a company to give them an impressive internship. 

There's a saying that goes ""it's not about what you know, it's about *who* you know"". This phrase is mostly used in reference to job applications, but it also holds true for seeking out activities. You generally need to know the right people to get the flashiest ECs (you can, say, find a research position by cold-calling professors, but the process is *much* quicker and easier if you have a well-connected counselor).

Because these counselors have so much oversight over their students' activities from such an early point in high school, they're able to create those ""spikes"" for their students that colleges like seeing. If they have a freshman who wants to pursue engineering, they'll think of a ""theme"" for that student that differentiates them from other engineering applicants, and then advise them on exactly which clubs to join and which classes to take (all while throwing engineering-related opportunities at them throughout high school).

During app season, they are very heavily involved with their students' applications. I've heard of private counselors who heavily edit or rewrite essays and who submit supplementary rec letters that the students wrote or helped write themselves (I've also seen counselors edit their students' research papers, but that's another story). Some of them might even look at their kids' activity descriptions to make sure they're framed in the most impressive way possible.

Now, are private counselors worth it? I won't comment on the ethics of this, but if your goal is to get into a top college at any and all costs, the second type is absolutely worth it. The problem is, the most successful ones seem to spread by word of mouth among parents (I first heard about these counselors from my mom who gossips with other kids' moms). You probably will be able to find such a counselor without much difficulty if you live in an affluent area with lots of rich parents (particularly if you go to a private school). If that doesn't describe your situation...RIP.

The first type of counselors are mainly worth it if you have trouble remembering deadlines or don't understand how to navigate the application process in general. A one-time session with a counselor could also be helpful if you aren't sure where to start with researching colleges or writing essays. Otherwise, I'm not so sure (you can find really good information for free on this subreddit or even College Confidential). That's just my 2₵—if you feel you'd benefit from a counselor and can afford one, talk to your parents about it.

Those are just some personal observations I've made mixed in with the research I did about private counseling. If you couldn't decide whether or not to hire a counselor, I hope this helps. Otherwise, I hope you at least learned something about how private counseling works."

And people will keep on saying the same advice ""Why don't you practice more?"", ""Maybe the problem is with them?"". Just remember it is their loss. And it is so annoying hearing the same advice asked to do the same thing over and over again. And then receiving those rejection emails. Those are the most depressing, in fact, one point they got to me.  If you ever find things like that getting to you, maybe it's time to just stop and think. What is it you are looking for in an internship? What do you want to get out of it? In fact, maybe just stop applying altogether, it could be worth it. Why waste your time on companies that you know will reject you all because they can't choose a great prospect (not considering the other candidates)? Because when it comes to your Mental health, that, in the end, is more important than getting an actual job itself.

All I'm saying is to step back and consider why am I doing this?  No, don't treat it as a simple question just ask WHY AM I DOING THIS?"

Trying to get advice on whether or not this would be a good first job out of college for me. I graduated cum laude last year with a bachelors degree in computer science. I worked through college designing and installing advanced saltwater reef aquariums(a passion of mine) and opted not to do an internship which I regret immensely as I did not realize the importance companies and hiring managers put onto professional experience. I have been having a really hard time finding a job and while normally I am articulate, knowledgeable, and well... normal, when I am in interviews I start stumbling words and become anxious/inept.

I am pretty sure I can get this system analyst job but I'm nervous that I am screwing myself career wise. I guess I'm just looking for advice on whether or not I should be happy with this position or if I should risk continuing my job search.

Would this job be a step towards system administration or would I be shooting myself in the foot right out of the gate?

I can post my resume if that helps too just seems like a lot of text already. Thanks for taking the time to read this and any feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated. Have a good day!

I am ""experienced"" software engineer at FANG with 5 yoe. Experienced is in quotes because five years isn't whole lot, but I'm definitely not new grad anymore. I've given dozens of interviews, was a manager for couple of years in my previous company, and met with hundreds of job seekers at career fairs. This subreddit was great when I was looking for new jobs, but it seems now more than ever saturated by either new grads or students, so wanted to give some perspectives on how to get that first job. Everything is my personal opinion, and will be geared towards people looking for entry level swe positions.

So you've been applying. You've had few bites here and there, but no real offer yet. Some people say job search is numbers game, which is true, to an extent. But if you spend some time introspecting on what you are lacking, then you can hugely improve your odds. There are three main components to job search: your resume, people skill, technical interview skill.

First your resume, this is your foundation. If the foundation is solid, it will make your job searching that much easier. You can tell your resume is lacking if your callback rate is low. If your resume isn't the best, then your focus should be improving this. Because it doesn't matter how good of engineer you are or master leetcoder, if you never get an interview in first place to able to show them. Formatting and wording is important, but what I usually look for when looking at resumes of new grads is whether they have internships or significant personal projects. Internship is usually better than personal projects, but if you are having hard time getting internship or it doesn't work with your timeline, then spend couple of months making personal project or, better yet, getting a group of friends to do a project and join hackathons. This not only boosts your resume but also gives you talking points in your interviews. 80 percent of the companies will ask you to tell them about something you built.

Now the personal skills. Or as I would like to call it, do you know how to function in a professional setting. If you pass the resume screening (and online assessments) first step is usually a recruiter call. They are looking for red flags and whether you are really interested in their company. So smile, look engaged, and most importantly sound excited for the opportunity. Do some research about the company beforehand, ask meaningful questions and not something like ""is the lunch free?""

Lastly the technical assessment. This is the most dreaded part for most people. Alas, there isn't a golden bullet here. You just have to grind. Grind leetcode, hit the books, and you will get better eventually. But be sure to leetcode intentionally. Meaning you don't always look at solutions after being stuck couple of minutes. If you had to look at a solution to solve a question, then try redoing it right away or the day after, you will be surprised how many questions you've done before you can't do anymore, this just means you didn't truly master the concept, so take it as sign to study more.

Lastly, learn from your failures. Unless you are very lucky or all star new grad from Stanford with 5 internships, you will fail your first interviews. The company will also never tell you what the issue was, so spend time on your own what you think went wrong. Was it technical question? Did you say something wrong? Were you too nervous? Debrief with your friends and mentors. And pat on yourself on the back, because that just means you just got that much better at interviewing.  Think of it as getting exp points in interviewing skills. Also remember that luck plays a huge factor in interviews. So keep trying and don't talk rejections personally. Learn from them and eventually you will have an offer.

Hope my perspective will be helpful to at least some of you. Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments. I'll answer all of them.

Edit: If you could do me a favor and ask your question as a top level comment, that would make it easier for me to find you. Thank you.
Edit2: Adding a couple of caveats here, I'm an American so some suggestions might not be as valid in your home country. Also it's for someone looking for a general SWE engineer role, so for breaking into specific industry like AI, embedded, etc, the process is a bit different."

Reason I dropped so much was because of a bunch of mental/family issues, but I can normally do much much better. I'm hoping there are some people who did horribly in their undergrad and still did fine after they graduated, cuz it's getting pretty difficult to keep going when I see no payoff for my work. Honestly if I didn't enjoy what I was doing I probably would've dropped out already. I applied for 100s of internships, got 3 interviews and 0 offers (1 for being overqualified, 1 being under qualified, and another was just some company policy that changed during the interview process). I'm gonna try my best this summer to work on side projects to be able to have something to put on my resume, but compared to my classmates with 3.5s, extra curriculars and internships/research positions I honestly don't compare to them at all other than determination and hard work.

The only CS classes I've taken is intro to CS, data structures, and principles &amp; techniques of data science. I am trying to get a SWE internship this summer, and I've gotten a few interviews, but I'm still waiting to hear back from companies. If I don't get an internship, I will build a few personal projects to showcase my skills.

With only one year left in my college education, is that enough time to prepare for a full-time SWE job after I graduate? I can graduate on time with a data science degree if I want to, but I am also considering taking an extra semester to take a class in computer architecture or discrete math. If I graduate on time, the only CS classes I'd be able to take would be database management systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence or computer security. Taking an extra semester would also allow me to apply to summer 2022 internships. However, I am out of state and an extra semester is pretty expensive, even though my family can afford it.

I'm trying to choose between UC Berkeley M.E.T. (a dual-degree program providing bachelor's degrees in EECS from the School of Engineering and Business Administration from HAAS) and Caltech.

Cost-wise, Caltech is around 10k cheaper than MET. However, right now I'm trying to evaluate the merits of each school versus another, so feel free to disregard it in your recommendations.

Some things about me:

* I have a strong technical tilt but would eventually like to move into management roles (open to but not necessarily in a rush to do so right now, however).
* I'm most interested in going into Machine Learning/AI, and especially those fields applied towards Medicine or Neuroscience. From what I understand, however, those fields typically require holding masters/PhD degrees to get recruited for.
* Planning to do Masters at a minimum. Potentially might consider PhD.
* Ideally, I want to the industry as soon as possible. However, if PhD is necessary to enter ML/AI roles, I'm open to that as well.
* Research is fairly important to me as well as from what I understand, it's essential for entering a good grad school. UCB has BAIR, which is really impressive. However, I am unsure how easy it would be to enter it. Caltech, on the other hand, is overall, a research powerhouse. That being said, I do not want to go into academia in the future.

Some pros that I currently associate with MET are:

* Guaranteed internships at Skydeck/Y-Comb Startups with 2k/month stipend.
* Great internship recruitment pipelines. The number of companies far outnumber the students. Access to FAANG seems high, which is valuable to me. Mr. Grimes seems pretty helpful thus far, and I've heard he helps a lot in recruitment.
* Top ranked Engineering (EECS is tied for 2nd in the US) + Business School (HAAS is 3rd in the US)
* Lots of AP/CC Credits Accepted. I could potentially graduate in 3 years or pursue a 4+1 master's program, coming out with 3 degrees in 5 years.

Some cons that I currently associate with MET:

* Doing research would mean pulling away from internships/industry, which MET seems to specialize in. Also unsure about the realisticness of entering BAIR.
* For companies that don't recognize the MET brand, Caltech might hold a stronger name.
* MET alumni network is still small (the first graduating class is 2021)

Some pros of Caltech:

* Research opportunities seem to be unparalleled. I feel these will help when applying to Grad School.
* Caltech has SURF', which is a summer research program with \~85% acceptance rate. Fellows receive $6,600 for the 10-week research period.
* Caltech's brand seems to be universally recognized. Don't have the catch of only being recognized at few companies like MET.
* Caltech students are also scarcer than Berkeley in general. For companies that don't recognize MET, Caltech might stick out more than Berkeley.
* Caltech does have a BEM (Business Economics &amp; Management), which will let me dive into the finance and quant parts from MET's Business Admin degree. Definitely not a full business administration degree but hits at parts that I'm

Some cons of Caltech:

* Doesn't have much of an industry focus, so venturing into that domain would be more difficult.
* Caltech BEM isn't anywhere close to being as well recognized as HAAS.
* I'm worried I might be funneled into more academia-related roles.

Any advice on either of the options would be really appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!"

I’m thinking, I’d like to dabble around in game developing. I’m a bit of an artist, but I don’t see myself making enough for a good life style as a visual artist. You can only achieve so much growth in the art field, the same applies to game development, but I feel like you can aim a lot higher in that field. I’ve decided, programming has the range to fulfill my ambitions. 

How would I go about getting into coding? I plan on ordering a book in the upcoming weeks, “The Art of Game Design”. I’d like to view the different perspectives of the field. I’ve heard game designing itself is tedious, so I might not look too far into it. I’m just looking around and trying to find something in the field I might enjoy. 

I’m 15, and I plan on applying for an IT Internship at my school. It’s not necessarily related, but having experience under my belt for the future seems important. I might learn more about technology. I was also thinking, participating in an internship might open future doors for me. I still might be able to obtain some valuable knowledge as well. 

Any advice as to how I can get into coding?"

Calc 2 should end with about a C (a b if I just ace this exam), though I might get a D or fail physics. I was also able to land a summer internship with a larger construction firm, and am very excited about it. With that, I wanted to ask some questions as a freshman/ sophomore Civil Engineering Student. 

,-Is retaking or not doing so hot in a class a sign that I should reconsider engineering, or just a trouble area that I need to work on (I can re take it without much issue, though it'll throw my schedule for a loop),

\-While I enjoy engineering, I have considered switching out to either something closer to Surveying or Construction management. Both are more hands on and less math heavy. Opinions on either?

\-Others in a similar position, how did you adjust. What did you do to make a change? I know I need to change some study habits and be better from the beginning, but what other tactics and ideas did you use to get through the last few calc classes and courses like statics?

\-What are some general tips for the next three years? I do plan to co-op as well.

(prestige vs fit)",[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mwnxje/am_i_stupid_for_not_choosing_the_more_prestigious/,"Edit: This might seem like a stupid post. Maybe it is. But I’m genuinely concerned about closing doors to certain career paths if I don’t choose UMich.

Long story short, I'm choosing between UMich Ross and USC Marshall. Obviously, UMich Ross is the better business school. But... after walking around campus and meeting current students, I'm leaning more towards USC. Ann Arbor is so pretty, but it just reminds me of my hometown, which I wanted to escape. Plus, the entire town seems to revolve around UMich, which makes it seem so small. And at USC, I feel like I'd fit in with the student body. 

Of course, when I told my friends this (who are all going to top schools for their major), they went ballistic and told me I was stupid for not choosing Ross. They basically told me USC was overrated and I wouldn't find any good jobs or internships, especially if I were to go into consulting. None of them seemed to care that I liked USC better or that UMich was 2x the cost of USC. 

This infuriates me so much, but at the same time I can't help but worry that they're right. What if I'm trading off the trajectory of my career for a measly 4 years of fun at undergrad? 

But at the same time, 4 years of my life is still 4 years of my life. And I'm sick of putting it on hold. 

Is anyone else in the same position (prestige vs fit?)"

2. Leetcode
   1. I think it would be better to start after I've taken Data Structures/Algorithm classes during my first year, unless I teach myself these courses with Coursera (worth it, tho?). I've heard many freshman internships involving coding test/interview...so I'm not sure how to approach these.

Hi there! I'm a rising senior in high school. I'm in the process of creating and finalizing my college list, and my intended major is CS/data science/stats. While researching universities, I noticed that a lot of them have CS under 2 schools i.e the engineering school and the arts and sciences or the liberal arts school. 

For instance, this is what's on UC Berkeley's website:

"" **There are two ways to study Computer Science (CS) at UC Berkeley:**

1. **Be admitted to the Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences (EECS) major in the College of Engineering (COE) as a freshman.** **This option leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.** 
2.  **Enter the College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S). This path is appropriate for people who are interested in a broader education in the sciences and arts.** ""

I was at a webinar recently, where it was mentioned that in cases like these, students at both colleges will have the same core CS classes, but their electives or their additional classes differ. For example, the students who study CS under the engineering school may have physics or chem as their additionals, while students under the liberal arts college may have a humanities subject. 

Does it look any different to employers or intern hirers if you've graduated with a  CS major from a liberal arts college rather than an engineering college? 

Building on that, is it viewed more favorably to employers if you do CS at a high ranked university that's not really known for CS, or at a lower ranked university that's incredible for CS? For eg, doing CS at Yale (known for its liberal arts) compared to doing CS at San Jose State or Penn State. 

tl;dr: 1. What's the difference between doing CS at an arts and sciences college and CS at an   
engineering college within the same university?

2.  What's the difference between a lower ranked university that's amazing for CS and a high   
ranked university that's not great for CS? How do the CS related opportunities available at   
each compare to one another?

I'd love to hear some of your thoughts on this. Thanks a lot, and have a good day!"

Secondary goals: Deepen technical skills to not be dependent on jobs that could be easily done by anybody.

Question: Which path should I follow for this goal under the assumption **(i)** that I only can choose between my current options **(ii)** I can choose openly between anything? Of course (i) is a very specific question, whereas I search for much broader and much more general advice with (ii).

**(i)** My current options:

* working student in a 3rd tier telecommunication provider as some sort of back office cloud administrator. Cloud not on the big players but on vmware but maybe I could break into IT-Security from there or work at Gaia-X projects.
* internship as data analyst in a global reinsurance company
* commercial analyst internship in a relatively big technology firm and work with Salesforce

**(ii)** General ideas I want to look into - what should I prioritize? - what would be interesting fields with my profile I didn't mention?:

* data analysis/science. Particularly, data engineering as I don't bother these by data scientists as ""boring"" considered tasks, but I had to somehow boost my technical/programming profile for that.
* IT-security
* data privacy maybe as an additional qualification

I also nearly landed a job as java developer (even though I'm beginner) recently, which I think would have served my primary and secondary goals quite nicely.

I’m in a dilemma here. 

I changed career last year, I was in a banking industry and left to get a degree in marketing instead. This degree required me to do an internship for at least 4 months. Because of covid I was scared of not finding anything so I started searching for the internship even before classes started and I found one pretty quickly actually so it was great.

The internship I found was perfect because it was with a digital marketing consultant so I got to participate in many strategic decisions, did so operation as well and got to work with various companies. The internship went really well, we started with 3 months, extended the internship for 3 more months and now my boss wants to hire me, now here’s the dilemma.

He is truly a great boss, always ready to help me, gives me a lot of time to learn new things, tries to give me new stuff to do while taking all responsibility if anything was to go wrong BUT I realised that I didn’t like working for as many clients as he does. When he hired me we talked about my future projects and I told him that after getting my degree I’d like to work a few months/years to build experience but my goal was to create my own business. 

I’m still inexperienced today but the business idea really grew on me and now I want to start by the end of 2021. So I suggested I’d go freelance until I finished my degree so he could give me the missions he didn’t have the time to do and I’d be free to stop after my degree but he told me that he really wanted to hire me fulltime.

On the other hand, my uncle is offering me to work freelance for his event planning company which I’d much rather do because I can focus on one company instead of working for 5 at the same time in totally different fields, I’d be freelance so much less constraining than a fulltime job BUT I know that working with family can be really tough (I know it firsthand because that uncle had issues with my other uncles because of work related problems) and I’d be on my own so I can test out stuff but there’s no one to guide me.

Something to take in account also is that I’m French and have full unemployment benefits until the beginning of 2022 so I could also not work at all and be payed to just get my degree which I’m not against at all but these could be good opportunities to get more experienced in this field... 

What would you guys do? I need some insights because no matter what I choose I hate being confrontational and don’t know how to say no so this is really a tough decision for me. I’m on mobile so I hope the formatting is ok and that I was clear enough in my explanations.

Tldr: 

As a newbie in marketing, would you rather:
- take a job you don’t really like and don’t envision doing long term but with a great boss and guaranteed work experience and guidance?
- work freelance for a family member with no guidance at all and knowing family business can cause issues BUT it’s freelance and you can manage your time however you want to work on your own project?
- just tell no to everyone and get unemployment benefits to get your degree easily and get started on your own project ASAP?"

I would like to move out permanently to Australia or Canada. I have done some research on the topic and I am quite confused on which of those countries is easier to get into and which route should I take (skilled migration, working holiday, visa sponsorship, or even an immigration agency). 

I have graduated in high school (EQF level 4, 5 years of studies) as a “Systems Developer” (focused on programming accountability software). I dropped out of college in the 2nd year (Computer science).

I have two years of work experience as a senior software developer (web focused) that I can easily demonstrate with a commendation letter, contract, pay slips, etc. (it is also my current occupation). I also have two months of web development internships that I can demonstrate with commendation letters and two years of freelance work that I do not know how I could demonstrate (web focused and software plugins. I have some customer's invoices).

I have also saved 8,000 euros and I am planning to have 12,000 saved by September 2021.

I’ll make a list of belongings I want to distribute to certain people and ask my brother to take responsibility in that. There are going to be three special letters: one for the team at which I intern right now, one for an acquaintance of my friend who I accidentally hurt and one for whoever will find me. 

At my internship I admire the team I work with, they are great people and know to some extent my suffering. However, I have been a bad intern, because of my hurting I was unable to finish a quality research. In my letter to them I apologize for my inability to be an reliable intern and I’ll thank them for being resourceful to my problems. For the acquaintance I’ll write about my regrets and apologize for not being able to talk to him face to face due corona. To whoever finds me I’ll apologize, introduce myself and shortly write why he or she found me. My best bet is to thank him or her for fulfilling the role in my death, maybe that keeps the person from developing regrets. 

I will poison myself on a late evening train on a Friday after work. This is the best moment to minimize disruption at my internship and making sure that my family finds out quickly before they get the chance to worry a lot and get very anxious of my disappearance. This way they get short notice from any hospital and quickly get their answers to why. 

Now my question to those who read till the end. First of all, I am thankful and second what do you think could improve on this plan so that collateral damage is minimized?

Thank you,

mwva4f,2,2021-04-23,My feelings about cs aren’t exactly the same as they were before i started my internship. Is it really like this?,lfreeman6490,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mwva4f/my_feelings_about_cs_arent_exactly_the_same_as/,"I’ve been at my internship for about 6 weeks now. Working part time until the semester finishes (a few more weeks) and then full time throughout summer. I was super grateful to get an internship, especially one focused on software development. I code for literally 8 hours a day every day...when there’s stuff to do. When there isn’t stuff to do i dread every moment of that. I don’t get excited to be here. It’s more like i sit down at my desk at 8 and immediately think “okay 8 hours to go” and i hate that mindset. I know most people don’t “love” their jobs but i don’t want to dread coming in either. I’m just wondering if this is a normal feeling at internships and first jobs or if it might be time to switch something. 

Contributing factors, I’m working with a tech stack I’ve never used before on a hardware full stack project that I’ve never done before. It seems like a TON of googling every day so far. It’s a small office without much communication throughout the day, my boss is super nice and helpful and i really like him though. Everyone here is super nice. It’s an hour away from where i live and I can’t stand the idea of spending 2 hours (sometimes more with traffic) every single day driving back and forth from work. It’s paid very very well for an internship and that should motivate me, but it doesn’t. I don’t seem to care about getting checks for 3k, it’s just very meh."

This summer the course is online.

1. Applied Science Communication 6-week-long summer course teaches transferable (soft) skills from using social media platforms (like Reddit) for science communication through blog writing, infographics, podcasting, video production, and more. The focus is on putting everything strategically together to help students communicate about their research interest/project. Counts toward CALS Written Expression and Science Communication minor. More info here: [HTTP://marksarvary.com/scicommcourse](HTTP://marksarvary.com/scicommcourse)
2. Summer internship with the Cayuga Lake Watershed Network. Apply ASAP. The emphasis is on climate change and sustainability. A great way to get paid and gain science writing skills. If interested, write to John Able [jfa5@cornell.edu](mailto:jfa5@cornell.edu). Info below:



SUMMER INTERNSHIP AVAILABLE. The Cayuga Lake Watershed Network (www.cayugalake.org), a nonprofit that is dedicated to protecting the watershed and its lake, seeks to hire a summer intern to compile and write a brochure modeled in part upon the successful 2020 publication, “Lakeshore Living in a Changing Climate” (download the pdf from https://www.cayugalake.org/resources/lakeside-living-and-climate-change/; and see also the essay by the author Abbey Yatsko about her summer 2020 internship experience on her blog at https://www.acrumb.com/home-page/reflecting-on-a-summer-with-the-cayuga-lake-watershed- network ). The intent of this new version is to bring together in a single handbook all of the informational resources that watershed residents of all economic levels might need for individual climate-friendly and water-friendly actions. The important objectives of this publication include 

&amp;#x200B;

* showing how everyday decisions by individuals can affect the water resources in the watershed, from surface runoff to creeks to groundwater and ultimately to the lake,   
 
* addressing issues of climate and environmental justice, and   
 
* informing readers that wise climate-friendly actions are not only economically favorable   
 in themselves but also can be financially supported by local, state and federal programs.   
 Although references and websites are available for the various separate aspects, the intern will be advised and supervised by the project leader, a CLWN board member, to integrate the ideas, methods and resources into an effective publication in both digital and print editions.   
 Preference given to a candidate who has a strong demonstrated interest in sustainability of the natural environment as well as a commitment to science communication. Appointment is for 10 weeks beginning in mid-June at the equivalent of 20 hours/week; remuneration is $3,000; candidates need to be equipped with their own internet-connected computer and word-processing software so that most work can be carried out remotely, although candidates are expected to be residing within the watershed over the summer. Applicants should please submit an email to the project leader at jfa5@cornell.edu with a cover message stating qualifications &amp; interests, a resumé and contact information for at least one local reference. Interviews to be conducted by Zoom, and finalists will be asked to provide writing samples."

I received an offer for a Network/Security Specialist/Engineer at a local VAR. This is more of an entry level networking/security position, but is exactly what I was looking for! I will be the installation and support engineer for data center/network solutions, helping with the design/implementation of security, network and cloud solutions, etc. I will also have the ability to try different things out if I would like, i.e. storage, virtualization, cloud, etc.

As a little background, I have an AAS in networking and my CCNA, studying CCNP at the moment, also have my eyes on a CWNP cert once I pass ENCOR. I worked desktop support for 8 months at a small private school, from there I went on to be an network infrastructure intern at a regional government agency for another 8 months. After my internship I ended up taking a level 1 service desk position (COVID and relocation had me taking any position). I have been at the SD for just under 9 months. I knew since I started that this was not going to be long term, I constantly had been looking at jobs somewhat casually since I started, nothing to serious until I came across this opportunity. I actually got contacted through some mutual connections about this new position, we started with some casual conversation and they became really interested in me, and one thing lead to another! The pay increase from the SD wasn’t as much as I was hoping for (43k&gt;48k + annual bonus), but I am just glad to be getting out of that hell hole, plus I am still young and have plenty of time to make more money lol!

Anyways, does any one have some tips for someone starting their first position like this? Both tips for getting started as well as tips to excel and be a helpful entry level engineer."

I have been struggling with things such as my health, mental health, relationships, and just LIFE in general but mostly just a lot of stress from being in college and close to the end of my junior year. I'm under a lot of pressure because of my classes and finding an internship in my field which is required to graduate. I was planning on graduating a semester early by buckling down and doing my intership over the summer and next fall semester while also splitting up the remaining classes I need. 

Without going into too much detail about everything it feels like life is just endlessly throwing me one thing after another for me to deal with. Over the past few months I have taken punch after punch from random things throughout my life that seem to be only there to try to take me down. I am happy and successful in many ways but these hard times have been dragging me down to a point where I am just so tired of doing this. 

My suicidal thoughts aren't what I call typical. I know to kill yourself is the worst thing of all so I would never ever even consider it. I want to be alive and happy and healthy and really live a life worth living. I don't want to die as in kill my bodily form and no longer be there for the people in my life. I don't want to exist. I wish I could stop existing in this world if only for a little while. Killing myself would solve the problem I'm having now yes, take away my pain (I often think of what I will be after my death and that bliss brings tears to my eyes). But it would create a horrible chain reaction of problems in the world and it would ruin my familys life, to cause that pain for them would be vicious. I dont want that. But if I could have simply never existed then all of those problems would be solved. 

Today my feelings have been really strong. I am so sensitive and I always have been which is really hard for me and my family members. The feeling ""I dont want to exist"" permeates through my mind. I started thinking of anything I could possible do to make it stop. To just be normal and not have a broken brain. So I looked up the number and called the hotline. It actually took a few minutes and strangely reminded me of being on hold with customer service but I did soon get connected to someone to talk to. It helped a bit I mostly wanted to hear someone elses voice who was listening to me. I cried a lot but eventually felt better and hung up. She gave me a lot of suggestions and made sure I was okay. It did help and I would definitely recommend giving them a call if you are in a bad place.

I don't really know where to go from here but I really just wish I could find a way to not exist."

Unfortunately being a first gen immigrant as a baby, my parents did not pave the path for me. I recently graduated with a CS degree from a small university. However it wasn’t until my last 2 years of undergrad was when I made the decision to leave bio-chem for tech. So from 2018-current I have been in this field. I did not know ANY syntax or algorithms prior to 2018. Most of my peers in my major were sooooo advanced, most had attended STEM camps as children. I was practically learning what they learned as 12 y/o. This was very discouraging, but I stuck through. However, now I’m graduated and still feel unqualified. I do not have any impressive projects up my sleeve or internship experience. Most of what I know is from the classroom. I am interested in web or software development.

Thus, I thought about doing something this summer alongside my work from home job, such as starting a homelab or getting my first certification.

The thing is, I’m having trouble figuring out what the goal of whatever homelab I’d build should be, or if there’d be something else I could do on my own that might look better on a resume.

You don’t have to be software engineer or data scientists to get a FANG job. 

Find another job role (such as Business Intelligence analyst) that requires coding knowledge (SQL) but doesn’t explicitly require a CS degree. Your CS degree and coding abilities will distinguish you from other candidates but at the same time you won’t be expected to solve leetcode problems. I wasn’t asked any hard technical interview questions, and I only make about 10-15k less than SWEs at my company with equivalent experience. 

To me the trade off for a little less $ is well worth it. My internships were in SWE and I found the expectations of deadlines and stand ups very stressful. To not have to bother with technical interviews and still make 90-95% of the sweaty Leetcoders salary is a huge life hack that I feel this subreddit should know about."

As a result, I want to learn more about coding and software in general, even though hardware remains my priority as of now. I have 2 questions:

1. In case I do want to end up working in software, would it be more beneficial for me to simply add a CS minor or should I try to switch into CompE? I understand that a switch to CS is out of question so I want to gain as much exposure to software while still focusing and learning about hardware primarily. Which of two would be more beneficial when applying for internships or jobs in software if I do end up deciding to go for SWE?
2. How bad of a position am I in right now if I'm looking to learn CS? I've started python about a month ago and am still somewhat of an amateur. As a result of my lack of knowledge currently, how badly would this affect the ECE or CS classes I plan to take? I can't do much this summer because I'm taking a couple online classes at Parkland so looking further than that, what do y'all advise me to do?

I've read quite a bit on this sub about how most ECE students end up working in software anyway which is what got me thinking."

For the past few months, I have spent all my time grinding learning Python and SQL, creating two different projects. Recently, I created a project that utilizes AWS Lambda, and this internship opening wants interns to learn AWS Lambda. My room is plastered with posters I made about SQL, my project's workflow, a Python function that confused me so I broke it down line by line, etc.

So, I have a drive to learn, but I feel like I am just somehow unqualified for the position. I know interns aren't expected of much, and that the intern is expected to learn over the course of the internship. 

I'm just afraid he will ask questions about DS&amp;A? I have started to take notes over a YouTube course, but the only thing I can talk about currently are singly and doubly linked lists. I'm going to go back on the grind and integrate Docker and Airflow into my project before the interview.

Any advice? To what extent does the behavioral aspect of an internship interview at a medium size startup outweigh the technical abilities? I love learning, and the feeling of making something makes programming so worth it. I just feel like I'm out of my scope technically."

I'm 30 years old, work as a project manager in tech, make $75,000 annually, Have $10,000 in savings, and $10,000 in my TFSA (8k in Wealth Simple &lt;7/10 risk&gt;, 1k in VSO etf, and 1k in Airbnb stock &lt;not doing so well lately lol&gt;). I currently live with a roommate and pay $1,250 for rent, and aside from rent, my cell, and food, I have no other expenses. I'm currently putting between $1,000 - $2,000 into my TFSA every month. 

My question for you all....is this it? Is this all there is? 

I feel like even while earning a half-decent income, and living far below my means I can't foresee myself ever being able to own a house, nor can I ever justify buying anything new for myself (furniture, electronics, etc), and feel like I did everything I was supposed to (went to the best uni in Canada, paid off all debts, did several unpaid internal internships, got a 'good' job, live below my means, etc.) yet I feel like at this rate I'll never be anything more than 'barely middle class'. 

Is there something I'm missing? Do I need to revamp my investment strategy - maybe take more risks? Make a career switch to something more profitable? Get a second job to help feed the saving? Apply for jobs in the US? Move to the middle of nowhere?

I come from a low income / financially illiterate family, and don't really have anyone to confide in here for direction, and somewhat feel like I made all the moves I was suppose to but now have no idea what to do.

I'm just kind of your averagely strong student... nothing outstanding. 

I'm interested in business, Econ, and maybe political science. The field I go into honestly depends on where I end up going to school/the programs I'm admitted to! I'm not super particular yet, but I like numbers, planning, and some creativity! 

Here are some things I value in a school. 

1) no lacs, women's colleges, or religious schools.

2) Not crazy Greek life. Some is fine, but not the point where the entire school is dominated by it! Think Michigan, not Dartmouth.... but no Greek life at all is chill too. 

3) No stress culture. UChicago lowkey sounds like a nightmare, and I really don't want to deal with classes that are IMPOSSIBLE for the sake of being impossible. 

4 strong at business, Econ, and/or poli sci in general. I'm still undecided, so I'd like to keep my options open!! I'd love a school that offers plenty of opportunities for internships (but not northeastern since the co-op schedule isn't my thing)

5) nothing super urban or super rural. I want a campus with a surrounding town! 

Other considerations:

weather: I fucking hate snow after living with it for 17 years, but like.... I'll tolerate it. 

this is vague, but not an overwhelmingly social activist guilt-tripping vibe? I'm super liberal, but I don't like the performative stuff I often see on social media. 

National merit money: I was considering UF, but I know benacquisto's getting defunded (fuck u Florida legislature). I'm still trying to look for money since I'm pretty positive that I'll qualify for NMSF. 


My current list:

Safeties: 

MSU 

UCF (they'll guarantee national merit full ride) 

Match: 

UF (if desantis vetos that dumbass bill) 

Reach: 

UMich Ross (in state) 

Super reach: 

Rice 

Maybe Cornell Hotel School? It seems really interesting. I need to do more research though. 

Upenn Wharton🤡

Harvard 🤡

Yale 🤡


Price is a consideration for sure (complex situation), but I'm willing to take out some loans if needed. I'll probably get decent fin aid though. 

So yeah! Please help me out!!"
mx7txg,0,2021-04-23,I was fired and just received an extra paycheck from my previous employer,hairpinlostinspace,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/mx7txg/i_was_fired_and_just_received_an_extra_paycheck/,"\[Texas\]

To keep it simple:

* I was fired/let go in Texas (my employer says ""with cause"" but it's sketchy - will explain below)
* Received my final paycheck on the usual schedule - it was smaller than expected but I didn't want to deal with them any further so didn't say anything.
* Today (2 weeks from previous paycheck) I received a full paycheck as if I was still working there.

Do I have to give this money back? I have been asking for my official termination notice since March but still have not received it. It's fucked up but I figured until they send me that they don't really have a leg to stand on? I am not usually so malicious but the company totally fucked me over so I really wouldn't feel bad pocketing it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested in the background:

* I was working for a consulting firm and in order for me to do my job I needed other coworkers to provide me with information/resources first.
* When my coworkers did not provide that information in a timely manner I was forced to find it myself in order to complete a project on time.
* I was given 3 projects that ran back to back with not even a day in between. I did nearly all of what my coworkers should have done and ended up working more than 60 hours a week including weekends.
* I expressed to both of my bosses that the workload was overwhelming and that I needed help from my coworkers or I wouldn't be able to stay in the job.
* I received help for one day before everyone began to ignore my messages again (we were communicating in Slack).
* 2 weeks later I was completely burnt out and hadn't been sleeping. I took a nap and overslept a meeting I had with an intern to prepare for another meeting we had that evening with a client. I had been up all night the night before trying to finish a presentation that still wasn't finished.
* When I woke up from the nap 2 of my projects had been reassigned and I knew it was bad but my boss acted like it was not a huge deal.
* I emailed over the weekend and asked to meet and discuss any consequences from the incident.
* When I went in my boss and her best friend (who they pretend is HR) started suggesting that I was going to be demoted or used as some sort of assistant since they could no longer put me on a project with that client.
* I retorted that I had expressed that the workload was too much and that they had a role to play in everything that happened.
* They refused to take any responsibility and I said I don't want to quit, I want them to fire me so I can collect unemployment. My boss said that I was being fired with cause.
* At this point I said I would leave then and that there was nothing else to discuss. They tried saying my notes didn't cover everything the client said (clients always change their minds), but I write my notes in a transcript format and my boss even acknowledged that I always take detailed notes.
* They also tried to use the argument that I had been slow to produce results in the past and that that combined with this recent incident were why they were firing me.
* I had never received any sort of negative feedback in the past and had even been told by my boss that I always responded well to feedback and ""took it to heart."" I also received a raise about 1-2 months before this incident.
* I am bipolar and my therapist is willing to put in writing that I was having a manic episode from being overly stressed. I am convinced I was fired for being upset as opposed to the reasons they are suggesting.
* I am convinced of this because the best friend told me so when I came to pick up my things. She told me that when my boss saw my ""demeanor and reaction"" that was when she decided that firing me was ""in my best interest.""
* The best friend also made comments about my new tattoo and nose piercing suggesting that I had been ""self-harming.""

&amp;#x200B;

* Since leaving I have had at least 3 coworkers express to me that they are also being overworked. I would never use their words against them, but just want to point out that it is not just me that felt/feels abused."

The interviews I did have just had someone who was slightly more qualified than me, always.   


I told myself that it is fine because I do have another job lined up for the summer and the company actually gives me an apartment so I don't have to worry about rent but it isn't related to CS. Now that I am seeing my friends get positions, I am just at an utter loss as to what to do. In this past year, I feel that I have taught myself two new programming languages, learned new frameworks and grown so much as a developer but also as a problem solver. I intentionally took harder and more challenging classes so that I could up my technical skills; I spent my winter break making a full-stack mobile app instead of just sitting down and not doing anything.  It just pains me so much to see people get jobs especially when I know that I am just as good of a developer if not better than them.   


I know that I can spend the summer getting better at my technical interviews and building more projects but man does it actually hurt. I just thought that I was actually good."
mx95j4,1,2021-04-23,Rejected for a job in favour of a much less qualified internal candidate. Finding it hard not to take personally. (Sports industry) Next steps?,sadjobseeker7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mx95j4/rejected_for_a_job_in_favour_of_a_much_less/,"Hi,

I'd really appreciate any opinions/advice.  


Background:

I'm 31 years-old I have a good university degree and I've worked in the sports industry for the last 11 years since graduating.

I recently applied for a job I was very well-qualified for at a company (lets say ""Sports Inc."") where I'd previously worked about 6 years ago. When I worked at Sports Inc. before I made friends and always received a lot of positive feedback. I left the company on good terms after 6 months. I was offered a more senior job with a more secure contract (the contract at Sports Inc. was just for 12 months) and in fact the more senior job I took wasn't one I had applied for; I was kind of head hunted.

2 years ago someone from Sports Inc. offered me the chance to come back - I turned it down but I did put forward someone who worked for me at the time. Sports Inc. hired this person on my recommendation and they have since progressed up the ladder at the company. So I did generally think I had a really good relationship with Sports Inc., albeit there are not many of my friends still left working there from when I was with them 6 years ago.  


TL;DR

Anyway I got an interview for this job at Sports Inc. a few weeks ago (a very similar low level job to the one I did at Sports Inc. 6 years ago). I felt confident I would get the job because pretty much my whole 11 year career background fits strongly with what they advertised for. I prepared thoroughly for the interview and answered their questions well. On paper I'm maybe a little overqualified for the role but I was deliberately humble in the interview and said I would be happy to start at the bottom end of their pay scale despite having earned more in the past.

I got a generic rejection email about a week after the interview and I was confused, but I assumed the people who interviewed me didn't like me on a personal level or there were even more experienced candidates than me.

I found out a few days after the rejection through social media that the person they hired is a 21 year old whose only previous career experience was as an intern (in an unrelated department) at Sports Inc.

Clearly the people hiring know this 21 year old personally and have worked in the same office as them recently, but I'm angry and upset that this has happened. I have 11 years of very relevant experience, a good record in more or less the exact same job in the exact same company and despite being straight up offered the job at the company a few years ago, I didn't take anything for granted and went through the application/interview process this time around.

On top of all this I looked up the 21 year old's social media profiles and there's some bad unprofessional stuff on there (homophobic and disablist comments). Stuff that would have put me off hiring them in the first place, especially given Sports Inc. have a pretty public profile.

I have asked for feedback on why they chose not to hire me but I have not had anything back yet.  


My self esteem is non-existent as a result of all this. A large part of me wants to expose the people who interviewed me at Sports Inc. to their bosses depending on what feedback they give me; spell out how they have hired this person with minimal experience and not even bothered to call me/give me feedback when on paper I'm a much stronger candidate. If they wanted to hire this intern, why even interview me? They could have told me unofficially through a mutual contact that they were planning on hiring from within the business, but they didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm being completely stupid and I just have a huge chip on my shoulder because of my own inadequacies, but I also feel I've been treated unfairly. Can someone more sensible/less bitter than me please let me know their opinion?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you"

In January I applied to a local tech company for a 4 month internship and got the internship. On the phone call and in the offer letter they had initially promised to pay me $30 per hour. 

However, now two weeks before the internship they just sent the employment agreement and in it it says they’ll pay $25 per hour. When I asked them if this is a typo they said no and that they chose to adjust the hourly wage. 

Now it’s too late for me to even look for any other opportunities, so I don’t know what to do. While I’m not desperate for money, this just shows to me that the company is unethical and is a huge red flag and am worried what will happen when I get hired/ if it’s a company worth working for? 

So should I just not sign the employment agreement and search for another internship (probably won’t find one this late so instead do side projects) or should I just take the internship and use it as a stepping stone? 

Would really appreciate any advice and thanks in advance."

I am worried about how I may explain these gaps to employers. Does it look really bad on my resume? I don't know. I feel like really pressured because my school's classes are really difficult and I do feel like it is impossible for me to balance school and working on my mental health. I also feel like I have to take time off to work on my mental health until I can comfortably balance work and my mental health because even if I do suck it up and force myself to finish my degree, my traumas are still going to be here and when I start working, I will be spending a lot of time and mental energy on well, working. So I feel like the situation does not really change even after I get my degree and start working.

I have a good job lined up with a good salary and benefits, but I am not excited for it at all.

In fact, as I think more and more about my future I am feeling sadder and sadder. I have only have two internships in college, which was my main perspective into the work world, but those were both very depressing. They were both 8-5 corporate engineering jobs where I went into an office for 8-9 hours a day to do 2-4 hours of work.

I cannot escape that I was lied to by everyone I. My life that graduating and getting a good job would make me feel happy and fulfilled, but I am now realizing that I do not think work will make me happy or fulfilled and rather it is simply a means of acquiring the money I need to live. I just felt so sad having so much of my time taken up by work and having almost no time to do the things I actually enjoy. Also, I hate that everyone else seems to just have accepted these poor conditions, especially when so much time is wasted at the office anyways.

I do not consider myself lazy as I graduated with honors from both my high school and college, but I really hate the idea of having to work a corporate job for the next 40 years of my life just to support a family with kids. 

At this point, I’m really not sure I even want kids if it means I have to work a job I hate to support them and I lose all my free time and freedom. Why make those sacrifices just for kids?

Anyways, I am feeling very sad about graduating (even though I didn’t have the best time in college because I dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression and I had to work hard because of engineering) and I’m not sure what to do. I am thinking about joining e peace corp but my current partner doesn’t seem like they would support that.

I honestly wish I had done an easier degree and partied and had fun through out college if I knew I was going to have leave college and work a depressing job regardless of what I majored in. I also know some people with easier degrees who seem to have the same level of jobs.

Anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings or patches other than general corporate work?"

Anyways, as a statistics Major I do have programming skills, even thought I don’t learn computer science as a major in school, I took two electives where I learned software best practices/data structures and algos and do a lot of software projects related to data science (dashboards, deployment, version control, learning a bit of mobile dev). A lot of my friends who are into data science took swe internships this summer because it was hard to get pure data science internships, but they were cs majors. For the upcoming recruiting season I was thinking about applying to swe roles as well. Just to have multiple options besides data science. My current coding background is using data science packages such as tidyverse in R, and pandas/sklearn and other machine learning libraries in python. 

Do hiring managers get hesitant about accepting statistics majors, or non cs majors for internships?"

I'm a sophomore right now so this would be my first internship.

Company A: This internship would be for the entire summer May-August mostly using C# and working with large data sets. The benefit for this one is I feel the C# skills would be more applicable for the future and a friend of mine works there and would essentially be my boss/supervisor so I feel it would be easy to learn from him. This company has more of a small startup feel to it and would be remote to start and then transition to in person likely. The pay is 18/hour.


Company B: This internship would only go for about 8-10 weeks from the beginning of June to early August. This would be fully remote the entirety of the internship. X++ would be what I use for this job which I know is similar to C#, but I feel wouldn't look as good on a resume. The company is a much larger older company and it's possible I'll work more than 40 hours some weeks and may have to work on weekends. The pay for this internship is 32/hour plus time and a half for any overtime.


Company B would be around $2-$3k more total as even though the pay is much different the internship with A is much longer. I'm leaning towards Company A as I feel I would have a better experience with them as I already know people there and the work seems slightly more interesting and marketable for future internships/jobs, but I also feel like it might be wrong to turn down the extra money, not because I need it but because I feel I'm selling myself short by taking almost half for the hourly. If pay was exactly equal I would choose Company A, but the difference makes me unsure. The remote factor of B also makes me lean towards A, because I'd like to make connections and I feel it's hard to do that over Zoom chats and emails. Company B is a bigger name and is a top company in their sector although they are mostly unknown outside of that sector, while Company A is much smaller with &lt;50 employees. 

Essentially my decision right now is between a better experience for less pay vs. better pay for a not as good experience.

Any thoughts? I've talked it over with friends and family and they're about as split as I am."
mxfng7,23,2021-04-24,I cannot believe what this office did to me.,_yuricchi,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mxfng7/i_cannot_believe_what_this_office_did_to_me/,"I just wanted to put this out into the universe because it absolutely blew my mind and I want others to know their worth when it comes to job searching. Note that it takes place in a span of five days. 

I applied for a receptionist position at a medical office, what type I am choosing not to specify, by, per job posting’s instructions, walking in with my resume and chatted with the office managers which they then moved me forward to talk to one of the three main doctors that own the office. They seemed to like me as I noticed nods of approval and I was then asked to meet the second doctor that same afternoon. This also went well so I was asked to meet the third doctor two days later as I was still employed and was scheduled for a full eight hour day and couldn’t make it in until then. Meeting with the third goes well so they ask if I can job shadow the following afternoon to “make sure it’s truly the job that I want.” Of course since I am still very much interested in the job, I agree to come in for two hours like we had discussed. The following day comes and the two hours pass so I ask to leave since this is a job shadowing after all and I am not being paid even if I do stay longer. However when I do ask the tone of the office manager’s voice sounds surprised and as if they were expecting me to stay for the remaining two hours they were open which would have put me at four hours in total. This is the first red flag but I agree to come back in the morning for the second job shadowing since I am trying to remain positive and hopefully cement me being hired for the position. This time they want me to be a little more hands on so I try my best but they get upset with me when I make a mistake filling some paperwork they asked me to try and fill out not even 30 minutes into the second job shadowing. Two hours pass and I ask to leave for an appointment but again they want me to come back in the afternoon. They must’ve seen the confused look under my mask because the office manager proceeds to explain that “they need to see more hands on from me and IF they decide to hire me they will reimburse me for the job shadowing hours.” It is at this point all my alarm bells go off. They mean to tell me that even after the two days of interviews and unpaid job shadowing that they are still hesitating to hire me or just make a decision in general? And what do they mean more hands on? They have barely trained me so I essentially still have zero clue as to what I was doing besides greeting the patients and running the charts back to the doctors. What more hands on can I get with such limited knowledge on the work required for the position? And if they didn’t hire me I will have completely wasted my time and given them free labor for 6-8 hours in total. That’s an entire workday depending on the place of work! They never even informed me of what my rate of pay would have been had I been hired and I did not want to ask as I know it’s a major faux pas to during the interview process. It is at this point I decide to end this charade and I did not return later in the afternoon like they asked me to. 

In other words do not let companies do this to you. You should never have to work for free, even if they say it’s to evaluate whether you would be a good fit or not. If it is more than two hours and they are not paying you, look into other options. I just hope and pray that other companies do not employ this technique because it is beyond unethical. I made it clear that I was not attending school, nor was this a type of internship. It would only have been worth while if I WAS going to school in the medical field in which this office specializes in order to receive college credit but it was not. It basically became a completely unpaid orientation for a position that I was not even guaranteed to have gotten and that is not okay. 

On a brighter note I still had a backup job option and decided pursue that instead as they gave me an offer on the spot. No stringing along which I appreciate very much. 

So that is all. I hope me writing this is able to help someone during their search. Good luck to everyone still searching for that dream job. Never sell yourself short!"

mxi1go,13,2021-04-24,Not on good terms with my father (Indian),imposterwick,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/mxi1go/not_on_good_terms_with_my_father_indian/,"M23 Indian here. 

Some background about me. I finished my computer engineering from a reputed college in India in 2019, but I didn't like it and never got a job from college as I didn't want it that time. I was thinking to explore my options other than engineering after college.

I used to study in another city and spent 4 years in hostel away from home. So after finishing college, I came back home and was unclear of what to do ahead. Months passed by and I had nothing on my mind regarding next things to do. During this time, my father confronted me about my situation verbally with anger. I have never been scolded like that from my father ever before and he always was supportive throughout my college.

I know I'm the one at the fault here, and I needed this confrontation, as this is expected behaviour from any parent, whose kid is doing nothing in life and sitting at home wasting time. Since that day around in mid 2019 till now, I have never been on good terms with my father. I have rarely spoke to him and would only talk with him if it's necessary.

With advise from some of my friends, I tried to find a job related to computer engineering. I spent some time doing some projects and learning things to build my portfolio. And did one internship and then landed a job in march 2021. So I was jobless for like almost 1.5+ years at home with covid around. But at last I landed one, which I'm proud of.

During these 1.5 years, I never spoke to my father about my career, infact I would always avoid talking with him and would avoid eye contact, because everytime I talk with him, it would always turn into an argument. He has a habit of giving his so called positive opinions every time, which sounds like a taunt to me. He never said this nor he ever implied this, but his behaviour made me feel like I'm good for nothing.

Only I know how I kept myself positive while preparing for interviews and applying for jobs while staying with them in lockdown without ever going out and meeting new people. There was kind of tensed environment, awkwardness in my home. I used to feel very depressed and upset. I felt like shit.

Now that I've got the job, sooner or later I'll be moving out once working from office will be safe. Till then, I'll be doing wfh. But still I avoid talking with him unless necessary. He also seems proud of me I guess for proving myself and getting a good job, but still I don't feel like this feeling of mine is gonna go away.

This kind of atmosphere was not there before I moved out of home for college. But after coming back, I find it difficult to stay with parents. Off course I love them and respect them, but I feel like it's not the same as before after that confrontation. I only feel like talking with my younger sister and mother. And thank god I had very nice neighbors, I could make their 3 year old son my best friend during this time and would play with him with his toys. He was the only one, with whom I could be with and let go off my worries. Without him, I wouldn't know how I could've stayed happy.


P.S. : I just wanted to let my inner thoughts out. And I don't even know whether I'm on the right subreddit or not. Any constructive advice/suggestions/thoughts are welcomed."
mxjulv,0,2021-04-24,Google SWE Internship - Destroyed during code reviews,crazy-gorilla,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mxjulv/google_swe_internship_destroyed_during_code/,"I am three weeks into my internship at Google and it really, REALLY sucks! I cannot do anything without getting destroyed during the code reviews. My co-host makes 20 comments on a 100 line CL, and when I correct them, he makes 20 other comments and I do not get anything done. 

Ironically, when I look at my team’s codebase, it is the worst code I have ever seen in my life. They do not apply the guidelines that they force me to apply. 

Is this normal? Does every new googler/intern go through that phase or is it just me? I already know now that I wil get a bad review but I don’t care I don’t think I will want to come back.

EDIT: Btw Google Zurich seems like the shittiest place on earth to work at. 50% are Ukrainian/Russian immigrants, the other 50% are north african immigrants. 0% diversity."
mxk0d4,1,2021-04-24,HELP needed for Life/ Career Advice Confession,iwmiod,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/mxk0d4/help_needed_for_life_career_advice_confession/,"Hello internet! *If there is another forum where I should post this please let me know.*

This is a confession... as I have never talked deeply about this to anyone. I am in my mid 20s, graduated in a tech degree in US during covid. I am from another country, a small village in fact. I scored top of my class in high-school, and in the past few years at University achieved scholarships, international internship, top leadership roles with average grades. I am healthy and competitive in working out. Did a little athletics too. Now I have a job with a startup where I just got a small raise too because of my accomplishments. I must say that I meditate every now and then. I am very grateful for the life I have.My friends would describe me as a decent and grateful being. As a kid I always loved AI, robotics and maybe that's why I went to University for CS. But as I grew up, I fell in love with music. I practiced 7 years straight and it was great. That is why I came to US in hopes of making it big. But I was told music wont pay my bills.

Now the truth is that I do not know what am I doing with my life. I am racing against time. I compare myself to people who are super successful. And obviously I'm guilty of watching all sorts of motivation, just do it, etc. YouTube videos. I know its all about putting in work and not making posts on internet but I am genuinely feeling lost. Oh and here is a small detail. Immigration. As a foreign student my options are limited to working in the field I graduated in. And while my company would like to apply for a H-1B a foreign worker visa, I want to be at the Googles, Amazons and best tech companies if I stay in tech.If I have already confused you, I apologies. But this is why I posted here. I am ready for any criticism or feedback. But I can reassure you that I understand it is important to take life step by step and be thankful for what I have. That is something I do understand. I genuinely want to make a lasting impact from my life and confessing that I do want to be rich(because I was born in lower middle class family), I want to be best in tech and business(because I was told I wouldn't make it) and I want to travel the world and make music and talk to people from other cultures(but my immigration restricts me). WIth immigration I only have 2 years before a company decides to keep me in the country.

Sometimes I feel that these systems(universities, 9-5 jobs etc.) are just not made for me and I want to do something of my own. But I don't have a genius idea or grades to get into ivy leagues. So music, tech, business, masters? What should I even do when I haven't found my passion, or the so called purpose in life. My race is against time and I want to be the best and I put my heart and sweat into it. But now I am just demotivated settling down within the comfort of averageness and comfort.I really need some advice or I'm afraid I will burn out and waste my life not succeeding and making it big.Thank you to you kind humans for taking important time of your lives to read this or provide any advice!

One offer was from a medium-sized company just over $100k while the other offer was from a large company that was worth over $200k in total compensation. Both offers were to work in North Carolina. These were the only two companies I interviewed for.

I am writing this post to document the things I did to prepare for interviews and answer questions I had throughout the process in the hopes it might help someone in the future. I want to stress that what I write here shouldn't be taken as gospel; this is simply my experience. Please make sure you draw from a wide variety of sources and hear others' testimonials when planning for interviews. Feel free to ask in the comments anything I haven't addressed.

# Technical Preparation

**How many LeetCode questions did you do?**

* 106 completed (\~120 attempted)
   * 36 Easy
   * 66 Medium
   * 4 Hard

**How did you decide which LeetCode questions to do?**

1. I had LeetCode Premium and went straight for the questions asked by the companies I was applying to
2. For any questions I struggled with, I added two of the 'Similar Questions' or two questions from 'Related Topics' to my favorites and solved them later
3. I then went through [this list of 75 questions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) and solved any I hadn't solved yet
4. Finally, I sorted all the questions by frequency and went down the list, prioritizing medium-difficulty questions

**How much time did you spend on each question?**

About an hour, sometimes less and sometimes more. If I couldn't come up with an algorithm within an hour and a half, I would look at the solution, save the problem for later, and move on to the next one.

**Is there a point where you begin recognizing patterns?**

It was a real struggle when I first started out. I was able to solve most easy questions but was pretty clueless on most medium questions. Things started to come together after I solved about 100 problems, but there were still a lot of problems I glanced at afterwards that I was unable to solve. If I got to do 150-200 problems (before landing an offer), I feel like I would've been in a really good position.

**Tips for solving these questions?**

* *Understand every possible method of solving each question you do.* In every one of my interviews, I was asked to solve each question at least two different ways. Be sure to find multiple solutions to each problem by either going through the problem's 'Discussion' section or, if you have LC Premium, the 'Solution' article
* *Don't just come up with the algorithm. Implement the solution and pass every test case.* A lot of times, implementation is the most difficult aspect of a problem. Also, in the process of implementing your solution, you might realize your algorithm is incorrect or doesn't address every edge case. Struggling through the implementation will ingrain the solution much more deeply in your mind
* *Review old questions*. This is self explanatory. Don't do too many problems without making sure you remember how to do ones you did a while back.
* *Depth over breadth.* 150-200 problems should be all it takes to cover everything you need to know. If you have done this many and are still struggling, you probably don't truly understand the problems you've done and rather are simply memorizing the solutions.

**Is LeetCode Premium worth it?**

I felt so, and here's why:

* Having access to the company-specific problems was *invaluable*. If there is one reason to subscribe, it is this
* Some of the questions locked for free users are questions that build the foundation for understanding how to solve many other questions
* The solution articles are often really detailed and well-written. They'll cover almost every way to solve each problem — something that you won't get from every Discussion post

My only warning is to not rely on the debugger they give you. You're not going to get a debugger in an interview. Get used to debugging by printing stuff to the console.

A Leetcode Premium subscription definitely isn't necessary if you can't afford it.

***Cracking the Coding Interview*** **or LeetCode?**

I did both. I started off going through Cracking the Coding Interview. I only went through the chapters on Strings, Arrays, Linked Lists, Dynamic Programming &amp; Recursion, Trees, Greedy, and System Design. The introductory segment for each chapter is really great as it covers a lot of the basic concepts you need to solve a wide variety of problems in each category. See if you can't get a used copy of the book for cheap.

# Background &amp; Other Preparation

**What other preparation did you do besides LeetCode?** Before each of my first several rounds of interviews, I went through a list of common questions I might be asked about each project I listed on my resume, rehearsing my answers out loud. I made sure I could summarize what I am currently doing in under 30 seconds.

One thing I want to warn you of is that you'll want to make sure you're prepared for *system design* questions (e.g. design TinyURL). LeetCode does not have any practice problems for this, so just be aware that these problems exist.

I'd also recommend reading *Clean Code* by Robert Cecil Martin. I got asked a lot how I would change my code for a production environment, and reading this gave me a lot of material to work with. It will also just make you a better software developer in general.

**What's your background?** I am 24 years old and have a little under two years of experience as a software consultant for an investment bank. My main skill is Java/Spring Boot but I also know a little bit of React.js and Vue.js. My resume really isn't that impressive, so don't let a weak resume stop you from shooting your shot.

**How long before you got an offer?** 2.5 months since I sent out my first application. This is also about how much time I spent grinding LeetCode. I got both of my offers in the same week.

**Where did you find jobs to apply for?** LinkedIn. Nowhere else.

# Thoughts on the Tech Interview Process

I hate it. I think it's really stupid. Some of the questions I came across on LeetCode had me thinking, ""They can't seriously expect a human being to solve this in under 45 minutes."" Some questions are just glorified IQ tests that prove nothing about your ability as a software developer. Some questions are so ridiculously mundane I wonder why they get asked at all. If these are your thoughts, just know you are not alone.

Unfortunately, tech companies do not care about your feelings. If you refuse to prepare for these questions out of spite, someone else who wants it more will step up to the plate and happily take those offers from you. Figure out what it's worth to you. Good luck

# Edits

I'll address some other things here based on questions I'm frequently getting asked.

**Which companies gave you an offer? Are there really companies in NC that pay that much?** I'm not at liberty to say which companies gave me an offer. What I will say is there are a ton of tech companies with offices in the RTP area that extend offers making mine look like a government welfare check. Google, Nvidia, and SAS are just a few examples. There are some other really solid companies here too, like IBM and RBC.

**How did you find those opportunities?** Set your location preferences in LinkedIn to 'North Carolina' and you'll see all the available jobs in the area.

**What did the rest of your resume look like?** I had a summer internship at a tiny company where I wrote maybe 100 lines of code. I had a research assistant position where I basically just put together datasets for my supervisor to use in her research. I also volunteered as a web developer for a hospital my senior year. I listed any technologies and languages I had ever touched but left out anything I couldn't talk about at a high level. My resume really isn't that impressive and I never got asked about these trivial roles.

**What is your comp package?** 138k base + 14k bonus target + 50k equity over 3 years (edit: 150k equity total). There's also 401k matching and a discounted stock purchase plan but I haven't calculated what those are worth.

**Are you getting paid by LeetCode?** No. I am just documenting my experience here. I am well aware that you can get a job without ever touching LeetCode or a similar site. However, landing a job without any practice is extremely unrealistic for the large majority of people, myself included. Feel free to use HackerRank or whatever else is out there. Or trust your smarts and go into your interviews blind."

*To:* [*clntXXXX@gvrn.org*](mailto:clntXXXX@gvrn.org)

*Subject: Termination Request*

*March 5th, 2016*

*Dear XXXX,*

*The XXX-amine XX-dosage of the “Green Dust” stimulant is a volatile, dangerous drug. Through rigorous research and unorthodox human testing procedures, we have determined that ‘the Human Weapon’ project is a threat to mankind as we know it. We have observed human test subjects undergo severe physical deformities and mental deterioration, including but not limited to seizures, self-harm, adult-born phocomelia (the malformation of human arms and legs), cannibalism, and further conditions thus undocumented (see section XX, test subject XXXX - CLASSIFIED).*

*As the lead scientists on the project, we have decided to put in an official request for the immediate termination of the “Green Dust” bio-weapon manufacturing process.*

*Signed,*

*Doctors C. Ermine and A. Ermine.*

&amp;#x200B;

\---

I read page after page, photocopies of communications, reports, notes, lab test results. A lot of it was incomprehensible. Vague memories teased the fringes of my mind, but they seemed so flimsy, improbable. I caught myself mumbling under my breath like a mad man, trying to piece together a life I didn’t know I had.

“He’s in here boys,” a familiar voice sounded from behind me.

I turned to find Carlee standing in the doorway, dressed in a trim-cut suit, flaming red hair pulled back in a sleek bun. The severe expression on her face aged her features by years, giving her the air of a battle-worn cop. I could find no traces of the naive intern I had come to know at my workplace.

“Carlee?”

“That’s agent Mavers to you, Doctor Ermine,” her cool voice threatened to cut me to shreds. She lifted a handheld transceiver, “We have the Scientist, Gomes.”

Before I could say anything else, six armed men passed Carlee to enter the room, encircling me. They wore heavy-duty military gear, with goggles and helmets pulled over balaclavas. I almost laughed out loud, because it was ridiculous to think they would need that much horsepower to detain me.

Then I remembered the photographs and the effects of the pill, which had almost entirely worn off at that point. Perhaps there was a reason these men were overly cautious. Based on what I had seen in the file, the chemical known as Green Dust was highly dangerous and unpredictable.

I darted my eyes around the laboratory, trying to find an escape. This manifestation of my flight reflex was enough for two of the men to grab me by the scruff of my neck and throw me down on one of the chairs. A third man produced a rope from somewhere, looping it around my legs and arms. It took him less than a minute to secure me to the chair.

“You’re not going anywhere, you asshole,” Carlee said from the doorway. She still hadn’t entered the room, and I saw her throw several glances out into the hallway. Who was she waiting for?

“What is happening?” I asked, my voice feeble and worn.

I realized that my body was crashing from exertion as I came down from the effects of the Green Dust stimulant. All my strength, the heightened senses, it was all swinging back the other way. I felt my vision blur and my eardrums clog like I was taking off in an airplane. The muscles in my body ached and spasmed. Breathing was laborious, my lungs struggling to catch even the shallowest breaths.

Jeff - the guy I previously thought of as a neighbor and friend - entered the room, exchanging a look with Carlee before turning to look at me with a hatred so heavy I had to look away. The pieces were starting to fall together, slowly, but it was still too much to make sense of my past and how it related to the man standing in front of me.

“All yours, Gomes,” Carlee said, smiling. There was something sinister in that smile, a gleam in her eye. It made my skin crawl.

“Everybody take out your phones and all other communication devices,” Jeff barked, “Turn them off, right now. This one is staying off the books, you hear me?”

There was a shuffling as everyone in the room obeyed. I didn’t like the sound of that off-the-books talk. Not at all. Once the men and Carlee were finished disconnecting their devices, Jeff marched over to me, grabbing my neck with his right hand. He dug his calloused fingers into my skin as he brought his rage-ridden face down to my eye level.

“Listen to me you little shit,” he spat in my face, hissing the words with such severity that my bladder lurched, “I don’t care what kind of ‘asset’ you are. I did not spend the last five years of my life stationed in the middle of butt-fucking-knowhere to watch your sorry ass jerk off into the blankets at night. Tell me what the fuck happened in that fire or I will kill you with my bare hands and call it an accident.”

My mind raced as fear-induced adrenaline coursed through my weakening limbs. I had every reason to believe Jeff was telling the truth, but I also had no idea what he was talking about. What fire? I decided to buy some time, to maybe try and learn something in return.

“I think you know what happened,” I croaked through his grasp, my Adam's apple sinking deeper into my windpipe.

He loosened the grip on my neck, a hint of doubt entering his eyes as he scanned mine for answers. Beads of sweat formed on his brow as an uncomfortable silence swathed the room. The wheezes in my chest were the only audible noise that remained.

“So you faked it, all of it?” Jeff’s voice was low and throaty, his eyes growing wide with anger and disbelief, “The whole thing. You knew all along. You never forgot.”

I didn’t know how long I had left to spin my wheels like this. I didn’t know which answer would enrage him more, because I didn’t know what he was talking about. It seemed like either death or a crippling onslaught of pain were imminent. Or both.

I looked past Jeff at the corner of the room. I wondered which version of my life would flash before my eyes as he hurt me for something I couldn’t even recall doing. I thought about the photos of the injured, mutilated bodies. The green-eyed flesh-eating monster. If I was behind that, maybe I deserved this. I think Jeff was screaming something at me at this point, slapping my face, kicking me in the gut, but my body was too exhausted from the effects of the drug to react properly. My consciousness was fleeting, dark corners creeping into my line of vision.

Then something brought me back.

One of the armed figures stood at the far end of the room, near the open windows to the lab. I saw them move hastily across the room while Jeff screamed at my face, shaking me in the chair. Their stride was effortless, silent. With the alacrity of a cat, they used an elbow to knock Carlee to the ground from behind.

“What the -”

Jeff let go of me as he and the other men flew into position to counter the rogue. Carlee remained on the ground, unmoving. The room exploded in commotion as the armed men shouted commands and at least two guns went off. I watched in disbelief as the figure darted across the room with incredible speed and precision, avoiding all tackles, fists, and bullets aimed in their direction.

Reality started to fade. I had been clinging on by an inch of my life, but now my body and mind had relented entirely. Somehow, I felt this masked person was on my side. That I would be okay. I closed my eyes and sank into a blissful nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

I awoke to a set of bright, circular orbs dancing in my line of vision. They belonged to a round operating light positioned just above my head. A strip of reflective metal obscured most of my view. I could only see a tiny bit of the ceiling, but what I could make out was bare concrete. I tried to jerk my head to the right, but it wouldn’t budge an inch. There was something hard fixing me in place from the neck up. I felt tiny vessels pop as I strained my eyes to see to the right. It looked like a cage had been strapped to my head. I tried to move the rest of my body, but it was also tied down to whatever surface I was lying on.

I started screaming, using all my physical strength to try and thrash myself out of my living nightmare. Out of all the shit that happened to me from the moment I received that first email, this took the cake. I had never felt as exposed, as vulnerable as I did lying strapped to an unknown surface in an unknown room, with a heavy device stuck to my head.

“Calm down, my darling,” a soothing voice filled the chamber as a woman appeared in my line of vision.

She was bulked out in the same heavy-duty uniform as the armed men who held me captive back at the college campus, but she had removed the headgear. It was the woman from Ashbury Lane, the one with the burns running down the left half of her face and neck. Without the headscarf, I could see that her auburn hair was cut short, revealing patches of bald scar tissues on her scalp. Her eyes glowed a luminous green.

“Alanis?” I stammered, guessing but not really knowing if this was the woman who was meant to be my wife, “What are you doing? Why am I here?”

“Shhhh, my love,” she said, putting a hand on my arm, “It will all make sense after the restoration.”

“The what?” I cried out, my voice faltering as my body quivered beneath the tight hold of the restraints.

“Human memory is a beautiful phenomenon, my dear. You knew this better than anyone. There is no need to worry now. This moment right here has been five years in the making. You planned it all so perfectly, down to the smallest detail, the precise minutes. It will all make sense as soon as I inject the anti-repressors into the hippocampus and amygdala. Those are both found in your temporal lobe, honey. You used to know things like that, and you will again. Now, shhh.”

Metal clinked as the green-eyed woman pulled a scalpel from somewhere to my left.

“Breathe steady, my love. You need to be awake for this to work. Think of something relaxing, like [**koi in a pond**](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/mt40kw/futureme_new_series_information_hub/).”

I am in the Navy and get out next year. I want to use the skillbridge program, which essentially lets you use your last 6 months on active duty to do an internship. 

I've browsed the website and it seems like a lot of the software programs are more geared towards apprenticeships/boot camps. I already know the basics of how to code, I am in my senior year of a CS degree and have already taken DS&amp;A, databases, OS, etc. I don't have any side projects, which is why I thought a bootcamp program like Code Platoon might be good, but I think an internship would be better.

Does anyone have any experience with this or advice? I am in the VA Beach area.

I've browsed the website and it seems like a lot of the software programs are more geared towards apprenticeships/boot camps. I already know the basics of how to code, I am in my senior year of a CS degree and have already taken DS&amp;A, databases, OS, etc. I don't have any side projects, which is why I thought a bootcamp program like Code Platoon might be good, but I think an internship would be better.

Does anyone have any experience with this or advice? I am in the VA Beach area.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: also some programs require you to be a full-time student. I take 3-6 credits at a time on active duty, so if anyone has experience with that, please let me know"
mxq24s,5,2021-04-24,First Year ME Student,DEZ7320,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/mxq24s/first_year_me_student/,"So I'll be starting my first classes with Oregon State University starting in the spring of 22, and I wanted to hear about everyone's experience with jumping into calculus classes.  I've never had to do any type of math like that (Highest was intermediate algebra), so you could certainly say this kind of worries me a bit.  

&amp;#x200B;

A quick background about me, I'll be separating from the Navy (Engineman) after 10 years so I'll be 29 when I start school.  I have an Associates of Applied Science, so I can relate to the online college side of the house, but never had to do any in person classes.   

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I've never been to Oregon, so hopefully I can hear how the Engineering school is like from students that attend there as well as internships and opportunities.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know this post is kind of all over the place, but I appreciate all of your input.

Have a great day!!"

mxrp2z,1,2021-04-24,Future transfer statistics major student need some advices for major and school,whatcanisay007,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/mxrp2z/future_transfer_statistics_major_student_need/,"I got accepted to UC Davis, UC Berkeley, and maybe UCLA (still waiting for LA, but I think I will get in) for statistics major. Now, I can't decide where is the best place for statistics major. When I was a high school freshman, my dream school was Berkeley because they are the no.1. They have the best rank for statistics majors. However, I think the program focused on the theoretical side, but I want to learn some practical skills. As I am searching for colleges with a more practical statistics major, I found UC Davis and UCLA. I noticed the data science track for statistics major at UC Davis and the statistics major at UCLA would be the best fit to learn practical skills. I am leaning towards UCLA and UC Davis.

When I visit the UC's, I like the vibe of the UC Davis campus and UCLA campus, and I think the campus of UC Berkeley is just so so. I don't worry about the cost, and I want to pick the best place for my major. I could see myself going to UCLA or UC Davis.

I noticed the data science track at UC Davis would teach students Python and R, so I think that's all I need. For UCLA, I heard they only taught students R, and I noticed their students might have fewer statistical programming classes than UC Davis students. I am not planning to do an extra minor or major. I have self-taught myself SQL and basic excel skills. My goal is to become a data analyst, business analyst, business intelligence analyst. I want to focus on the statistics side and business side and I am not good at computer science. I think I will follow the major plan and take some statistical programming classes on the side.

I know for UCLA statistics major and UC Berkeley statistics major is a pre-major, but UC Davis statistics major does not do the pre-major thing. So, I think UC Davis might be better because I got into the major I applied with. I hear stories about students forced to change their major because of the GPA cutoff. I like my major and I want to keep my major. 

Now, I like about UCLA because it's higher ranked, practical skills (they teach R, but they don't teach python), and I think their graduate get good jobs. UC Davis, teach everything I need, but they ranked slightly lower than UCB and UCLA. I am not sure where I should go. For both schools, I think their graduates with a statistics major are doing fine. I don't have any internship experience, so I don't know what to expect.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just curious how people would choose if they got into UCLA and UC Davis for statistics major."
mxrtjn,2,2021-04-24,Is it bad that my CompE program is heavily skewed toward EE?,Reasonable_Title_944,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mxrtjn/is_it_bad_that_my_compe_program_is_heavily_skewed/,"I am currently a rising sophomore in CompE, hoping to go into software engineering. I had chosen CompE at first because I wasn't sure if I was more interested in hardware or software, and I understood that CompE provides the same career options as both CS and EE. However, it is clear now that I would enjoy the CS route more.

The issue is my degree plan is nearly identical to EE. The only differences between the two are an extra C++ class, Data Structures, Intro to SWE, and two CompE electives. The first CS class I take, C++, is not even scheduled until the Fall of my junior year. All the other classes are the standard EE classes like Circuit Analysis. 

If I were to switch to CS, I would be a year behind because I have not taken any CS-transferrable classes beyond math and science classes. Furthermore, my university's CS program is unfortunately underfunded and of poor quality - all the upperclassmen I have asked say that the program is mostly self-taught. As such, I'm hesitant to switch majors and graduate later just to end up teaching myself most of a CS degree, something I could already do. 

I have been teaching myself Python for the past few weeks and intend to spend the summer learning as much as I can. 

I imagine that CompE on my resume won't hurt me when applying for SWE internships. However, I am concerned I will end up behind in CS skill-wise if I am not focusing on the area in university. What are your thoughts? Would it be worth sticking with CompE for another semester to transfer into a university where I can take more CS classes? Am I overthinking this?"

BACKGROUND:

I'm in my last semester of a 4 year bachelors in computer science. I have basic experience with (HTML, CSS, Java, Python and SQL). I want my career to be focused in datat engineering. I read in an online resource that I should focus on (SQL, Python and AWS).

I am NOT prepared and never did any SWE internships while in college (regretting it right now) . In my freshmen year,  summer, I interned for a IT company as a QA associate. Did not code in that position. 

I have been applying to jobs in indeed and got called by recruitment/placement companies like mindlance , revanture, skillstorm etc. 

QUESTION : Should I accept the MINDLANCE offer that requires relocation. Paid training and placement in one of their client companies with 57k salary WITH (1 year commitment contract). Even though I'm locked in a company, it will help me get my foot in the door

OR...

Try to get short-term, low paying or even unpaid,  SWE internships in the summer and then try for a different internship in the winter AND try to get ""stepping stone"" experiences for my resume.

Any tips/questions would be appreciated and answerd. 


I feel overwhelmed because of how unprepared I am. People say I should

-  grind leetcode for 3 months  and then apply to jobs 
- do small projects on my own
- apply for internships even if they don't pay well
- join these job placement companies like mindlance and get your foot in the door"

Hi everyone,

I graduated with my undergrad in May 2020 and started working full time as a software engineer for a large tech company in the Bay Area (working remote from my hometown for now). It was an internship return offer that I accepted back in the fall of 2019. We recently had our performance review cycle that my manager told me I had just made the cutoff for tenure-wise at the 6 month mark. This is also when compensation adjustments are made on an annual basis.

I got nearly all positive feedback from each of my evaluators, and my manager personally told me that I am doing “exceptionally well” and that he and my colleagues often forget I am a new grad because of my self-sufficiency, quality of work, and professionalism. He even said he was targeting me for promotion next review cycle, which at 1.5 years of FTE tenure would be faster than the 2-3 year average.

Despite this positive feedback, I only received a 1% salary increase for my annual compensation adjustment. My manager said this was because I have only been with the company a short time and raises primarily occur through promotions. This didn’t make sense to me though; if I had been there long enough for a performance review shouldn’t that be enough time to warrant full consideration for comp increases? I wasn’t even expecting to be considered for any type of raise at under a year of tenure, but now I’m realizing I won’t be able to get another adjustment for another year and will potentially be missing out on several months of a raise, especially if I end up not making promotion next time around. I’m not dissatisfied with my current pay, but a 1% increase doesn’t even make up for inflation and cost of living increases.

In your opinion, how should I handle this? Should I have an open conversation with my manager and see if it is a possibility to get a number larger than 1%, or should I just drop it because it’s my first full time job and I’ve been working for only 8 months and hope for a promotion next time?

TL;DR: New grad software engineer that got 1% pay raise during very positive annual performance review after ~7 months of working. Should I ask for more or leave it be?

Thanks all!"

mxvgh2,4,2021-04-24,I get to stay at university!,sapphicmoonie,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mxvgh2/i_get_to_stay_at_university/,"I was essentially on academic probation after failing an exam for the second time and my application to take it a third time was denied (probably because this was the fourth time this happened), which meant I had to have a meeting with the board of examiners to explain why I failed and why think I'll succeed if I retake it.

That (online) meeting was on Wednesday and after spending the entire week in a state of stress, I was really nervous about it since being expelled for good would mean that I can't enroll in that program again, not even at a different university.

But the meeting went really well! First they asked me to clarify some things about my diagnosis (I was only diagnosed in the middle of last semester and the effects of my meds etc were really unreliable in the beginning) and how it affected me/ what was different now compared to then. I was able to explain how my meds helped and they said I seemed really confident, and then asked me if I had a plan going forward since I still have to retake two exams that they previously approved a third attempt for that I was only able to skip because of covid. I told them that I planned to only take those three exams this semester, to then take the remaining course scheduled for the 4th semester during my internship next semester and then continue as scheduled afterwards.

Then I had to wait another twenty minutes as they talked about it and when they let me back in they told me immediately that they approved my application, and said that my plan seemed good and gave me a few options to think about, like applying for extended exam time and where I could find study partners.

I'm still so elated about it! When I first got my grades back and saw that I failed again (and even more so when I got the email about the initial denial) I was really disappointed because it seemed like such a cruel timing - I finally found a psychiatrist who took me seriously after years of asking my previous ones to test me for ADHD, and the meds made it possible for me to pay attention in class and to actually study for things (studying never had an effect for me before). But I got one last chance and I'm determined to make it count.

TL,DR - after failing exams one time too many I was on probation but the board of examiners gave me another chance and I'm really happy about it"

I did research exchange at NTU last year and fell in love with a Singaporean girl. I’m graduating in a month and would like to come back to Singapore for work so that we can be together, as it is almost impossible for her to move to the UK :(

I tried to secure a job for a few months now and after sending a hundred applications, nobody ever got back to me. I managed to get a Working Holiday Visa, but I’m now struggling in securing an internship. I was hoping that some of you might share your experiences and provide some advice on how to approach employers.

A bit about me:
* graduating with First Class in STEM from the U.K.
* looking for an internship in business / marketing
* have some marketing and business experience from an internship in KL during my gap year
* also started an online clothing business and self-taught most things like graphics design, Facebook &amp; Google Ads, website building etc.
* study exchange in Canada and previous research internship at NTU
* co-curricular activities such as class rep and coach
* volunteering experience at Open Days and demos
* held part-time jobs during my whole time at university

I know that Singaporeans are super hardworking and a tough crowd to compete against, but I feel like I’ve done everything by the book and I’m still struggling to get anywhere. Would appreciate your advice!

Thanks! 🇸🇬🇬🇧"

I just have no luck getting into IT, and if I'm stuck like this for any longer, I'll completely lose all my sanity. I've applied to many tech positions over these near-3 years but often either heard nothing back or just getting the email saying I wasn't chosen or they've moved forward in the process. Or if I do get an interview, I don't hear anything positive past interviews.

Should I just give up on looking for work? I'm stuck.

\-2 degrees and 1 internship

\-No work experience other than 1 internship over 3 years ago

\-Hell, ""Take any job right now"" is a dead end. Employers nowadays don't want to hire anybody that isn't going to stick around for more than 2-3 years

\-If it's not dealing with tech skills or skills to build a career profile, it won't work well for me. I'm the type of person that gets bored super quick, so if I'm not dealing with anything like troubleshooting, data entry, or other hands-on stuff, it'll be hard for me to even be remotely interested.

\-Networking doesn't feel like an option for me. Not a people person.

\-In no position to pursue any certifications and can't save up money to do so either

\-No transportation to travel

\-Don't really trust how ""remote"" remote offers are (Some want you to work overseas or in another state, some are only temp remote given COVID, others require travel, etc...)

I don't know what directions to turn anymore, and I can't even be optimistic anymore when applying for jobs. ""Let's see how long it'll take before I get that rejection email,"" or ""Oh boy, here's another job application that will end in failure"" which rings in my mind. After 3 years of failure, it's hard to care anymore. If nothing turns up, just fuck it. I'll just die bitter."

Recently I had an internship with a public accounting firm and was extended a job offer for December 2022 making around 55K a year. I did two years of dual-enrollment in high school and applied to the internship this spring thinking that is what I wanted to do. I realized during the internship that working 60+ hour weeks and the overall tasks itself were not that enjoyable to me.  On top of that, it feels like I am drastically missing out on any form of college experience especially with COVID basically taking out this year.

I’ve always had a passion for mathematics and technology and have considered majoring in line with these two fields instead. It would push my expected graduation to May 2024, but hopefully I would be making a higher starting salary if all goes to plan and the work would be more fulfilling. On top of this, I’d actually get to have somewhat of a college experience.

On the other hand it seems conflicting as I attend a public state college where tuition and board is around $10K a year so I’d be spending another $20K in total on top of the missed income from the public accounting position. I’m the first one in my family to make it to college so this has been beyond a head spin for me the past couple months as I navigate through this situation.

To keep it short I have two choices.

1) Accept public accounting position and make $55K with gradual pay increases
- Benefits: 1.5 years of $55K income and saved tuition of about ~$20K
- Costs: Miss out on any college experience for the most part, can pigeon-hole myself into doing something I am not as passionate about, could be missing out on traditional recruiting opportunities

2) Switch major to mathematics and computer science and spend $20K on tuition.
- Benefits: Much more passionate about this path, can take advantage of recruiting and leadership programs for different fields, can explore different fields such as actuarial science, pursuing a MS in CS or something similar, or explore different consulting/banking positions that recruit from the school
- Cons: Miss out on 1.5 years of $55K income and tuition of about ~20K"

First time post",Short_Past_468,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/my01dp/ive_applied_for_several_engineering_internships/,"First time posting, I’ve noticed the quality of advice here is good and I find myself in a bit of a quandary.

I’m EE and I’m interested in working for an engineering  consulting firm. I guess more specifically, I’m interested in getting a job that ties smart technology development/application and the built environment.

The Problem: I’ve applied to about 20 different firm’s summer internship programs this semester and heard back from 0 of them. I’ve been able to follow up with 10 of them by sleuthing out who the hiring team/managers are on linked in to get some extra exposure, to no avail. I experienced something similar last year except I actually got 2 interviews, turns out that was the same week Covid-19 shut everything down. Both firms flopped and twitched on their internship programs as so much was up in the air. At least that’s what they told me... if you couldn’t tell the experience has me feeling a little cynical and I’m basically resigned to the idea of Lyft driving and food delivery to make ends meet this summer.

It sucks though because this is the second time in a row I’m going to miss out on a valuable opportunity. I really don’t blame the firms, maybe my background or resume is lacking and they just want to see a little bit more before they take a chance on me. Although I did talk to someone who works at one of these firms and they told me to “dumb down my resume.” Could be good advice though, I can’t tell. I’ve also been told my resume makes me sound boring.

What kind of advice do you have for someone in my spot? Should I look at adding some certifications before trying again? Maybe someone has been in a similar spot? I’d be very interested in your story if so.

A little bit of background: I’m graduating with a bachelors in EE in May and continuing on to grad school for my masters in the Fall. I’m older than the average graduate (30), I’m a veteran and my rate was technical (Nuclear ET), and I’m in Hawaii.

I recently completed my internship for a startup company. It was an incredible experience, and I got to enhance my skill set and know what it's like to work in a company.

I expressed my interest in a full-time position to my manager, and she was excited that I even considered it. However, I added that I also would be looking for other opportunities.

Later on, my manager continually convinced me how working in a startup is better than larger companies because you get to learn more (while getting paid less)

My manager started to tell hirerups, HR got in touch,  and I confirmed my interest in full-time.

Now I am starting to feel like maybe I should not have said anything because deep down, I still want to work somewhere else for the sake of more growth.

I want to ask my manager for a letter of recommendation but I am hesitant this will make me look like I just played everyone.

Or am I overthinking this?"

Hi, I have some interrogations and I am seeking opinions to confirm and deepen my thoughts, please. 

What about my profile? 
I come from a kind of signal processing Major. It's about processing any signal from analogical source to deep learning. I got specialised in Machine Learning stuffs. I also have a strong mathematical background thanks to my first years in prep class in France. (Those are specific classes to France I believe). 
I did a project with a lab about remote sensing human activity from hyper spectral images. I have an internship in computer vision in an IT enterprise, the topic is multi object tracking. It's R&amp;D. 
Also, I am a founder of an IT association in my school, so I have a various basic knowledge about IT in a lot of fields. I love programming and anything near to IT.

What I want to do? 
Basically, I wanted to do a PhD. But I realized that research area in Computer Vision wasn't that interesting : most of papers are just new algorithms, it's not so exciting in my opinion. And about fundamental research - I prefer this - it's about a group of few people making papers and a lot of others doing nothing much. Also, I don't want to be forced to be in one place during 3 years for my PhD. Also, If I do a PhD I want to do it intensely but I am afraid to lose interest at the end. 
Sooooo, I want to do some stuffs elsewhere in data science, I am currently thinking about my professional options :
- Data analyst in some random companies, it pays well I believe and it's not that tiring. So I can have side project 
- Freelance as data analyst also 
- Data scientist in some startups : if it's data scientist in another place, I would need a PhD I believe. I have already a contact to be in such startup 
- For every option, I would like to go out of France
What are you thinking about these options? Am I missing  an option? Or one of the option is looking like impossible to me? Is it hard to move out from France to UK or Canada? 

How I plan to enforce my profile?
My profile has some weaknesses. My internship ends in 3 months. I would like to have more personal projects and recognition. So I plan to do some kaggle competitions to get better at Data analysis and also do Tensorflow certification. And if I have time I would like to do some random personal project. But I think I won't have this time. 
What do you think about these ways? Do you have something else to commend? 

Anyway, thanks for reading, I am open to any opinion. If you can provide relevant points and/or sources, it would be perfect &lt;3"

I am a high school student that has a couple options for summer internships that I want to talk about. A little bit of background - I am entering a computer science major wanting to be a software engineer / product manger in the future. for this summer I so far have 1 (1 month) placement with Google (Summer Computer Science Institute - 3 hours per day) and just got an offer as a part-time Partnerships intern at a well known career counselling company. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: should I take this part-time Partnerships intern (where I will be working on getting corporate clients / universities to come talk on various panels) or focus on doing a project or two (I will most likely complete a nano degree from Udacity or smt like that) and also study for technical interviews coming up in September/ October

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the pros for taking Partnership intern position: 

 \- Massive connections, they have corporate partners from all the big tech / finance companies + have clients that have landed roles at them

\- Might help me land a product manager role in the future?? (as the experience lines up?)

\- Very inclusive / hussling environment 

\- Start-up experience

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- Not a software engineering role

 \- I can use the time to make technical projects etc

\- Will not help me with technical experience AT all (its all partnerships)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: If I do take the intern role, I will NOT produce the same quality of side projects as if I didn't. Furthermore, I also need to prepare for technical interviews.

Looking forward to people here giving me a few pointers for me to make the right decision?

Cornell MEng ECE vs CU Boulder MS EECE (Thesis)

I want to get into the network industry. I have my Bachelor's with relevant subjects but I don't have the relevant work experience as I've been working as a developer for the past 3 years.

Cornell requires students to be prepared before pursuing the course as the career fair is right at the start of the program.
On the other hand, I can take up more courses and learn comfortably over a period of 2 years at CU Boulder. Probably even do an internship.

Will online courses and working on gaining the required skill set by myself before the Fall 2021 semester be enough for me to survive Cornell's MEng program and get a job?
Or should I stick to CU Boulder's comfortable pace and not take this risk? 

Cornell might open more doors for me but CU Boulder will give me an in-depth background. The pros and cons of both are so varied.

Any suggestions are welcome!

I’m a mechanical engineering student . I am really interested in Software engineering/Comp science/ML since a long time now but haven’t been able to learn anything as there is so much information available online and it’s confusing. I would like to know where I can start and what should be my first step if I want to consider Computer Science as a career option in the next 1-2 years. I do not mind paying for content online if it is really worth paying for. I want to know some areas of CS which are suitable for a Mechanical engineering student and some domain which I can really look into for internships and jobs. How many hours per week should I dedicate if I want to be serious about learning it? 
Which languages do you think I should start with?
Any help or suggestion is appreciated!"

I have lived abroad twice, and in that time I've reached a good level of Mandarin, where I could use it in a job if I focused on one specific area ( and have used it briefly in a temp job). I never intended on being back in the US for this long, so I have taken a lot of low paying temp jobs over the past two years, not worrying much about the impact on my career. And then when I was supposed to leave again, Covid hit last year. Now I'm worried that with global instability and the difficulty to go back abroad right now, that perhaps I need a change and should focus on starting a career here. And honestly, I'd rather not go into the education field because I'm worried that the pay will be low and because teaching in the US seems like a lot of stress and not a lot of appreciation from others.  

I am currently getting a Master's degree in a Liberal Arts Major( yes, I know, bad mistake), however I'm not doing very well. The entire covid and political situation in the US, as well as some personal issues, have impacted my studies. And now I'm already more than half way through my program and realize that any hopes of getting a decent research job, or even an internship, are very slim. Furthermore, my resume experiences are often shorter and in jobs that don't necessarily require more than a HS diploma or associates degree. I am constantly applying to jobs along the Northeast, but even jobs that require little to no experience do not call me back. Every few months I go on a mass applying spree for a couple of months, nothing comes of it, and then I give up and feel discouraged. 

I'm worried that I'm falling behind all my friends. They're all buying houses and getting married, meanwhile I'm the single broke friend who is always unable to go on trips, go out to eat, ect. And I feel like dating is impossible when you're not financially stable. Nobody sees me as more than a hook up, because most people seem like they wouldn't want to get involved with someone as old as I am when they're unable to find a career. I think that if another year goes by and I can't find a job, that I will give up on the US and just teach abroad forever, however I'm worried that is not a stable career move anymore, as global tensions continue to rise, the ESL industry is increasingly moving online and because I'm getting older and a lot of schools seem to only want people in their 20s and 30s."

I am a recent transfer CS student at big 10 and this spring term was my first semester as CS student. (First time I ever code in my life as well)

I am actually planning for applying for the internship for summer 2022, but I am not even sure how good you have to be as SWE intern?

Like, do they expect a high level of compentence  in coding?

For me, like the easy questions on leetcode is incredible hard yet and I guess it is probably I been code for like few months yet. So, in my case, should I just prepare more and aiming for summer 2023?  or Should I go ahead and apply for summer 2022 and just grind more?

I got a job as a back-end developer with an early stage startup. I would be beginning tomorrow. The people there are very supportive and excited to have me there. I did really well in the interview and they were really impressed with me. I think this has led them to have high expectations from me. I am not sure if I can perform to their expectations.

There is one custom at my new work place where whenever a new employee makes their first production release, they celebrate it together over a video call. The last employee to join released his production release in the same week he joined, I am not sure if I can do the same. I would be working with Golang and GraphQL which are new technologies to me and I am not sure I can catch up. I have decent back-end experience and have been working as a fullstack developer intern at another place for close to 8 months and have done several side projects.

This position would be an internship for a couple of months till it's converted to full time role. But to be honest, I am really anxious and stressed out about how I will fare. I fear that I would let down my team and may not be able to match their expectations. How do I be confident? Have you faced similar situation in your job?"

myak92,123,2021-04-25,Got my Dream Job - My Experience and Tips (these work),Leavemealone2013,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/myak92/got_my_dream_job_my_experience_and_tips_these_work/,"I wanted to share my experience and tips on getting a job. Sorry it is long, just have a lot to share and want to give details. Not to brag, but I got my dream job and a huge pay bump for me. I will say that I have doubled my income in 2 years from changing my mindset, taking 100% ownership of my life and actions, and grinding. I have accepted a role in the mid-six figures which is amazing for someone in their mid-20s (F). Two years ago, I made $56K. I do not have a fancy degree, I have a liberal arts degree (ba) from a state commuter school. I never did an internship, just started working in college. I have no ties to my family whatsoever and did not come from a “privileged” background. I work hard to continue learning on my own and have big goals. Besides the mindset I have and the things I have taught myself, I have nothing special that you do not have.

I started this process in January, applied “lightly” through the end of February. Then took a few weeks off to work on a certification, then went hard from mid-March to now. I treated this like a full-time job and then some. I was applying for jobs below a VP but above a single contributor. These tips probably apply best to people in a similar place

**Here were my stats:**

**Applications: 380** (this is an estimate based on applying for 10+ a day)   
**Contacts: 52** (this means the company emailed or called and wanted to speak with me; I did decline some because once they contacted me it was not something I was interested in)  
**Process started:** **40** (this means I had at least 1 interview with the company)  
**Total Interviews: 97** (this means 1 interview is time with 1 person, 30 minutes or an hour. I had multiple interviews with some companies, the most was 8)  
**Total Projects: 1** (I was asked to complete 1 project)  
**Total Assessments: 6** (I was asked to take 6 assessments)   
**Full Process: 10** (This means I went through a company's full hiring process and either got an offer, did not, or told them I had another offer to accept)  
**Offers: 4** (2 written, 2 verbal)  
**Rejected by employer: 3**  
**Rejected by me: 3** (this mainly happened after I had 2 written offers and I was happy with these 2, so I told the company I was no longer interested)

* **Mindset:** This is the pre-step one, step zero. Without this, you’re going to be in a tough place. I am not going to get too into this, but two things. One, take full ownership and accountability for your actions and where you are at. I get it, life is tough, but once you take 100% ownership of your life, it is a freeing feeling to know you are the captain of this ship. This means no excuses. If you think, “I didn’t get that job because the hiring manager didn’t take me seriously since I’m young”, you need to change it to, “What can I do differently next time to show that while I am young, I am very mature and professional?”. If you are going to have excuses and outs for yourself, then my advice is probably not right for you. Second, you need to be detached to this process and the jobs. I got my heart set on one job in particular, and when I did not get it, I was really really upset. You cannot get emotionally attached until you have a signed offer and clean background check, ideally I would not get attached until you start the job. Having a “chill” approach to this whole process will also help. It is going to be rough, but accept it and know it will be over. You can make this painful process the minimal amount of pain, or you can make yourself really suffer, your choice. You also must believe in yourself and know this is possible. If you do not believe in yourself, no one else will.
* **Write down what you want:** This is step one. It is very important to know what you are looking for in a new position to make it as successful as possible. I personally split my list into things that were non-negotiable, then things that would be “nice to have”, but not hard requirements. No one can do this but you, so I recommend getting really deep and putting thought into this. Personally, the role I accepted checked all my boxes, besides one that is in the works. I’m not going to share mine because it is personal, but this is something you can research on your own or watch youtube videos about. A couple examples would be the benefits you are targeting, job title(s), work location, etc. Be specific, but not too specific. For example, maybe you have a family so you’re looking for a company that has decent healthcare where you will spend no more than $500 per month out of your paycheck on your family’s healthcare. Your ask is specific enough that you know what you are targeting and not too vague. Saying something like “I want healthcare”, is too vague and 99% of companies will give you some healthcare, so this would need to be specified. This is just one example of literally thousands you can come up with. Having your non-negotiable list makes it easier to know which jobs you should pursue and which you should not later in the process. Now, don’t rule any jobs out based on your wants as you apply (unless there are a couple huge things that won’t work), just have these in the back of your mind.
* **Set up alerts on LinkedIn and apply as fast as possible**: Set up alerts for all job titles that are related to what you are looking for. I am in a more niche position, so I made the alerts “Sales Operations”, “Revenue Operations”, and “Business Operations”. I didn’t worry about adding Manager, Director, etc, because I focused more on the company and the job description vs. the title. **Tip:** Job titles are negotiable, especially at startup, small or medium sized companies. I specifically wanted to work remote, so I made my alerts for the 3 “titles” have 2 alerts, one for jobs specifically listed “remote”, and the other just “United States”. I found, especially at this time, a lot of companies are open to remote, but might list the job location as their headquarters. If you read the JD, it will say something like “flexible work from home policy”, “work from home”, “work from anywhere”, but the term remote isn’t on the location on LinkedIn, so it won’t pick up. Next, apply as fast as you can to the jobs.You want to apply in the first two days, the sooner the better. Think about it, if you are one of the first resumes, most employers will be excited, especially if you are a decent candidate. You’ll be scheduled quickly. If you were interviewing, wouldn’t you be kind of over it on your 15th zoom interview of the week? I think going early also gives you the chance to wow them and set the bar high. LinkedIn was where I spent 90% of my time and thus found 90% of the jobs I applied for. Next I did Indeed, Ziprecruiter and Glassdoor and got a handful of hits. I personally found all the jobs from LinkedIn were on one of these other sites but not the other way around. 
* **Cover Letter**: Cover letters are usually a waste of time. Don’t use one unless the job makes you. Seriously, I did not send any out unless it forced me to and had a 13.16% application to hit rate (hit meaning the company contacted me for an interview). That’s pretty good. If you do have to make a cover letter, find a template online. Change 2-3 sentences to match what you did to the JD and send it off. Don’t spend more than 5 minutes on these, again, they are a waste of everyone’s time. Same thing goes for the jobs that ask you to answer 10 questions with paragraph answers. My max was 3 questions that were 2 sentences each. More than that is a waste of time.
* **Resume:** This could be a whole section, but going to keep it short. My resume has the following format:  
\-Header with my name, phone, email, and city I am in (not full address)

\-Brief summary of my overall background and skills  
\-Skills and expertise (about 12)  
\-Tools/Tech (about 10)  
\-Experience   
\-Applicable certifications  
\-Education  
I found this format to be the most efficient. I have some pops of color, but no crazy designs. My resume is on 1 page, I do not think you should go onto 2 pages unless you have 15+ years of experience. Put all your bullets into a verb with the action you do or did. Examples include plan, manage, implement, design, collaborate, prepare, generate, etc. I personally went on LinkedIn and looked up jobs I wanted, then took the responsibilities they listed and tailored it to my resume. I recommend you look at a few to get different verbiage that seems to be prevalent. Lastly, I do not recommend having multiple resumes as it can get confusing to remember which one you applied to which job with. 

* **It’s a numbers game, apply for it all:** People who apply for all the jobs have been termed “sprayers” because they spray their resume everywhere. I’m pretty much a sprayer and have no shame. People frown on this practice because they say you haven’t done your research. My standpoint is I will do my research if you want to interview me. Why would I spend more than 1 minute researching something that 90% won’t happen? Makes no sense to me. So once I would get my alerts on LinkedIn, I would look at the job description, look at the website, then apply. 1 minute maximum. You want the top of your funnel to be full, so applying for the widest net makes this possible. 
* **“Years of Experience” isn’t all of it:** Most jobs will have a detailed JD, and they all love to throw out stuff like, “15 years of experience with a BA, or 18 without a BA”. Personally, I got a job asking for 10 years of experience when I have more like 5. Anyway, studies show women won’t apply for a job when they don’t meet most of the JD’s requirements, whereas men will apply if they meet 50-60% (part of income inequality). I took the approach of applying for anything I met 50% or so of the requirements for. Again, apply, the worst they can do is send you an automatic rejection email or nothing at all. 
* **Niche experience is the new thing:** With covid, employers are able to be picky af and the new thing they care about is niche experience. What I mean, is they want you to have experience identical to their business. For example, if a company sells floral arrangements to mostly businesses, they want a person that has experience working at another company selling floral arrangements to businesses. Florals to consumers just won’t cut it. I was rejected from a job after 6 interviews because I had 9.5/10 requirements. I had B2B sales ops experience in healthcare, but not their exact vertical, so was rejected. As frustrating as this is, you need to be the unicorn the company is looking for. Again, this is something I saw in a lot of the jobs I applied and interviewed and ultimately the job I did get. I’m a unicorn, yay!
* **Common interview questions:** I’m not going to go into what the most common are, but there are plenty of YouTube videos that are great. I personally love Andrew Lacivita and found his tips to be the most useful. Basically, you need 5 or so stories that you can use to answer most of the questions that will be asked. One example, “Tell me about a project you took on that was your biggest failure. What went wrong and why?”. Have a story lined up. I wrote down the question (main gist of it, a failure), and wrote down my story this way: the main approach I take to facing failure, then what happened, why it was bad, and how I resolved it. Notice I do not use the STAR method. I’m not going to get into a debate about it, but Andy Lacivita said that if you pick a story that the interviewer doesn’t like, the rest is pretty much fallen on deaf ears. So, if you approach it as I’ve said, you show the interviewer your big picture approach to failure, so they know what you would do if this happened again, then you get into an example. For this question, it would be something like “Great question. In general, I approach failure as xyz…. A specific situation would be when xyz…. This was a problem because xyz… I resolved this situation and made sure it would not happen again by doing XYZ. Do you want me to dive deeper on any of that?” Once you have your “stories” practiced, it makes interviewing way easier and less stressful. 90-95% of behavioral questions will fit one or a portion of your stories, so you’ll be all set.
* **Introduction for interviews:** “Tell me about yourself” or a variation of that is the most common interview question. Most people stutter on this simple question. Same as the previous tip, practice your answer. I like to make mine specific to that job. So, I will research the company and job description, then make a 3-4 sentence answer that tells them about me. Checkout Madeline Mann on YouTube, she has a nice template for this. I would write my answer out on a notecard for each interview. If it was a phone screener, great I could reference my notecard. If it was on Zoom and I was really nervous, I could tape my notecard behind my laptop. 99% of the time, just from thinking about my intro, making my notecard, and then reading it once or twice, I did not need to use it at all. 
* **Company Research:** Again, I suggest doing research after you have a phone screener or interview scheduled. The day before or day of, I take 10 minutes or so and research the company. Research the company’s website, the job description, and then search for the interviewer. If HR is interviewing you but the job description says something like, “This role reports directly to the Sr VP of Marketing”, look up that person’s profile as well If you can find something in common with the interviewer, you are golden. It does not have to be big. For example, maybe you and the interviewer spent time in the same city. Focus on this and they will feel a connection to you. The most important things that I have found are knowing the company’s “offering”, ie, their elevator pitch, some core duties in the JD, and the interviewer’s history at the company. They love to ask “How much do you know about XYZ Inc” or “What do you know about XYZ Inc”. Just give them a couple sentences then say, “I’d love to hear anything you could add on to that”. Then they will talk for a good 5-10 minutes. That’s really the extent of my research. No need to go over the top knowing everything about a company at this stage. Even if you have 2 minutes, look at the company’s website. NEVER tell the interviewer you did not do research or don’t know what they do.
* **During the Interview:** Given the current times, I am making the assumption most interviews are on Zoom. I’m not going to get into Zoom etiquette(enough sources on this), but do the basics and look presentable. Say hello to the interviewer, ask them, how they are doing, then try to start a conversation. If they respond to how are you then say something like “sorry if you hear my dog barking, my neighbors are mowing their lawn”, say something like, “oh no worries at all, I completely understand, what kind of dog do you have?” Get them talking about anything besides interviewing you. As this goes on, keep letting them talk as much as possible. When interviewers talk a lot, they leave with a positive connotation of you (cause you let them talk and people are ego-centric). Okay, when they actually ask you questions, this is where your 5 stories come in. Besides your stories, you must put the interviewer in the present tense. You do this by talking about what you will do at their organization, not talking about your past experience. Employers typically have a bias about your past when it is not their organization. They think “well sure, managing a customer success team was easy at that job because they sold a 1 time product, ours is a subscription not the same”, so you need to put yourself in the future tense at their company so that goes away. Towards the end of the interview, when they ask “Do you have any questions for me”, YES, you always have questions. Again, find questions that make the interviewer talk about themselves or that value their opinion. Here’s some I like and that they seem to like too (this assumes they haven’t answered or brought these things up already… most won’t):  
\-What has been the most challenging thing for you at XYZ company thus far?  
\-What do you think would be the biggest challenge for someone taking on this role (the one you are interviewing for)?  
\-What is something this person could do in the first 3 months to make the biggest impact?  
\-Is there anything else this role (or you if you feel confident), can do to make your life easier?  
If you noticed they had an award, mention something special they’ve done in their role, ask them to tell you more about it, the process, etc. Again, we want them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments as much as possible. Last, just a reminder, there will be people you don’t jive with and you will get tough questions. Don’t sweat, it is part of the process, and the less you take it personally the better.

**Tip:** Smile. Nothing is worse than getting on a zoom call with someone who looks bored af. Smile and look like you want to be there.   


* **Close Your Interview (this is a game changer):** At the end of the interview, preferably your last question, you want to close them. Do not say “What are next steps in your process” (unless you are speaking to the recruiter/HR). Basically, we want to ask them if they have any reservations about hiring you. This gives you the opportunity to address or clarify now instead of being sad when they reject you.  Your last question should be something along these lines, “I really enjoyed speaking with you, my last question is do you have any reservations about moving me through to the next round of this process?”. There are a few ways to soften this. If you think “reservations” is too harsh or brings up too much negativity, you can say “do you have any further questions for me or anything I can clarify so you feel confident moving me through to the next step in this process?” Another alternative, “Do you have any doubts about moving me through to the next step?”. Last thing on the alternative methods, you can either say “Moving me through to the next round/phase/step of this process” or you can say “hiring me for this role/position”. Practice this until you find a flow that works for you. Trust, me this is probably the most game changing tip I learned through this process. People will react in one of three ways. One, they will take a minute to think then say something like no I don’t. Two, they will smile (typically a sales type person), and will say thank you so much for asking, no I don’t have any reservations and they will usually say they think you’d be great. Three, they will say actually yes, and tell you their concern. I had 4 people out of my 95 respond that they did have a concern. Three out of the four, I was able to overcome and got offers and ultimately the role I accepted (amazing!). The last of the four, I could not overcome, but I knew right after the interview that it was probably a no. Again, this tip helped me so much, and I promise, your competition is not doing this. 
* **Send a Thank You email - always:** After your interview, always send a thank you email. Send the email to the recruiter, HR, the hiring manager, team members, whoever interviewed you. Do not email the recruiter or HR and ask for someone’s email. Google and figure it out on your own. Try some emails, the worst that happens if the email is wrong is that you get an unsendable email...You can keep your email short. My favorite template is Andrew Lacivita’s. Check it out, it is 3-4 sentences and gets the job done. I would aim to send the email within a 2 hour timeframe after your interview. I like to wait 15-20 minutes so they think I specially types the email for them, but don’t want to wait more than 2 hours. A quick email shows you are highly interested and seeing your email while you are fresh in their mind helps solidify you as a solid candidate. 
* **Avoid answering expected salary:** A lot of companies will want to discuss salary right away. Try to avoid this until the end of the process if you can. At the end of a process, when the job has decided you are the one, you have a lot more “chips” to bargain with. If they do ask for a salary during a screener call, I like to say something like, “I am flexible and wouldn’t have a specific amount in mind without understanding the full benefits package and costs associated. Do you have a range in mind for this position?”. Most of the time, I would say 75-80%, will say something like, “Oh yes we offer great benefits we can talk about that next, but the range for this role is $80,000 to $95,000, does that work for you?”. Always say yes, that works for me. The recruiter will not have the final say on the salary, the hiring manager or someone above them will. Your job here is to go through the process, make them fall in love with you, and offer you what you deserve. Take it from someone who did exactly this… I went through a process that ended up in an offer I declined, but the example works. They wanted to pay a certain range that was on the low end of my desired range, but I said, “without knowing the full costs of benefits and the package offered, I am sure if we go through this process we can find something that works for both of us”. I ended up getting an offer from another company that was a higher title and a more than the top of my range (more on this later), so I let this company know. I was very transparent and said, “I received another offer, it has a higher title and a higher pay associated, I know this role has X title, so I am not sure if you can get closer to my other offer.” Well, this company ended up changing their title to the higher one on my other offer, and got close to the pay I was asking for, $20K over their “budget”. I still declined this offer because my first offer one was just an overall better fit, and still paid more. But, that goes to show, companies can change their titles, budgets, etc, if they see your value. 
* **References matter:** Your references matter, especially the higher up you go. Personally, I’ve been very fortunate to have some awesome former co-workers I can depend on and a former supervisor who is awesome. That being said, if you do not have these, I would work diligently on figuring this out. If you are employed, can you build some relationships that are strong and would be helpful? If you are not employed, you will need to network and find some strong allies. I would say that co-workers and former managers are going to be your best references though. That being said, I had two major red flags I found with references. First, I had a company I was interviewing with that said the next step in their process would be me sending over all my past managers' contact information and my current manager… this was without any sort of offer and while I was still employed. This is a major red flag and I would not advise anyone do this. This one in particular did not progress to that stage, but if it had, I would have kindly declined to proceed in their process. Second red flag, I had a couple companies email me very explicit directions for the references they wanted, for example, a manager, a person I managed, sales person I worked with, and another co-worker. At the time, I needed to speak with my former manager and person I managed, so I emailed back that I needed some time but could send some other references in the meantime. The hiring manager was really pushy and said he’d wait for my manager and the person I managed. Unfortunately, this gave me really bad vibes because it came off as very micro-managing and like they didn’t trust me. I was able to get the references ok to have this person call them, but I ultimately emailed them that I was pursuing other opportunities. Let me be clear, I think it is fine to ask for references and I understand you may need to provide your previous employer’s contact information to have your employment verified once you have an offer, I personally just don’t get a good feeling from companies being very pushy on what type of references you send. The two companies I did provide references for were really cool about it and just asked for 3 professional references, no dictating what they did or how we interacted. This feels reasonable to me and I was happy to provide. When you do provide a person’s contact information to be your reference, make sure to ask your reference if this is okay, do not just put their number down. If they say yes, kindly give them a head’s up about the job, company, who would likely be contacting them (90% of the time it will be the HR person or the hiring manager), and anything else pertinent they need to know. Thank your references profusely! 
* **Always negotiate your offer:** Great, you interviewed, sent over references, they love you and want to make an offer! This in my opinion is the most stressful part of the process. If they give you a verbal offer, always ask for it in writing before you accept, negotiate, or decline. Thank them for the offer and let them know you are appreciative. Once you have the offer in hand, review and make a list of your questions. Do not accept an offer until all your questions are answered about the job, compensation, benefits, stock if applicable, pto, etc. I personally found healthcare costs to vary greatly, make sure you ask for the plan’s costs, most HR people will be happy to share and send you their benefits guide. If they don’t, I would consider this a red flag. Not going to get into it, but had a company not provide the guide and their benefits ended up being a major bait and switch that changed quickly, they did not want to tell me. I would also ask when their plans renew (most are in November to start January of the next year), and if their costs have been stable the last couple years.   
As for actually negotiating your offer, I am of the mindset to never accept a first offer. Unless you are going to be in a VP or C-suite role, I think you have 1 negotiation round, then you accept or decline. If you are getting an offer, hopefully they have not lowballed you. I personally was fortunate to not get lowballed in the current processes, so I am going to focus on getting a decent first offer. Once you get the offer, see what you want more of. Maybe it’s salary, or bonus, PTO, or something else. Generally, everything is negotiable. Depending on your experience, the role, and the company, there may be several items you want to negotiate or just one. Note, you are negotiating, don’t expect to ask for 5 items and get all 5 the way you want.   
Once you have your items, I recommend emailing the employer and simply asking if they have a few minutes to touch base. Do not, I repeat, do not email them your negotiations as a lot can get lost in translation. Most employers at this stage will get on the call and this is when you tell them again how appreciative you are for the offer. I personally like to soften them up with a couple non-negotiation questions, maybe something like “would you be able to give me a brief overview of what the first 2 weeks of onboarding might look like?”. Let them answer, then ask anything else not relating to negotiating your offer. Once these questions are answered, I would say something like, “Great thanks again for answering my questions, this helps a lot. I am really excited about this opportunity, I had one more thing I wanted to touch base on, is there any wiggle room on the salary and PTO allowance?”. Note, I use “wiggle” because it is a funny word and doesn’t have a negative connotation or make it sound like you are being demanding. They will typically say something like, “What are you looking for? I will check” (something to this effect), or they will say no the offer is final (this is rare). Let’s say they go with answer one, then I would tell them solidly what you are looking for. For example, “Would it be possible to get the base salary to X?”. That’s it. Do not get into a ramble or rant about why you want, need, deserve more money. No one wants to hear it. If they do ask, I suggest having 1 response based on the responsibility of the role. Perhaps you have a significant number of direct reports, or have longer hours than previous roles. Do not reference what you found online as these numbers on sites like Glassdoor can be wrong, vary greatly by location and company, and aren’t personalized to you. Most employers will respond that they will look into it and get back to you. Try not to get anxious while you wait. I know it is scary that they might rescind your offer, but I promise this is so rare. It’s all about how you deliver it, and if you were kind and appreciative, they won’t. Once they get back to you, it will either be: they can do everything you asked, you get some of what you asked, or they can’t do anything. In any of these three options, it is now your choice to accept or decline. Again, unless this is a VP or C-Suite role, I do not recommend countering again. **Tip:** Get everything in writing. I have been burned by this in the past where I was told I would get quarterly bonuses, but this was not in writing. Turns out this was the wrong information. Do not sign anything until you have it documented
* **Follow your intuition:** This is probably one of my biggest tips. You know in your gut if something is right. We are conditioned to repress our intuition too much and do not let it do its job. I had accepted a job previously that my gut told me was not it, but I took it anyway, and within a week, I knew it was not it. Do not accept a job you have any reservations about or your intuition is telling you no. If you feel this now, it will not get better. Your intuition is a powerful tool you should use.  
Good luck on your search, you can do it, never forget that!

So ill be graduating in a few with bachelors in information science with a focus on data science, however I have no idea what my next steps should be for finding a job. I never tried to get any internships because I felt like i didn't know enough to even apply so outside of school I have no experience yet. That being said I think I need a little bit of help narrowing down what type of entry level jobs to aim for. From school I enjoyed the python coursework and little bit of networking and infrastructure I had to do. I think the job market in my area, DC Maryland Virginia, is pretty competitive at the moment so are there any certifications i should look into to make myself stand out more than just my bachelors?"

mycan7,0,2021-04-25,Got accepted for an internship I have no business being in,KingSwirly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mycan7/got_accepted_for_an_internship_i_have_no_business/,"Background:

I’m a junior SWE major

I know unit testing and creating console applications, in Java/c#

I’ve worked as a leader on a lot of teams, and worked in a product manager type role for an open source project.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been applying to Product Management and SWE internships for the summer and got accepted to a PM one, but the position requires me to deploy and application to the cloud myself when I’ve never even touched even touched JavaScript or any backend framework. I’m trying to learn html and css now but I can’t learn it fast enough for the internship that starts in two weeks.

I wrote an email to the recruiter saying I wasn’t an experienced developer and only can do XYZ, but I get the feeling she didn’t understand what I meant or misunderstood. 

The company specifically asked for coding experience in Java/c++/python. How I even got accepted is beyond me, but the interviewers were vague when I asked them an explanation of what they wanted. They simply stated “deploy an application to the cloud, we want to see what it’s like from a developer’s perspective”. They left it at that and I didn’t want to look too incompetent so I just went along with it. 

If i bring this up for a third time I know this will become too big of an issue for them. Should I just binge and try to learn html/css/JavaScript/angular in a couple weeks and during the onboarding, then worry about the rest later? Is that even possible? I have an idea for a project that would just use a front end and call 2 third party api’s. It would have no database but learning an entire language and framework along with css and creating an application within 3 weeks seems fucking insane. Plus I have finals.

Besides this I got accepted for nothing else, and this company is really good. They hire back consistently. I’m looking for SWE FTE’s out of college. Should I spend my summer on this or instead learn JavaScript/angular properly, build a solid portfolio, then find a job that way out of college. Obviously it’d be more difficult finding a job, but if I spend half my summer screwing around at this internship and nothing comes of it I could be screwed in the long term."

I was told in my phone screen that I was applying for either a software developer or a sw dev in test with a range of 58-65k.  A day after my final interview I got a call notifying I was selected for a different role (QA test analyst) and that I'd get another phone call with a verbal offer this upcoming week. I'm a little wary about being offered a lower salary than what I'd be willing to take, as I'm sure everyone is. While I'm a new grad in CS, 3 more weeks till graduation, I do have a BA in Political Science. I'm sort of just preparing for the worst, I don't have internships or prior CS jobs but do have professional experience (2-3 years) and some worthy school projects I've completed. 

Are there any tips or topics to avoid when you want to counter an offer?"

I’m International, Indian. SAT: English-680 Math-790
Toefl-107
9th-91%
10th-94%
Most importantly 11th-72% (I changed schools mid session)
12th pre board-91%


Missed all deadlines before 15 January.

Got into UW Madison CS (55k fees)
Got into UMass Amherst (40k fees)

Now I either go to these or reapply next year because I feel like I missed out on places such as UC Berkeley, UIUC, Gatech, UT Austin, etc. because I missed the deadlines. 

If I reapply
I am sure to score 1550 on SAT Retake and a 90+ 12th class final grade.

I am super confused as both the programs are good, yet expensive. Also I might get into better ones next year but am Super confused whether it’s worth to skip a whole year out. I need a really competitive and great college which provides me best opportunities for research, internships and startups.

I’m not betting on Ivies as for them you need super luck as an Indian. Also others better than UW Madison don’t provide much scholarships either, so will have to take out a high loan anyway.

Sorry if it’s too long. Got on Reddit just now.

Also send me personal message if you feel like."

myi8cg,1,2021-04-25,Life is a big fat joke,churchisforbrunettes,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/myi8cg/life_is_a_big_fat_joke/,"
 (24f) Both my dad and my older brother are diagnosed sociopaths, so my life was basically f*cked from the start. I grew up in a household full of physical and emotional abuse, manipulation, neglect, stealing and lying. I had friends when i was around 12, one of them became a drug addict, the other one a prostitute, another has been in an asylum since forever and the last one 'moved' to morocco at age 13 to marry and never be heard of again. One of them is still my friend and is doing good in life, but ever since she has a boyfriend, she doesn't speak to me anymore or only when she has problems and needs my help. I made other friends througout the year, but they all ditched me. I never bonded with anyone like i did with my friends from when i was 12. I guess our shitty lives connected us, but they were all a victim of their crappy upbringing, like me i guess. I don't have any real family. I occassionaly get forced to go to a family gathering but they are all racists and also talk crap about my mom in front of me, so not the greatest crowd. I had one niece, who was also my godmother, she was awesome. She hung herself in her basement when i was 13. When i was 15 i got scouted to be a model, i saw it as a chance to escape my life and become more independent, but because of the height restrictions it was nearly impossible to break through. I did some cool stuff, i even was in a magazine once, but i wasn't tall enough to make big money. And now at 24 i am basically retired in the industry and two photographers who i loved working with, ditched me because well, i got too old and too fat (fat in model industry standards). I got fatter because i'm on antidepressants. I probably have ADD too according to my doctor but i can't afford the test. As for love life: my first boyfriend in college left me at 3AM, without any explanation. A week later he was dating my colleague from my student job. I was heartbroken and tried to kill myself, i never told anybody. Then i dated a guy on and off for 4 years who was awful to me, emotionally abused me and compulsively cheated on me. But my self esteem was so low that i let it all happen. I did finally get rid of him, which was very hard for me. I now have a crush on a guy from my student job, but i can tell that he probably doesn't like me. And as if that wasn't all bad enough: i have horrible tinnitus that makes me so so so depressed and truly makes me want to jump off a bridge even more. It also makes me annoying to be around: i can't go to parties, i can't watch tv too loud, can't stand it when people talk loud...even my mom is getting annoyed by it.
Oh and for those saying to go to therapy: i had a first appointment with my therapist, which was ok. She never replied to my e-mails in which i asked to continue the sessions (and yes, i'm sure i had the right contact info), she probably saw that i'm a lost cause.
Other than that i think i might be bisexual but i'm not sure. I had/have (kind off) a crush on a girl i went to high school with, but idk if i feel physically attracted to women. So i struggle with that too.
Oh and i forgot to mention: my parents divorced when i was 12. My mom still lived in our old house, which i loved. But then one day she moved without telling me and they threw away all my stuff except for my clothes. Not that much later, both my cats died. This hurt me so much, they were the only friends i had.
As for school, i am doing a masters but i am so depressed that i feel like i am paralyzed and i can't do anything so i know i'm gonna fail. On top of that i didn't find an internship place because of covid so i'm f*cked anyhow. 
I can't escape either because i have no money..
I had good friends at my dorm, but they literally told me last week that i hang out with them too much and they basically want me to leave them alone. I'm just a burden to everyone.
I tried. I tried really really hard to make something of my life but it feels like life itself keeps throwing sh*t at me and is basically telling me to die. Even if everything were to work out, i still have the torture of tinnitus so it all doesn't matter anyway. I just wish i didn't wake up anymore."

I asked a question here last week about my situation. I interviewed at a non-profit organization (Company A) for an internship about a month ago. The interview went very well and I was told they wanted to bring me on but would need to confirm with their funders if they have the budget to bring on a summer intern. The HR rep gave me an unofficial offer last week, mentioning that it was likely she would be able to give me an actual offer in about a week. She sent me an email yesterday with an official offer and mentioned that I need to reply by Tuesday morning on whether I accept, and then she will send me the paperwork to sign to accept the summer contract. 

I was contacted by a very big insurance company (Company B) a couple weeks ago about a position they think I would be a good fit for. I interviewed last week and the interview went amazingly, probably one of the best interviews I've ever had. The hiring manager was basically having a casual conversation about the position with me and said some very reassuring things throughout the interview. He ended it off by telling me I should be proud of myself for landing the interview and that I seemed like a very confident young man. I was also told they would get back to me within a week about the result of the interview. 

Now that I have an official offer from Company A and a deadline to respond, I'm unsure of how to move forward. I like Company B a lot better; I've had friends who have worked there and they've all told me it's amazing. Even more, the position with Company B is directly lined up with the career path I am interested in and want to go down. Company A is a very small company and the position is related to where I want my career to go, but nowhere close to the position with Company B. I also know Company B is well-known and would look very good a resume, as opposed to Company A. 

Can someone please provide me with some guidance on this? I want to reach out to Company B and let them know they are my top choice, but I don't wanna seem pushy or like I am rushing them to make a decision. Is it possible for me to accept the offer from Company A and then pull out if Company B gives me an offer? Both positions would be contract positions for the summer, so if I were to pull out after accepting the offer but before signing a contract, would that be okay (from a legal perspective)?"

Towards the end of college I took as many courses as I could in those areas, but I still feel really behind. I even managed to get my M.

I have a lot of experience working in labs and processing data (\~4yrs, part time during school and one internship at a research hospital), and some project experience building small robots on bare metal boards. Originally I chose BME because I had an interest in prosthetics and I thought I would get to explore many fields to figure out in more detail what I actually liked doing.

Plus, it doesn't help that I, like most people, have been stuck home for a year due to Covid and really need to get away lol.

Maybe I'm just not seeing the big picture and realizing it's better to take this than no internship at all?

I know only I can decide what's best for me, but was wondering if anyone had any input on this situation and whether it's worth sticking with this internship."

I'm currently not able to figure out what I should be focusing on. And that along with a good dose of procrastination, is causing me to waste time dinking around with useless things like environment setup and whatnot.

Mainly I'm torn between LeetCode and Personal Projects.

I don't know if I should be focusing my time learning about data structures and algorithms, which would give me a leg up when grinding LeetCode.

At the same time, I want to work on projects as well, which would obviously give me development experience and whatnot. 

Right now, I'm also trying to juggle working with the GSoC organization I've sent a proposal for, which would help me snag a really nice internship with them. 

But unfortunately it's somewhat clear that I'm not going to get it, so I'm not sure if I should spend time working on that either.

I'm more inclined to do personal projects, but my pace is very slow, which leads me to believe that I'm mostly just wasting my time.

Would like to hear thoughts on this."

It is with the same company, same pay, but at a different location that I hear is a lot less stressful than where I'm at right now. I work in specialized residential care and my job is very draining as many of the residents are aggressive on a daily basis. I love my coworkers but other than that my job satisfaction right now is on the lower end of the spectrum.

This would be a no-brainer except that I work 4 days a week right now because of school, and over there I would have to work 5. They have already told me this is not negotiable. Starting in September I have to take 4 classes per term instead of the 2 I'm doing right now and I'm not sure how well I would be able to handle that while working full-time.

Additionally, in my senior year (fall 2022) I have to do a 16 hour/week internship, 9-5 2 days a week, meaning I would either have to quit the new job or have zero days off for almost a year. My current boss is very flexible with my schedule and understands that I may need to change it again in the future.

I'm leaning towards not taking it - as much as I dislike my job, I feel like the next few years are going to be stressful no matter what I do and I really value that extra day off to give me some breathing room.

Am I making the right call? Anyone else have experience trying to juggle full-time school and work?"

Additional Information:

Halfway through my 1st semester of senior year I switched from SL Physics to HL. This isn't on my transcript for the 1st semester(school policy) but will be for IB Grades and 2nd semester grades. However, my counselor communicated this to all my schools.

Concluding thoughts:

I still can't believe that I got into Penn, I remember opening all 5 ivy decisions at the exact same time thanks to some fast clicking and not seeing Penn until the end and nearly knocking over my computer from jumping with excitement. I'm beyond excited to start learning CS at such a great school and maybe even dipping my toes into the business world with the opportunity of Wharton quite literally being next door.

My one piece of advice to CO2022, cast a wide net! If you have the resources and the time, apply to all the schools you want to, don't be discouraged by essays. I personally spent a lot of time working on my applications and am relieved to know it worked out! Good luck to everyone applying next year!"

I am a fourth year computer engineering student and accepted an internship offer at a pretty well known defense contracting company. The thing is they only gave me a week deadline to accept the offer many months ago but I have still been applying to other companies in the mean time.

At the moment, I am still in the hiring process with 2 companies (final round for both). The problem is that the internship I have accepted is beginning on May 24th. However the final round for one of the companies is May 10th, then after that I will have to wait for the result.

I honestly wouldn't keep moving forward with these 2 companies if I didn't believe the work/the program/the offer will be better than the current offer I have accepted. But now I am worried about the timing of these offers coming up very close to the start of my current internship. Also, if I do receive an offer and decide to take it, I feel like rescinding very close to the start of the internship would be very bad. Please advise me on what I should do. Thanks

edit: I guess I didn’t make this clear in my post, but other than rescinding, I’m also concerned about the timing of receiving the other potential offers. I have to move/sign a lease for my current offer. Do I inform the 2 other companies at all of my situation or just wait to hear back? Maybe if I nudged them they could be quicker in letting me know earlier. Idk"

Instead of hiring full time employees, we want to bring in interns and train them until they are able to do the real work.

The issue is since I'm into mobile development and the interns will be in web development as well alongside mobile devs, I just don't know how to train them nicely without actually getting any full time web developer involved in here.

We clearly don't want to waste the precious time of the interns because if they aren't going to learn we rather not invite them into the company as interns.

So my question is, how can I make their overall internship period fruitful ?

Can you guys share your past internship experiences in tech companies, and at least tell what went right or wrong and how things could have been better?

&amp;#x200B;

I need some insight so we can make the learning experience better.

If all fails, we will scrape interns for the stack I personally can't train.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, our company does web and mobile apps development and we are at the very early stage, 0 clients so far.

Also, right now it's only the two of us.

I did not plan to ever pursue a career in the United States, but as life is..... I met an American girl, married her, and now we are working towards moving there in about 2 years from now. So visa and a working permit are not going to be a problem. 

To my person:

* I got the European equivalent of an  Associate's Degree in Engineering Technology 
* 1-year Military Service 
* 4 1/2 years planning for plant construction, especially industrial plant construction (mainly waste to energy systems in AVEVA PDMS / E3D, ACAD, ACAD Advance Steel) and  Static and Dynamic Analysis of Complex Piping and Steel Structures (Rohr 2) 
* BSc in Petroleum Engineering (including various internships, 2 years of research as a student assistant, and (hopefully) 3 publications) 
* The next step would be an MSc degree in energy technology (to distance me a bit from the 'pigeonhole' O&amp;G). 

So do you guys have any experience with people like me entering the American job market? How hard of a time do you think I will have to get a foot in the door?  And do you have any recommendations on either in or outer curricular activities I could pick up to make myself more hireable?"

So here's a short explanation of my situation:

I'm 24 years old, I graduated two years ago as a bachelor of architecture, with a 2.85 / 4.00 GPA, I know, not high. I have only two work experience, architecture intern for 3 months, and a junior interior designer for 3 months - I got laid off because of COVID last April. Unfortunately I didn't learn much from those jobs, for example, I never got involved with project management, which is a popular requirement for junior level architect positions. Ever since, I've been seasonally productive and lazing off, following my depressive episodes and health condition.

I worked on my portfolio and practiced rendering with new applications. I also applied one design proposal for an architecture competition, which didn't win, but it's a nice addition to my portfolio, I guess. I edited plenty of choir videos for my church, directed an online musical theater video for them on Christmas, and edited one video for my relative's company. One time I became an editor and layout designer for a book my relative wrote. I'm thankful for my relatives, don't get me wrong. In fact, my aunt just asked me to supervise the renovation of her house.

But I want to start my professional career. Last year, I applied to plenty of postings with few responses and even fewer interviews (only one, I think). I started applying again about two months ago, starting from architecture consultants, and none of them responded. With my lack of experience and reference, it's understandable. At this point, I'm quite overwhelmed with what I should improve in order to snatch at least one interview. Again, I know I'm capable of doing some things, but the lack of response in my job application made me so self-conscious. It's very discouraging.

More random stuffs I did:

* I was granted a scholarship for a short Data Science bootcamp, and I acquired a Data Science certification... Only to realize I'm not into the industry.
* In the past, I created social media content for my university organization. But that's like, 5 years ago."

On the other hand, I'm worried about taking 186 with 61C because 186 is a very project-heavy class. And I will also be spending a significant time recruiting. And I kinda also wanted to take 188 with Prof. Dragan, because I've heard she's really nice with teaching 188.

I'll be spending a significant time of next semester recruiting for a summer internship. So, my primary concern is that my combo should not be too time consuming.

Following your advice RE why I couldn't get an internship, I've really grown my portfolio of extracurriculars and related groups. I'm currently working as an electrical engineering research assistant at a biomedical research institute, and without saying too much I am becoming more deeply involved as a major engineering player in a student start-up.

Since the lockdown's I have had some time alone to reflect on my personal direction. I would really like to be a part of a young, ambitious engineering industry here in my home country. This start-up that I work at is extremely tightly linked with start-ups of similar natures in the same office, with more emerging every year. A smaller yet more mature start-up has recently received funding through investors and is under the personal mentorship of the famous head of a VERY prominent company in this industry (he's a household name). Like, I'm tight with these people, and they have this guy on speed dial. And now they're making some noise about hiring more engineers.

I would LOVE to work with them. I can't believe I have this kind of opportunity and I consider myself very lucky. But I do have some reservations (this is all just hypothetical btw). Firstly, that I want to finish all of my classes this year (finishing by early November), but I think that that is probably negotiable? The second is the pay, they are all dropped out of uni to work on this start-up, and are paying themselves minimum-wage, and wishing they could pay themselves even less. The thing is I've worked hard throughout uni, and I am in a position to repay my loans the second I graduate. Clean slate. My third and final reservation is will I be 'falling behind' by joining a start-up straight out of uni? How would it look on a CV, how would I get my engineering charter? What might future employers think of it? There is always the likely case of if it all crumbles, I would move into the company run by big-boss-guy-famous-guy.

So I guess I'm asking do I take it?"

myx1ii,2,2021-04-26,Need help - Poli Sci Degree + Career Opportunities,throwaway851945,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/myx1ii/need_help_poli_sci_degree_career_opportunities/,"I'll try and keep this as concise as possible, and add as much detail as I can so you can understand my situation. **tl;dr at the bottom for those that want it.**

I'm a 17M, nearing the end of his second to last year of high school. I study History, Government and Politics, and English Lit at A-level (British curriculum). As of right now, I am very much on track to study either Poli Sci or maybe Intl. Relations at Uni abroad, most likely Canada. Having done some reading, it seems that Poli Sci is not a degree that gives you a straight forward path to a job/ career, and this worries me somewhat. I know people will say (rightly so) that a degree in the STEM fields is much more likely to land you a well paying, secure career prospect immediately after Uni than say Poli Sci or any BA degree is, and if it weren't for the fact that I am pretty crap at STEM, as well as not finding it interesting and don't enjoy learning about it in the slightest, I would heed that advice and take a STEM degree, but that isn't my case unfortunately. In terms of what I am good at and what I enjoy, Poli Sci is the best match for me in both those aspects. But as I say, it seems it doesn't lead easily into a stable career right out of Uni. For reference, I am intending on graduating in either 2025/ 2026 depending on the Uni I end up at.

I'll elaborate a little more on my situation that may make my situation a little different to those Poli Sci grads who are struggling to find work:

* I really don't mind not working in the ""Poli Sci sector"" as it were. At the end of the day, I am fairly flexible in what I can do, and am more worried about getting food on the table than I am doing my dream job. In actual fact, I would say I don't have a dream job, I just want a job that I enjoy somewhat (or at least don't hate), and is stable, pays well, and like I say, puts a roof over my head and food on the table. I find a pretty wide range of stuff interesting once I get into it, so am not limiting my career prospects to just Political based jobs. I have no issue expanding my horizons and working in sectors that wouldn't naturally be thought of to be related to Poli Sci. I guess in that aspect I'm not keen on ""boxing myself in"" by only applying to jobs related strictly to my degree.
* I understand that thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people all across Canada will be doing a similar if not the same degree as me, and will all be applying and scrambling at a job market that (especially now) is dwindling. For this reason, I also understand that I need work experience/ internships to pad up my CV if I am to stand a chance at getting a job right out of Uni. I'm intending on doing at least 2 internships over the summer breaks I have throughout my duration of study at Uni to give me that extra ""stand-out"" CV that might put me above others when applying for a job in terms of work experience desirability. Additionally, I can speak conversational German, and am in the process of potentially beginning to learn French too.
* I have no intention of going on to study further at Masters level or any equivalent. My parents have said that they are not paying for my education after my undergrad degree (completely understandable), and honestly, I am not fussed on coughing up somewhere in the realms of 10k CAD whilst having to work to fund that. I would much rather make myself as employable as possible right out of my undergrad and start working ASAP than stretch out my education whilst being out of pocket paying for it.
* I understand that coming out of Uni, you are not going to land a job that pays in the upper echelons right away. That's the nature of the beast. However, with that kept in mind, I have no issue working my way ""up the ranks"" as it were. If I am able to get my internships through during my time at Uni, with any luck I might be able to land an entry-level job somewhere with that experience giving me the edge over other applicants, or perhaps even get a job offer after doing an internship, which I understand is a possibility. In essence, I'm not picky on what level the job is. I understand my first full time job won't make me a CEO or anything even close to that, but I'm willing to accept something on the beginner end of the career spectrum and work my way up through hard work and effectively ""jumping"" the career ladder with every job as I rack up more experience over the years, effectively adding to my CV more and more.

With all these points listed above, I will now get to my main question. **With the points I have put forward about me, my aspirations, and how and what I am willing to work as, do you think I will stand a better chance at getting a job after my undergrad than most other Poli Sci grads?**

*tl;dr: Am at a crossroads in my life of what I want to study + the employability of my degree. Need help figuring out if I have a good shot at landing a job right out of my undergrad bearing in mind the points I put forward about myself above (willing to work outside of the ""Poli Sci sector"", padding up CV whilst at Uni with work experience/ other skills, willing to accept the hustle and work my way from entry-level upwards).*"

He's working on a closely related project, we already have a relationship, and he'll make a great reference for phds because he'll have known me since undergrad all the way through grad school (and a safe option because he's already written me great letters). Also the internship I did with him was a chemistry project and I really would like to transition from my current genetics oriented research into more biochem related work so he would be the only person who could be a reference for my chemistry knowledge.

I'm thinking that if I choose him it will give me an additional option for references because if I'm working in the other professors lab she's still a solid recommendation option regardless of being on my committee. However I'm wondering if it would be weird or even blatantly rude to have someone be that heavily involved in the project but not be officially on my committee. 

So she makes a lot more sense in the short term for actually being the most useful committee member for my thesis but the other professor if I get him included in the project will end up being a really solid recommendation when I apply to phds. He's stretched a bit thin working on several grants right now so he wouldnt have as much time for me but he does occasionally ask for updates on my thesis so I think he's still invested enough in me and the project to say yes, plus he's on so many projects because he's such a well established person in the field so hed be a really strong reference. Does anyone have any insight?"

I'm an evolutionary biology masters student and would like some help/input for my current project! I am doing a bioinformatics internship, but no one at my lab really understands what I'm doing and I am kinda stuck. I will first tell you a little bit about the scope of my project before diving into my questions.

So for my project I have 4 transcriptomes; Parent species A, parent species B and two hybrids. I don't have a reference genome since I'm working with salamanders and these guys have ginormous genomes (like 10x human genome). My goal is to find the **parent-specific transcripts** in the hybrids. I think this is called an Allele-Specific Expression analysis. I run everything on a HPC in linux from my university. So far I have cleaned up the transcriptomes before assembly with Trimmomatic and SortMeRna and then performed the de novo assembly with Trinity. For the quality assessment of the assembly I used the Trinitystats.py and read representation using Bowtie (which looked quite okay). 

And now to the point where I am stuck. 

The next steps in my pipeline are verry blurry for me and I'm overwhelmed with information from the internet. My next step would be using BUSCO to find orthologues (I've tried running RnaQUAST on our HPC but couldn't get it running), but for the transcripts that I don't find orthologues for I think need to predict the ORF's/genes (ORFfinder/Transdecoder?). But then I also have to do variant calling (?) in the parent species (how do you do this?) and try to find these parent specific transcripts in the hybrids (Bioconductor in R?). I don't really understand in what order which kind of programs I should run next in my pipeline. I've read a lot of literature about *de novo* transcriptome assemblies, but most of them do have a reference genome (or transcriptome), plus I could not find an article which tries to do the same thing as  me.

To break it down I have two big questions:

1. what programs should I be looking at?

2. In what order do I need to run these programs?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice/insights/constructive criticism would be very **very** much appreciated! I will try to answer questions as well, but I'm definitely not a bioinformatician.

Thank you guys so much!!"

While I had glowing grades and reviews, I absolutely hated my final semester of internships.

The job is kind of vague, in a way, and I’m a person that thrives on well-known rules and expectations. I’m now at the point where I have to work, and the money from the healthcare job would really be good...but the thought of taking the job makes me feel 10 kinds of awful, anxious, and depressed. It would likely take 6-12 months to feel somewhat confident in the position and my abilities.

I can do a different job (my partner is supportive of any path I take, thankfully) but it will be more of an entry level salary. I left with some school debt. And our house is a “fixer upper” that needs MAJOR repairs to really be decently livable (new roof, HVAC, several appliances have failed, etc.) So I’m constantly wrestling with it and feeling awful that I could elevate us from this if I just took the darn job. Idk if I should take the job that makes me feel so awful, or go a different direction and make less money. I just feel so stuck right now. At my previous job, I had been there many years and loved feeling confident that my employer loved having me and I did a great job.

myzccv,0,2021-04-26,Need Help Deciding: UIUC vs UBC CS (international student),dpfmca,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/myzccv/need_help_deciding_uiuc_vs_ubc_cs_international/,"Hey! So, I have less than a week 'til I have to commit to a university, and right now my top choices are between UIUC and UBC (vancouver, canada) for CS. I totally get that I'll get biased responses posting here, but I'd love to hear your inputs anyway. 

As an international student, I'm pretty worried about the job and internship opportunities available in the US, since, compared to Canada, getting a working visa -- if that's an option I'd like to to take in the future -- seems to be more difficult. 

UIUC's tuition is higher by around 5k/year, but its CS program seems to be regarded as better than UBC's. I'd also have to declare CS *after* my first year at UBC, and that means averaging around 80% across the courses I'd take in the Faculty of Science (there *is* a small chance I wouldn't be able to declare the major). Meanwhile, I was directly admitted to CS at UIUC. Also, UIUC's campus culture seems to be a lot more vibrant than UBC's, but UBC's location in Vancouver is nicer to live in. 

To all of you: How would you compare the tech industry between US and Canada? How would the opportunities differ for CS (international) students? How do you think the experience (in college and after) would differ overall? 

If you know UBC, how do you think the CS program compares to UIUC's?

What do you think in general about choosing between these two universities, given my circumstances?

If there are any international students reading this, was it difficult for you to get internships, and are/were you afraid you wouldn't be able to get a job or (if you wanted to) extend your OPT/CPT? 

Also! I don't know if this matters all that much, but the US doesn't seem like a very safe place for Asian women right now (and I am one). Is safety ever a particularly prominent issue here? And lastly, do you feel like international students integrate well into the community at UIUC? I've heard international students could sometimes isolate and group themselves together at other universities, and I'm just curious if that happens here. (I wouldn't want to do that.)"

I don't understand what's wrong with me or what I'm doing wrong. 

For pretty much my entire life I've wanted to become a history teacher. I enjoy reading, talking, and learning history, and I've enjoyed teaching English abroad. When I got into college I set up all of my courses with this goal in mind - dual major in Education and History, take the necessary tests, become a teacher. Everything was on track and I was going to be happy teaching. Maybe not earn even half of what my father earns but that's ok, I don't mind the money that much, I'll earn enough to live. As a teacher abroad I worked in a school that worked with a lot of students with mental struggles, and I've even managed to help some of them get their lives turned around and go on to have successful lives filled with confidence. Many of my former students today are fairly happy, motivated students who have managed to turn their lives around and enter prestigious universities. I felt that as a history teacher, I could do what I enjoy and make a positive impact on students at the same time.

That was until recently . . . I'm not sure exactly when this began but I definitely noticed it by two months ago. A requirement at my university for the education program is two years of student teaching, but thanks to Covid the school I was set up to do my student teaching at had to close itself to ""non-essential"" personnel, which meant the cancellation of my student teaching. I'm a junior, so I don't have the time to keep going and graduate on time.

It's put a real roadblock on my plans to teach. However, I figured that I could still either take a fifth year of college or go to graduate school and get a master's in education, since I am on track to graduate early for my history degree. However, all of those options cost money, which has become a problem as well.

My family's already burned through most of our reserves for me to go to college, and my father has had cancer in the past. This is his third time, and I'm afraid that it will be his last. Every day he wakes up in pain and has horrible coughing fits throughout the day, and when I'm in bed at night sometimes I can hear him crying. He says he can keep working and not to worry about finances, but I can tell that he's breaking down and that he can probably keep working for one or two years maximum before he falls apart. And of course cancer could get him before then. Even if he could work long enough for him to help pay for graduate school or a fifth year of college, I don't want him to. I just want him to retire and enjoy life as best he can now, before his body breaks down further. He's done so much for me, and I just want him to be happy. He immigrated to this country slowly climbing up from multiple minimum wage jobs while attending school, and even though he's managed to climb up to a very well-paying job, he's never taken a day off in his life.

This means, of course, that I'm going to need to save up the funds to go to graduate school, if I want to be a teacher. But with just a B.A. in History now awaiting me at the end of my undergrad, one of those ""useless"" degrees (don't worry, I embrace the jokes now), and with my entire previous work experience being either teaching abroad or the fast food work I've been doing outside of school to help pay my way, I don't have the work experience or the degree or qualifications to get a half-decent job. I'm in the Boston area (and I'd like to stay just so I can be close to my parents, especially my father, because at his state who knows when things get real bad?), and pretty much any job that pays more than 40k (the point where I believe I can effectively save up for graduate school and sustain myself while paying back loans) requires certificates, specialized degrees, or years of work experience, which I lack. Hell, a lot of jobs here that pay only 30k (the point where I believe I can at least ""survive"" and sustain myself if I abandon my dreams of teaching, going back to school, or having a family or even dating) still require specialized degrees or years of experience. As for the skilled trades, I lack the strength and body - I have a back condition. Financially, I know that this is basically the best my life will ever get; all that awaits me after graduation next year is minimum wage fast food or retail work, and trying to get out of that takes more school, which I can't pay for. A classic 9-5 Mon-Fri job never looked so appealing, yet at the same time so unreachable. Trying to work fast food and college at the same time has also ended up hurting my studies, and while my GPA is nowhere near failing, it's just barely too low to qualify for many scholarships, so I can expect little to no assistance. With the way my classes are going right now, and how unmotivated I feel, I don't think I can expect any significant improvement. And as a junior, it's too late for me to change majors or even add a minor.

And here's the other part which is somehow even more disturbing to me than my dismal job prospects. I'm no longer interested in anything I used to want. I used to love history and looked forward to my history classes just two months ago, but now I can barely force myself to read the assigned texts. I used to want to teach, but all of a sudden I find myself lacking interest in going to graduate school to pursue this goal. Maybe somewhere deep inside me I still have that fire, but I can't find it. For a very short time it was replaced by an urge to find an internship or a way to get a typical office job, but last week I've also lost interest in that too. I just feel unmotivated in a way, since no matter how hard I work, I lack any certification or the proper degree or the proper work experience to do anything except fast food, so why bother? I've been rejected by almost every internship I've applied to so far anyway. 

I know my parents care for me, but I can't stand to look them in the eyes. I can't stand to go home either. I actually prefer to spend as much time as I can at my fast food job, because at least that's time I'm not spending thinking about school or at home, and at least I feel like I have some sort of purpose at least. On my free time, instead of studying like I should, I just spend hours and hours wandering the streets of Boston alone, with no purpose or destination in mind. Hours pass without me really noticing or caring. I'm wasting my time and oddly enough I don't feel worried enough to change that, even though I'm paying for part of my college education.

For pretty much my entire life I haven't had many friends, and I haven't been in a relationship since high school (which broke up with her calling me a ""self-centered"" ""asshole"" ""uncaring"" ""horrible person""; I don't know what I did wrong but she's probably right). I have a feeling this won't change, I'll admit I have ""borderline Autism""; I believe it's the worst curse you can put on a person. When I was younger I'd do stupid stuff like an autistic kid would, but in my mind I would be fully aware of what I was doing and screaming at myself to stop. I'm not sure how, but I've managed to somewhat control myself and now the opposite is true; I'll spend all day trying to keep myself in control while deep down I have urges to spin in circles, or laugh hysterically, or some other dumb thing. Worst part is, I'm aware of my potential to be ""weird"" and I want to just behave normally, but I can't always tell if what I'm doing is ""weird"" or not, which might be why so few people want to be around me; maybe I still act strange without me realizing it. In kindergarten I went to a separate program for kids with autism; I still see it in my nightmares sometimes and I remember the layout of the building perfectly, even though I've forgotten almost everything else from my youth. First corridor on the right, then the classroom on the left at the end of the hallway. I was the only kid to make it out of that classroom and go to the regular school, as far as I know almost all of the other kids there now live in special facilities. In my nightmares, I end up going back into that classroom. I'll never know why I managed to escape when everyone around me never did. Maybe I was never meant to escape. Maybe that's where I belong. I thought I'd mastered being ""alone"", but all of a sudden I can't stop thinking about how few friends I have, or how I'll never be able to get into a relationship again.

What really scares me is how worried I am about my future, yet at the same time how little I care. At least right now, I'm no longer interested in history or teaching, I know I should go to graduate school to earn a more useful degree but I've lost interest in going to school. I've lost hope in any office job or any ""real"" job at this point. Financially I'm not in dire straits yet, but considering the state of my father, this won't last for long and I'll need to sustain myself financially soon. I have few friends, and that's unlikely to change. Just a year ago I was a person with dreams - dreams of graduating, becoming a teacher, finding a smart and funny and wonderful partner, settling down and having a family and being a good father, being a good person. Now I don't think I care. At this point all I want is to live alone independently, let my father retire and enjoy his life, and then be there when my parents inevitably pass away. I've lost all interest in my own future. Hell, I've got half a mind to just kill myself once my parents are gone. They're the only ones that care for me, so I owe it to them to keep going for them. I've at least promised my mother that I'd finish college, so I will at least get my B.A. in History. But once they inevitably pass, who do I have to live for? I already hate myself. At minimum wage, you can barely afford to live alone, let alone having enough to date or do things with friends. I don't even care, nobody would want to date or be friends with a loser who can only find work in fast food anyway, nor should I deserve friends or a relationship anyway. Where I am currently, I've ""peaked"", and it's all downhill from here. 

I find it oddly ironic that as a teacher abroad I've managed to help students overcome their despair and mental struggles and find joy and meaning in life, yet I can't help myself.

I've lost interest in everything I cared about or dreamed of. I no longer have ambition. Once my parents are gone, the only person who would really care about me is my brother. He's doing well, good grades studying computer science, in a great relationship with a girl going to medical school, plenty of friends. He's pretty happy too. The family future is secure, my brother will probably do fine in life. At most I'd be deadweight to him, constantly asking for money to help pay off debts. Logically speaking, it would be best for all concerned if I just disappeared or died once my parents die. At least my parents won't have to undergo the pain of losing me, and my brother will be fine without me and won't have to worry about supporting me. 

I'm conflicted. On one hand I've seen this sort of feeling before, in so many of my students that I've helped. It's a huge red flag and I'm aware of it. I'm aware that I need to find myself help or a purpose urgently. Yet at the same time I feel fine allowing myself to fall apart like this; deep down, I think I might even enjoy falling apart, as if I'm somehow unraveling who I really am. Out of sheer luck, or fortune, or whatever, I escaped from that classroom. But perhaps I was never meant to leave. Maybe this is just nature fixing a mistake it made around 14 years ago. I don't understand why I've lost all my motivation and drive so quickly. I must have done something wrong but I don't know what it was (except for majoring in History, lol). I'm barely dragging myself onward for my parents' sake, but otherwise I don't know what I'm doing. Maybe I'm ready to embrace my autism, what I was always meant to be. I guess I don't really belong out here.

**Additional Information:**

I was that kid worrying about college admissions in middle school. In retrospect, that was stupid and caused a lot of undue stress. On the other hand, I was very self-motivated in this process, my parents could care less where I went (trust me, I never take that for granted) and I think that made me even more proud of how it went.

My final decision was between Wharton and Yale. I thought it would be harder for me to decide, but I felt right away that yale's culture was much more conducive to a happy college experience. Between these schools, the difference for finance recruiting is negligible. Plus, my buddy at Wharton doing Huntsmen told me to go to Yale.

**My biggest piece of advice** **is...** try to make your own opportunities wherever you can. In my case, starting a nonprofit, finding a photography mentor, joining the board of a nonprofit, etc. were done without any kind of program or preset path (in contrast to MUN or Robotics which were in school and followed preexisting competitions). While the top kids in any given discipline (the science people who go to ISEF/RSI, the math folks who win olympiads, the writers with big writing awards) will end up at top schools, it is a lot easier to succeed in admissions if you create your own opportunities, it shows your initiative and gives the school hope for what you will do after graduation.

That's all... Love Y'all &lt;3"

I just got accepted into Davis as a transfer and a cog sci major. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I ended up messing up my first year in ccc and no longer met the requirements to transfer as a computer science major. 

Since then, I’ve massively improved my grades (maintained 4.0 in past year), got  myself a software engineering internship, and realized that I want nothing more than to major in computer science. 

The CS website makes doubling look pretty easy. All I have to do is complete a list of courses with a C- or better. And maintain at least a 3.0 during my first quarter at Davis. 

I’ve completed every single course (with As except for calculus), including ECS 50 which is required to double.  

Given that I maintain a 3.0, is doubling in Computer Science possible or is it not as straightforward as it seems? 

Any advice is appreciated!!"

So i wish to know how valuable the google data analyst certification is?

Cuz i am honestly not eager to pursue a masters degree (time and cost wise), and the same question i wish to ask about the ocp java se 11, i did take it and fail it (got 56 out of 80, while needing 68 to succeed, but i had gotten a voucher for it and ended up paying less than 50 euros for it), but i wish to know how valuable such a certificate can be (or with any other programming language like python). I honestly appreciated the java cert content because it was way more practice oriented unlike my courses at university, but not sure really how it is viewed in the market.

I don't enjoy this job/career path at all and it's really f\*cking up my mental health so I've decided to quit this job soon. Despite this, I really feel like a failure. Like I put in a lot of effort to learn. I started as an art major, switched to math/cs and started from literally 0 knowledge. I got through a decent university (and honestly in hindsight it was kind of hell to get through), did projects, had other internships and I still can't do anything. I'm converting my python code to c right now for some firmware stuff and its so damn hard. I've used c and python before so many times!! I feel like my brain has just turned to mush after like my 3rd year of university and now I'm thinking through murk. 

Part of me wants to believe that my boss is unreasonable (he told me he was disappointed in me on my like 3rd day of work, disappeared for almost all of February and came back to berate me on the progress of my personal project after telling me to prioritize work that other coworkers gave me) but I also know I have a bad habit of procrastinating because the work is too hard. 

My boss berated me again on this project and told me that he's disappointed in my progress. I feel quite embarrassed and tired honestly even though it doesn't even matter because I'm quitting.  I'm also frustrated that he doesn't clearly state his expectations until I ""disappoint"" him and ""need to put in more effort"". I swear I'm really trying I'm just horrendously slow. Like I know!! I'm a disappointment!!! I wish he'd stop telling me that!! I don't even have one on ones with him and he disappears so often I cant even set up a meeting with him. I feel like I'm just left flowing in the current to crash into another wall!!! 

This ended up in a big rant but can anyone give me advice on how I can improve myself for my next job? I really don't want to end up in this situation again. I feel like my biggest problem is that I procrastinate and get distracted easily because I feel like the work is too hard. I don't know how to make my projects more manageable. I feel like my brain just doesn't want to work anymore."

So I am a Junior in HS. I am currently a running start student so I am getting some pre-reqs done. 

Some career fields that I am interested in are basically business and law. 

I have always wanted to be in one of those fields. Nothing else has really interested me. 

The only issue is I’m not sure what specific area I would like to go into. I have tried doing research but it doesn’t help much. 

Law: I was interested in Criminal Justice, Corporate Law, Family Law and Sports/Entertainment Law. 

Business: I just recently started actually looking into this career but have always been interested in it. I was interested in Finance (but my sister is doing this so I don’t really want to be the same as her. I want to flourish on my own), Marketing, and MIS. 

I have always wanted to be my own boss. My parents have their own small businesses and I have always wanted my own business too. However, I want a career that would allow me to expand my parents businesses or help others expand their businesses. 

I would love more information about these fields if you have it. I am really into both fields and have always pictured my future in one of these fields. 

I know I am still in early days to know, but I would love to start trying to figure it out. Both of these fields are demanding and I would need to do internships and I want to get a head start. 

Anything and everything that y’all got I would love to know. As well as resources to learn more about these fields! 

My strong suits in school is honestly english, math, science. 

I am good at math and science, I don’t like learning it but it is mostly easy for my to learn. I just hate the teachers sometimes lol. But these three subjects are my strong suits I guess.

I’m good in all areas of school in all honesty. I just have issues of procrastination, which I am working on. 

What other careers are worth looking into? 

I come from a low middle class family. Tuition would definitely come from financial aid, scholarships and loans. But I want a job that will give me a comfortable life financially, and maybe one that will allow for me to take care of my parents and help them retire early (they work labor jobs). 

Thank you!"

Here is the sixty-first installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I got into UBC Science and McGill’s “Math and Computer Science” programs, and I’m deciding between them. I plan on going into the industry for SWE or Data Science, hopefully in New York or Silicon Valley. Does anyone have any insight into ease of getting good internships or jobs between these two schools? Or insight into the programs in general?

Some other considerations are:

* at McGill I was admitted directly to second year, so I’d only have to do three years
* I got small scholarships to both
* UBC seems to have an interesting co-op, better than McGill’s
* UBC’s tuition and housing would be marginally cheaper first year, but housing seems much trickier and potentially more expensive after first year
* I’ve heard the Montréal location might be preferable for internships, but idk how much that matters. I speak French so that wouldn’t be an issue
* UBC is generally ranked higher for CS
* at UBC the first year isn’t technically in my major yet and I’d have to do a lot more general education requirements, whereas McGill basically waives my first year because of IB

I also applied to Waterloo, but their decisions don't come out until mid-May and I need to commit somewhere this week in the meantime.

mza5rp,2,2021-04-26,GPA Lacking but Experiences are much better,A200IQGAMER,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/mza5rp/gpa_lacking_but_experiences_are_much_better/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a rising senior in undergrad and I plan on applying to a PhD program in Fall 2022 in biochemistry or chemical biology, as I want to do research in the fields of computational structural biology or bioinformatics. However, I'm a bit confused and concerned about my chances because while I want to apply for top programs, my GPA is lacking compared to my experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

For starters I will say that I am a transfer student, and for the first two years of school (Fall 2018 to Spring 2020) I attended a local state school where I was a biology major on the premed track. I achieved a 3.67 GPA, and I pass/failed Orgo II (COVID semester) because the switch to online was rough and I dropped from an A to a C in that class. Several of my science grades (bio and orgo 1 in particular) were B's or B+'s. However, I managed to transfer into a T15 research university for my junior year and onward (Fall 2020 to Spring 2022), where I am majoring in Biochemistry and Chemical Biology. However, my first semester here was remote, and my GPA was pretty bad. I got a C in physics 2, a B in biochem, and a B in a CS elective, causing me to get a 3.22 GPA for my first sem at my new school. After this current semester, I am expected to raise my GPA to something along the lines of a 3.42-3.47, but one of those grades is in physical chemistry, where the online formatting of the class has really ruined me, and I am likely going to get a B or a B- in the class. My grades have also prevented me from being eligible to do an honors research thesis for my department, which I was really looking forward to doing.

&amp;#x200B;

However, despite my GPA, I have been extensively involved in research since I transferred. I have been involved in a computational structural biochemistry lab since I transferred to my new university, I got a summer internship at a big pharma company working with medical imaging and drug discovery, and I have been involved in a research network at a public, academic health center out of state, where I do bioinformatics research remotely. I plan on getting a first author publication in my school's lab by the end of the year, and I will be a co-author in my bioinformatics project which is expected to produce a publication by November or December of this year (it might get pushed further though).

&amp;#x200B;

While these opportunities sound great, and I'm happy I got them, my grades just seem to pale in comparison to my research/industry experience. As such, I was wondering how much my grades would affect me with regards to applying to good/top programs. I will be taking a graduate course next semester in computational structural biochemistry, as well as taking 3 other major related courses, and I hope to bring my grades up one more time before having to apply. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated."

I think I can definitely finish in the top 10, with top 5 a possibility.

My gpa is really, really bad though and I'm stressing out about that. I'm not worried about my essays, because I'm confident I can make them good, but I just don't know because of how bad my gpa is.

I'm gonna use my personal case but it's probably going to apply to quite a few people on here.

I'm a Senior Computer Science student at a university in San Francisco with good career relationships within the Bay Area. I'm going to graduate Summa Cum Laude in December with a GPA of 3.89 and as I am planning for the future I'm very intrigued at what to expect ( Hiring-market wise ). Here's the deal: I'm an international student. I need to apply for my Optional Practical Training which would let me land internships for the next 12 months after graduation but I could also not try OPT and apply for an H1-B ( ""Working"" ) visa if I have a full-time offer from a place willing to sponsor me.

I would say that my resume has a ratio of positive returns of 15% as I applied to 60-70 internships last summer and I got like 10-12 coding assessments back ( Didn't have time for an internship so ended up not getting one... good excuse because I'm awful at assessments and probably wouldn't have gotten one ). So my questions are: As long as I practice my coding assessment skills, what are my chances of getting an internship after graduation in December 2021? I know that the Trump administration made it more difficult for people, in general, to get H-1B visas, know more about this? Any idea if it changed in the recent months? Also, international students have to mention their status in applications and whether or not they will need sponsoring, is that really a barrier to getting a role?

Any experience or thoughts are welcome and I'm really excited to hear you about all of this! Thanks for reading ;)"

The school I went to is crap, but that's not really an excuse for the failed attempts I've had at getting an internship/job related to CS. 

I went into my degree program about 3 years ago after doing freshman classes at a community college, and basically chose CS because I wanted to get away from Nursing as it was what my mom wanted to force me into. I was very naive in thinking I would learn everything I needed to get a job in the classes I took and did not need to put in extra work. I found out in the last year that there were things like leetcode that I should have been using to practice, aiming to get internships a lot sooner or working on projects to make up the difference on a resume. Now here I am about to get a degree and I am so terrible at interviews I dont feel like I could ever get a job. 

So now I'm thinking options. I can work on projects hard and heavy for 6months to 2years while working part time. I could try to freelance web applications. I could keep desperately grasping at straws to get a job. I could go get a associate degree or masters in a related feild. Just a lot of options, but I'm kinda scared. I spent 5years getting a degree that now seems worthless, and a lot of factors have killed my self confidence. 

I do like teaching though. I teach lifeguard and swim lesson classes. The small kids are not my favorite, but I enjoy working with high schoolers in lifeguard classes. 

Basically, I just feel stuck and need some encouragement and advice. No one in my family experienced decisions like this because they mostly went some kind of medical route where work was garunteed after they were certified or had a degree."

I applied to these companies

Tesla

Apple

Snapchat

In contact with a recruiter from Linkedin who says their fall 2021 recruiting should be starting soon.

I've connected with recruiters on Linkedin for my favorites but I haven't been able to get any messages, I was wondering if it was too late.(I applied roughly a week ago)."
mzdc4c,1,2021-04-26,Unsure when to put graduation date,friendsworkwaffles02,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mzdc4c/unsure_when_to_put_graduation_date/,"So here’s the thing - I’m in college and I currently have three possibly graduation dates. 

1. Spring 2023. This is if I take summer classes in Summer 2022 + hopefully having an internship. Having taking classes and an internship might be too much. 

2. Summer 2023. This is I wait to take the summer classes I would be taking in summer 2022 and taking them in summer 2023.

3. Winter 2023. This is if I do a spring internship at some point. I’m double majoring in accounting and finance (with accounting being my primary major). Many accounting recruiters want students to take spring internships since that’s there “busy season.”

So here’s the thing - what do I put on my resume? I feel like saying 2023 is too broad, especially since some internships I’m looking at specifically want kids to graduate in spring or summer of 2023. Any advice?"
mzdryu,10,2021-04-26,UT Austin or Rice for CS? - Please help me decide!,throwaway12046933,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/mzdryu/ut_austin_or_rice_for_cs_please_help_me_decide/,"Hello everyone!

I have spent the last 4 weeks researching each school, but I still have no idea which one to choose.

Comparing each school's CS programs, Rice's is worse than UT's but not by *too* much (T20-ish vs T10). However, UT has a greater selection of CS courses, clubs, and opportunities as a whole, especially because it is a larger school and located in Austin. I shouldn't have any issues with internships at Rice, but I think I'd have a higher ceiling as a UT student/grad. 

I'd definitely be happy with the social scene and location at both schools, but I prefer UT and Austin as a whole. With all that being said, you're probably thinking the obvious choice is UT, but there's one issue: I'd have to internal transfer into CS from UGS undeclared. However, I'm just as hesitant to go to Rice because it is $25k more expensive per year and I would have to take out $10-15k+ in loans per year. 

I know the internal transfer process for UTCS is **extremely** competitive, but I'm willing to GRIND and do whatever is necessary to transfer into CS (attend office hours, info sessions, take advantage of the Sanger Learning Center, etc). The acceptance rate is \~40-50%, and there are no guarantees, but I believe I'd have a solid chance if I really take advantage of all my resources. My backup plan if I can't get into UTCS is to either major in Math with an Elements of Computing certificate or just transfer to UTD/A&amp;M. Of course, I don't plan on transferring to UTD/A&amp;M, but I'd be okay with it if I was forced to.

**TLDR: UT is hands down the better and much cheaper option, but I'm not guaranteed a CS major. Rice's CS program is not too far off, but I would have to go into debt to afford it.**

**Should I take the risk, go to UT, and try to internal transfer into CS ($29k/year), or should I just play it safe and study CS at Rice ($54k/year)? Are there any other options I could consider?**

Thank you for the help!"
mzdy73,13,2021-04-26,"I graduate in Fall 2021, and I feel really bad about my employment prospects. What advice do you guys have for me?",[deleted],berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mzdy73/i_graduate_in_fall_2021_and_i_feel_really_bad/,"My problem isn't my resume. I'm fairly good at selling myself on paper and I know instinctively what roles are a good fit for me and my skillset.

I usually get a good interview/app ratio (my latest was about 45-50% response rate). I don't get interviews from MBB, FAANG, or the Big 4 but I usually have a fair shot everywhere else.

Well, actually, my resume might be a problem come new grad recruiting season because internships probably have a lower bar. 

However, interviews are a way bigger problem for me. 

Since I first interviewed for board positions in HS, I've noticed I suck HARD at interviews. I've been rejected from 6 final round interviews so far. I used to fail first rounds all the time, but with practice, I managed to make it to the final rounds / second rounds at least 70-80% of the time.

I believe my interview problems are a mix of bad selling skills, bad self-presentation skills, being too awkward/nervous, and sometimes not having good content for skills-based questions. I usually have good content for behavioral questions, but my delivery is extremely poor (not confident, monotone, etc). 

I made a giant list of problems I have in interviews over the weekend, and I asked everyone who's ever mock interviewed me to give me additional feedback on problems to add to the list.

For each problem I have, I made a plan on how to solve it. I'm planning to go over the doc with a career counselor to see if they have any other suggestions on how to fix my problems this week. 

The fields I'm currently looking at include: marketing, market research, consumer insights analyst, consulting (economic and management), and marketing analytics. Maybe also product management but not as much into the field. 

I'm planning to ask mentors in those fields if there are any other fields that are a better fit for me or other ways to improve or get a foot in the door for those places. 

I'm literally content with any salary above 50-55k and would like to stay in CA. Anywhere in the US is fine actually except for maybe the South (w/exception of Atlanta).

However, despite all this planning, I know things can go badly. So does anyone have any advice on what to do if I'm unemployed 1-2 years out of college?"

I have decent experience programming in group projects throughout college, as well as in industry as I have completed a couple internships. I also went to a pretty elite university, although not one particularly well known for CS, but prestigious nonetheless. 

At this point in my job search process I am so fed up. I hate it so much. It's just sending out apps for them to not be read or responded to ever. Most of the time its the ones where they make you fill out your resume on their page, even though i just submitted my fucking resume. Ive only had two interviews, both of which went decently well but no luck. 99% of the time there is just no response, even if I try following up, which is difficult since it is often difficult to find recruiters on LinkedIn and there is no real way of me contacting them. 

I dont know what to do. I feel like I am gonna be unemployed forever. Am I doing something wrong? Is anyone else in a similar position? Looking for support or advice. Thanks"

mzgpel,17,2021-04-27,STEM students: We need more self-awareness,OuchOyster,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mzgpel/stem_students_we_need_more_selfawareness/,"I'm a (dual) STEM student from some random North American university. I've worked in a bunch of fields, from healthcare to finance, the latter being the industry into which I'm heading after graduation.

You've heard the hype. STEM is quickly becoming the most popular group of disciplines, most notably computer science, life sciences and statistics. Once previously thought of as the temples of body odor, antisocial coding and expired condoms, schools like Carnegie Mellon, Stanford and MIT are now filled with people of all types, all characters and of all intentions.

But, f\*ck me do we ever lack self-awareness. It seems like STEM students seem to be so sensitive, so quick to criticize other disciplines and so slow to develop the ability to laugh at ourselves. We seem to roast everyone, from the money-obsessed business bros who live in suits, to the the art students who seem destined to make our lattes.

I think that we need to start meme-ing our own kind and get off our high horses about our self-proclaimed righteous path to impact the world.

Just how many of us are quick to be disgusted by the aspiring Wall Street professionals' obsession with money, yet are premeds who are already selecting our residency choices based on the average compensation they provide?

How many times have we heard of engineering, math or even biology students who here about their friend's internship at Google and then coincidentally start a Coursera introductory Python class before desperately trying to fit a computer science minor before their graduation date.

Just how many of us talk about helping those in need, and reducing disparities via innovation, yet end up going to get their MBA to go into investment banking or consulting?

Just how many of us make fun of those ""rich white kids from private schools"" with dads who land them internships, even though we may have parents who are engineers, doctors, lawyers or successful business owners who sent us to top public/magnet high schools?

How many of us constantly repeat that college doesn't define us, that money isn't the end-all-be-all yet will refuse to date someone who's ambitions don't include becoming a doctor/lawyer/engineer?

How many of us enroll in coding bootcamps after our sixth application to medical school?

STEM is tough. STEM is fun. STEM is definitely a path to financial stability and good career prospects. But, STEM students are equally as stereotypical and cringe-inducing as the others. We're now the majority. We are the ""cool kids"". We're mainstream. We need to drop the whole Underdog mentality because, quite frankly, we're not.

Just kidding, let's just go back to LeetCode. "
mzh6rb,0,2021-04-27,There is just way too much inside my head,Ok-Extent-932,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mzh6rb/there_is_just_way_too_much_inside_my_head/,"I'm(21f) a current undergraduate student with CS as my major. My college was a little below average but I still did quite well in my education. I have a job in this field that barely helps me pay for stuff. I've always planned to get an MS CS in the US so I applied for fall 21 to 4 universities(limited finances). It was a tough year and I only managed to get one university that gave me admit to Cybersecurity. While it is a good branch to continue in, I'd like to take CS subjects as a substitute for the originals ones. I am not sure about what to do. 

The university that I have an admit to is really expensive and I would end up with huge debts but my family insists that I take it. I have very little idea on the core subject and although it is in a boom, I'm not sure if it's the best decision for me. My family would pay for my finances for few months and they think I can get an internship/role in a company to pay for myself. I don't know if I can get an internship to pay and I don't want my parents to support me for everything. I've consulted people online regarding this and they all said that my graduate degree is hardly going to affect my career. 

Being an international student, there is hardly any time for me to decide as I might not find a visa slot. Should I just defer this semester and think carefully or should I just go for it? I can't think of anything but the worst-case scenarios where I lose my job, waste money, and picked the wrong stream for an expensive college.

PS. If I book a visa slot for August 2021, can I reschedule it to December 2021(5 months later)"

But it's been 3 years of university and I have only tried actually learning a handful of times. I feel so underqualified for anything. I barely do any extra curricular programming and everyone in my year knows so much more than I do. 

I want to delay my fourth year by another year and try to learn enough to make some projects and find internships so I can have some actual work experience.

One of my friends said that people without internships were graduating and getting awesome jobs.




As I went through school, I heard the job market kept getting tougher.  As a mediocre CS student, I was able to graduate with one internship and line up two job offers by 2019.  It was tough, but definitely possible back then.



But my experience definitely does not compare to more senior engineers I know who almost failed out of school, had no internships, knew one programming language, and still found jobs.  On the other hand, my experience definitely does not compare to the current graduating class of college students who are having trouble finding new grad positions with multiple internships."
mzq564,2,2021-04-27,College Sucks Sometimes [Rant],Unix33,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/mzq564/college_sucks_sometimes_rant/," 

To preface this: This post is going to be a rant. It may be long or short; I don't know. I just know that I need to put this out there to get it off my chest.

First of all, I love college. It turned me from an introverted teenager into a more socially open adult. I won't ever regret the time I spent here and the friends I've made as well as the very invaluable experience I've acquired during my time in my major. However, sometimes I worry about the amount I've had to take out in loans due to my family not being the most fortunate and having four kids, two of which went to private colleges before me. I also have just learned that I won't actually graduate Spring 2022 and instead will be graduating in Fall 2022. This doesn't bother me too much but a lot of pressure weighs on my shoulders because of the fact that I'll be moving in with my girlfriend soon hours away from my school. I decided to switch to fully online because my school makes you attend classes at different campuses \~20 mins away + commute time (NOVA traffic is a bitch) all while I have no car and need to work at least 30 hrs a week to start saving money so the switch to online and doing away with additional loan money for on campus housing and transportation costs made the most sense. This makes it harder to register for classes though because online courses are extremely limited to like 2-3 courses per semester and they rarely open new sections for waitlisted students.

I am starting to feel the pressure of my decisions, as I have definitely racked up at least 75K in loans and will be graduating within a little more than a year. I have no idea how I'm going to pay loans off and even trying to get an internship is hard thanks to coronavirus and the overly saturated intern pool applicants. Sometimes I feel so stressed that I can't even enjoy my hobbies like videogames, making YouTube videos, streaming, etc because I feel lazy for doing so instead of grinding out school harder. Sometimes I wish I could make it big and make a living off being a content creator but the amount of time school is requiring from me makes it look like a pipe dream that will probably never happen thanks to the overwhelmingly time consuming tasks I have to look out for throughout every single day: homework, exams, working part time, projects, trying to make content and fit in hanging with friends as well as my girlfriend, etc.

I guess what I am saying is that I don't really regret college but it is bringing me a lot of stress to deal with now nearing the end of my 4 years. I feel like I am not really getting to where I want to be in my life and its causing so much more stress. I hate feeling like this because everyone else loves this part of their lives (most of the people I know had their parents pay for the entirety of their college so they don't have to worry about as much; lucky them) while I am in the super stressed phase.

Thanks for listening!"

I’ve seen countless posts on Linkedin of fellow business majors from major target schools posting their NWM “job acceptance” posts.  

I understand that finding a job in the current market is extremely tough, but why do people go through with the NWM internships even after finding out it’s essentially a scam?  I remember a couple years back I got a call from them for an interview, and it only took a few google searches to learn what their “Financial Advisor” role is.  I feel bad, but at the same time it seems that people know what they’re getting themselves into.

I've looked through local internship positions for the field I'm interested in, which is Data Science. I see their minimum qualifications commonly include Python, SQL, and 3rd/4th year CS/IT/Related course, along with varying requirements like JS and Numpy.

I feel like I'm qualified skill-wise, but I also feel like there's stuff taught/learned in college that I may have skipped over, not to mention I'm not even enrolled in college for another year and a half. Folks here, am I underqualified for this internship or am I overthinking this?

mzs2xe,3,2021-04-27,Advice on what comes next after CAD Support Role?,mo711,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/mzs2xe/advice_on_what_comes_next_after_cad_support_role/,"Hi There,

I was looking for advice, specifically for those who used to be a SolidWorks (SW) Applications Engineer (AE) - though other AE's from other CAD programs can chime in. The overall theme of this post is about if there is anything to look forward to especially within the Mechanical Design or even Mechanical Engineering industry in general (Plus some series of questions below) despite beginning my career as an AE?

The questions that I had where:

1. How was it like after leaving the AE role? Was it easy/challenging to find mechanical design or even mechanical engineering roles?
2. How was salary like? was it an increase? If so, how significant was it?
3. Were you happy jumping out of the AE role?
4. Are Mechanical Design/Engineering roles less customer facing than the AE role?
5. Were your networks valuable in landing roles post-AE?
6. Was there any ""stigma"" or disadvantages with having an AE background? and if not, what were the best things/skills/aspects that you used to transfer to a design/engineering role?

Some contexts:

I'm approaching 3 years into the AE role and pretty much everything I do day-to-day hasn't surprised me too much (I was under the tutelage of a SW AE during one of my internships, so I knew what to expect). It's my first job straight after graduating Bachelor's in Mech Engineering. Because of migration implications, this was pretty much the job I had to take as I couldn't wait for something else to come by.

The cool bits about the role:

\- Even though it's my first job, I have been exposed to a wide range of mechanical design/engineering and industrial design industries and have been shown valuable insights into how projects and design processes work. This role showed me that I do personally enjoy the challenge of setting up simulations (FEA &amp; CFD) to match real world results

\- Interacting with all types of engineers (Mechanical mostly) and designers from the typical end user up to senior level engineers. Interactions include upper management level depending on situation.

\- Nothing beats a great workplace and to be honest, I’m super glad this is the case as my fellow co-workers give me one of the few reasons to come in and tackle the things that come in

The bits that provoked me to write this post:

\- Out of all things I typically do, trainings - and specifically CAD trainings - I feel I’m beginning to not appreciate. It doesn’t help when particular trainees don’t understand computers, cant listen/read/understand instructions and uncooperative for the most part. I'm so glad for the rare trainees who help me through when this happens xD . Anyways, it can depend, but its like the occurrence seems to have increased relative to when I started, and it can feel draining

\- At this point, after all my interactions, I feel like wanting to be on the other side of the desk. Not the support person to fix software related problems, but to be able to actually be a part of a project and do design work (SW preferred haha). This also includes being there from start to finish rather than constantly coming in mid way just to trouble shoot and leave

\- The constant support case grind and customer facing aspect can be wearing down (especially when it gets real busy) at the expense of development time

Any contributions would be great. I would like to know if it’s still possible for me to advance my career and look forward to future roles in the actual design/engineering space 😊

Thanks!

I am majoring in physics and math and for a while was pretty sure I wanted to go to grad school and have a research career but I've lately been rethinking that, mainly because I've been losing interest in school. I guess I was wondering if it would be possible for someone like me to get an entry-level engineering job or paid internship right out of graduation? For more context, I am thinking about going into some kind of renewable energy field, maybe offshore wind. Ideally, I think going into something like computational or mathematical modeling related to that field would be really interesting. I have pretty good grades (\~3.8 gpa) and go to a pretty well known big 10 school. Most of my experience has been in research, I've done 2 years in fluid mechanics research with an applied mathematician and I've done one summer and am going to work again this summer with a paid research internship with a coastal physical oceanographer doing data analysis and helping with numerical simulations. I have also taken a fair amount of computational math classes, numerical linear algebra, numerical analysis, might take an optimization class next year, and would say I'm proficient with programming. I say all of this because I am pretty confident that I could market my abilities to a potential employer but I've never actually taken an engineering class and I'm not really sure how accreditation works or if an employer would even be allowed to hire me for an engineering type job. Next year I'm planning on taking a pretty basic intro to renewables engineering class but idk if that would actually mean anything to an employer. I could definitely see myself going back to school to get a masters but I don't want to spend all of that time and money until I have a better idea of what I actually want to go into and some real world experience.

After completing 1 year in computer science, currently doing my first internship, I'm currently at a university at 3+ hour of my hometown which is just by Montreal (Canada). I don't really like it, I don't really like the teachers, the \*culture\* of the uni is pretty outgoing/party while I'm an introvert, but I was young/naive and just followed wherever my friends went. The good thing about being there is that I'm out of my comfort zone, living by myself, after being protected by my parent quite hard.

 I've reach to a university in Montreal near my parent home and they pretty much said they would accept me if I applied and look to transfer my credit. Both cs program are pretty much the same minus 1 require internship.

I don't know if it's me imagining thing or thinking the grass is greener elsewhere but I'm really lost, I don't know if I should just take the leap, leave my current uni, my friends which I kinda feel a bit disconnect nowadays and move back with my parent(I'm 21). They already pay for everything and are disappointed that I'm always sad.

I don't really know what to do, I'm kinda pressure to get new apartment this week or the next one but I'm not even sure that I want to study here. I also  have problem with depression and I'm always anxious about all the possibility I can take to be happier, hell, I'm not even sure I really want to be a developer. But my parent are really pushy that I need a degree and a career asap."

The internship is scheduled for next year, 2022 summer. I am a Comp Sci major, and a bit confused and wanted some input. Given my major, I kind of want to try to and see if I can snag an opportunity at a company more technologically focused, that can give me more relevant experience. But those applications would be opening in late summer, early fall, and I think it would be rather unwise for me to hold onto the offer for so long. I realize I am in a fortunate situation, but I just wanted some opinions on whether the Start is a good first internship as a Comp Sci Freshman or should I take my chances at snagging another. There is also the option of accepting the offer then later declining if I do get another more fitting opportunity, but I understand this is terrible business practice and would burn bridges, something I definitely don't want to do as a Freshman lol.

Hello, my mom is a single mother who did her absolute best to raise me and get me through college on 20k income a year (shes a beast, i never felt like I was a low income family growing up). I am 22M college student about to graduate in a year or so and I will have a projected post grad TC of ~ 120 (or higher depending on my next internship)

My mom does know much about finances and has not shared much with me till now. I think its a cultural thing not to share but oh well. 

Recently she started looking around for a house to live in (in the lower mainland BC) and wanted me to cosign the mortgage cuz her income is too low. After some research I thought that would be a bad idea because of multiple reasons (I would not be able to get any loans for myself, i would most likely be moving to the states, ect).

My mom has no investments in her TFSA, about 150k in her savings account, and a retirement pension shes been building up. Furthermore, she has no consumer debt, and earns a yearly income of 20k~ as a waitress. She has about 10- 15 years left before she thinks she will retire. Should i help set up a TFSA account and park all that money in VEQT or a similar etf? (Maybe even safer?). How do i help plan out her retirement? Should i cosign the mortgage? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated"

 I had a CS internship before at a pretty decent company where I used modern frameworks and learned a ton, but that's only one, and was a few semesters ago. I'm worried that I'll be out of touch or out of date by the time I get a job, especially since a lot of new grads will have 2+ internships.

Is it expected that new hires be competent and will be ready to contribute quickly, or is there normally enough time to become acclimated to the role? I had that time for my internship, but I'm guessing that new hires are probably held to higher standards."

I'm graduating from a decent undergrad SE program on May 2nd and I have two offers. I'm honestly stumped about which one to choose. What are some of the things that you think are really important when deciding on a job? Did you ever make the wrong decision? If so, why? I tend to go with my gut on things like this, but maybe reddit can give me some validation. Here's just a tiny bit of info on what I have lined up.

**Offer #1:** 

• Product is NOT software.

• More full-stack web dev using React and learning AWS.

• Decent sized private global company with very professional culture.

• Pays slightly more.

• 50% remote.

**Offer #2:**

• Product IS software.

• More software engineering-y.

• C#, Angular, MongoDB, etc.

• Smaller private company (but not startup) with relaxed culture.

• Fully remote but with option of going into office at leisure.

Also, to the people out there who still don't have an offer, I really sympathize with how you feel. Just know that I too had to submit hundreds of applications and even lost an internship due to COVID last summer. Don't give up, you can DO it!"

In the fall I would like to also be a GSI for an 8 hour position and I am planing on taking CS 170 and CS 169. 

I am really unsure what else I should take. I could take 61C as well during fall but I heard this will be a huge workload but I don’t want to delay 61C any longer. 

So basically I am unsure what to take, if I don’t take 61C in the fall I would like to take Data 100 but I am also worried that 3 technicals would be too much.

mzzkno,5,2021-04-27,"23M, College graduate of '20 and still no job... or any interest in my field of study",jobhaver96,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/mzzkno/23m_college_graduate_of_20_and_still_no_job_or/,"Hey everyone, some background on me: I graduated from a reputable university with a degree in media and journalism (with a concentration in public relations, so that's mostly what I would be eligible to work in,) which I loathe. I only chose it because I had a limited time to graduate and I needed to choose a major, plus I have a knack for writing. While in school, I was pretty good at my major — good grades, praise from professors... all that stuff — but I quickly learned that I have no interest in the field. Seeing and learning about how I would become a cog in the corporate world really rubbed me the wrong way... everything about the industry feels slimy and goes against my morals (buying out corporations and making them more palatable for the general public feels gross.) Despite this, I stuck with the major and ended up graduating in May, 2020. While in school, I did manage to get a social media specialist internship my senior year, which is the only experience I have within my field. I also worked two retail/customer service jobs while in school, but I have been unemployed ever since graduation.

Now, onto my post-grad life so far, and why I need advice. I didn't begin my job search until August in hopes that a few months out of school would help me do some soul searching and figure out what I want to do (disclaimer: it didn't work.) Lost and dealing with some mental health problems, I barely send in any applications from August until now. I look at job listings daily for hours, but I find nothing I can see myself doing for the rest of my life. Even just reading the job listings and thinking about my future in those jobs fills me with dread. So far, I have been looking at entry public relations jobs, entry communications jobs, and entry social media jobs, but nothing interests me. As for the jobs I actually sent in applications for, I never get a response from them aside from a confirmation that they got my resume. The whole process has been a killer for my mental health and self-esteem.

As far as my interest lie, I honestly don't have many that can be turned into a career (to my knowledge.) While in school, I took an intro graphic design class and it is the only memorable class I took that was related to my major. I loved how I could be creative and make cool, pretty things. My professor didn't frame the course around doing boring graphic design like making graphs for corporations, which I'm figure most people in the field do. We made stuff like event posters, magazine spreads, etc., and I absolutely loved it. Though, as he talked more about his career in graphic design (making graphs for companies and publications, not doing cool things for magazines, art venues, or things similar,) I got turned off from the idea, plus I did not have enough time to switch my concentration to graphic design as I was a senior taking the class.

Outside of that, my real interests lie in music, arts, and video games. In high school, I took a photography class and loved it, but I don't know how that would be a viable job considering I do not have formal training in it, nor do I have any real-world experience doing it. While in college, I did college radio and it fueled a passion in music, but working for a record label where they produce focus-grouped, generic top 40 bullshit is something I do not want to do. I want to do something **real**. I want to create real things that positively impacts humanity. Creating a product for a big corporation that was made just to bring in a profit is something I really don't want to do. As far as video games go, it's my only hobby right now and has been my biggest interest ever since I was a toddler. Video games are a beautiful medium for some amazing stories (plus they're great for competitive scenes like eSports stuff) and I would love for my career to be involved with them. As a kid, I wanted to be a video game content creator (aka Youtube, Twitch, etc.,) and it was a hobby of mine back in middle school, but I stopped pursuing that because I was told that grades and getting into a good college was my top priority.

When people ask me what I want to do with my life, I always say ""something in the arts,"" but I never know what that is. Doing creative work for a music/arts/fashion magazine, a video game company, or something similar sounds amazing, but I have no idea what any of that actually entails, nor do I know how to get my foot in the door for any of that. I am not the best artist but I was pretty good at photography and graphic design for my beginner level of experience. I mostly have a good eye for aesthetics and I am a pretty decent writer when I am actually trying and not word-vomiting like I'm doing on this post.

Does anyone here have advice that could get me out of this rut and get me off my ass? I have no motivation or drive to find a job right now because I know I would become even more depressed if I worked some corporate office job. By the way, salary isn't a huge factor for me. If I am forced to spend the majority of my life working a job in order to survive, I might as well enjoy it, right? As long as I can afford to live comfortably in a city with a job that doesn't kill my soul, I am content.

**tl;dr** 23 years old, 2020 graduate with degree in public relations. Hates the field. Still no job and no interest in going into my field of study. Likes the arts and video games (especially video games). Wanted to be a video game content creator growing up but that's not really a feasible job. Looking for something creative. Has a knack for aesthetics and writing. Hates corporate life and everything about my identity, personality, and ideology goes against it. Help :(

P.S., someone irl mentioned UX/UI design to me as a potential option, which doesn't sound bad, but how would I break into that field?"

I've been an intern at my current organization coming on five months now, and I'm not sure how to broach the topic of when my internship exactly ends. To clarify, I'm not desperate to leave or anything like that — I actually really enjoy it, the length of commitment was just never discussed when I came on board.

Is this something that's best discussed over a meeting with my bosses, or would it be fine to just shoot them an email? I don't want to give the suggestion that I'm trying to leave, but if they only intended for me to be an intern up until the summer (I joined halfway through the school year and I work for an entity associated with the university I attend) then I would obviously need to consider next steps. I'm probably overthinking but I don't want to impose or make things awkward, especially if I do secure a summer internship and they might've expected that I was sticking around (I'm very close with the team and they know that I love the work)."

Hey, I'm at a total lost so I thought I might ask for some advice.

(English is my second language, sorry)

After  completing 1 year in computer science, currently doing my first  internship, I'm currently at a university at 3+ hour of my hometown  which is just by Montreal (Canada). I don't really like it, I don't  really like the teachers, the \*culture\* of the uni is pretty  outgoing/party while I'm an introvert, but I was young/naive and just  followed wherever my friends went. The good thing about being there is  that I'm out of my comfort zone, living by myself, after being protected  by my parent quite hard.

I've reach to a university in Montreal near my parent home and they pretty  much said they would accept me if I applied and look to transfer my  credit. Both cs program are pretty much the same minus 1 required  internship.

I don't know if it's  me imagining thing or thinking the grass is greener elsewhere but I'm  really lost, I don't know if I should just take the leap, leave my  current uni, my friends which I kinda feel a bit disconnect nowadays and  move back with my parent(I'm 21). They already pay for everything and  are disappointed that I'm always sad.

I  don't really know what to do, I'm kinda pressure to get new apartment  this week or the next one but I'm not even sure that I want to study here. I also have problem with depression and I'm always anxious about  all the possibility I can take to be happier, hell, I'm not even sure I  really want to be a developer. But my parent are really pushy that I  need a degree and a career asap.

I've already completed 1 year in electrical engineering and switched over computer science cause I didn't really like it. Now I can't change major unless I want to pay for everything.. As I said, it's true that I have an anime/gaming addiction, I can't see myself live a life at a desk doing meaningless work in this world. I don't remember the last time I had a goal in my life, as they say : ""I lack ambition"".

However, Microsoft has deprecated all MCSE/MCSA certifications; for those who would have wanted to study the MCSE: Core Infrastructure, Microsoft apparently recommends several tracks including the Azure Administrator Associate certificate. That seems to be the best way for me to study aspects like Windows Server administration, Active Directory, IIS, etc., which I see in many job postings for tier 1 support. I would rather get on-the-job experience in those areas, but they're outside the scope of any of my jobs, so I am forced to study them on my own.

Should I get Azure certification for this reason? After I get it, should I add a blurb to my resume explaining that it's meant to replace the MCSE so I can be successful with the automatic resume readers that look for the MSCE keyword? Would it be better not to do that and instead use the cover letter and/or interview to explain why I've taken the Azure certs?

(I am in the middle of a year-long unpaid internship in quality assurance and assistive technology. My other job once involved an accessible computer lab for people with disabilities, which gave me both IT and customer service experience, but when the pandemic started, it became a purely clerical remote job with no upward mobility.)"

n0574k,1,2021-04-27,Don’t know what to do anymore,whale-mingo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/n0574k/dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Hi there,

I feel like I’ve run out of options. 

I’m a 20 year old undergraduate engineering student. 

I was a freshmen in college last year (the one I wanted to go to the least out of the ones I applied to), and my year was cut by covid. I didn’t understand how much that threw everything off until today:

In late July my university posted their covid guidelines— I was shocked to see how inadequate their plan was; they did not provide or have any sort of testing and they did not provide any sort of accommodations for taking classes online. I would have had to be on campus and attend in-person classes. I was excited for my second year as I had positions as a residential advisor (in the best dorm with upperclassmen), engineering ambassador, researcher, and a couple of leadership positions for clubs. It was a difficult decision to make— do I risk my family’s health for the sake of “being on track” with my education or do I pause my higher education and ensure the safety of my family and myself? Many efforts were made to try and guarantee my safety if I were to be on campus, but there was no way it could have worked out. I ended up choosing the gap year.

Since then I’ve been applying to many different schools to try to transfer to, internships, research, jobs, etc. I also tried to become certified in different programs, attend virtual conferences/talks, and continue to try to practice math / physics so I don’t forget everything. Unfortunately, my family has had a hard time medically. My dad was assaulted at work (in the summer) and then got into a car accident (in October, other person’s fault). We don’t have insurance so we are still dealing with medical bills, we had to get a new car, and we’re still working with workers compensation and lawyers for a settlement. My parents don’t really know what they are doing so they put all the work on my older sibling and I. We also have no idea what we are doing will all of this adult stuff because we don’t have a adult figure in our lives that could help guide us. My family life is already difficult enough— none of us ever gets along and my parents view my sibling and i as terrible people when we try to give advice or point out mistakes so they don’t make the same mistakes again. They are quite naive so a lot of people take advantage of them. They are quite religious and put everything on faith to solve stuff (so they don’t really do anything about the problems they have). 
There’s a bunch of other stuff but it’s too much to say— my point is that home life and family life is really really rough. 

Unfortunately I had to also apply for those positions (RA, ambassador, etc.) again because I didn’t receive full training (because of covid). I didn’t even a interview for any of them the second time around. 

For the RA position, I submitted my application in December. I made sure everything was in place and kept emailing monthly to keep in touch. I got an email a couple days ago saying that I was put in the last round of RA applications (first round was due January) and that I’ll know if I got the position on the 26th. I ended up getting the position, however I got the WORST dorm ever. 

In the end, I got rejected from virtually almost anything and everything. I’m already behind and all my friends will be a grade above me, I want to transfer schools so I already don’t want to be there, and now knowing that I lost everything I had in place before just makes everything worse. I never got any of my engineering projects completed, so I have basically nothing to put on my resume too. Life at home is getting to be unbearable, I’m already fat, ugly, hairy, dumb, lack personality, lack good talking skills,  lack everything. I can’t see anything positive anymore. I lost my drive for life 7 years ago, and I just want to end it all. The only thing holding me back is the fact that my family will have to deal with me, and I’ll be even more useless and unhelpful. I’m so disappointed in myself, and I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I just want to drop out and die. I’ve been breaking down everyday and I’m just so tired of it. I try not to dwell on the past too much but I just can’t stop thinking about it. If only I had a time machine... I will literally do anything for a time machine oh my god. I’m sorry if this is formatted terrible or I miss spelled something or it’s hard to read, I just don’t know what to do anymore."
n05bxk,1,2021-04-27,Should I hand in project after ignoring (ex)boss for 4 months??,throwaway190902394,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/n05bxk/should_i_hand_in_project_after_ignoring_exboss/,"Ok before you read this, I know. I am very, very stupid and unfair for doing this.

So I did a mini internship that ended up going beyond my allocated number of weeks. After my informal last day, my boss asked me for an updated version of my project. I completely ignored him since the project wasn't up to scratch and thought I would reply after I finished my college essays that week. Long story short- I had a mental breakdown these past months and held everything off. I know this is not a reasonable excuse at all but I felt shit almost every day and couldn't take the stress.

He emailed twice about the project before radio silence. I didn't reply to his email, meaning they still don't have the final project AND I haven't given my invoice either so I haven't got paid for all those weeks of working. I don't know whether I should bother apologising and handing both the final project and invoice or I should suffer the consequences and lose out on all that money.

If I am advised to email him, what do you think I should say in the email?

Thank you."

(Prospective Student),Pars101,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/n05ryk/is_anyone_here_an_information_systems_major/,"I am deciding whether to commit to Maryland this week  and I wanted to know if anyone here is majoring in Information Systems. I have some question if anyone is willing to answer:

1. What do you really do in the major? Everyone tells me its a combination of tech and business but I think that's pretty vague.
2. Do you think that the program provides you with good opportunities (internships, scholarships, networking, etc.)?
3. How do you think it compares with the CS and InfoSci majors?"

Because of online classes I haven’t been able to get know my peers and seniors. i have no idea how to properly apply for an internship or how to get good at leetcode. But everybody around me is telling me to get serious that its time, so what should i do next ? I am aware of Data structure and algorithms but how to get better at it ? and how to get internship while being an undergrad. How much pay is appropriate for an internship?"

My question isn’t so much of us it worth doing but for someone who has taken formal university level networking and security classes how realistic is passing the sec+ quickly? Like within the next couple of weeks quickly. My grades in my security and networking classes have been in the A range and nothing on the objectives looks completely new to me but I’m not sure where to go for practice exams. I’ve gone through messer’s sec+ 601 course, as well as his A+ course some time ago but I never got around to taking the A+. I looked around messers website but I don’t see anything that specifically points to practice exams. I’ve taken a few of the free ones that are floating around the net and done fine on those but they are like 10-20 questions and I know that will make me cocky and I’ll fail if it just jump right in. 

I have no industry experience because I changed into this major last spring so I’ve been on fast track and haven’t been able to land any internships yet. That is why I’m hoping to add sec+ to my resume if nothing else to help get my foot in the door for interviews seeing as I graduate soonish. 

Thanks for any advice!"
n074yy,28,2021-04-28,Life as 21F growing up with tiger dad,zaebatsz,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/n074yy/life_as_21f_growing_up_with_tiger_dad/,"Growing up, my dad has always been the classic tiger parent. I’m not allowed out past dinner/sunset. I can not talk to, hug, hold hands, touch boys. I must ask him before purchasing items, going out, joining clubs/sports teams at school, and volunteering. When I was in elementary school, I was known to be very loud, talkative, and sporty. Talking to boys, and befriending them was easy with these traits, and with young boys, it didn’t take them long to start having small crushes on me. I never let my dad know about these things. As far as he knew, I had only female friends. Until one point when I was 12, I decided to meet up with a boy I liked at a nearby convenience store for a can of pop. It was as innocent as it could get, thinking back on it. When I returned home around 5 PM, my father found out and was furious. He took a badminton racket and hit it against the wall, breaking the racket. He was yelling. I cried. My mother tried to intervene and told him to stop. To this day, I’ve never seen him as furious as he was that afternoon. Of course, I eventually got over it. The boy confessed his feelings towards me a few days after that day. I rejected his feelings towards me. It was partly due to my dad and my fear for what he might do when he finds out I accepted a boy's feelings, and partly because I knew I wasn’t emotionally mature enough to handle a relationship. He cried, started harming himself. And though he blamed it all on me at the time, I knew he was having a hard time at home with his mom remarrying soon after divorcing his father. That boy eventually moved away to Europe and I never heard from him again.

High school was far worse than elementary school. My parents never cared about my grades. It was never about that with them. Though, I did achieve straight As throughout middle school, and a 97% average in high school because of self-determination. My eyes were set on big named universities when I entered high school, and I knew what this meant; Good grades and extracurriculars. I did them all. However, what my dad didn’t understand was the extracurriculars. I joined the school's soccer team in freshman year, and played it throughout my sophomore year until my dad thought it was the reason I was getting “overweight”. This wasn’t the first time he commented on my weight, and though my mom is often a bystander on all the topics here in this lengthy post, she also had some say about my weight. I remember I walked out of the car in tears in high school once because of him commenting on my weight. At the time, I was 5’4, and 110lb; a healthy BMI. My head thought I was obese and I needed to get below 100 pounds. I had an unhealthy relationship with food starting in my freshman year of high school. I began starving myself, thinking skinny is better. I began binging and sometimes I made myself throw up because of the thought of getting overweight. Eventually, my weight spiraled and I gained 20 pounds throughout high school. My dad thought soccer was the reason my thighs were getting larger and hips wider. I believed it was puberty, but after lengthy discussions and fights about wasting time, I quit and didn’t continue during junior year. I still had student council, as well as jazz band and concert band. He thought those were a waste of time as well. His argument was that he went to university in China; “one of the top universities in China and I didn’t have to do all of this”. He would always lecture me about how I was wasting my time and how I should be more like my brother. I guess that’s an important point. I have a brother. He’s quiet and reserved. He has a handful of friends, average grades, and does not socialize outside of school or do extracurriculars. He’s two years older than me, graduated high school, and didn’t get into the school our parents wanted him to get into but got into the third option. Everyone was quite devastated about it. He plays video games all day and lives at home now; though my parents don’t know about video games. He hides it very well. My parents compare me to him a considerable amount of times. He’s tall and slender. He doesn’t know how to keep himself. He doesn’t cut his nails and often forgets to wash his hair. However, the one thing that he has that I don’t is that he’s less social and doesn’t do extracurriculars. This is one thing my dad hates about me. I do too many things, and I go out too much; Volunteering, working, organizing events for the student council, practicing for the band, and more. This made him upset for some reason. Graduating as valedictorian and student body president, with an offer from his top choice of school didn’t amaze him. He didn’t care about my merits or any of that. He only cared that I was fat and that I socialize too much. I spent all of high school without a boyfriend. Of course, this was partly due to my dad and his scary curfew and partly due to the fact that I didn’t find a liking to any of the boys in my high school. I never went to parties, never drank, never spent late nights with friends, or slept over at friends’ houses. I never went to the movies late at night or concerts. Past 6 PM, I’d be home, or I’d get an earful by my dad, 10 text messages, and a call every minute. 

Entering college, I lived in residency my freshman year. After discussing with my parents, my dad was very much against it, but I wanted to experience freedom, even for just a year. It came at a price though. I had to come home every weekend and I had to call often. My first few months, I went to parties, I drank, and I did anything I wanted to. Coming home every weekend became a dread. I hated it. After a few months, I buckled down and by December, I stopped going to parties. I was a part of many clubs at school and spent time with the people there. I enjoyed my time. I felt so free and happy. I slept when I wanted. I went out when I wanted. I didn’t have a curfew. I could see the stars at night. I lost a considerable amount of weight, and I felt the happiest. It was beautiful, and I made so many friends. Things changed after I moved back during the Summer after freshman year. I lost all contact with my friends because they hung out when I couldn’t. They made special bonds that I couldn’t make because they spent more time together. I had to quit the clubs because my dad’s strict curfew was back. I gained the weight back, and my dad has commented on it every day, and yet forbids me from not finishing the food prepared for dinner, though I am the one who cooks it. He forces large portions on me. He starts yelling if I let him know I can’t eat anymore and feel full. He states that I look ugly fat. It never has to do with health. It always has to do with the fact that I look ugly. I started getting depressed. My dad wouldn’t let me move back to campus due to the cost and the idea that my brother did not live in residence nor does he intend to live in residence. My dad thought it was unfair. 

By my second year, I didn’t really have friends that I could call close. I walked to classes alone, studied alone. I didn’t mind it too much. I still had another club and started making friends there. When corona hit, I was at my lowest. I started realizing how much I missed out in university, and how I didn’t make as many memories. Coming from having a great high school experience where I socialized heavily and made so many memories to not having any close friends. I would scroll through my social media, and see my old friends from my first year having an amazing feed of photos and memories, and I get jealous. At this point in my life, I still haven’t had a boyfriend or a steady relationship. My dad forbids it still. He always tells me, without me prompting him, “You’ve waited this long, why not wait until you’ve graduated?” At this point, he does not want me dating until I’ve graduated, but I’m convinced he won't ever approve of me dating until I’m thirty. I don’t ever mention men or relationships. He always initiates the conversation, and it always ends up him lecturing me about waiting longer to date someone. Currently, I’m working full-time as an intern at a large firm. I am getting paid quite well, and am focused on my career. Lately, though, I’ve been feeling quite trapped and as though I’m suffocating from all his constant comments and obsessions with things that don’t matter too much to me.

thanks for reading up until here if you did. I just wanted to let this out somewhere."

Please feel free to comment in this post any questions that you have about studying Communications, and I will then make a YouTube video answering the top 5-10 asked questions, based on my experience in being a few months away from finishing my Communications course at the University of Newcastle Australia(PSB Academy).

The course I’m studying majors in both Journalism and Public relations, while touching on other things like Communication theories, data visualization, and video production for advertising and journalism. 

However, in terms of internships and job offers, my course only offers part-time internship programs during the last trimester that require you to work in the fields that you are taught in the course. 

I can’t say much about job offers since I haven’t had any.

 I will post the YouTube video’s link here for you guys to directly access it.

I’m hoping to answer your questions to help you to better expect what you’ll be doing in Communications and better decide if you want to study this course, since there isn’t much in-depth information on the internet about studying Communications. 

Thanks for reading the post and I look forward to answering your questions!"

I know this is cutting it a bit close to the May 1st decision deadline but TBH I am a bit stuck on where to go for a CS degree for my undergraduate studies. I have gotten some fantastic offers from some of the best universities in the world but I have decided to stay a bit closer to home and go to a university in California. The two I have nailed it down to are Cal Poly SLO and UCSD (specifically Warren College). In terms of price, they both are very similar so that isn’t the big issue for me. 

Cal Poly SLO

Pros:

&amp;#x200B;

* Smaller class sizes 
* Very hands-on and focused on internships
* Seems like a super fun place to be (cool student life and experiences)
* Located in-between the Bay Area and LA (two major hubs in California)

Cons:

&amp;#x200B;

* When on campus, it doesn’t really feel like a university from the outside
* Slightly less well known (but IDK if that matters)
* Not super into research and not too many different options to explore 

UCSD 

Pros:

&amp;#x200B;

* Got into the “engineering” college on campus 
* All the professors are very involved in their research fields and they are super well respected for that research
* The campus had that WOW factor when I visited
* Bigger school with more resources on campus (like a supercomputer and research institute) and a larger brand name (but IDK if that matters)

Cons:

&amp;#x200B;

* Super huge class sizes with LOTS of people
* Some labs are taught by TAs and it is a bit harder to form a relationship with a professor
* Not as many internship opportunities and they are a lot harder to get

I would be eligible for the Honors program at both school with my high school GPA (applied to Cal Poly’s honors program but waiting for a result and I am eligible for the honors society at Warren College) Both schools are amazing and have the pros and their cons, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice or guidance on what to choose.

Thanks in advance!

Cheers,

Ansh"

n0al8c,2,2021-04-28,Laptop for MBA,Mikeye92,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/n0al8c/laptop_for_mba/,"I'm going to start my MBA in the US this fall, but I'm currently in Europe. At the moment I'm using the laptop provided by my company but I'll have to give it back at the end of May and after that I need a laptop since I'll do a pre-MBA internship (in Italy) for a couple of months. I'm thinking about buying it now instead of waiting to go to the US and then buy it because here in Italy I have 22% discount on all laptops, so it's really cheap, even if I know that laptop prices are somewhat lower in the US compared to EU. 

Big question is: will I be able to use my EU laptop in US without issues? I'm thinking about charging (do I need only a US charger and that's it?), or compatibility issues with software. 

 LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
Up to 900-1,000 EUR. Purchasing in Italy. (Consider that because of the discount above, a laptop which has a price of 1,000 EUR on Amazon, I'll pay around 780 EUR)
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
No, looking for new ones. 
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Build quality, battery life, performance, form factor.
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Quite important, considering that I have to bring it to school everyday.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
13 or 15.
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
Probably not, maybe I'll play some videogames that are only on PC, but I have a PS5 for gaming.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
As above, maybe I'll play something like Valorant or Counter Strike, but it's not an important factor. 
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
No, actually I just need something that will work well with video calls, excel stuff and so on. 
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
I've seen LG Gram, ASUS ZenBook and HP Envy as possible candidates. Would be great to know if there are other good options. Moreover, a good comparison among those three would be great to understand where they differ from each others.

Thank you guys for the help!"

I have already tried to negotiate for both offers, but the details shown below are final and non-negotiable, according to my recruiters at both companies.

The TC for both is as follows:

1. Big A  - 150-160k per year in Seattle, Washington
2. Mid-sized tech company - 125k per year in Bay Area, California

I've actually already interned at Big A and received the return offer. While I felt I learned a lot, I honestly wasn't a huge fan of the culture, and I'm sort of dreading starting in the company for full-time. The internship was pretty stressful and I'm worried that the transition into full-time work will be pretty overwhelming.

By contrast, the culture at the other tech company seems much more aligned with what I want. The team I interviewed with seems really supportive, and overall people just seem really happy there. The team/company also seems to focus on maintaining a healthy work-life balance as well.

Is it really a serious misstep if I choose the mid-sized company for fulltime as opposed to Big A? I know this sub touts the prestige of FAANG, but I feel like I will be happier in the other company."

However, I'm not sure what the hiring bar is like for such positions.

So far, I've kept my GPA competitive for research internships (\~94% CAV) but never sought after these positions. Instead, I mainly focused on preparing for general SWE jobs for coop, so I don't have much experience doing research / working with ML.

Ultimately I want to complete my Ph.D. at a university with a department dedicated to a specific human rights policy.

The first of these offers is in an excellent location for networking in the field (arguably the best), is affiliated with a higher-ranked university, and the curriculum is more geared towards meta-theory/practice in my field, providing a solid foundation in global governance/diplomacy context which I could certainly use. They have great internships built into the program and offer career services. Would really be able to build on my French since it's in a Francophone city which is valuable in the field.

The second program is in a horrible location for networking, is at a not at all prestigious university, but the curriculum is geared more towards my niche interests. Does not offer internships or career services as far as I'm aware, but it is actually in a high-interest location in my field in the Middle East. I would have the opportunity to learn Arabic which isn't as central of a language in the field but definitely in high demand.

I'm concerned that the lower rank of the school and nonexistent networking opportunities will negatively affect my prospects of admission to my dream Ph.D. program, but wonder if learning Arabic and studying in a location that's relevant to this human rights policy would make up for that? I don't know, but I have 2.5 weeks to make a decision and I'm totally at a loss for what to do.

About a year ago I started on as an intern after graduating with a BSc in Computer Science. The company themselves is government funded and doesn't actually do much CS related stuff, most people at the company are not competent besides the few software we work with (none can code etc, basically bureaucrats).One of my projects I started with them was a data analytics portal application that we can give to our users for them to look at statistics of their communities and patients. I've been working on this project for about a year, with an open source embedded BI solution as the backend with some test data, and been developing a front end dashboard portal for it that also features support ticketing features for the software we provide training for, as well as a user forum.

I've been very excited about this project and it's been my favourite part of working at this company, I really wanted to be a web developer when I graduated school but couldn't find any place to take me because of my lack of on the job/internship experience.

Now as this project is finally getting bigger we've been looking at better paid BI solutions for it once we can get a pilot going. The BI solution we are going for has their own Database Management and User Portal as well as an Embedded option (which would plugin to the application I built).But now the upper management is seriously talking about scrapping my application and going with the big companies user portal service instead. They don't think it's realistic to develop a web application in house because of the amount of overhead, as I'm the only one who knows how it works, and they don't want to hire on more people, not to mention since I've also taken on all their IT needs (networking, firewalls, vpn etc....).

I'm a little hurt. I spent a year putting hundreds of hours into this application to get it to a presentable prototype, using every compsci trick I knew. The app itself is in a functional prototype stage (albeit with a few bugs here and there), and now they're planning on throwing it out and getting me to just use someone elses software that does similar (but not the same) things.

Am I being selfish? I'm worried because if they take this away there's not much other opportunities for software development in the job, just general IT management. I feel like them scrapping this project is kind of where my passion for this job ends.

Should I be taking my experience with web development I've now gained to other companies? Are they making a bad decision axing my project or are they right that there is too much overhead?

Any feedback or help would be much appreciated."

These are doubts that assault me when I find that instead of having a little workshop before getting to work in an enterprise, I should get a lot of ""market value"" in order to get, not a job, but an internship and by my own.   
Well just wanted to share with you, I don't know where to move from here or if I should quit."
n0h4aa,1,2021-04-28,I have a bachelor's in mechanical engineering and I am looking to pursue my masters in Europe.,The_Nortrom,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/n0h4aa/i_have_a_bachelors_in_mechanical_engineering_and/,"With a work experience of almost 3 years, I have decided to quit my job and pursue masters in courses like Thermal engineering or any industry oriented course.

The countries that do have universities with good QS rankings as well as good reputation are:-

1. Germany
2. France
3. Sweden 
4. Norway
5. Belgium
6. Denmark 
7. The Netherlands 

Whenever I talk to people, or surf the internet looking for advice regarding the right country, I am told that Germany is one of the best countries because of a lot of reasons(including free education, which is partially true). 

But, I have read a lot of cases from Germany where students have completed their masters in Germany but had a tough time finding a job. I understand, that there would always be students who wouldn't be able to find jobs but the number of people stating jobs are very difficult to find in Germany were alarmingly high. 

So, these are the questions which I am hoping to get answers here for:- 

1. Are there any other countries in Europe that I should be looking at other than the ones I have mentioned earlier. 

(My thinking process was:- Europe vs. USA+Canada 

And Europe felt better because it is less expensive compared to USA and also, considering the administration and restrictions in US at the time I took the decision that Europe would be better.)


2. Fall semester vs. Spring semester. 

It would be great to go for my masters as soon as possible but at the same time, I have read that Fall semester has its own advantages, like the RA/TA jobs, internships, and a lot many. 

In case someone has gone for their masters during the spring semester, I would be grateful if you can share your experience. 

I am new at this and I would be really grateful if you can help me with my doubts."

From my school, I have one year of combined helpdesk and desktop support experience. After that I was asked to be a helpdesk manager of a smaller department at my school. I did that for another year. I'm currently looking for a 6 month internship before my senior year and my school is offering me to work under one team of Sys Admins. If I don't take the position to work under this team, I'd be looking to be a Sys Admin intern at another employer if I get any offers. If I stay with my university, I will most likely be able to extend my internship from 6 months to work with my schedule until graduation, so I will have 2 years of Jr Sys Admin experience.

My question is, after college is it going to look bad on my resume that I only have experience with one company rather than more than one?"

I am starting my MBA this fall, and am planning on recruiting for a tech PM role for my summer internship and full time.

However, I have a computer science background and have spent the last few months studying and planning to apply to FAANG PM + SWE roles before b-school, with the idea that I can potentially skip the MBA altogether.

If I were to apply to a few roles over the next few weeks/months, before b-school starts, and I don't get any offers, could I then reapply as an MBA student for summer internships? Or is there some type of ""6 month cooldown period"" where I won't be able to apply for summer internships because I had applied for a different role within the last 6 months.

Does anyone have any experience with this?

Thanks"

Previously I have done several software Engineer internship in tech companies. 

I have got some offers and narrowed them down to the followers:

1. Berkeley MEng in mechanical engineering, with a concentration in robotics and autonomous systems. 

it’s Berkeley! But it’s not EECS and it’s only 9 month long. Not many people from this program work as SDE after graduation. Will my previous SDE experience may help me find a full time SDE job even if I enrolled in a mechanical engineering program?

2. Columbia MSCS
Ivy school with a good location which however will cost me quite a lot of money. and I have to register 4 courses in the first and second semester to maintain my visa status, which will be a drawback for me because I want to focus on finding an internship in the first two semesters. 

3. CMU INI Mobile and IoT engineering
It’s Carnegie Mellon and all the students in the program find a SDE job. Got a scholarship of 7000 dollars. But it’s trivial compared to the tuition and this program includes many computer engineering courses. 

4. UChicago MSCS with 50%scholarship. 
Gots tuition waiver for 50%tuition, and UChicago has a good overall prestige. but UC is not typically thought strong in computer science.

I am also admitted by Georgia tech MSCS, but its cost is the same as UChicago if I do not find a GTA/GRA and its courses are as intensive as Columbia (4 courses per semester) so I think not attending it.

Really need a programmer who went through blood and tears from entry to mid to senior position to help me out, please!

I want to switch to a programming career.

Right now I've been a sysadmin for 12 years. I have a BS in IT and BA and a 3.7 GPA. I only need another 15-hours credit to get my BS in Computer Science. But with my professional experience and related degree, I don't think I need to. What do you recommend based on your 2020-2021 experience with the software engineer jobs and industry-wide expectations? **Do I really need a BS in CS?**

**What's the easiest language(s) to learn to get an entry level job with a considerable salary like $50k+**? I googled and someone said interns get $25/$30/$40 per hour. I don't know what or who to believe.

I've been reading here it seems Python/JS/Java/ReAct are the way.

Right now my passion is building web-based applications (not websites) and mobile apps. Like I want to build something similar to [monday.com](https://monday.com) or [smartsheet.com](https://smartsheet.com). I don't wanna build something like TurboTax or Windows or macOS.

What I want to know is should I just learn only Python and start building stuff and post them online now prior to looking for an entry job? Or should I learn all of those and start building stuff?

One method takes less time while the other method may take a year or 2.

So I talked with my psychologist and realize that I've stopped doing the things that work out for me, so now I'm recapping everything e doing those things again and It's been helping a lot.

1 - use [track.toggl.com](https://track.toggl.com), it helps to track your time and productiveness, with this you can pinpoint the areas you can improve (don't get psico or will trigger anxiety)

2 - Binaural songs. This tip helps my brain to remember that I'm doing something and fill the void that says ""This is boring""

3 - Sleep and eat well, doesn't matter if you go at 3 am do at least 7 hours

4 - Meditate. This is really hard for me because I forget to do it and then I give up but will help a lot.

5 - Make a list of what you want to do this week and enjoy every victory, classic

6 - Take your meds

7 - GO OUT. At least once a day go outside for 5 minutes and breathe air

Like many here, I had my own fair share of ups and downs with regards to the whole internship application process and I'm thankful I managed to secure a role for summer through both nailing the interview and learning how to get a referral on the way in via LinkedIn.

Decided to put together a comprehensive guidebook for those who are interested in reaching out to industry professionals on LinkedIn to get a referral for your internships. Please only check out if you're interested in reaching out to people on LinkedIn, else this won't serve your purpose/goal of getting a referral.

Hope it helps!

https://gumroad.com/l/justacuppa

I personally have reached out to industry professionals to form connections and genuinely to find out more about the industry I'm interested in (Consulting and Tech - my background is in Consulting and moving into Tech Strategy).

More often that not, it is usually at the end of my coffee chat that the person I'm meeting offers to refer for a position or forward to HR, or in a few cases forward to a recruiting team to keep my resume for future hiring.

Anyways the key thing is - the mindset in reaching out to industry professionals should always be to learn about the industry and expand your social network/capital (referrals will come naturally, in most of my cases).

I would greatly appreciate it if someone could answer!

1. Would it be possible for me to get a single room as a freshman? I would be willing to pay extra. I would be okay with living off-campus too (if it's allowed for first years ofc). This is a dealbreaker for me.
2. What is the political culture like? Is it far left or moderate left? 
3. How are the mental health services? Do your parents find out if you use them? I am a bit worried because so far on this sub I've heard that the mental health services are bad/lacking
4. How is the culture around mental health at Cornell? I've heard horror stories about students jumping off the bridges
5. Should I bring a car to campus? Is the public transportation good?
6. How are the class sizes? 
7. Do you feel safe on campus? Especially if you're a woman?
8. Does the bad weather detract a lot from your experience? 
9. Does the isolation of Ithaca/kinda being in the middle of nowhere detract a lot from your experience?
10. Is Cornell actually depressing and stressful or is that just a stereotype?

I also have some questions specific to the CS program:

1. In general, is the program more theoretical or practical? Does it prepare you well for going straight to industry after graduation?
2. Is there grade deflation?
3. Is the student culture collaborative or competitive?
4. Do AP credits transfer over well for CS students or are they useless?
5. How hard is it to get into CS clubs? Are they super competitive?
6. How is the workload? I've heard that CS at Cornell is extremely difficult 
7. Is it difficult to get internships due to Cornell's isolated location?

I am sorry if I played into misconceptions/stereotypes (and please feel free to correct me for that), I just want to get input from current students before making my decision :)"

I've gotten a few automated coding challenges through Hackerrank which I completed but that's about it. I'm not sure how many places I've applied to, but if I had to guess, I would assume somewhere around 30~. My biggest regret is not doing any sort of internship, but one summer I did do some freelancing web dev work for a local company which doesn't seem to really matter. 

I'm just completely exhausted and losing hope. I was doing so much leetcode after I graduated to prep for the upcoming interviews, but I've yet to receive an interview 2-3 months in and I've just stopped practicing. I guess this is mostly a rant but I'm also wondering if you guys have any advice. I'm just so disappointed in myself and generally sad because I had this idea in my mind that after I'm done, I'll land a good job with good pay to help my family and get to happily do what I enjoy, but that's not the case. 

I just feel so lost... Any advice on what to do is greatly appreciated, thank you."

I have a bachelor's degree in computer science (4-year course). I had decent grades, and a bit of research experience through an internship, and 1 publication (not related to bioinformatics). After graduation I worked as a software engineer at a top IT company for over a year. I was interested in moving into Bioinformatics field and managed to get a job as a Bioinformatician at a research institute. The work I do here is still almost entirely software development, with a little bit of data analysis work occasionally. I am now more interested in research than development and think that getting a PhD in bioinformatics might be the right way to go to.

When it comes to PhD applications, I am concerned about my lack of research experience as almost all universities mention this. Getting a good academic LOR is another concern as I have not had much research experience during my undergrad, and it has been a while since I graduated. I can get strong LORs from my current and previous employers but PhD applications seem to prefer academic LORs. 

Considering that I have a little over a year before I start applying to PhD programs, what can I do to make a strong application? Also, which PhD programs do you recommend for someone like me with a computational background but looking to get more experience in biology. I am particularly interested in Genomics and Biomedical research."

I also plan on taking another compsci class this spring.

As someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with compsci, i just don't really know where to start, i've done well on all my compsci classes so far, A's. I would say i'm probably better than the average student in my classes, although these classes are still pretty beginner.

Think is, I get mixed messages about it. Most say it's a good path that looks to be growing since the tech industry is booming and companies will always need tech support in order to function.

I'm finding it very difficult to get a response back for any of my applications. Does anyone have any advice on any companies that are willing to hire non-italian citizens, or how i can possibly better market myself for a job there?

Thowaway account

Hey everyone, I want to ask for a raise, but my situation is complicated. Here is a little bit of a backstory.

I am a college student(Here they are called Cegep, and the step before University, but is after highschool) from Canada.

EMPLOYMENT SITUATION:

I have been an intern for the past 2.5 years for a consultant company. At my company, I work under 2 bosses.

My first boss (Boss A) partially owns the consultant company and he is the one who runs it.

My second boss (Boss B) owns a big company and is also part owner of the consultant company, but doesnt take part into running it. 

In general, all decisions related to my employment are Boss A's business, and all work related decisions are Boss B's business, since he is our only client (relatively new consultant company)

In 2.5 years, my salary went up 4$. At first, salary was not something I was focused on since I only wanted to gain experience. Also, my cost of living was relatively low during that period.

Im the intern who has been employed for the longest, all projects I worked on were succesful and satisfied my bosses, specificaly one I worked on by myself that brought over 400k in sales. Never really took a day off unless necessary. I work a lot, generally 40 hours week even during school and exam weeks.

LIVING SITUATION :

This autumn, I will be attending university and my cost of living will be relatively high. High to the point of not being able to cover all my expenses every month co sidering I wont be able to work full time. I am not able to get loans since my parent have a too big salary (will not be giving me any financial aid) and also because my salary from last year is considered too high. (Kinda stupid that they base it on past year salary, rather than how much ill be able to make during University).

This situation is what is stressing me out and the reason why I want to ask for a raise.

THE ISSUE:

I talked about my concerns to Boss A, about how I would like to have a raise, selling myself a bit and explaining the big reason why I NEED a raise.

He said it all comes down to Boss B's decision, since he is the client and he is the one who pays.

I first asked about the raise 2 months ago to Boss A, and after not hearing back from him on the subject for 3 weeks, I asked him again and had no news for a while. Boss A has talked about it with Boss B briefly but Boss B never really came back on the subject. Today, Boss A called me in the meeting room to have a chat, since my internship is coming to an end in a couple of days wanting to make me sign documents concerning my new employment contract. While reading the contract with me, he told be about the raise I asked, and said that he talked to Boss B about it, and he is really pushing for it, but Boss B is either too busy or not paying attention. He suggested I should go and talk with Boss B myself, to get a definitive answer. Boss A doesnt want me to leave and so do I. He knows and understands that I will have no choice but to leave if I cant have that raise.

(I have an opportunity elsewhere, with a better salary, but I like my current job and dont want to just drop them without giving them a chance, as they have always been great to me)

I am really scared, and stressed about the idea of approaching boss B about the subject, since I know Boss A talked to him about it multiple times. I dont want to be that one annoying guy that is always asking for something. I am also in the mindset that, he doesnt care/want to give me a raise from his lack of response. 

WHAT I WANT:

I need help on finding a way to approach him about the subject without it sounding like I am threatening him of leaving, as I am the main dev on 2 important project. I dont want to sound like a total asshole but i want to let him know that I dont have a choice If I dont get a certain raise. I dont want to seem not loyal.

This may sound like a stupid question, but for me it isnt. The subject has been killing me from the inside for the past couple of months and made me feel depressed, often bursting into tears in my car when coming back from work and feeling sick every morning.


This post may be sounding like me shitting on the company, but it isnt. They have been great for my career, giving me a lot of professional experience and i didnt even start University yet! 

Sorry for the long post once again.
Please help."

I am planning on applying to GSB and HBS and had a quick question around how job changes are perceived by admissions committees. 

I will be applying with about 5 years of experience, but I have worked for 3 different firms over that period. My question is if that’s too many career changes? Below is a bit more detail. 

My first job out of undergrad was at a top Private Equity firm that I had also interned for. In total, excluding my internship, I spent ~1.5 years there. Following that, I spent exactly a year at a well known hedge fund. Then I had an option to join two very high profile people in the hedge fund world as their number 5th employee at a new firm they were launching. I have been with them for about 2.5 years. 

Each one of my job switches has given me more responsibilities and has been because I was presented with what I thought to be a great opportunity. As such, would this look really weird in my application? 

Thank you!"

Incoming freshman to the College of Engineering and I'd like to affiliate into CS. I've heard that Cornell Engineering especially suffers from grade deflation and that the median GPA for Engineering/CS is 2.7. Is that true and if so, how bad exactly is it? What's the median GPA? How likely is it to get a GPA around 3.7ish or at least 3.5? (I'm a pretty hardworking person and I'll definitely put in the effort but I'm just wondering if it's even possible).
2. I want to get a Master's Degree in CS as well. I'm aware Cornell has a M. Eng program, how good is that compared to a regular MS at a good school? Like are they valued the same by employers? Also, kinda going back to the GPA question, will I be able to have a high enough GPA with time to do research &amp; internships in order to get into a good MS program?
3. Is Cornell a good place to be recruited/get internship opportunities, as in do companies like recruiting from Cornell bc location-wise it's pretty far from a lotta companies in the bay area so are a variety of companies (from startups to the big ones) interested?  basically, is it helpful to go to Cornell in terms of recruiting?
4. Is it hard to enroll in classes? like is it common to be waitlisted or even not able to take classes you want/need?
5. Is Cornell worth the cost? And if so, in what ways?

in high school, i feel that i did not take advantage of every opportunity i was blessed with; i had chances to do research, participate in internships, and enter into/win competitions i know would have made me more competitive applicant. starting my freshman year of college, i intend to change that.

all that aside, in the activities i did participate in, i was very successful. i’m not the smartest or the most talented, however, i’m willing to work. i also acknowledge that grad admissions (especially for engineering/STEM) are a totally different ball game than undergrad admissions.

with all that out of the way: what do you guys wish you knew about as a freshman with their hearts set on grad school? if you got into an excellent grad program, what do you think helped the most? would starting this planning process earlier help me to succeed in grad school admissions? how can i prevent asking myself “what could have been” when it comes time for me to graduate?"

Finished everything except my thesis (fell ill, had to go on disability for multiple years). Since then everything has changed so I don't consider going back an option. I have been making a living from various temp work, but I have held the same temp jobs down for years, so I have good references. 

I tried applying for coding jobs with what I had, thinking that a 99% complete engineering degree would be worth something. Turns out it isn't. I have been told things like ""Gaps in the CV proves you are not driven enough. We don't care that you have held down the same job for years afterwards"" or ""need to provide graduation certificate, with the degree stating either computer engineereing, computer science, informatics or software engineering otherwise you are unemployable"".  

In my country there are programs called ""higher vocational degrees"" they are not quite uni and a lot of it is in the form of internships. They are designed to match what the industry claims to be needing and if not at least 90% of the graduates aren't employed in the field they were trained to do 24 months after graudation the the program is shut down. I am seriously considering applying for a 2 year program to train as either a front end developer or as a full stack developer in C#. What do you think? 

Am I too old to get into the field? Will my gap continue to be held against me? I am able to provide a clean criminal record, never even been accused of a crime so I can dispel the questions if I spent time in prison."

n10s4b,2,2021-04-29,Getting a job after coding bootcamp,dreyy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n10s4b/getting_a_job_after_coding_bootcamp/,"I'm an engineering manager and I interviewed a fair share of people out of coding bootcamps for internships and junior software engineering positions. I saw the same mistakes over and over again so I decided to write about how to get a job after your coding bootcamp.

Here are my top 3 **DON'Ts**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Don't talk about what you don't know or understand. It's better in an interview if you say what you know regarding a topic but otherwise just say ""I don't know"". If you think you know something but you're not entirely sure you can say ""I've heard of it and I think it means *this* and *that* but I don't have any personal experience with it yet"".

This is great because it shows that you have a general understanding of the topic and not having the experience is totally okay for an intern/junior!

&amp;#x200B;

1. Don't ""spray &amp; pray"" your applications. Instead of applying for any and every job you see invest enough time to find jobs that match your tech and affinity. It's more effort, it's probably harder to score a job but it will be ultimately more rewarding and you're wasting less of everyone's time.
2. Don't rely on a single channel. There are many recruiting platforms and many good companies are really bad at advertising their jobs. In fact, many jobs never make it to Linkedin or Glassdoor. Create a list of companies that you like and that work with the tech you're interested in and check their career page.

Here are some tips to get hired:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Target specific companies. That means research their tech stack, their culture, etc. and then write a targeted cover letter.
2. Prepare for the interview. Ask the recruiter what's expected. If it's an interview with coding puzzles you should exercise. Do leetcode, etc.
3. Go for tech-focused companies. It's better to work in a company where the tech and software is core to its business. In non-tech native companies IT is still mostly seen as a cost factor.

Really hope this helps someone. What are everyone else's tips?"

I recently accepted a cybersecurity internship at the largest company in my city. It's a huge honor and also a huge responsibility so I want to take it seriously. I have some internship experience prior to this so I know general professional etiquette and whatnot. But I'm more so wondering what to expect specifically because it is a cybersecurity internship. I'd appreciate it if some professionals could give me some insight into these questions:

\-What can I expect workload wise?

\-What are the major dos and donts?

\-How many questions are too many?

\-What is the most likely thing I can fuck up?

\-What would make me stand out to my employer?

\-Personal recommendations/advice?"

n17yc0,1,2021-04-29,Leaving CS Masters Program to Work,Thebearguy30,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n17yc0/leaving_cs_masters_program_to_work/," 

So to start off I was as an Intern/Co-Op in an IT position at a big aerospace company my senior year of my bachelors degree (Spring 2020). When covid hit I lost my job due to furloughs and decided to apply to grad schools. I got into a good School in the Midwest for a PHD program in Computer Science with all my schooling paid for by working as a TA(teaching assistant). I was originally intending on leaving after two years with just an MS in Computer Science. I am Making about 20k a year doing about 20 hours of work a week as a TA. This is all a great opportunity...

1.My first two semesters of the MS program I was have been taking 500 level courses which are like database management, software engineering, computer architecture, etc. Because of covid, I haven’t really been able to meet an advisor since everything is online. I just learned that to graduate over the next year I will need to take all graduate level courses(700 level). 3 the first semester and 2 the second semester. I recently talked to someone finishing the PHD who said taking 3 at a time can’t be done with the workload and I didn’t even mention I have to be a TA on top of that. I am usually a person who would laugh it off and just grind it out cause that’s just my mentality.(I got 3 majors in my undergrad) I am very unsure about my ability to complete this in the next year and if I do what it will do to my mental health. If I go back I could get my masters in this one year but it could very well take my til Dec 2022 if I am too overloaded because they don’t offer classes in the summer and I would have one last lingering class.

2. I don’t think what I am learning is very useful. I have this feeling that these upcoming classes are very in depth on very specific topics that are very research and academic based. I don’t believe they have a lot to do with real world SWE jobs, which is what I want to do. As of now I am continuing to work as a TA and I have an internship with a small startup doing software engineering/architect work. So I will basically have 60 hrs/week worth of work already throughout the Summer. When it comes around to fall I will be stuck taking a huge course load that isn't really preparing me for an industry job and it more aligned with reading academic papers and research. If I was not focused on school I could focus on getting cloud certifications (AWS and GCP) as well as practice leetcode for those big time software jobs.

3. I want to start working and making real money. I have recently become very serious about the FIRE lifestyle and I maxed out my Roth IRA this year but I still have student loans from my undergrad and it's hard to do much when I make about $2k a month and spend $1k on rent to live in Madison by the college. I have been thinking about opportunity cost and I know as a starting/junior software engineer I can make from 60-100k and even though I am not going further into debt getting my masters, I am not really improving my net worth either. There is also not a guarantee I find a job, although I am optimistic I can keep searching and find one by the end of the Summer.

Should I go back and finish my masters or should I just start looking for jobs? Anyone have good advice or options on what I should do? A similar experience?"
n18c1w,1,2021-04-29,Trying to figure out a job,omnisxiii2,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/n18c1w/trying_to_figure_out_a_job/,"Hullo folks! Sorry for the essay.

I'm currently a junior attending a somewhat prestigious university, struggling to figure out what to do next. I'm majoring in History (lol useless degree), with a minor in Music (lol useless minor). My original plan called for going on to get a master's in education since I wanted to become a teacher, and I do have just over three years' experience teaching; just over half a year as an intern in nearby public school districts, and two and a half years paid work teaching English abroad in the summer and remotely during the school year, with fairly good results (I even won a few awards from the local government).

The problem is, my father's cancer is back, it's the third time, and this time it looks a lot worse - he's coughing all the time, he can barely gather up the strength to go to work in the morning. Honestly, even if he doesn't just straight up die by next year, I just want him to retire - he's got enough cash saved up in the pension and whatnot to live somewhat comfortably if he retires next year. He's barely dragging himself to the finish line just for me, and I seriously hate myself for doing this to him. I do work part-time in fast food outside of school to help reduce the burden, with the expected result on my grades - my GPA is around a 3.02, so while I haven't screwed myself into the dropout zone, I have screwed myself out of the scholarship zone. Furthermore, I'm just feeling terribly burnt out at this point, I'm starting to get tired of just going to school all day and not doing something that can actually sustain me and just mooching off my parents' earnings and savings. I've promised to my parents, on their request, that I would at least graduate with my degree. I just don't know what I can do from there. The original plan was to go to graduate school, but with my father in horrible condition and the money pool drying up, plus the fact that my student debt for now is still fairly ""low"" (expecting around 20k total once I graduate, I have about 15k total saved up and the plan is to dump 10k immediately on the debt), I think my focus right now should be being able to keep myself financially secure and self-supporting. Of course, a history degree will not help at all with that, but shame on me for not coming up with a backup plan. At this point I know I need further school to either get into teaching or get a major that's actually useful, but I'm legitimately burnt out and feeling sick of school, and I likely won't have the funding available to do more school. But I want to have it as an option in the future, should my circumstances change.

So the name of the game right now is to figure out how to support myself, with a useless degree. I'm lucky I guess in that I have already learned a bit about cheap living - rice and beans, no excessive spending, etc. My only real ""requirement"" at this point is that I'd like to stay in the Boston area, just so I can be there should anything happen to my parents. Bonus points of course for actually being within range of the T, since that should allow me to sell my car and save a ton on insurance and upkeep (within Boston I generally just walk anyway). I generally only get entertainment needs from Youtube, and I don't spend a lot of time texting or shopping or going to activities like movie theaters. My only real ""treats"" come from ordering takeout maybe once a month, spending one or two days a week walking around the Common (which is free as long as I have the time), visiting the MFA maybe twice a year (I do enjoy art even though I'm horrible at it), and buying a subscription to stream some football games during the season, which I cancel when the season ends. Otherwise, I'm totally fine with living inside a broom closet and living a life devoid of much other joy. Haven't been able to get into a relationship since high school (and the last one ended horribly) so I'm ready to embrace the forever alone life if necessary. My brother's doing a useful major and is dating a medical school student anyway, so the family will be fine. I probably won't have to support anyone then, which works out in my favor.

I'm going to base my math and calculations and whatnot based on my choices and circumstances (Boston area only, relatively cheap living habits, probably roommates, no need to support anyone myself, no spare change needed for dating/other activities). Doing the math, I figure I can save up for a possible future return to graduate school (assuming I've worked back up my morale and mental well-being enough to motivate myself to go back to school) around the 35k/yr mark. At 40k+ I'd probably be able to spoil myself a little with an apartment of my own in a really bad neighborhood, and maybe afford to date (not like it'll actually happen) or have a little fun once in a while, maybe save up faster for a return to school. For basic survival with no hope of a future return to school, or family, or really any future except as a deadbeat who just lived and died with no accomplishments of note (which I guess is still more honorable than dealing drugs or committing crime), I can make 30k work. Bare minimum would probably be 28k, at which point I'd be cutting back on everything else I mentioned including any ""fun"". Would also scrap public transit and just walk I guess. At least that's minimum wage in MA so I don't have to worry about going any lower, unless I'm somehow so unemployable that I can't even get a full time job at all.

Besides the teaching experience (which includes elements I might be able to sell as ""clerical"" or ""office"" experience, since I did a lot of that work myself since the foreign school I worked at was understaffed as hell so I managed a lot of the basic clerical tasks myself), all I've got is my part-time fast food work from the last three years. With my teaching experience (in making classroom materials) I also have a functional knowledge of PowerPoint, Word, and the Google equivalents (Slides, Docs). Based on what other people have said, I figure I can probably self-teach the basics of Excel too. 80+ wpm with 98% accuracy on a typing test I just did randomly, just seeing what I was capable of as-is. I also have some experience as a gig worker as a freelance classical musician, which won't support me but can maybe pull in a little bit of extra cash every month or so, and proves that I can at least look and act presentable in formal situations. Absolutely no experience in coding (attempted a course in college and almost failed it lol) so trying to run into that field would be risky; might attempt it if nothing else works. Back injury does mean I probably can't do heavy manual labor for very long (it's minor though, so if I have to do it for a few years I'll do it). I'd hate having to walk very long distances every day but walking around Boston every day for years has given me pretty good walking endurance if it comes to that.

I know that as bleak as my situation is, I did kind of hit the financial independence jackpot; my parents at least have enough saved up to retire and live off of benefits and savings for at least the next 10 years if not more, if they live somewhat cheaply. Brother's on track to graduate with a useful degree with a good GPA, plus dating someone going to medical school, so I probably won't have to support him. Worked to pay for part of my college plus family earnings and savings so relatively minimal student loan debt expected. Not big into any spending habits, no drugs (a little bit of college underage drinking of course plus my time spent abroad in a country with a lower drinking age, but I'm willing to cut that out if necessary, and generally my habits there don't impede my ability to drag myself back out to school or work when necessary), no criminal record, already have some savings to kill some debt, and in an area that you could live in without a car, plus a college degree expected (if a useless one at that). So at the very least, I should reasonably be expected to be able to keep myself alive, even on minimum wage. Worst comes to worse, I'll drag food home from a fast food job, which will probably kill me with obesity in a few years, but at least I'll save on food. I'm not physically strong or athletic, but at least I can stand, walk, lift moderate weight, etc.

Totally fine with a soul-crushing, dead-end office job like data entry or office admin or whatever, some soulless cubicle 9-5 Mon-Fri thing. Might do weekends too; not like I'm going to be able to afford doing anything on weekends, although I would prefer leaving Sunday or Saturday off to visit parents if need be. Would try to avoid fast food, retail, or factory work, or working midnight, but if necessary I'll just suck it up. The bare minimum line at this point is to survive; having a future is a secondary concern. Plus, I can pull out some ""read about Communism in college to experience the working class lifestyle after college"" jokes (love it when my hard-core Marxist classmate in one of my classes constantly spews some Communist literature during discussions and then drives home in her brand-new Tesla while drinking Starbucks while I'm the one closing my store every night just to help pay for school).

Anyway, gunna ask this in a series of ""tiers"" based on me trying to measure how screwed I am.

1. (The ""actually things are going to be very ok"" tier) What are my chances at finding a job around Boston in the 40k/year and up range? Would prefer an office Mon-Fri 9-5 job but I might be willing to just deal with some weird shifts.
2. (The ""things are kinda ok"" tier) What are my chances at finding a job around Boston in the 35k/year and up range? Anything except for lower end retail and fast food, and preferably an office, but at this range I can't afford to be picky. Bonus points for a job with upward potential but at least I can save a tiny bit to go back to school someday when my mind's ready and my savings are prepared.
3. (The ""things are bad but I'll live"" tier) What are my chances at finding a job around Boston that pays 30k/year? Most of these roles are probably going to be dead-end roles or high-level fast food management roles, and at this range I'll probably just uninstall any hope of becoming a teacher or going back to school, but screw it, I won't be a deadbeat and I'll be living an honest life.
4. (The ""I might need to uninstall life"" tier) Legitimately, if I just remove my degree from my resume and remove half of my work experience, could I still have a shot at getting a literal minimum wage (13.50/hr) job? I'll have 0% future, 0% mobility, and 0% will to live beyond not wanting my parents to feel bad, but honestly this is the point where death seems like a good option. Too bad I'm too much of a chicken to actually end it all, so I'll still need a job. At this point I can probably at least be assured that if I scrap pretty much everything from my resume I'll be able to secure a job at McDonald's handing out fries, so I think the question isn't""can I get a job"" but ""what job sucks less"", preferably still in some sort of office but at the least not in retail or fast food. Of course, I can't be picky about things, and one of my coworkers at the store I currently work at has a PhD in History, so recommendations about less horrible fast food places to work at are helpful too.

I reckon with my previous experience plus attention to detail and computer skills, if I brush up on Excel I might make a half-decent office admin (actually would be nice, state govt. roles that I could shift into after 2 years of work have a base salary of 45k and a max of 60k, so I'd actually do pretty well for someone with a useless degree) or administrative assistant (I'm male though so it might be a bit harder, but I do have the experience interacting with people plus the general computer knowledge base). Previous part-time fast food experience might get me into an assistant manager role, but I do know several folks that have worked full-time for years and never made the jump up, so I don't know. Sales could work, but I'd rather have something more stable than just commissions salary. Customer service would be fine considering my previous work background, data entry would be soul sucking but I figure I can deal with it. Might be able to break into a trade as an apprentice, but I'm weak physically and my back isn't in great condition already, so I might not last more than 10 years in that. Everyone hates on the 9-5 Mon-Fri office job around here, but honestly that's kind of my golden ticket at this point . . . any advice or tips? What even are my chances?

Again, sorry for the essay folks, and thanks for helping out."

I work for a non-profit, basically educating people who come to our location on specific topics. Initially I was hired as an intern, so I did the education stuff along with a lot of miscellaneous mini jobs, but 90% of the stuff I did had to do with education which I enjoy. I didn't mind the random stuff as I was told I may need to do this as an intern. 

After my internship I got 'promoted' in their office doing paperwork since it was the off-season for education stuff. I was fine with this since my job titled changed to relate to that. And it was fun.

Now, my job title changed again. I am basically the head of the education part of this non-profit. I work in our shop in the off season. 

Once COVID hit I was out of work sadly. While we were still closed to the public (and therefore didn't really do any of our programs) my boss asked me to come back and do landscaping stuff. I was totally fine with this as I was just happy to have work and make money.

However, this unfortunately has set a precedent. A year later, my boss is still making me do this absolute shit. I hate mowing lawns, I hate weedwacking. This is NOT what I signed up to be. One of the days we are doing the educational stuff she has me doing maintenance crap.

LOOK I get there is some things we have to do at jobs we don't like. There is one kind of program I hate doing. BUT that IS part of my job, so I can't complain too much. Ya know? But this, this is NOT what I signed up for. Once in a while? Whatever. All the time? NO.

I also feel a bit insulted. I'm getting my Masters and she just has delegated me to maintenance stuff? So much for seniority.

Am I justified or am I be whiny?

I do want to say that I am grateful I have ANY job...but I just can't help but feel sad and miserable...."

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Algebra/Algebra 2 Teacher (9/10) - She really loved me, she thought I was some type of genius (I am totally not)

Freshman English/Senior AP Lit Teacher (8/10) - Really liked the way I wrote and knew what kind of student I was.

**Interviews**

Stanford (8/10) - Was my first interview back in November. I think it went alright, nothing crazy special.

Harvard (9/10) - I think she really liked me. We had a very easy going conversation, things just flowed very naturally. We talked a lot about life and my career aspirations.

MIT (9/10) - Lasted decently long, about 2 hours. We talked a lot about my projects and my personal endeavors. She was able to tell I knew a lot about MIT.

Columbia (10/10) - Lasted a little more than an hour and a half. He was a fellow engineer (in a field I was actually really interested in!!) so we had a more technical conversation. Surprisingly, I learned quite much from him in that short time. He talked a lot about his patents and he really enjoyed and was surprised from some of my projects. He gave me his signature ""thumbs of approval"" for my Columbia Application and said he would definitely admit me if he could.

Princeton (6/10) - Definitely my worst interview. It was very awkward and I tried my hardest to keep the flow of the conversation but she was giving back very short and dry answers, which made it extremely hard.

Cornell (9/10) - It was more of an alumni talk. Very casual, but I think I was able to convey that I knew a lot about Cornell and it was one of my top choices. Made her laugh quite a lot with my peculiar questions :).

UMich (9/10) - I thought it was pretty good. He was a recent 2020 grad so it was a lot more casual. We talked a lot about his PhD application and its differences with the college application process. I think he liked me, we had a lot of commonalities. He even offered to introduce me to some of his friends in FAANG companies to help me get internship opportunities in the future!

**Essays**

Spent a solid month on my main common app essay. Talked very deeply about my life and my experiences. Without going too much into detail, I mentioned the abuse I faced as a child and how it has shaped the way I approach things now. I mentioned childhood racism and bullying (now looking back, probably very taboo for admissions officers). My english teachers really liked my essay.

**Additional Information:**

I know I am not the best student and I don't have the best awards and activities. I expected to get into Binghamton and Stony Brook (my safeties), but not sure what happened there. From my school's Naviance charts, a 1400+ and 90+ gpa would basically be an automatic acceptance. I guess my situation was just different. I applied to so many reaches thinking I would at least have a chance at possibly Georgia Tech, Cornell (my dream school), or Michigan. Not gonna lie, I felt kind of stupid and that something was wrong with me and that I let my parents down. But looking back, I guess I was shooting too high. I know I can't do anything now to change my application, but what do you guys think I did wrong or lacked in my application for these high ranked schools.

Thank you so much guys for the super kind comments! I will save this post on my main account and come back and read whenever I'm feeling down. Thank you guys again and I wish you all the best :). "
n19dwh,2,2021-04-29,Can I get a business internship with a DUI?,AffectionateSet7823,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/n19dwh/can_i_get_a_business_internship_with_a_dui/,"I am a 20 year old college student, and earlier this year in January I was arrested for a DUI (in California, no injury). I was pretty wasted as I barely remember the moment of the arrest, and spending the night in jail was a blur. I blew a .19. Every single day I ask myself, how could I have been so stupid? I am constantly punishing myself mentally and my self-esteem has dropped to rock bottom since that happened. The thing is, I am a good person, and I know that. I just made the stupidest mistake of my life, and I now feel that I have just thrown my life away. I am a sophomore in college and I am a great student (3.86GPA, scholarships), like I mentioned before: I am a good person. So I just keep asking myself every day, why did I ruin my life like that? I have very supportive parents and friends who have supported me through these very rough three months, but as much as I hear “it is gonna be okay”, I cannot see the light ahead, it is all darkness for me. I just cannot forgive myself for having made such a stupid and costly mistake, because I do not even have alcohol problems, it was just a one night bad decision. I had my DMV hearing last week and they came to a decision that my license will be suspended for a year, with the suspension starting in a few days. My court date is in late May, and I will most likely get convicted because there is nothing in my favor with the evidence of the case (I hired a good/experienced lawyer). If I am being honest, what worries me the most is the future in my professional career. I am a finance student and I want to pursue a career in either finance or accounting, but the problem is that I do not have any real world experience yet (internships, job). That is why I hate myself the most, because I feel that I haven’t even began my career and I already have this black mark on my record forever. I want to put this all behind me, but the uncertainty of the future makes it very difficult. I need advice, I need guidance. I know how competitive the business world is nowadays and how the job market is in today’s society so having this DUI dragging me down makes it feel like the end of the world. Does anyone know if I could be able to land any internships in the next two years with a DUI on my record? Or will they completely rule me out? I feel like any firm would not want to waste their time working with someone like me, when they can just choose another candidate with a clean record. I just do not want to graduate in two years with no relevant experience because nobody would give me a chance. I know I made a mistake, and it has been internally destroying me for the last three months because I cannot forgive myself for it. If anyone has any advice or any guidance, it would mean everything to me, as I cannot see the light at this point..."

I work for a non-profit, basically educating people who come to our location on specific topics. Initially I was hired as an intern, so I did the education stuff along with a lot of miscellaneous mini jobs, but 90% of the stuff I did had to do with education which I enjoy. I didn't mind the random stuff as I was told I may need to do this as an intern. 

After my internship I got 'promoted' in their office doing paperwork since it was the off-season for education stuff. I was fine with this since my job titled changed to relate to that. And it was fun.

Now, my job title changed again. I am basically the head of the education part of this non-profit. I work in our shop in the off season. 

Once COVID hit I was out of work sadly. While we were still closed to the public (and therefore didn't really do any of our programs) my boss asked me to come back and do landscaping stuff. I was totally fine with this as I was just happy to have work and make money.

However, this unfortunately has set a precedent. A year later, my boss is still making me do this absolute shit. I hate mowing lawns, I hate weedwacking. This is NOT what I signed up to be. One of the days we are doing the educational stuff she has me doing maintenance crap.

LOOK I get there is some things we have to do at jobs we don't like. There is one kind of program I hate doing. BUT that IS part of my job, so I can't complain too much. Ya know? But this, this is NOT what I signed up for. Once in a while? Whatever. All the time? NO.

I also feel a bit insulted. I'm getting my Masters and she just has delegated me to maintenance stuff? So much for seniority.

Am I justified or am I be whiny?

I do want to say that I am grateful I have ANY job...but I just can't help but feel sad and miserable...."

I am immensely worried about graduating with debt after years of thinking it was going to be easy to get a well-paying job after graduation.

I’ve thought about focusing on cybersecurity, but I haven’t taken any relevant classes for that yet.

Honestly, any and all advice is appreciated. Where do I go from here? Any suggestions?


(Some background on me:
I didn’t start coding until college. I’m an “ok” programmer when it comes to homework assignments and projects, but it takes me a long time to get my work done. I have never attempted leetcode or anything like that. I go to a mediocre state school. The CS bachelor’s program I am in is extremely broad, but I have no clue what I should focus on with my degree because of that. My GPA is around a 3.3.

However my endsems will start from next month also I think a one month internship is fine for my resume so I can focus on placements after summer. 

If I leave after one month, if they do give certification they probably won't right. 
So I am asking whether just stating your internship on resume is enough or do companies require certificate of internship.

One of the reasons I don't want to complete a 3 month internship is that Glassdoor salary is very less. Like less than Infosys tcs etc. Are they accurate ? Because it was just one or two reviews for software engineer."

I'm graduating this semester with a BA in Linguistics and a minor in Spanish, but I didn't really accomplish anything except the degree itself. 

In 2018 I had a spiral due to mental illness that completely demolished my academics. I got diagnosed with anxiety, ADHD, and depression. I've been getting intense outpatient treatment and therapy ever since. I failed a whole semester, had to withdraw from it retroactively. Failed classes here and there that I had to repeat, over 20 units. I didn't get any internships, didn't network, and I'm honestly too scared to reach out to my professors for recommendations at this point. My overall GPA is going to be around a 2.8, but it was a 3.7 before the breakdown.  

I'm doing better now, getting high Cs and Bs, but it's left me feeling really hopeless in terms of graduate school admissions. I'm trying to get a Master's in Computational Linguistics. 

What can I do to make myself more appealing to programs despite all this? Should I explain this in my statement of purpose or take more classes to fluff up my GPA?

I am looking into applying to the Clinical Psychology Master's program next year (starting September 2022) in the Netherlands. I would like to one day become a healthcare or clinical psychologist.

I was wondering if any of you have completed such a program/gone onto this career path as an international in the Netherlands. I know that this program requires an internship that is in a language you speak at a very high level. I speak English, French, and Italian at high level so at least that opens doors for me but I was wondering how it is to study Clinical Psych as an international considering this requirement. I heard it's really hard to find an internship.

I also know that to become a Healthcare psychologist (Gezondheidszorgpsycholoog/ gz-psycholoog) or Clinical Psychologist you have to do two or four years of extra training in Dutch. I got to level B1 and I'm pretty good with languages so I think I'd be okay if i'd still have two years to study the language well. I just don't have much of an idea about how it is in practice.

Just very curious about what your experience has been as an international or Dutchie in clinical psych/this career path and I thank you so much for any response!

Take care :)"

* As a result of the above, I have two good letters of recommendation.
* No internship experience, most likely due to the sub-3.0 GPA.

I am already working as an intern as a front-end developer but I am making so much mistakes that I feel like the senior developer is sick of even reviewing my code. I don't know what to do, I am stuck. Should I continue in this field or should I leave it(again, like I do in everything). Should I go for Economics or should I go for CS for academics. Or should I altogether find another career for me? I have been dealing with these questions for a year and now I am sick of them. I just want a clear direction, how do i get that? I am suffering from OCD btw but I think this has little to do with my situation.
Your advices will mean a lot for me. Thanks."
n1inkf,7,2021-04-29,How to prepare for COMP 352,kwish_,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/n1inkf/how_to_prepare_for_comp_352/,"Sadly due to my sequence, I have no choice but to take comp 352 during summer 1.

A lot of students have told me that it is an important class and to avoid taking it during the summer if possible (Professor Hanna who is like a god in the cs department has said the same) but I can't take 352 in the winter (I have an internship in fall) without messing my whole sequence up since 352 is a prereq for most of my future courses. 

So I'm wondering, how can I become a pro at data structures and algorithms by studying by myself? The teacher that I have lined up for this summer (Jababo) has meh reviews on rate my professor so I don't feel like ill learn to the full ability of this course this summer semester, especially with a shitty prof on a fast-paced sequence.

Any suggestions of videos, textbooks, youtube channels or even an online class (willing to pay for it atp) that could help? I know a lot of CS is based on this course and I don't want to lose out because of a shitty summer sequence."

I’m a high school senior, and I have two more days to pick a college but I am still having trouble deciding where I should go. I’m planning to major in CS and minor in mathematics or econ if I can. I am interested in working at quant (quant trader) but also interested in becoming an analyst of some sort if things doesn’t go to plan. So, I am deciding between the four: UC Berkeley, UCLA, USC, and UCSD. 


**Pros for Berkeley**

• More opportunities are available 

• Nextdoor to SF 

• Higher rankings 

• I live in the Bay Area, so I can come back home anytime

**Cons for Berkeley:**

• Campus isn’t as nice as the rest

• More stressful environment


**Pros for UCLA:**

• Better college experience overall

• Love the area and architecture

• One of the best dining halls in the country

• New environment 

 

**Cons for UCLA:**

• I’ve read some bad things about UCLA’s finance recruiting. However, I’m not planning to move out of state and try to work at Wall Street, so this con might be irrelevant

• Got in as a Math of Computation major. You take some CS courses, but not as many as a CS major would, and it’s also more math oriented. I’ve read that it’s equal to a CS major, but I’m not sure if it’s biased since I’ve read it from the UCLA subreddit. I’ve also heard that some jobs and internships require a CS degree, so that’ll put me in a disadvantage


**Pros for USC**

• Strong alumni

• New environment

• Smaller class sizes


**Con for USC**

• 5K more expensive per year than UCs

• Reputation has tarnished a bit due to the admission scandal and the gynecologist sexual abuse

• Rumors of snobby rich kids


**Pros for UCSD:**

• Recieved the chancellor’s scholarship which is $10k per year and priority enrollment


**Cons for UCSD:**

• I also didn’t get the CS major. They have a lottery system to switch, which is like around 20%.

• Too far away


What would you rank between the 4 and why? So far, my top are UCLA and Berkeley. Really stressed out that I still haven’t made my decision yet. If you could also give me advice, that’ll be great too! Thanks in advance!

1. How difficult is it to transfer to an engineering major like mechanical or aerospace engineering? I know the school of engineering is separate from ICS. To be clear, I do want to major in CS but in case my interests change, I'd like a doable transfer process. Is it easier to transfer to engineering here than if I went to UCSD for Econ?
2. How difficult is it to get CS internships here? I've heard mixed things on this topic.

I might retake that course over the summer (it's Basic Real Analysis). I got an A in Probability, A- in Theory of Computation, B in Linear Algebra,  B+ in Ordinary Differential Equations, I might get an A in Cryptography which is a CS course but very proof heavy. This semester I might be taking Combinatorics for credit, I just haven't done well. Advanced Linear Algebra, I might can get into B territory depending on how the remaining assignments and exam goes. I've not done well in Survey of Algebra so far, so I may take it for credit too. I'm definitely taking statistics over the summer, hopefully can land an A. I just feel like I've totally screwed myself. I do cut myself some slack because the pandemic has not been a great experience for me academically, I've dealt with some mental health stuff + struggled w/ logistics of remote learning some. I just know I need to be responsible and do well so my apps look good.

Other important info: I'm a double major. I've done decently well in my CS classes, I think a B+ is a normal grade for me which I know isn't perfect. I have gotten A's/A-'s. I am interested in researching at the intersection of the fields, hopefully in a mathematics department. I care more about who my advisor is, how the program is structured, etc. than I care about any specific school (other than for funding and networking purposes, I guess.) 

I'm also a physics minor, but my physics grades weren't great. Like, C+ type not great.

btw please don't judge me I am a first gen student who kinda goofed in navigating all my overlapping interests :') def kind of regret overloading myself w/ stem courses the past year, but really wanted exposure to different topics + to get reqs out of the way. I do have some other stuff to make myself more competitive on apps, mainly an REU, current research w/ a professor at my home university, a software engineering internship... fingers crossed I can do well on the GRE. Backup plan is a master's program before a PhD one."

I (21F) will be graduating from college next Spring in 2022 in operations and supply chain management, with a minor in management. 

I have always been great in my jobs once I find them but struggle to get hired. It is typical for students in my degree at my university to find a job in the winter before graduation and have a position lined up to start at right after graduating. This is the typical path for students and I am worried I will miss out on my shot to get hired as a new grad If I am waiting until July to start applying after this trip. My connections at my university will likely no longer be available to me and there will be fewer referrals and job postings being sent my way. I have an internship lined up this Summer but it is unlikely it will turn into a position I would want to work in full time or would even get an offer to return post-graduation so I would be starting from scratch in my post-graduation job hunt.

The trip I am thinking of going on is a 60 day around the world tour to 11 countries. It will be with other people about my age with flights/hotels/activities all planned out. I would go on this by myself, but I have done a solo trip abroad (no program) and have been a relatively frequent traveler in the past so that aspect I'm not too worried about. It seems like a trip I wouldn't have the opportunity to go on again in my life. It is expensive, and the money itself would be somewhat of a stretch but I could reasonably make it work as long as I am able to have a full-time job relatively soon after returning.

However, I am stressed about how taking off months straight after graduation will impact my work prospects. Especially since I feel I struggle with job placements (I'm a bad interviewer, but trying to improve!) I worry about completely forgoing the typical recruitment and hiring most companies do for new grads in my area. Would taking off the time reflect poorly on me as a potential candidate? I want to find a job and career I love but am hesitant to take off so much time and potentially miss out on a great opportunity.

I may lose any flexibility I have in savings that would be carrying me over until I start to make real money as I took my time searching for a good fit. I don't want to be stuck in a role I hate because I haven't been working 3-4 months straight, struggle to find jobs in general, and just want to accept the first offer that comes my way, especially since I have struggled to get offers my entire work history? 

I honestly do not know what I should do or want to do and am really just looking for your opinion and insight since I don't have anyone in a traditional career I could talk to. 

&amp;#x200B;

TDLR: Do I follow typical recruiting patterns for my major when graduating and take my time to find a job that I love and is a great fit, or do I go on a dream vacation for 2 months and potentially miss out on hiring cycles and end up in a role I don't love just because it was available and I was offered a position?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Didn't read any of them but if I had to guess they would all probably be somewhere between 7-10/10 because I was really close with all four of my teacher recommenders as well as my counselor.

**Interviews**

Harvard: Very nice conversation, got along well with the interviewer, and talked for about an hour. She said she thought I seemed more emotionally mature than most Harvard kids (lol). I think I asked really good questions tbh. 9/10.

Columbia: Pretty much the same as Harvard, a little bit shorter. Good conversation talked about advice etc. 9/10.

Wesleyan: Student interviewer which somehow felt more formal/rigid? Went really well though- I feel like younger people are a bit easier to read in terms of how you are doing so I think this one I could accurately place as 10/10.

**Portfolio**

I added this section because I think my portfolio had a big effect on my outcomes. I put both my fine arts and film work. My portfolio was a little kooky and not your basic still lives/drawings which I think made it stand out. It was also very conceptually strong (I included background for most pieces...). I did a portfolio review with Michigan before applying and they loved it; RISD reached out to say they especially liked my portfolio. Several schools emailed me/wrote me notes about how much they liked my portfolio after I was accepted. I was always insecure in my artistic merit so this was honestly really validating and cool. 10/10.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: I went through a few ideas before I landed on my final one. I tend to be pretty hard on myself, but I think this was actually really good. I only had my counselor read it, she said it was terrific. I'm generally a pretty good writer (wouldn't know from this post lol) and I was really able to inject my voice into it and give it a lot of personality. I also got notes from a couple of officers about how much they liked it. 9.5/10.

Supplements: a lot of copy-paste-adjust, varied from school to school. I think the sort of base ones were pretty good though. The weakest ones were probably Columbia, Vassar, Bard, Harvard (I literally used an old English assignment oops— though to be fair it was a pretty fire one). 6.5-9.5/10.

*Rejections:*

* none heheheh

**Additional Information:**

**Reflection:** I think the key to my success (other than socioeconomic privilege tbh) was that I worked really hard on figuring out where I wanted to apply so all the schools I applied to were really good fits which I think came through in my applications. Also, I think being very strong academically and being very strong artistically is an appealing combo to schools, especially if you are able to connect those strengths in your ""story."""
n1lnd5,7,2021-04-29,Having a bad internship experience,Latte_boy_22,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n1lnd5/having_a_bad_internship_experience/,"I'm currently a 3rd year college student. I'm studying electrical and electronic engineering, however, recently I learned that I am not interested in hardware and instead would prefer a career in CS related fields such as software engineering, data science, data engineering, etc. My university requires me to pursue a credit bearing internship for one semester, and so for this internship I chose to do a Data Engineering internship at a start-up abroad. I got the internship through a program in my university that matches students to start-ups in foreign countries. Normally, this gives the student a chance to travel to said country and experience start-up culture there, but due to the pandemic, the program was made remote for roles like mine which can easily be done online. 

So, I started my internship, and since the beginning I had many issues with the way my internship was being handled. A few important things to note before I start talking about my problems:

1. Where I'm currently based and where the company is based, have a huge time difference (not mentioning countries to maintain anonimity). The time difference is 15 hours, which means even if I wake up at 6am in the morning, I only get 2 hours working in common with the rest of the company. (8am for me is 5pm on the previous day for them)
2. The company is an engineering/science company first, and I am working as part of a very small data team (1 supervisor and 4 interns including me).
3. This is my very first internship, and my experience until now has been limited to a few extra CS classes I took in university, along with some online courses and a one casual hackathon with my friends.

Since day one, I felt very isolated from the rest of the company. My supervisor didn't even contact me before my first day to discuss how I will start, what I will work on etc. I had a brief call with HR, and they also seemed surprised that I didn't have a plan or anything to work on. Not only did I not get contacted, I was asked by HR to contact my supervisor and set up a call. 

My first couple of weeks were okay. I set up things on my computer, read up on suggested things, and worked on a couple of small features for one of the company's repositories. My supervisor arranged for one call a week (which seemed a little less to me since we have literally no face time, but I just went with it since I assumed that's how it is).  During these first few weeks, I would message my supervisor at the end of each day telling them about what I have done, and asking any questions I had, or what to do next. At the end of the week, we would have the weekly call and discuss the week's work. Things went on like this for the first month or so, but then my supervisor messaged me one day saying he doesn't have the time to be messaging me and helping me everyday. This also seemed a little odd to me because for the majority of his working day, I would be sleeping anyway, and it would only be the last couple of hours of his working day that I would message him. But anyway, I went with it. We had a call to discuss this, and he told me that he would try and give me the whole week's work during our weekly call, and we would only touch base the following week, unless I had some small questions here and there. Things got rocky from this point on. I would rarely get replies to my messages, even though they had the whole day to reply. It's not even like they would message saying ""Hi, I'm busy today, please hold on, I will get back to you soon."", they would straight up ghost me. Aside from this work was going pretty bad too. I had never worked on a big repository like this before, and there was a lot I didn't understand. I would get very vague instructions, only a couple of sentences on what I'm supposed to do, which lead to a lot of confusion for me. Since I couldn't get help right away, this would delay my work further. I was working on this small task on the side, but I didn't get clear instructions on what I was supposed to do and so whatever I would try on my own would always be wrong. Finally my supervisor messaged me taking me off the task and telling me that he has seen very little productive output from me since I started.  I explained to him that it would be helpful for me if he could provide explicit and detailed messages about what I'm supposed to do, since I would often not know what I'm supposed to do. He agreed, and things were okay-ish for the next couple of weeks. He would give me steps to follow to complete my task, and I would do them to the best of my ability. I started a new project where I was working on an internal tool for one of the engineering teams. However, things went downhill once again. I started working on a new task, related to code, libraries and concepts I didn't know anything about. Because of this I kept running into issues, and did not get timely help. This again lead to a huge dip in productivity because I would often get stuck and not know how to proceed. My supervisor told me that he expected me to have basic debugging skills and was surprised at how little I knew. Although I do have basic debugging skills, on further introspection, I think my issue lies in the fact that I find it difficult to do so in a codebase I understand so little of. Anyway, all of this ended horribly in a really bad call I had, where my supervisor told me I've been doing almost no work and haven't been completing my tasks. He asked me if I was doing some other work instead of company work, or what the issue was. The call ended with him saying he needs time to think about what to do with me since he doesn't know what work to assign to me. He told me we'd call again next week, and he expects me to talk to him about what my problems are and how I can do better for my last month of the internship.

Overall this has been a very stressful and unpleasant experience for me. I wanted to know what other professionals in the industry think of my situation and how I can handle it better to make my last month better than before. A few specific questions:

1. Is it normal for tech industry supervisors to have such little face time with interns/lower level employees?
2. Is there something specific I can do to improve my workflow?
3. Am I in the wrong here? Is this how things work in the industry, and am I required to tough it out and figure things out or accept that I am not fit to work in this industry? Since this is my first internship, I had many hopes and expectations. I expected to be guided and to learn things, but instead I am constantly overwhelmed and confused, with no help from anyone."

Before I start, this is tough to type out because I never thought this would ever be me, but here am I. My whole life I have known people that have committed suicide but never would I ever think that I would. 

I am currently a freshman in college and I am a transfer. I transferred from a small school where everyone knew me and I knew everyone. I had a very active social life, got along with everyone, and overall was the greatest semester of my life. I had great roommates, a girlfriend, a good-paying job, and a great and loyal friend group. 

However, then I transferred to a bigger state university and I was very nervous, however, I made friends with my neighbors and I thought I had made friends. I didn't have a roommate, but I thought that was going to be a plus. Before I had gotten here, my girlfriend had broken up with me and I thought I was going to have the time of my life. I was wrong

Jump to recent months, and I have never felt more lonely ever in my life. I am a very social person, so being in a room by myself is a prison. My neighbors that I thought could call my friends, do things without me all the time and ignore me when I go into their rooms. They always say ""we are your roommates"" and ""if you ever need someone, we are here"" but when I have they always ignore me. They know I don't have a roommate and that I am constantly alone. I try to relate to them but I can't because we are simply so different. My mom and I more or less fell without contact and overall I have a very toxic home life. I have lost 2 internships. 2 girls that I had a thing with fell through, I don't feel like I have any true friends. Sure I go out on the weekends and get drunk, but they are just distractions. My only true friend from back home had just gone to boot camp.  I had enough one night and I decided that April 4th was going to be the day I that I died. 

At around 10 pm, I went downtown to the river and starred and began to cry, knowing what I was going to do. I didn't write a suicide note: I never felt like I had to explain anything because of those who were truly close to me. I then began to walk to the bridge where I was going to jump. Along with me, I had strapped a backpack with me, that was full of personal belongings and rocks. I got very drunk and brought enough alcohol to get me fucked, and I prepared. I knew nobody was going to miss me when I went out, what purpose did I have.

But, I reached the top of the bridge where the arc was the greatest, and I stopped because I couldn't keep going, I realized I was too much of a pussy to do it. I was too much of a coward. I wanted to die, I wanted it more than anything. But I never did it. I stopped, walked back to campus, and cried myself to bed. I still don't know why I didn't do it, I just couldn't. I don't have much to live for except I guess keeping my own existence alive. That's it. 

I have't opened up to anyone about, not a single soul. I am planning to tell a freind that I have that more or less knows about this. But I don't trust anyone. I am nervous of what they will think. I am always happy and outgoing, but I put that on so that people will think I am fine. I have reached out for help, but I can't afford the therapy session, so then here I am. 

Thats all I wanted to say. I don't know what to do. I am only here for 2 more weeks in college and then I go back home, where all I do is work for 10 hours, go home to a mother who constantly berates me, no freinds, no fun, only video games, and rinse and repeat."

1. What year of college do CS students typically get internships?

2. What are the best ways to build up a CS internship resumé if you have no coding/programming experience besides very basic stuff? What groups/clubs should I join as a freshman to build up this part of the resumé?

3. What path should I take if I want to get a summer internship? (when should I apply, what classes should I try to complete, any suggestions for companies, how to prepare for interviews, etc.?)

I’m kind of worried since I’ve heard that UCI is one of those schools where there are lots of companies/potential opportunities in the area, but going to UCI doesn’t give any sort of advantage the same way going to a higher ranked UC or another mid-UC does for internships. I know that the university I attend hardly affects my ability to get an internship, but I have heard from people and a few friends that it is not as difficult to get a CS internship if you attend UCSB or UCSD. 

Any advice?"

**Market Axess**

*Pros*

\+ Leading company for bond trading software

\+ £32k (pro-rata) intern salary (I am unsure about grad salary so if anyone has information regarding this, would be great to know but Glassdoor shows £75k+ and is recently updated but I don't know how true this is)

\- Shorter internship (8 weeks vs 10 weeks)

\- Harder to progress to other companies?

**Thought Machine**

*Pros*

\+ More modern technology stack so should help employability in future and is more fintech like than MA (a more technology driven finance company)

\+ Has a proper engineering culture and is probably more known than MA

\+ Known grad salary (\~£60k) which is decent

\+ Attracts good talent from top UK Universities

1. I decided to be a teacher from a very young age and never explored other options. I have paid off all my student loans and have almost 10k in the bank. I am young enough to still get on my parents insurance, so this seems like the best time to explore.
2. My position is at risk. I teach one of the only non-mandated classes at my very small, poor, rural district. We have severe financial woes and are attempting to merge with another school. 
3. The position is ROUGH. I teach band to 8 different grade levels on top of two general music classes. I love my students, and while we've grown attached to each other, I feel like an empty cup emotionally. I feel like I have nothing left to give but they need so much more attention and emotional connection. Behaviorally, they are awful. They are so rude and often cruel to each other, as well as me. The parents are about the same. I am just so tired.
4. I have an internship opportunity in a potential new career field that would require me to take off a year anyways. I am so excited about this opportunity.

When I think about leaving teaching and this position, it feels like there is a weight lifted off my chest and a light at the end of the tunnel. There is also a huge amount of guilt. My superintendent made a comment that they wouldn't fill my position if I left. That means 100s of kids wouldn't get the opportunity to participate in a subject they love anymore because of me. Yesterday when I was leaving, the financial supervisor told me to ""Keep up the great work"" and that ""They needed me"" at the district. I thanked her, and she repeated herself. Also, I will be the 3rd band teacher to leave in the past 4 years. 

I feel terrible. But I also am so emotionally drained from this all. Any tips for not letting the guilt of leaving eat you alive?

TL;DR: I want to leave my position and possibly teaching as a whole, but feel a huge amount of guilt. any tips?"

He is a guy in his 40s with an MA in a humanities subject and additionally talented in art and as a cook.    
He is a very smart person who has an issue about not really having worked in his life, despite wanting to and looking for it.  

He basically has a history of depression/some trauma and  huge chip in his shoulder from the time he was studying - his family was pushing him to get a job, and he did not know how, and this somehow stuck for years.

 He did freelance jobs as a teacher,  editor and some internships, but overall he never settled on a path, and because of that he spends a lot of time researching/ looking for work and not really getting any results. In addition he has a child and is currently a stay at home dad, but he will have to find a job soon. Hi partner has a good job, but I am guessing nobody would want to be in a situation that they are indefinitely. 

He  always has stories of being ""on it"" and he got interviews for  some jobs - but for example a chef position he interviewed him rejected him because he has a family and early morning shifts would not be right. 

He received an inheritance a few years ago, so this is how he was able to scrape by for a few years... 

I am feeling bad for him, because he does want to change, but does not seem to know how to, and I think this situation has hugely impacted his self esteem, so it is a full-filling prophecy. 

His current plan is to find a vacancy that is obscure enough that his skills match it entirely, and write a great application. 

I was encouraging him to 

\- apply for a phd (he would be great teaching academically)

\- set up a website for his art-related skills (he got an art commission a while ago, and he could definitely sell his work)

\- try sourcing various freelance jobs (I got him in touch with someone who is a private tutor)

\- try making at least a little bit of money from crypto currency 

\- ditch the whole idea of ""getting a job"", because it might not be possible anymore, and concentrate on  doing what he is good at, and set up a business/ service that way. (which he would be good at). 

I don't know what else I can do - he was in therapy, but it did not get him far on the job front. 

I don't want to get overinvolved, but I want to offer something that could lead to him getting out of the situation. He overthinks and is isolated a bit and it leads to confusion/ ineffective strategies I think."

Now, this morning I got contacted by an EY recruiter in my first choice city where all my family lives. They said they are basically able to give me the job because I interviewed last fall, but they had few openings then. 

I know all big 4 are pretty much the same and I have basically zero connections at PwC.

I'm 25 and graduated from the University of Washington (I live in Seattle) Spring of 2020 with a BA in business admin w/ a focus in management and it has been brutal trying to find employment. 

Since 2013 I had a goal outlined where I would graduate from HS, attend community college to get an AA degree, then transfer to UW where I would finish my BA. My plan was to work full time while attending college part time so I could pay my way and graduate debt free. And after 7 years I finally became the first member of my family to graduate- and debt free none-the-less! 

Ever since graduating though, I've felt completely lost. The small business I worked for full time through college meant I couldn't intern anywhere or join any clubs, and so I lost out on all of the networking opportunities that my peers gained. I thought that showing my dedication to a single employer all through my college years would look good on a resume but now it feels like I shot myself in the foot as I have been having such a tough time finding employment. 

I grew up pretty poor. Both my parents work for a school- my mother works at the before school daycare and my father is a grounds keeper, I love them a ton, but they have never been tech savvy. They are both in their 40s and still have never owned a computer of any kind as they always thought that computer stuff was too confusing and complicated. Because of this, I grew up with the idea that learning programming or ""learning computers"" was just ""too hard"" and even now if I look at a page of code I feel my blood pressure rise as it looks daunting and confusing. So I majored in business since I have always been a very good leader and people person. 

However, living in Seattle and not having a tech background basically rules me out of 50% of the available jobs. I have been trying to learn Python on my own, and while I only just started (I can make loops now woohoo!) I'm wondering if this could be a career path. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*TLDR\*

Since graduating I've felt like I'm lost in the woods, but I'm starting to see a path where I become a programmer for a while then utilize my BA in biz management to become a program manager. Seattle has a coding boot camp called Coding Dojo that seems to be a pretty solid choice. I would have to take out a loan for it, but as I have no debt from college I think I could swing it okay. 

My unemployment runs out in September, and the Coding Dojo would be finished in August, my unemployment ALMOST covers the cost of rent and I have a little money saved up so I think I could survive the 3 months while attending the boot camp. My main question is, come August will I just be in the same position I am today? Will the Coding Dojo (and my learning on my own) be enough for a starting position in Software Development?

I would love any advice that anyone has to offer. Thank you."

UMD is one of my top 2 choices right now, the other being UBC.

* Is it easy for undergraduates to participate in research? Do the CS professors care about YOUR academic experience? Is it easy to approach them/ get involved in their research? Is the collective CS faculty with all the TAs and Professors, overall good and do they care about the undergraduate students?
* I’ve heard a lot about the Brendon Iribe Centre for its labs, research facilities, and maker spaces. Is it accessible by the undergrads or is it mostly just reserved for post grad students/researchers/other important people?
* How often do students get paid internships/co-ops or even unpaid internships?
* What would you estimate to be an average salary for CS graduates right after graduation? \[I know that there is an enormous no. of CS majors and it’s difficult to know but your estimates matter to me\]
* Which companies recruit the most UMD CS graduates?

I just had a question to anyone who has done or is doing their engineering coop. I was just curious as to how your lifestyle changed while in coop, by that I mean: 

Did you have more free time compared to when you were at school?

Did you have trouble adjusting to your 9-5 schedule?

Lastly I would like to ask for advice on making the best of my coop. I'm specially nervous as most of the people I will be working with are on the old side, and the company I am working with mentioned that there are only a few engineer interns this year. 

As a young intern, did you have any trouble relating to older co-workers? If you did do you have any advice?

Thank you!!"

I landed a job at Microsoft as a contractor and things don't seem like they're going great... I know it's a great company and resume booster, but I feel lost I really want to help the team more, but it feels like no one is interested in showing me how to do things or get things done. I'm really nervous one day someone is just gonna wonder why I can't seem to do anything and I'm gonna be axed for not knowing anything. This whole thing is just made worse by the pandemic and remote work making it feel like when I really need help I'm waiting 4 hours or so for someone to give a half response to my question or not even answer it at all. I'm hoping there may be someone out there with career experience that can tell me if I should stay or head for a company that is willing to teach me now versus later in my career when I'm actually expected to know things but haven't. Thanks so much for any responses or insights anyone has!"

My factors for choosing are a bit skewed since internship opportunities rank pretty high up on my list of priorities. Hope you can give  help me with a personalized response. 

Factors I'm looking at (in order of importance): 
1) Internship Opportunities (since my 3 options are not anywhere near London, it'll be harder to find hiring companies)
2) Prestige
3) Academic Quality and Faculty
4) Ease of launching a start-up (I'm planning to run a start-up through college)
5) Costs (Money is obviously important to me)
6) Research work (to be able to work with professors of the uni, companies in the area, etc) 
7) Location (the livelier the city the better also warmer weather is preferred but cold climate is a deal-breaker)

What would your choice be? Help me decide."

n24pu1,29,2021-04-30,Got my first job in IT. I've been working to transition out of the restaurant industry over the last 8 months and now it's time!!,retnuh45,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/n24pu1/got_my_first_job_in_it_ive_been_working_to/,"As the title states, I got offered my first IT job.  It's a helpdesk plus job. It seemed from the description that they expect more than just the regular helpdesk. 20k increase over what I usually make yearly serving tables. It's with a big international company that has it's hand in defense contracts, aerospace, space and transport industries.  I'm looking forwards to having some upwards mobility once I get my foot in the door. I'm looking at this job as a stepping stone. I'd like to be a network engineer in a few years.

Before August of 2020, I had zero IT experience. I've always enjoyed video games and computers, but I was never one to take them apart and see how they work. When the pandemic hit, it gave me a lot of time to reflect on what I wanted. I've been ready to move on from serving tables for a long time, but family responsibilities (aka wife and 3 year old identical twin daughters and a 5 year old daughter) among other things made it super difficult. Then the pandemic hit and I was on unemployment with nothing to do. I found this internship with a company called Acuitus that seemed very interesting and decided to give it a shot. Now many people will tell you there are free materials online and you can do it all yourself, and you can, but I needed a little structure. The program was quite intense and I learned a lot. The goal of the program was to graduate interns with the necessary skills and knowledge to be sysadmins. It has only been available to the civilian population for a year now, so it isn't really well known, but I would highly recommend it. 

It has been difficult getting interviews at first as Acuitus isn't a recognized name in the industry yet. I really wanted to get my foot in the door somewhere that fit the basic metrics of what I was looking for.  This new helpdesk job is only a 15 minute commute, I got good vibes from the interview panel and the starting pay was exactly what I was hoping for as I break into the industry. That's why I decided to go for the helpdesk first, just to get in the industry while I continue to study for a few certs over the next two years. I'm currently studying for my CCNA which is scheduled for May 16th. I start the new job on May 17th and look forward to hitting the ground running.

At the interview, I felt they could see I had a decent background on the technical skills side, but I really played up the soft skills I've developed with over 12 years serving tables and interacting with customers. 

Cliche, as everyone seems to say this, but if I can do it, anyone can. If you have any questions about the process and/or the internship that helped get me started, please reach out. Good luck to everyone out there still looking!"

Plus, I really do have fun making meaningful projects and learning new things. 

So for every day of summer, I want progress from doing at least 3 LC easies, to 1 LC hard a day. I also want to practice my behavioral interview skills every day. For the first month of summer, I have decided I want to learn the MERN stack to build my personal portfolio along with some webapps. 

That leaves me with three months remaining to learn so many new things. What technologies/avenues do y'all suggest I explore, which are fun + will make me competitive?

For context: I love data science, and would ideally want to go down the data science route. I have done intro CS classes, and have a decent grasp of Python and C++."

n25czb,2,2021-04-30,what environmental job can i do with my current skills? 23 and love the ocean,cheloniagal,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/n25czb/what_environmental_job_can_i_do_with_my_current/,"hi - just wanted to post here because i’m feeling really overwhelmed this evening.

to give a short summary - i have a first class degree in english with creative writing from the university of nottingham, and an mphil in medieval studies from the university of cambridge. i also have just finished a law conversion course (equivalent to LLB)

i also have lots of experience in conservation and science communications- ive worked for prominent environmental and publishing organisations in bermuda, where i’m from.

i feel like i have strong skills and a strong background, even if it’s eclectic, but i just keep hitting walls wherever i turn and i don’t know what to do. everything feels hopeless atm.

i have realised that my love for the ocean is overwhelming, and i want to have a career related to the environment/conservation. i applied for a phd in zoology this year and got interviewed but didnt get in - understandable, as i dont even have a science degree. i realised that maybe the better path for me would be to use the skills i already have - maybe i should study something like ‘conservation management’ where there is no science prerequisite, but maybe i could get an environmental consulting job after

right now i am looking in to jobs in either - science communications (which i have experience in), environmental policy (which i think i’d have to be a qualified lawyer to do), or environmental consulting (which i think i need a science or conservation management degree for). 

i just want to find a way to do a job that’s fulfilling and financially sound - hopefully without continuing to study law. i hated the law conversion course when i did it, but when i panic sometimes the law thing seems like the best option. then again - i have been rejected for training contracts and internships related to law, probably because they can tell im not very in to it, which makes me feel nervous - like it will never work out

i fear that if i tried to do environmental consulting i would just be outcompeted by people who have science degrees. same for science communications. 

i could apply for a zoology or marine biology or ecology programme - but i dont want to start from undergrad level again. i feel like ive wasted so much time. i would probably be able to get in to a masters for zoology

but maybe a masters in conservation management sounds good - i would be guaranteed a place because there are no pre requisites - but im worried that there will be no jobs even from that - that i’ll still be outcompeted by those with a science degree

then again - could i work on environmental policy without being a qualified lawyer? maybe i could be someone who does research and recommends policy changes?

ideally, i would like to do something with the qualifications i have now - but i just dont know what that thing is

please, if you can think of anything that someone with my skills would be suited for - or if you do have a career in sci comm or environmental policy, please let me know. im feeling so lost at the moment and would appreciate any thoughts. sorry for the rambly post!"
n25j7s,5,2021-04-30,I’m afraid my doctor is going to cut me off Vyvanse,throwawayvyvansepres,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/n25j7s/im_afraid_my_doctor_is_going_to_cut_me_off_vyvanse/,"I live in Canada and began taking Vyvanse nearly 3 years ago. I started off with 30 mg dosage and then after a year, upped to 50 mg.

I was stable on 50 mg for the most part over the course of the next year and a  half. I tried to incorporate frequent off-days (every other day), even during classes. Those days were fairly unproductive and I’d have trouble staying on task. Closer to exams, I’d begin taking them every day. 

But regardless, I would always have 5-10 pills to spare by the end of the month. 

This past year, however, I began doing a second degree after I didn’t get into medical school. The past few semesters I began to take Vyvanse pretty much everyday, with an off day maybe once every two weeks.

This semester was the busiest, however, and I quite literally took Vyvanse every day. No breaks. Here is a run down on my refills this semester:

30 pill refill —&amp;gt; then called for refill after 40 days 

30 pill refill —&amp;gt; then called for refill after 28 days 

30 day refill —&amp;gt; then called for refill after 25 days (but came in to get it after 28 days)

In the last refill, I got my prescription, but there was a note written that my doctor wants to see me again for my next refill.

Now I’m freaking out as I’m afraid he is going to cut me off. This last two months, there’d be days where I’d be taking an extra half of a pill in the afternoons because the morning dose began to loose affect by then. I know this is irresponsible but the pill is loosing affect. I know some people take IR boosts but I have no idea how to go about this without my doctor questioning my intention. 

I am once again 4 days behind my script. I just finished my exams but still have this huge semestriel project, and my spring courses begin early next week. I still haven’t even gotten an internship and have to keep applying for that too.

I’m trying to force myself to finish everything else without Vyvanse these last few days but I simply can’t. And I also have no idea how I will face my doctor next week because if he refuses to sign another refill, I almost certainly know I will crash and fail everything. I can’t take time off to reduce my tolerance. This is already a second degree and my parents have also become significantly poorer since last year. I quite literally have to either find an internship or continue cramming. 

So now I’m fucked :/"

This is going to be my first industry-oriented internship and could you please suggest which one to choose, keeping in mind for future job opportunities and resume building -

1. **Computer Vision -** It is an object detection task used for analyzing video footage. In the end, we will also have to build a visualization app (most probably a web app) and notification application (Ex- A warning message when someone does not follow covid precaution)
2. **NLP -** It could include any of these three will be given to us-

* It is to survey &amp; develop Transformer models for classification. 
* Conversation AI and chatbot application

3.  **GAN -** Im not really interested in this project as I already have a GAN project on my resume for improving   
the resolution of an image.  


&amp;#x200B;

Could you suggest which one to choose for better future opportunities?? I have worked on self-projects in Computer Vision and NLP, but I'm a little new to application deployment (DJANGO/ FLASK). I want to break into Data Science or Deep Learning industry, it would be really helpful if you could suggest which one to choose for better future opportunities?  


Are having projects in Computer Vision more valuable than NLP or vice-versa? Should I keep a balance in my resume for NLP, CV, RL, etc projects? 

Thanks in Advance :)"

I've got my own ""agency"" if you'd even call it that... where I'm trying to establish a brand building domains and websites for companies and businesses and increase their sales and revenue with my knowledge of Google Analytics and Adwords experience...   
Currently, I'm having absolutely ZERO / zilch / nada luck or results... and it's a daily every single day task / job that I spend hours on the computer hustling and bustling trying to scrape up whatever I can to get from anyone...  


Which leads me into my next question...  
It's seriously starting to affect my life and my relationship with my girlfriend...   
All I've ever done professsionally ""work wise"" was .... this type of work for ONLY my Dad's business exclusively... We recently decided to part ways from each other and I thought instantly that I would have NO problem setting out on my own and getting going with clients left and right signing up to have me manage accounts, and monitor their social media, do their adverts, CREATE adverts ... (I have the entire Adobe Creative Suite installed... and 8+ years experience working with it... Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects (video editing software)...) but alas... I'm about to the point of running out of steam.... and I'm starting to think this isn't the right path I should have taken...  


Is there \*ANYONE\* and I mean \*ANYONE\* out there, who would be willing to take me on, PLEASE? I'm begging of you... just take me on as almost to the point of an internship level position, I'm begging you. I just need a few dollars a day to be able to get by with potential for growth based on results...   
I'm a hard worker, not looking to ""get rich"" off anyone... and I just want something steady and ready to stay working and make my girlfriend proud and put food on our table.
