I have clinical depression (since 2001), and chronic fatigue syndrome (since 2006)

A senior specialist in the area which I plan to specialise is on my mind a lot. He is a grade A twat. I have a position to specialise in a different hospital in another part of the country but whilst I'm still here I have to deal with him. 
He is extremely intelligent but socially awkward and not very popular. He is known for being difficult and many people avoid him. 
I shouldn't have to deal with him much for the remainder of the internship but he is still on my mind and I'm in a state of constant inner turmoil. 

When discussing a patient he will make things difficult and ask challenging questions and focus on minute details that don't matter. After arguing with my recommendations and treatment plans and making me feel like something he found on his shoe he will mumble that my plan is fine (and yet he spent so long making me feel like a fool). If I talk to him about something and he disagrees with it I will try and explain my thoughts by saying 'I read...' and he will interrupt quickly with 'I don't care what you've read' and not give me a chance. 
Despite knowing that I have a position to specialise in my chosen field he will belittle me when discussing a case by saying 'well I wouldn't expect just an intern to know that' or make similar comments over and over making me feel as though he has no faith in me. 
I dread seeing him in the hallways and when I was working with him in his department I would hate the thought of going in to work. 

Even now, in bed when I should be relaxing I'm thinking of the negativity he makes me feel. I'm usually a joyful, pleasant person but he sucks it out of me. 

My fellow interns understand my feelings but as they have no interest in his field of study his mannerisms don't bother them much. 

I'm not sure what is going on. Is this just me? Is he a bully? 

How can I ignore it and not let him bother me? 

I really really want to stand up to him but I can't. I feel like a pathetic, weak child at school in front of a monstrous bully who overshadows me and I say nothing :(

I also worrying about saying something as the specialist world in veterinary medicine is a small one.

I have been following the freecodecamp track, im 2 projects away from completing the front end portion.

I have started to look for employment now and have been for about two weeks for front-end developer, junior level position or even an internship i just want to get that experience and my foot in the door. Good news is, i have landed a first stage interview with a company in toronto on monday. I am not sure what to expect to come of it but i will keep grinding, working on projects, bettering myself to get the job i want. So to my question. With everything i have already done and that shows in my portfolio and in GitHub (i just start contributing to an open source project thats a chrome app). Is there anything in there that you would see as a employer and say ""we do not want that guy"" or does the work i have done show that i would be ready for a entree level job? Is there anything i could do better? do you see something that is really poor that i could improve on? Should I just work at improving what i have already or keep making new projects and adding to the list? I myself feel that i am ready for a junior level position. i have the ambition to learn more not just to get a job but to just be better at what i love to do and thats to create web things.

I have some questions about possibly transferring to CompSci.

So I am currently a sophomore and I go to Behrend right now with a 2.65 GPA.  This semester was my ETM pool semester and I got put into EE.  My first and second choices for my major were CompSci and CompEng, but they both had a 3.0 GPA requirement which meant I got put into my last choice which was EE.

The 2017 ETM pool (next spring) has a 2.60 GPA cutoff for CompSci.  Can I somehow try to enter that major through the ETM process again?

Or do I need to try and do a change of major request and get tight with the CompSci faculty?

I know for a fact that I am comfortable with CompSci and programming is something I enjoy doing every day.  I have a portfolio of projects that I have worked on and a github account with a few projects that I have worked on in teams.  Me and my team won 1st place at HackPSU a couple of weekends ago and I have a software development internship lined up for this summer.

I fucked up in Calc 2 and got C's in both my physics classes (211 and 212) and got a C in calc 1.  I hear that EE is so math and physics intensive and I am worried that this will ruin my GPA.  I feel like CS is right for me but am confused as what I should do to try and get into it.  Can anyone offer any advice?

What should I do?",PVCUREGRKG,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hbevq/third_year_undergrad_overwhelmed_by_finals/,"First off, I'm currently a junior at a university with a decent computer science program. I'm also in a state that has one of the best job market's for computer science grads on the east coast. I currently have a 2.8 GPA and have completed most courses without asking a question. I've never asked a coding question on an internet forum either, I prefer answering questions on my own to make sure I fully understand what's going on even when it takes a considerably long time. I get along quite well with other CS students but wouldn't consider any of them ""friends"". Most of my real friends are majoring in engineering and can't really relate to CS, so I'm kind of on my own.

Now don't get me wrong, I love comp sci, I'm just lost and having trouble figuring out what I really enjoy and want to do with my life. I've been applying to internships since December and haven't heard back from any of the 20+ companies I've sent my resume to. This has kind of sent me into a spiral towards the end of this semester and now I have little to no ambition to study for my finals this week. Since I have nothing practical to do over this summer, I'm kind of freaking out that I have 2 semesters left and that I'll have no real world experience once I graduate.
At this point the best thing for me to do this summer is to work on personal projects to help pump up my resume and portfolio as they're kind of weak. With just a simple Android app, a few multithreading C programs, and a C++ program that solves a Rubik's cube, I feel that I'm not making myself stand out to any particular company or industry.

Overall, I just feel lost and just don't know what I should expect down the road. I've been flip-flopping between getting a masters degree(in data science or security) and entering the workforce with no experience once I get my B.S. 

With that overview I have a few questions I'd like to ask.

1) Is it normal to feel so lost and helpless even though I love most of my courses and projects?

2) Since I failed to get an internship for this summer, is there anything that you'd recommend for me to work on this summer in addition to personal projects?

3) Are there any ways that I could gain real world experience before graduating in May 2017?

4) How can I figure out what I love to do within computer science (security, back-end web development, embedded systems, system programming, etc.) when my assignments and courses take up most of my time? (I usually get burnt out after finishing an assignment and end up hanging out with friends instead of continuing to work on a personal project)

5) If I can't choose an area within computer science that I like most, how should I know what to focus on and study now?

...For instance I have an FPGA that I've used to help me learn verilog, I have a TI microcontroller that I've used to help me learn about embedded systems, I have a RaspberryPi that I've used to help me learn about IPsec, etc. etc..
I'm all over the place and I love it all! What should I do?

6) ^^ Should I have included these things on my resume? 
I didn't want to seem too low level even though these are the things I enjoy.

7) Am I worrying too much?

Thanks in advance for your help!"

Considering going to college to re-enter the workforce.,jobsthrowawayaccount,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4hd6ij/unemployed_at_29_with_a_skillset_not_in_line_with/,"Throwaway account because I'm a little embarrassed.  I find myself at 29  and Unemployed for over a year. It feels like I need to rebuild my life from the ground up.  I recently was able to pull myself out of the depression spiral that I got into over the last year, but I’m still struggling for a path forward and finding a career. 

 I have a degree in political that I got when I was 25 (I went to school at 21 after being a high school drop out) but it’s not leading to great employment outcomes.  I considered becoming educated the solution to my job problems prior to being 21.  I did a lot of job hopping being school, so I didn’t have a lot of experience to fall back on.

 I believe my current skillset is not in line with the labour market demands here in Toronto.

*  I did sort of luck out and landed an internship in an IT consulting/ managed services company straight out of university, although the places was a disaster and completely disorganized and had a crazy high turnover rate.
* Spent a year as a project coordinator and then project manager: burned out, got fired, brought in and then
* Promoted to Relationship Manager, spent a year in this role, and made some sales into my accounts.
* Decided to return to school at York U to upgrade my bachelor to try to apply to law school.  Ended up dropping out and spiraling into a depression.

I’ve done a lot of interviews over 2015, but most failed to produce an offer.  I was on a role for a bit getting a lot of interviews, and going through multiple rounds but had other candidates chosen over me due to their experience.

Right now I can’t even seem to land a part time job in retail or at a grocery store.  I’ve been rejected in person and online, even when using a toned down resume.  I don’t really have part time experience to fall back on from when I was younger, which is what I assume most under employed arts grads do.  So this leaves me in a bit of a bind.

I’m considering going back to school, at a college in a technical field.  I’m even taking an upgrading math course, and have figured out that I can actually do math- which opens up a lot of options for me moving forward.   I’ve considered a post grad in marketing, engineering technology programs (and considering bridging into a university program out of it) and IT and computer programs.  I've also considered a trade, but it's not my first choice.

I’m becoming paralyzed from overthinking and can’t figure out what to do moving forward to find a rewarding career that I can do well at, and also pull in some good pay.  I’m leaning towards the engineering route so I can design and build things, but it’s a long path head, I’m broke (but would have OSAP) and it’s not a great feeling to be in this situation at 29.

Maybe there is something I’m not seeing here.  Thoughts?

4hdohc,6,2016-05-01,I need some advice,IPromiseImNotSkynet,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4hdohc/i_need_some_advice/,"Okay so I just finished my final semester of college and I'm having a hard time finding a job. I majored in Computer Science and I would think finding a job would be relatively easy considering every company needs programmers for something, and since all of my friends from school got offers from one or more companies weeks or months before the semester ended.

But that's not the case with me. In February I started applying everywhere in my area that I felt I had even the slightest chance of getting a job. I probably sent out 20+ resumes. I had a few interviews; 3 phone interviews and 2 in-person interviews, and I still have one more in person interview next week. I've thought that all of my interviews went pretty well, not necessarily perfect but by no means bad, but I have gotten nothing by bad news from all of these companies. Every company I've talked to has sent me that ""we're pursuing other candidates"" email.

I don't know what the hell is going on. My resume isn't the shiniest thing in the world but its not completely blank either. I have projects that I did on my own time throughout the past few years and I've even gotten compliments on the work during interviews. 

What I think the big problem is that I didn't have any internships. Why, you might ask? Because I didn't have the level of experience that they were looking for at the time. I've tried to get experience, but no company wants to give me experience, therefore I don't have any experience. 

The other problem that I see is my GPA. I'll be honest it's not great. I had my fair share of shitty professors that graded unnecessarily hard after not teaching the content very well at all, and I also had a few elective classes that I didn't give a shit about because more important classes were taking up all of my time. So I have a wide range of grades on my record. So when employers have been asking me what my GPA is I've been telling them 'about 3.0' because that's what I thought it was. Well I just learned today that it's not that good. It's more like a 2.7, so that is only going to make things more difficult since the only thing people seem to care about is GPA. I don't think it reflects my capabilities or work ethic at all but nobody seems to care about that.

So like I said I've applied everywhere I thought I stood a chance at and have been ignored or turned down by all of them except the one I still have an interview scheduled for. So what the hell am I supposed to do? I mean if this last one falls through I feel like I'm just completely fucked. My only thoughts from there are to try to get certifications and try again, but the whole ""you'll find something"" and ""everything will work out"" bullshit that everyone around me is telling me isn't helping me find a job any quicker. So does anybody have any useful advice so I don't become a worthless piece of shit like the rest of my family?"

Furthermore, judging from a couple of hours spent scouring local listings on CL, indeed, monster, etc., all the ""entry-level"" IT jobs within 30 miles of my home -- even the catch-all helpdesk ones -- want at least a 2-year degree with very specific experience and skillsets that I simply don't have and can't simulate since troubleshooting a dropped wifi connection or driver crash on a home desktop isn't the same as working at a high-volume helpdesk at a major research university like the one posting these openings.  
  
I could enroll in a 2-year A.A.S. in Computer Information Systems at the local community college, but we live in a high-cost area and it would put a strain on my family to live off of just my wife's salary while I go back to school.  At the same time I feel like I could probably self-study my way to a passing score on the A+/Network+ exams at minimal cost, but I worry that simply having certificates without practical experience from internships would leave me no better off than I am now.
  
People I've spoken with say that the only thing that matters is what you know once you've got your foot in the door, but realistically speaking, how can somebody like me find that proper balance between textbook knowledge and practical experience to take that first step up a new career ladder?  "

I took it because I thought it would be doable to work full time and take classes, but I was wrong.

I was only able to take one class per quarter and now after 1.5 years, I have about 2-3 quarter of classes left (if I take classes full time again).

What's the best option if I want to do software engineering stuff once I graduate? I haven't been able to do any side projects because working full time and taking classes part time has left me with little free time. I did however pick up skills like working with source control, jenkins, JIRA, chef, etc

Should I quit and go back to doing internships and only taking classes?"
4hgs2v,2,2016-05-02,Really hard to take her advice to not give up.,melancholicthrowaway,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4hgs2v/really_hard_to_take_her_advice_to_not_give_up/,"Hi. I'm not sure where to start. I've already tried to kill myself several times, but I always chicken out  when it comes time to do the deed. The closest I've gotten was swallowing a handful of pills, then throwing them up when I put too much thought into what happens after the end and got scared again. I really want to die. I have trouble falling asleep at night. I always think too much. Most of my days consist of feeling like shit as I take several hours to muster up the strength to get out of bed. If I have free time, I binge watch anime or bring up something to play to keep my mind distracted. If it isn't a school night, I try to stay up long enough that I'm so exhausted that I'll fall asleep immediately, so I don't have to think about anything. It rarely works; I still lie there failing to sleep for a while, and it's not something I can do if I have to wake up early in the morning.

 I can't for the life of me seem to get employed, and I haven't worked a single day of my life. When a friend from highschool gave me advice, she said I should focus on my resume; she remembered me well enough from speech and debate that she figured I'd have it in the bag as long as I could get an interview. She's working on her MBA at a really good school and had a comfy looking internship last time I checked, so I look up to her a bit. On my end, I've gotten a few interviews, but I can't even get myself hired by the local McDonalds.

Right now, I'm just leeching off of my parents, who are paying my way through college. I had a bit of a breakdown near the end of highschool, so they ended up enrolling for me. I basically go to a backwater school that was everyone's backup choice. And even though I just lie down doing literally nothing most days, I still end up failing my math classes, which I just can't seem to get. I'm honestly just a waste of money, and it'd be better off going to someone else who actually needs it.

I don't know how I feel about my parents. When I found that other people could actually befriend their parents, I tried really hard to befriend mine. The few times we eat together at the dining table, I really tried my best to talk to them, but the conversations never go anywhere, so it's always a silent meal. Whenever they'd decide to watch a movie, or if some other interesting media pops up, I'd try to discuss it with them, but they never really talk. Most of the time, they just heckle me for a botched job I've done somewhere around the house or in my life. I should still be grateful to them, though. They put food on the table and are sending me to college while I'm not really doing a thing.

There's this girl I still like. We dated for a little under a year, and  we find that we're both just as depressed at around that time ( I'm glad she's doing better now; I think I've gotten worse). Despite that, it was the most  serious relationship I've been in, and I learned a lot from her. She's really sweet and she made me happy. In return, tried my best to be there for her, but I just wasn't enough. She broke up with me, and is with another guy now, but we're still friends and talk to each other ever day.  She used to have a habit of telling me how her day went every evening, which didn't stop immediately after the break up. That's how I found out she lost her virginity after two weeks of knowing him. I know it really shouldn't matter, but it bothers me, and it kind of hurts a little. Unlike me, he actually has a job and can make her happy enough that I know she doesn't cry as often as she used to. Looking back, I  can't get it out of my mind that she felt sorry for me and only accepted me asking her out out of pity.

I really should be moving on, but I can't help but think of the life we talked about having together after we graduated. I'm not entitled to anything and should be feeling happy for her, but I guess I just feel a little bit abandoned. We exchanged hand-written letters, and I still pull them out to read, sometimes. I'm still mad at myself for throwing some of them away when I couldn't bear to think of her anymore.

We used to run a guild together, but I started logging in so infrequently that I just transferred the leadership to her. Nobody really noticed when I finally stopped logging in, so I guess I wasn't really doing a very good job. She seems to be handling it better, though. When we first started, she didn't want the leadership and nominated me when nobody else would step up, but I guess she just needed someone to get the ball rolling before she could take over.

A friend of mine got married the other day. I'm really happy for him. Someone else who I see in a lot my classes and started going to college the same time as me is about to graduate a year early. She works really hard, so she deserves it. A while back, there was this kid on the news; 16 years old and he made some sort of invention for water starved people, I forgot what it was. Meanwhile, I might have to stick around for another year if I keep failing my classes. Finals are coming up, and I think I'll fail math again. Still can't get a job. But I haven't really found the time or motivation to job hunt, so there's nobody to blame but me.

I know I have it better than most people, and I really have no right to complain. I tell myself that every day, but it's hard to not want to just give up and try to sleep my life away. The fact is I'm just a worthless basement-dwelling leech, the kind of person that everyone hates in society. I'm so cowardly I can't even find the strength to kill myself and get it over with already. I'm not even sure why I'm here anymore; I guess I'd feel a little less lonely doing this instead of struggling to sleep some more.

I'm tired of myself, and I really really want to die.  I'm just a whiny brat that should lay down and die already. But I can't find the courage to do it myself. It'd be best if there were a way for me to do it quickly without having to think about anything, and without any time to change my mind."

I'm a second year (of three) CS student in the UK. I've just been let go by my current employer (call center manager) after a slew of redundancies. Now I am looking for new work and was wondering if its too early to apply for dev jobs.

I only have one small side project which is a automation script for a report i had to run in excel, quite basic. I've applied to everything i could find that specifies it is an internship or for undergrads but being in Scotland that was a total of two. Is it worth applying to grad positions?

I'm on track for a first class degree and think I can talk intelligently about the soft skills I gained from the managers job but all the requirements in job descriptions seems very far away from my current level.

Thanks for your time. :)"
4hhopx,2,2016-05-02,Advice on Best Graduation Path?,nyklyfe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hhopx/advice_on_best_graduation_path/,"I'm about to finish my junior year in college as a CS major, and I just wanted a bit of advice as to which path I should take from here.

I just transferred to my current school ( one with a great CS program) this fall, with little prior programming experience. I was a CS major at my old college, however the program was extremely weak, and after 2 years there I found unable to grasp fundamental aspects of CS.

At my new college, I'm learning so much quicker and I really feel like I've grown a passion for CS and have established myself as a pretty good programmer. However, I feel like this really has been my ""freshman year"", seeing as though I didn't have any internships or tech jobs/skills prior to this year. I have an offer to be a TA for a upper-level programming class next semester, so that's really the only thing I can put on my resume right now.  I've been talking to my advisors, and I've come up with two options.

**OPTION 1:** 
My last 2 semesters, take 4 CS classes each, which would be pretty hard, but still doable. My GPA would definitely take a hit ( my college has a VERY vigorous CS program). 

**Length to Completion:** 4 and a half. 

**ACCOLADES:** TA job, 1-2 side projects, MAYBE one internship( at most, since I only have one more summer to get one), Bachelors Degree, slightly lower GPA( due to the 8 CS classes in 2 semesters).

**OPTION 2:** My last 2 semesters, I take 3 CS classes each. This leaves me with 2 CS classes left to graduate( after 4 and a half years). Now, my school offers a 5 years CS Masters Program, which although It would obviously take me more than 5 years to complete, I'd still be eligible for. The perk for this program is that I can substitute 2 undergrad classes with masters courses. Meaning If I took 2 masters courses, I would get 6 credits for my undergrad AND masters degree.

**Length to completion:** Undergrad in 5 years, Masters in 6 Total.

In this situation, I feel like I would have a lot more time to rack up a few more things to my resume and get some more experience. I would definitely have more time to make some side-projects, and I feel like not only would I be able to rack up MORE internships, but better ones as well( as a masters student).
In this situation I would graduate in 6 years with a Bachelors, a Masters, more internships, more side projects, and a better GPA( due to only having to take 6 courses in my last 2 semesters). 

Really, overall, I just feel like on my current path, I wouldn't be ready for the real world just yet. I'm definitely not experienced enough to get a good job just one year from now, let alone an interview. However, at the same time, from what I've read, a lot of people prefer spending the time getting job experience over getting a masters degree. 

ON A SIDE NOTE: If no masters, I would graduate with NO DEBT. If I did do my masters, I would graduate with about 13k in debt. 

Any advice would help greatly. Thanks!"
4hilm8,13,2016-05-02,How to best spend a month of freetime?,CodeCappuccino,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hilm8/how_to_best_spend_a_month_of_freetime/,"So I am a third year undergrad, set to graduate Fall 17/Winter 18 with a BS in CompSci.  In school I've learned C++, Java, and C#.  Looking back this was probably a poor choice class wise, as now I cannot keep the three languages straight in my head.  I've also just wrapped up my first technical internship, where I worked with C#, ASP.NET WebForms, and some JavaScript.  I have a summer internship lined up to start at the beginning of June, where I do not know what tech stack I'll be working with.

Overall, in terms of resume gaps, the biggest issue I have would be side-projects, which I am hoping to address this summer with either a mobile app or some open-source work.  In terms of knowledge gaps, I feel as though I should learn one language much deeper then I know now (probably Java), learn testing (as my school's curriculum has completely failed to address it), and the standard data structures and algorithms interview prep (TopCoder, CTCI, etc.)

With the upcoming month of free time I have, I want to address these concerns, but I am unsure of what to prioritize.  I currently feel that I should perform a deep-dive on Java, as that will help me the most with coding interviews.  But I also want to learn Swift and iOS development, as mobile dev is the field I can most see myself going into. (I already have experience with Android)

So my questions are:

1) Which of these should I prioritize?

2) What book/resource will most help me reach that goal?  For example, Effective Java seems to be the universally agreed upon book for that language, will reading it accomplish familiarizing myself with Java much more intimately?

3) Is it a bad idea to try and learn yet another language, in the form of Swift?

TL:DR - If you had 4-5 hours a day, 6 days a week, for a month, what would you focus on?

Thanks!"

I finished my first project and then got moved to a different team to start a new project. For the first project, I didn't 100% finish it because they wanted it delivered really fast and they weren't happy with the approach I took, so they decided that I'm not good enough to be a developer or something, and then moved me to another team. Two other people inherited my project instead and were tasked with refactoring my code into the better approach, and I got pushed off to another team that has nothing to do with software engineering. One of my coworkers from that team even told my new team that they should make sure my project doesn't involve any coding, which is absurd because she has no programming background whatsoever and is basing her opinion of my development skills on the really rough project that I worked on for the first half of the internship - a project which I worked on pretty much by myself with little to no guidance. I won't say too much about it because it was sort of a toxic relationship there and I am glad I am no longer on the team or working with her, but now I'm on a different team and my project is more process management rather than development. :/ I don't want my development skills to atrophy...I need to spend as much time as possible developing so I can improve! So should I quit a month early and just spend that time on my coursework and writing code on my own? Or should I just do whatever they ask me to do for the last month and give this new field a chance? I was a software engineering intern and now I'm a systems engineering intern. My primary interest is writing code and engineering software. I already have a software engineering job lined up for when I graduate in a couple of months. I want to spend my time writing code and learning about code, not doing this. I agree with the previous team's assessment that my programming skills could benefit from writing a lot more code...and that's what I want to do! :/ 

I have enough money to survive until I start my new grad job in a few months. My biggest fear with quitting is losing potential contacts and another month at this really hot company on my resume. My biggest fear with not quitting is spending another super intense month (the workload here is very intense even for interns) on stuff I don't want to do, for small pay, while my coding skills stop growing and while my coursework doesn't get the attention it needs. Finals week is approaching and it's going to be really challenging. If I were to quit, I could spend time studying to make sure I get the best grades possible. I've already been studying whenever I can, but the internship has been so intense that my coursework has taken a backseat to the internship work. Now that I'm not even working on development, I'm hesitant to keep doing that."

I just feel like with all that, my gpa is bringing me down. I've only been working all this time and all those hours to pay off college but I'm not sure if being debt free, graduating in 4 years and having shitty grades is better than having 30k in debt and doing well. 

I want to confidently apply to places like google or microsoft. This semester isn't going so hot with one of my classes anyways. my other classes are Bs and As this semester as long as I don't bomb the finals.

I have a github but it's only got a monte carlo stock options simulator and a game I'm working on (authoritative server networking, opengl and 2d liquid physics), both of which are pretty dense but horribly organized.

I'm thinking of starting filling applications for summer 2017 sometime in September.

what do you guys think? What can I do to boost myself in the meantime? I'm working on improving my technical interviews just in case I land an interview.

I'm 26, and late last year my internship turned into a full time job making 50k/yr. Last month I finally moved out from my parents house and have cut direct contact with my mom and all contact with my dad. I hear about how my mom is doing through a third party.

When I was in high school my dad helped me set up a checking account and without my knowledge he made himself the primary on the account. Since then he regularly checks my account to see if I'm spending my money the way he thinks I should. After going full time but Prior to me leaving I couldn't save up any money due to my dad needing extra money ($700+) on top of the ($500-600) rent I was paying. 

So onto my current situation:
I closed the checking account that my dad had access to and opened a new one in my name only and that has pissed him off royally. I also have a savings account and 2 credit cards that I set up last year. I used the credit cards to but things last year with out every purchase bring scrutinized and paid them off with the savings account. My dad did not know about any of these accounts/cards

I just heard from the 3rd party that my dad tore my room apart over the weekend and found an old statement for my savings and is furious that ""my mom let me open a savings account without putting one of them on the account""

Since he now has my savings account information is there anything I can do if he poses as me on the phone with the bank? I called and had a verbal password set up but is there anything else I can do? Is it worth going to a lawyer yet?  Sorry for the long read, I would greatly appreciate any advice!"

I'm not sure if its relevant to my case (feel free to skip to  TL;DR if not), but I'll list my qualifications next:

I graduated with a batchelors of science in mechanical engineering just over a year ago with a solid GPA, intern experience, study abroad experience, leadership, etc. 

I have worked summers since I was 14 as a pool concessions/janitorial worker turned lifeguard, turned manager of a local city pool. During a time-off between US semesters and an upcoming study abroad semester I mentored my high-school's robotics team, helping them with applying physics and basic engineering to the design of their competition bot. I found interest in fluid mechanics related work and (having just completed the manufacturing engineering course) found an internship related to manufacturing of hydraulic valves.

Post graduation I moved to an area that I have always loved, to be close to the ocean, thinking ""Well I'm pretty qualified, I'll find opportunities!"", and I did find one. I work as a drafter and ""hydraulic engineer"" for a pool building company. 90% of my time is spent doing basic drafing with CAD software for construction plans. I do a lot of drawing for large commercial jobs, but as I do not have my P.E. I cannot sign and seal my own plans. I am the only person at my company to have a college degree of any kind, and while I learn a lot about the industry every day, I feel as though I don't have much room to grow. There aren't really any positions I could be promoted to that would fit my skillset, I am making roughly 70% of the average starting salary from my major (its a comfortable amount of money, but I see no reason for it to ever go up while at this job). I have my F.E. certification, but with no mentor or P.E. to work under I am unable to pursue that further either. I'm not unhappy at my job, but I know that I *could* be making more, and (most importantly) I feel as though as long as I wait to find something more relevant the less sharp I will become and the less appealing I will be as a candidate for other jobs. I'm not really using my degree very much.

I have found interest in product design engineering as I enjoy the creative aspects of optimizing form as well as function, and began applying heavily to related jobs in several areas (not just where I currently am). I enjoy evaluating customer needs and applying my education to deliver a calculated solution. I enjoy being a part of a team of people smarter and more experience than I am to learn from them. 

TL;DR: Typical college engineering graduate ""above average"" qualifications, got a decent job in area I love since market is tough, now trying to move jobs to something more relevant.

---
 
Given my current situation, I have started looking for something more technical, relevant, and interesting to me. Something where I can be of value and also better myself as an engineer and grow career-wise.

Almost all of my job searching has lead me to find ""Entry-Level"" jobs that somehow still manage to list several years of experience in a very specific application of engineering that one couldn't possibly have as a recent graduate.

This seems like a common concern, but where can I get that experience? How can I experience a specific engineering application, get relevant training, become more knowledgeable and therefore more valuable if there are seemingly no ""stepping stones"" on the way to these ""entry-level"" positions?

It seems as though the only way in to a lot of these companies is to have been lucky enough to co-op with your company of choice and also be lucky enough to decide that you would like to further your career in that area after college, otherwise you're just too unqualified for 99% of the entry level positions up for grabs. Do companies not train their employees anymore? I know training is expensive, but employers have the opportunity to advertise for a *huge* pool of talent that are proven, capable learners and mold them to be exactly what they need, yet no one seems to hire anyone who hasn't been trained by someone else already.

Am I missing something?"

I am coming from /r/personalfinance, where I asked [the following question](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4hjku4/better_offer_but_not_sure_about_experience_it/) about a job offer. I was tentatively advised to take it, but also advised to ask the question here for a more in-depth look at the experience aspect of my question: 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I have an offer that I *think* I really want to take. The position is at a large financial company in a good city, and pays right down my alley at around 63k with attractive benefits. To recap: I’m a computer science grad (this week), and ideally I’d love experience at a good company in software development. But, I’m also not the perfect candidate: I have an alright gpa (3.4), but I have no internship experience, which I know has held me back.

&gt;*(tl;dr): Would I be making a mistake for a software dev career down the road by accepting an infrastructure/database job offer?*

&gt;**The Position:** 
The title is actually called associate systems and support analyst, but as far as I can tell it has nothing to do with the field of “systems analysis,” despite the fact that they sound similar. The position itself seems to be more related to infrastructure, and database maintenance (like live monitoring of a database for erroneous entries? I’m not sure if I’m explaining this correctly). 

&gt;The position *doesn’t* have a strict focus on software development. Though the development process is in the job description, the interviewers flat out told me that development isn’t a big part of the role (and languages I have experience in aren’t on the job desc.). *There is a software dev track in this company for entry level,* but I believe I applied too late in the semester to snag one of those roles, as I was busy applying elsewhere and this company just slipped my mind. (Such is life.)

&gt;That being said, this is the best offer I've received so far. If I don't accept it, then I can safely continue looking for explicit dev positions, but at the obvious cost of not having a job getting experience in something.

&gt;**My question is,** if I take this position, will its lack of development exposure hinder me in finding software development positions in the future? OR, can it be only a good thing, given my lack of an internship? My understanding is that roles like QA, etc., have a tendency to pigeonhole CS grads into that type of role later in life. But do I risk that with accepting this position, or is it different, and only a neutral/good thing, given my lack of experience? The job offers exposure in database tech at least, like DB2 and  Oracle/SQL."

Hi /r/forhire,

Like I said, I am a recent grad (Dec 2015) from Michigan State looking to gain some great UI/UX experience. I've been working as a freelancer since about last June when I decided to take up UX. Unfortunately, a lot of places won't hire you on as a contractor if you don't have any experience.

I am looking for a full-time permanent position or a full-time paid internship. I am open to contract work.

I'm experienced in Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and After Effects. I am also well-versed in the full UX process. I really shine at conceptualization, wireframes (I use Axure), and prototypes. I'm skilled in user research but would love more experience in that arena, especially with administering/conducting user tests and interviews.

I am also a big history, gaming, and film buff. Anyways, my portfolio is linked above, so if you would like to see some of my stuff, check it out! You can reach out to me at my email address.
Thanks everyone and have a great day! "

While I'm extremely pleased too start this internship I want to start working full time after this internship (assuming all goes well), but still have three classes left to complete in the fall. I've signed up for all online classes, so I would be able to work full time at this company through fall in hopes they will offer it too me. My question is this. I understand this is dependent on each company, but has anyone ever received and started working a full time job, while completing the last of their classes for their bachelor's degree? Or do most companies want to wait to hire until the bachelors degree is completed? In this case, this is an entry level IT job where I would be doing internal desktop support and states in the job description that a bachelors degree is necessary. If anyone has any advice or thoughts on this I would really appreciate it. Thank you."

This is my first post here but not the first time I stop to read, thanks for the support you give, it meant a lot even without being involved in the thread. 

I am sorry if this gets a bit too long, English is not my first language and I'm not used to talk about feelings, so I might need more words than strictly necessary. 

The main point of me writing this post is that I'm sick and tired of my life routine, but complaining about it only got me very bad reactions. 

Maybe I am lazy and spoiled, maybe I was too lucky for most of my life and now I can't cope with work because I have no discipline. That's what my girlfriend seems to mean when she complains about me complaining. 

I'm almost 31, for the last 15 months I've been working day and night with a partner on our own business. Things are starting to work out, we are hiring our first employee, who is finishing an internship in a month and seems to be a good fit. 

For the first time in months, last weekend I could sleep more than 6 hours and ""forget"" about work, maybe some day this week I can even get home before 20:00. 

Everyone around me says it is worth it, they seem to be pretty sure about it, way more than I am. They say it's an investment and we are lucky to have clients in this economy. 

Fuck that shit. I can't afford to buy soil for my plants (soil is dirt cheap, literally), I pay the bills and the end of the month starts on the 5th for me. Can't buy clothes to wear for work, can't go out to dinner, not a single night, can't afford my cat to be sick because that means using my business credit card and being even more broke for a couple of months. And I am hungry most of the time because my stomach is way bigger than my bank account. 

I think of death as a relief. I think of killing myself every day, but I just can't. It makes me think of my loved ones having to pay for a crappy funeral where no friends are going (I've been a terrible and very distant friend) and it makes me sadder, but it takes suicide out of the picture for a while. So I light up some weed and it lightens up my mind. I've been an occasional smoker since I was 16, but with my financial history I never had a chance to abuse. Last year I grew a couple of plants and that's how I can afford it now. For the last month I've been trying not to smoke for a week and didn't even get to the first 24 hours (I've had plenty of weed available for the last 7 months, but this habit is new). 

I don't know if the drug is causing a depression or a depression is making me use, but every day I feel like killing myself until I smoke and then I look at my problems in a different way. I wake up my ass from the couch, cook some shitty shit and go to bed defeated again. I can cook like a pro, but I just don't want to any more. 

It feels like the only thing I can decide about, and taking the choice of smoking again while I listen to some music is the only moment of happiness I can afford. 

My girlfriend used to be a loving and supportive one, but no one loves a broken man and I know it's just a matter of time till she leaves. It makes me sad, but I made up my mind long time ago, it's quite understandable, no one wants to live like this. 

For the business, things have been growing quickly for the last 5 months, at the beginning of 2016 I was looking for a job, just to know what I could afford to look for, but not with the biggest expectations. I got the interest of a couple of big firms, but I ratted out because I got some clients and I hoped things would get better faster. I always had problems with authority and I am scared of having a boss and not liking him, I tend to do stupid things like pointing it out in front of everybody. 

At this pace, I might be able to take some days off this year, but I don't know if I have the strength to get to that. I feel exhausted and sad. 

My mother, the one who might have spoiled me by filling my shelves with every book I asked for, was diagnosed with cancer last December. She's gonna make it, the diagnose was on time, but I haven't been able to visit since her first chemo session, which was at the end of January. And that hurts, like it hurt when I couldn't visit my younger brother in hospital after a spine surgery. 

I just can't find a meaning for all this. I find myself crying alone at least once a week, and that has never happened to me. I don't want to take any drugs, not even marihuana, of course. I just want to get back to the gym, sleep 8 hours and have some food on the table. And I feel so weak, because I know there are people out there with bigger problems who deal with it, but I can't even find support. People look at me like my brothers do: the big guy with tons of confidence and all the answers. But I am done, behind closed doors I am just done. 

I thought this was gonna make me feel better, but I already stopped twice to cry and that's too much feelings for me. Thanks for reading this, I hope I can write something funnier soon. "

I have a Bachelor's in Communication. I've completed three unpaid internships and have been working a PR position for 5 months. 

I work in a very small office with a group of people who are close friends and have worked together for years. I feel that several of my fellow employees have both been over-critical to the point where I feel llike I can't do anything around them from sending a fax to asking a question in a meeting, without being criticized, and one of them has also been very condescending and it has made it hard to work with them.  

My boss has been unavailable and has communicated to me that my job is ""not priority"" for her on several occasions. I've also received very little (essentially nothing) in the way of training. 

I received a performance review last week. There were some criticisms that I agreed with whole-heartedly. I fully embrace that I have made mistakes and that there are areas for improvement in my work. However, there were also statements in the performance review that did not accurately represent certain situations. The review also contained at least two statements that were outright erroneous. The way it was worded I am wondering if they are setting up to fire me. 

I feel like the situation I'm in is toxic. I'm a very hard worker. I worked three unpaid internships and four retail jobs before this and received only outstanding evaluations. I've put 110% into this job-coming in early, staying late, working outside of regular hours to complete projects some of which were not explicitly assigned to me. I'm also smart-I got grades in both high school in college. However, being in this office my confidence has dwindeled down to nothing. 

For the sake of my mental health I need to get out of this environment. I know that this is not the smartest thing I could do career wise but I've struggled with my mental health in the past and I am very familiar with what my breaking point is. I've far surpassed it.

My main point in posting is I'm wondering what my options are, and I am exploring everything.

My idea is to apply for every office position I'm qualified for at two local hospitals, and also look on Indeed for receptionist roles around the area I live in while taking every state and county test I can find. I'm willing to work two jobs. I'm willing to put in more than 40 hours to make ends meet. I just want to be treated fairly. 

Any advice?"

Now the issue is, some of the things shes mentioned, Ive never had experience doing(using a particular coding languages) When she calls back should I make her aware of this ? As I dont want to seem like an idiot once hired. 

Another Dilemma is that I had an interview last week with Company B, and the interview went really well. I just hope they thought likewise. Company B will be making a decision come later this week. 

How do I go about holding off Company A, respectfully, until Company B makes a decision on whether or not I have the position. Also making Company A aware of my not so steller coding background(IT major - MIS concentration).

I'd received the contract to sign off on and was reading through it, and found something that somewhat concerns me.


The first is that you give permission to work overtime whenever, without being paid for overtime, and the other is that they have you opt out of the Working Time regulations (regulations which stop you from being able to work more than 48 hours a week). 


These two combined are somewhat concerning, as it seems they want me to give permission to possibly work a hefty amount of over time (and possibly a LOT of hours), and not get paid for it.


This will be my first real full time job barring an IBM internship I had, which didn't have these clauses. I was wondering if this is something to be expected from this industry, and if it's something to be concerned over. Obviously I'm not looking for any legal advice, just people's advice/experience.

I am currently in school for Computer Science, to hopefully get into Game Development. I went to SkillsUSA state with a group for game design and simulation, which we won first place and now go to Nationals in June.

All this sounds fine and dandy, though the thing is I want to quit from the competition, since the game we made was incredibly mediocre/boring by critics standards, amongst other things (internal politics in the organization is a big one)

The thing is, if I quit, I can kiss a recondmendation letter and a possible internship opportunity out the window, since that's what my teacher told me if I quit. 

But the other thing is though is that it I go, and if there is supposedidly industry people at this competition like she said there would be (there was supposed to be at the state but it was essentially just two judges, one from the school and the guy who I was supposed to intern for), wouldn't a mediocre product look bad on all of us anyways, and the industry people not take us seriously anyways?

I know it might be as obvious as ""Just go with the competition"", though I'm not entirely sure anymore. I honestly need an idea on what would be best."

I worked on personal projects and competitive programming to make up for it. I have CTCI and I planned to study it non stop for a month this summer before applying to US elite/prestigious companies. I graduate in December 2016 so I'd apply this summer. 

Now I'm considering grad school for computer architecture. Unfortunately I developed this interest after taking the computer architecture class.

I almost have a paid internship at Accenture (here in Dubai) lined up. Internships aren't that useful for grad school so I might decline the offer to do unpaid research at my university. My professor said he would give me some projects that he doesn't have time for (he's the department head) to work on. I assume he'll give me guidance as well. Maybe I'll get something published.

I'm very unqualified for grad school. Taking the position is useless if it can't offset my weaknesses. Here's my lack of qualifications:

1 - 2.6 GPA. major gpa is less. (I expect that my overall and major gpa will both become &gt;2.7 at the end of this semester. I'm expecting mostly A- or As)

2 - C- in computer architecture. C+ in operating systems. No compiler design class.

3 - This is [my school](http://www.aus.edu). Outside the US and ranked #400. I'm American though.

To make things even more bleak there's [this](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-get-into-grad-school-for-computer-architecture/answer/Shane-Ryoo?srid=7myq).

&gt;The field is shrinking rapidly and only a handful of companies now employ computer architects.  Even many of us that worked for renowned professors at top-5 schools no longer work in computer architecture: there aren't enough positions and only the top few students get the jobs.  That includes myself and several friends, many of whom work on processor-touching projects at Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and elsewhere.  We all had 3.9+ GPAs in undergrad from top-10 universities.  But we don't get to do computer architecture.

One option is to take this research opportunity and try to get into a low ranked school for masters and then a higher ranked one for PhD. Another option is to work for a few years in industry and then go to grad school. Another option is to abandon this entirely and go back to my original plan. With Facebook in particular I'm sure I can get an interview through my last recruiter (I failed the FB summer 2016 internship interview).

My questions:

1 - Could doing research until December give me a chance at a decent school? It's not worth dropping my internship if not.

2 - If I go to industry with plans of grad school later, would I have to do research? How long? Could I even get a research position without research experience?

3 - Is the computer architecture field really shrinking?"

I'd love some career advice, and I'd even be willing to pay someone an hourly fee to get together on Skype or Google Hangouts and chat. 

A bit about my current goals: For the next 3 years, my plan is to work as a full-time software engineer and do a Master's in Computer Science through Georgia Tech, with a specialization in Machine Learning and whatever Trading classes I can take. I ultimately want to work at Citadel in downtown Chicago, and I feel like the Master's along with what I'll be learning at my job starting in August as well as what I'll be learning on my own time will prepare me for a role there. My reasons for wanting to work there are - 1) Money for my financial goals 2) Prestige for lifelong employment anywhere should I need to move and 3) Challenging environment in my favorite city.

I have a solid GPA and learned a tremendous amount at two known companies in California, as well as two companies in Illinois. I have a full-time job starting in August at a really hot company in Chicago, and I'm planning on staying there at least long enough to have all my stock options vest, and hopefully until they get acquired or go public (both are likely to happen during the next 24 months). They build management software and deal with tremendous amounts of data, which is why I feel like I'll learn a lot about big data analysis and efficient code.

Does this career plan sound feasible and on the right track given my goals of working at Citadel, making a lot of money in challenging environments where I can learn a lot, and maintaining lifelong employability? Is the master's a waste of time or will I 1) learn enough from it that it will help me achieve these goals and 2) is it a good way to perhaps get an internship at Citadel or even a full-time job down the road? Is getting an internship there after a few years of working full-time just downright weird? Should I not limit myself to just Citadel if I'm interested in HFT and hedge funds?

Any advice would be appreciated. Would love feedback from people who took a similar route."

I need some help, advice and suggestions!

I hold a BS in Computer Science from a top-3 school, but have not been employed as a software engineer. In the time since my graduation 12-years ago, I have been involved in freelance projects and managing businesses. In the last 4-years I have opened two restaurants and a fast food place and they are successful. I'm still part owner of one, but no longer involved, and want to return to software engineering.

I worked on Python/Django, C#, Android and Lua. I still have a good grasp of data-structures/algorithms and understand OOP, functional programming, recursion and so on. I'm looking for a junior position to get me started on technical problems so that I can sharpen my skills. I get along with team members, self motivated, reliable, on-time and have a team first mindset. I'm excited about starting, but need some help marketing myself.

So is there hope? Can I still find a job and a career as a software engineer?

1. What should I do to become employable as a software engineer?

2. What projects should I work on to best show my skills?

3. Everywhere I look, it seems businesses are looking for senior software engineers and that junior positions are filled from college. What can I do?

4hqvhr,37,2016-05-03,To everyone with high test scores and low GPA waiting to apply-READ,applyingtothrowaway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/4hqvhr/to_everyone_with_high_test_scores_and_low_gpa/,"I wanted to share my story on my college admissions process and how much I realized that grades really do matter, and good test scores will NOT get you into top tier schools. 

A common question is if a 33 and a 3.2 will be enough to get into a top 20 school.

I thought the same thing until this year, and from February-May were some of the hardest months of my life.

TEST SCORES WILL NOT ADMIT YOU. TEST SCORES WITH GOOD ESSAYS, ECS AND RECS WILL NOT ADMIT YOU.

I say this from experience. I just applied this year and got rejected everywhere except for two schools and waitlisted at one. I had a 3.6W (3.3 UW) GPA (trended from 2.7 freshman to 4.9 junior and had an explanation for why,) had taken AP Physics C, AP Gov, AP Chem, AP Calc AB, IB Psych, IB Chinese, (**scored 4/5/5/5/5 for AP and 7/7 IB**) 

My senior year course load was IBHL 2 English, HL History, AP Calc BC, IB Econ, Geophysics. I had a cool story of growing up internationally, had internships, varsity sports, academic extra curriculars (speech and debate, mock trial, leadership in both) and according to me and my teachers, great essays and recs. **To kick this all, I had a 35 composite ACT (34E, 35M, 36R, 35S, 36 Essay)**

That said, I moved my senior year to a very competitive school in Virginia, and was rejected from: Yale (legacy), Middlebury, Claremont Mckenna (ED2), Washu, Vanderbilt, and was waitlisted at William and Mary (in state as well). I was admitted to Lehigh and Fordham, and upon appealing my Lehigh decision, was one of the select few to receive merit based aid. 

When I got my 35 and got my grades together my junior year, I thought I was set. I went from thinking I would get into most schools to praying to get waitlisted or accepted to at least one. Any one. But I didn't. The days rolled by and I was rejection after rejection after rejection. 

While this was happening, I was watching my peers with scores in the 20s and kids who I knew I was smarter than get into top tier schools. I would get asked about college and be ashamed to answer because I felt like a failure. I'd done interviews with Yale, Vanderbilt and Middlebury and they all went excellently. I wrote my essays well and communicated with my admissions counselors, but to no avail. 

To the juniors and younger: 

You don't realize how hard it is getting rejected from multiple schools you believed you would get into. You never want to feel like that. It's so hard because when you apply, you see yourself at a school, you fall in love, you know you can do it. But when you get rejected, fundamentally, it breaks down your sense of self; you realize that you're not the person you thought you were. When it happens once? That's normal, college admissions are finicky. Six consecutive times? That's when something inside breaks. 

Let me tell you, if you're in a situation like mine, chances are you go to a competitive highschool, are smart, have smart friends, and have always been the ""lazy scholar."" That said, watching all your friends get into the places that you got rejected from will make you feel more alone than you ever have.

That's part of the reason I'm posting, as a twisted sort of vent for my frustration and anger. I cannot stress this enough, traditional teenage angst aside, if you're in this situation, there aren't a lot of people like you, and less that understand how you feel.

Personally? (as if this post wasn't personal enough) nothing was harder than seeing my girlfriend who I love dearly get admitted to Georgetown with a 1260/1600 because her mother worked there. For the record, she was waitlisted at W&amp;M, UVA, NYU, Lehigh, Villanova, rejected BC, JHU. Stuff like this turns the kindest people bitter and angry. I know how mopey it sounds, and it sucks, it really does. 

There's a map of where everyone is going to college next year outside my highschool office and I'm too ashamed to put up my face.

When I applied to all those reaches, I thought I would be ok if I got rejected from all of them, at least I tried, right? 

Wrong. 

I'm not a traditional suburban white kid, I've been through some really hard stuff, but believe me when I tell you, this is one of the worst experiences of my life, and it really doesn't go away, not right away at least.

Juniors, sophomores, even freshmen with high test scores, please listen, please be careful, and do everything you can to get your grades up. Having good scores and ok grades makes you an exception to the rule. Don't assume that you'll be the exception to the rule at top tier colleges, because chances are, you're going to get burned. 

Don't make my mistake.

Thanks for reading this, it was really therapeutic to type this all out, this community has been really great and I'm on a throwaway incase anyone from my school knows my reddit tag.

4hqvs2,31,2016-05-03,I don't know what it was...,Marion-ette,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4hqvs2/i_dont_know_what_it_was/,"When I was eight, my class went on this field trip to the aquarium. I remember standing beside this huge tank, hands and face pressed to the glass, watching all of these amazing creatures swim by. Every color I'd ever seen was in that tank, swimming past coral and rock, swooping in and out of the pathways of turtles and small sharks. I was amazed and overwhelmed, and I wasn't alone. Opposite me, hands and face also pressed against the glass, was Alan. It's how we met, became friends, and then married 15 years later. And now he's lost.

Even though we were married over a year ago, we hadn't gotten around to the honeymoon yet. Between me working full time at the aquarium where we met while working towards my environmental studies major and Alan taking every class, internship and extra curricular activity to get his masters as a marine biologist, we've been rather busy. I thought it was a god send when his internship took them out of the country to study deep sea creatures in Wales, and that his boss took pity on us and invited me long. ""It'll be good to bring the wife along, like the honeymoon you never had. Plus, never hurts to have another scientist along for the ride.""

The plane was tolerable and the food was odd, but the scenery was breath taking. We'd been there for less than a day before Dr. McKinney (Alan's boss) had us sized up in scuba suits and planned out the ground work for where we'd be diving, how long, and how deep. All the basics were covered for me, a small refresher course on hand signals, then it was time for dinner. It was the last normal night I think I'll ever have again.

We started at dawn. I struggled into my scuba gear, Alan helping me get all the straps for the oxygen on tight and right. The man driving the boat, who's name I couldn't pronounce and shoddy English I couldn't understand drove us far out past the sight of land, and dropped anchor. The goal of the day was to take underwater photographs of the fish, the habitat and the pollution. We were all outfitted with cameras and enough air for an hour of exploring before safely coming up. McKinney went over first, breaking the almost glass-like appearance of the waters surface. His head bobbed back up as he stuck two thumbs in the air and went back under. I could see Alan grinning like a nerd in his face mask as he mockingly grabbed his nose, pretended to pinch on in, and wiggled his hand down above his head before going over as well. I turned to the guy driving the boat, and for a moment I felt a small pang of fear that maybe while we were down there, he'd take off. 
I shook off the feeling, made my way to the side, and let myself fall into the water. 

I knew the water was cold, but I didn't really feel it in the suit. Maybe 20 feet from me I could see Alan, already captivated in the small cluster of red and green fish swimming in a tight pack near him,  completely uninterested in the million pictures he was taking. He looked up quickly and saw me, gave me a wave and went back to work, like a child with a new toy. Out to my left McKinney was also snapping photos, but he was more interested in whatever was growing on the rocks around him. He noticed me, waved, and from that point on I was pretty much on my own.

The day was pretty much just that. Sail to a location, grab a new tank, take a billion pictures, and repeat. By 10pm it was dark, I was tired and had already missed out on three trips down that Alan and McKinney had gone on. Balls deep in homework and having had enough of this diving business for one day, it took forever for Alan to convince me to go on one last trip down. ""Evelyn, you've got to see them. It's really beautiful, they're like little flashlights."" Only half paying attention to his chatter about the fish, I agreed, saved my homework documents and suited up, if only to make him happy. 

This time the water was freezing, even in the suit. Our suits now had small lights on the goggles, giving way to maybe 10 feet of visibility. Along with the cameras we also had hand held lights, which only made me feel the smallest bit better.

McKinney saw me in the water, but didn't signal me at all. He just sort of floated there, in the black. He must have been twenty feet from me, flashlight pointed down, crossing streams with my own, so I know he knew that I was there. Still he didn't acknowledge me. 

I started to feel uneasy. It didn't feel right. I looked for Alan to my right, turning my back to McKinney, scanning the black for wherever he might have been, but I couldn't see him. I turned back, and McKinney was gone. Just gone. I panicked, and began frantically swimming up to the boat. After forever I broke the surface and scrambled on board. I pulled my mask from my face and took deep breathes trying to call out to whatever-his-name-is that drives the boat. I reached the helm, but he was gone. The sonar was still working, and if the guys where down below us, it would've picked them up. I stood there for what seemed like forever, watching the sonar go around, waiting for the ping. And then it happened, and I swear my heart stopped.

The size and shape was clearly a diver. Alan. I'd hoped it was him. But then where was McKinney? The diver was moving, slowly, circling the underside of the boat. What the fuck was he doing down there? Looking for me? Looking for McKinney? A moment later, another shape appear. Oh thank god, they're okay.
Then a third shape came onto the screen. 
It was bigger than the other two and just as quickly as it came, it was gone.

""What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck..."" I couldn't stop repeating it, backing away from the screen. Yelling rose up from behind me, the sailor was yelling at me in Welsh, throwing his hands wildly at the sonar and then towards the water. 
""I don't know what you're saying! I don't know! There's something in the water. Help me find Alan!"" I was screaming and at some point I had started crying. He slammed his hand down on the console and pointed out to the sea. 
Then he turned the key and started the boat.
""NO! No, stop!! What're you doing, we can't leave them out here!"" I lunged at him, punching and scratching at his arms until he let go. He grabbed my whole face with one hand and shoved my head back hard and I could hear my skull whack against the wall. Blood trickled down the side of my head and slipped into my wet suit. I lunged at him again, biting and scratching. He fled from the helm and out onto the deck. He was screaming at me, pointing to the sea and then to the sky. ""Dead,"" the only English he'd ever said to me, and he was yelling it in my face. ""Dead, dead, dead,"" Over and over. ""He's not dead!"" I screamed back, shoving him hard in the chest, and then we was gone. The splash broke the silence and I could see his blonde head bobbing up and down in the water, still yelling at me, crying out for a life raft. Suddenly he stopped mid holler. Leaning against the railing I watched as he remained perfectly still in the water facing me. His eyes widened and then we heard it. It was the sound of large air bubbles breaking the surface like when a diver breathes out and the tiny bubbles rise to the top. But this wasn't small like those, it was like someone overturned a bucket and let the air pocket out. Some 50 feet away from him I saw the water pop. Then another. Then another, only closer. I reached down beside me for the life saver, and brought one finger to my lips very slowly to motion for silence. 

The next moment happened in an instant. I don't know why, but he turned to look where the air broke the surface. Whatever it was cleared the distance between them in a second before I even had time to think. He was gone and I was alone. I ran back to the helm, grabbed the radio and called out to anyone for help but all I got was static. The sonar was pinging in the background picking up on whatever was down there. The screen showed one figure below me, completely stationary in its location before the boats power went out. No radio, no sonar, and fuck, no keys. *Where the fuck are the keys?* I ran to the side of the boat, sobbing in my suit, and searched the deck for the keys. I hoped against all odds that they had fallen out of that guys pocket before he went over. I looked up at the sea and 100 yards out, I saw a light. 

I picked up my flashlight and pointed it out towards the light and to my amazement it reflected goggles. Then one bare hand rose up out of the water, gave me a small wave and disappeared, head and hand, back under the water. 

I raced to get my mask and goggles on, tightened my tank and dove back in. The water around me was pitch black beyond my headlight. Below me was a vast blackness and above me was the faintest sliver of moonlight, letting me know the boat was still there. I swam out as far as I could in every direction, heart pounding in my chest as I flung the flashlights beam everywhere looking for Alan. I had gone further from the boat than I'd have liked when I saw him just floating there, like McKinney had been. I knew it was Alan, I could tell by his body shape, just floating in what looked like a black abyss. He raised a single hand and lazily waved at me. But it wasn't right. It looked the way a child would wave, loose in the wrists. Then a small light appeared a few feet away from his right leg. Then another, near his shoulder. As if a switch had been turned on, hundreds of tiny fish began to light up all around him, making him more visible to me. 

That's when I saw it. Propping his body up, was some kind of creature. It was long and thin, with wispy fins coming off of this enormous tail stretching down at least ten feet. It's black hands were wrapped around Alans wrists, making him motion waving at me. Black eyes, sunken and swollen stared out at me from just behind his head. 

In a second all the fish went out and this thing swam at me like a river snake. It came across the distance before I had time to react and smashed Alans goggles against mine. Through my cracked lenses I could see his eyes were white and lifeless, skin pruned from his suit filling with water. I pushed him away, letting his body sink down into the black, panic and bile rising in my throat. I kicked up hard, making my way to the surface, desperate to get the fuck out of the water. My panic peaked when a hand grabbed my ankle. With a quick twist I knew it was broken, pain rising up in my leg making me scream. I looked back and saw it's face. 

Black and green scales covered either side of it's face. Deep slits moved with each breath it took making the neck look like it was pulsating. The corners of it's hideous mouth reached all the way back to where ears would be, if it had any. It's lips parted to reveal two rows of sharp teeth, bits of flesh and plant caught in between them. As it's mouth opened wider the bottom jaw looked like it disconnected creating a huge opening to see down it's throat. I kicked wildly with my good foot, desperate to break it's hold on me.  Adrenaline kicked in and I pushed the light on the top of my camera right into it's eye. The flash went off in its face and the scream it let out wasn't like anything I'd ever heard before. 

I swam as hard as I could despite the pain in my ankle, broke the surface and scrambled on board. I limped to the helm and locked myself in. I could hear pounding from the underside of the boat and sharp screaming came in short bursts all through the night. I clutched my camera to my chest, my only scrap of evidence. Only once was I brave enough to look out over the water and I wish I hadn't. Slowly circling the boat, just inches above the surface, was the creatures arm holding up Alans head.

4hqzva,9,2016-05-03,"Is being a developer supposed to be ""easy""? Not sure how to gauge my failures.",exquisitesunshine,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hqzva/is_being_a_developer_supposed_to_be_easy_not_sure/,"I apologize for the naive question but as a graduating CS student I have been extremely depressed. I changed to a CS major 2 years ago and have coded for the first time 2 semesters ago. I am currently struggling with coding despite getting a grasp of the basics and on top of having zero experience (no internships or side projects yet, planning on working hard this summer to improve on coding), I am a slow learner in general and was never a math person (not that I did poorly). 

When I changed to CS major with the goal of becoming a developer, I realize that as a programmer you will need to constantly learn and keep up with the latest trends in order to separate yourself from many others who are entering the CS field. I have been depressed for a while now because I see so many people in my class who have started with programming and have dealt with the command line ever since they started school or has done so much during their high school years while I still feel like I've just started. I know some that work super hard and are top of the class but can't even land interviews with Google. On top of that, it seems like people around me just pick it up much easier. My professor graduated with a degree in psychology, then got a law degree, then finally a PHD in CS. My friend started as a hardware engineer then becomes a software developer for IBM. There is an Arch Linux developer who does his job as a hobby--he's a full-time surgeon.

How do I cope with the possibility that I can realistically never be as successful as some of these people? Every day I wake up with a plan in my head to work as productively as possible and have removed distractions in my life but when I get to learning how to code, I feel like I don't know how to learn in a productive manner. Any time I see something I don't understand, I google or look for a Youtube video but I feel like this isn't what successful people in the field do and it might be better if I read a textbook from start to finish. I might get easily dissuaded when I don't understand explanations as I'm searching for an answer. I don't know anything about the market--what set of skills are sought after, what combination of languages to pickup, what niches are in demand, what roles there are in a company, where the industry is going, etc. Despite all this, I always fantasize myself one day becoming a competent developer that can write programs to fit people's needs on my own, yet I've made little progress thus far and any progress that I've made are frankly quite pathetic given what is expected of me as a graduating CS major.

Sorry for my incoherent post.

I am looking to anyone who works or has worked within Networking / Servers / and Cloud server/networking


I have an second/final stage interview on Friday and the only thing I was lacking in the first interview was Networking knowledge.


I was told to know some stuff by the next interview!!
I have bought and am reading bits of the Networking For Dummies 9 in 1 book.


The servers run on a linux system, they have cloud servers also. 
This is for an intern job so I only need to know basics but I want to firmly suggest I know my stuff! 


They have also mentioned DNS and DHCP to know about.


Could anyone give me any bullet point topics to read about and if youre feeling generous with your time some key jargon words to go with it?
I want to impress them by knowing some key things about networking and network maintenance when im coming from a non-networking university background.


Thank you in advance

4hs6ps,1,2016-05-03,At what point should I start applying to jobs?,wheresthelight,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4hs6ps/at_what_point_should_i_start_applying_to_jobs/,"I'm at the point where I have some ok projects under my belt (mainly the front end ones from freecodecamp), I can get through all the easy level algorithm, implementation, string, and data structure problems on hacker rank while only referring to documentation.

I feel proficient in Python, HTML, css, and JavaScript. I still feel like there's so much to learn though like getting github down and understanding backend stuff and databases, etc.

I'm currently going through FCC right now and I'm solving the majority of the algorithm problems with ease. The projects are currently on codepen which I will be transferring over to github once I'm done the frontend part.

I have several electrical engineering internships under my belt, but no degree. I got accepted into App Academy recently, but it was conditional and they would only accept me if I paid a deposit to secure my place, which I just couldn't afford due to my financial situation. I didn't read the fine print well enough and assumed the entirety of the program would be free, until you get the job. And the grads of that program reportedly make 100k in SanFran and 90k in NYC.

So I figured, if I'm capable of getting into a program of that caliber (~5% acceptance rate), I'm probably capable of self learning my way into a decent job, if I work hard enough. Currently, I spend the majority of my days just learning and doing projects. But I've been going at this hard for several months now, and I'm still not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

So is it probable or even possible for someone like me (no degree remember) to land a good paying job? I'm definitely not expecting 90-100k, especially outside of SF and NYC...but is it realistic to shoot for something in the 60-70k range? And if this is possible, when should I be applying for jobs?

 Ideally I want to wait until I feel fully prepared, but I hear that you never feel fully prepared. My goal is to finish everything on FCC (except the nonprofit projects) by July, while still going through supplemental resources like pluralsight, etc. and then start applying to places.

Sorry this got long.

Tldr: at what point in your self-learning should you start applying to jobs, and is it realistic to expect a 60-70k salary with no degree?"

As per the title, I’m after a software engineering internship that will span 6 months. I have already completed a 6 month internship, looking to get another under my belt. I’m comfortable working in Java, Android, HTML/CSS, JS and PHP. A full stack developer internship would be ideal, but something more focused could be just as interesting. I have experience with a range of other languages, frameworks and technologies as well – so if you’re after something specific, shoot me a message. 

I won’t bog this down with the run-of-the-mill “Hard working, focused, enthusiastic” shtick - hopefully any potential employer out there will pick that up on their own, after the first interaction with me. 

Hoping to start immediately. If you’re looking to add a good hand to your development team, please get in touch.

So a little background information, I am going into my second year in a four year university for Computer Science and I just had my first phone interview for a SAP/Software Development internship position at an electric company. I've had job interviews before that I've aced pretty well, but those were in person and it was just for things like a tech store, or a boba shop, so I don't think those compare to the internship interviews. Pretty much I had a 30 minute interview schedule for today. The recruiter asked me pretty standard questions such as, tell me about your experience at your old job, and some coding projects that you did, what are your strengths and weaknesses, and then the rest of the time she was talking about the job position and what I would be doing and what's available for me. We never really got off track, but the interview seemed very natural and not awkward whatsoever. Most of my responses she responded with a genuinely sounding ""awesome!"" or ""that's great!"" When it came to when she asked me if I had any questions for her, I asked things like what's the company culture like, and if I were to get hired, what type of things what would I be primarily doing. All and all I felt pretty good about the interview because it somewhat felt like a nice conversation. One thing is, the interview only last 15 minutes instead of the said 30 minutes, and from what I hear from others, they usually end the conversation with something along the lines of ""Okay if you got the job you'll hear from us within a week."" However, I didn't get that and the way the interview ended was just after I asked her questions and then we wrapped things up with her saying ""Okay if you have any more questions about the position feel free to email me."" After the interview I gave her a follow up thank you for the interview and now I'm just here wondering if I did well. If anyone could drop some insight on how you think I did or if I have a good chance of getting the job, I'd greatly appreciate it."

I'm currently a chemical engineering major looking to change to computer engineering due to an internship I had working with embedded devices and software development. The only problem is I've already done 3 semesters of courses and thus will be slightly behind on core courses when it comes to switching. However, due to AP credit, I already have all of my calculus, chemistry, physics, and gen eds complete. This means that hours-wise, I'm slightly ahead of where a normal compE would be. 


Do you think it's doable to finish the degree in 5 semesters and not push my graduation back? I have a scholarship that only covers 8 semesters, so I'd really like to do this if possible. I only have 70 hours left, so I could average  14 hours / semester which sounds doable to me. A compE who followed the plan would have 78 hours left due to gen eds, physics, and calculus requirements. 


Any thoughts? I may rethink changing if it will likely push my graduation back. 


Also, I plan on talking to an adviser soon, but since I'm currently away from school on an internship, I won't be able to for a few more weeks. "

So I have a really low GPA (below 2.5) and put on probation once, but it was because of the GE classes. Looking at my transcript, while I maintain at least a C+ or B in my engineering classes, the ones that I received a D- or D are english, history, and all that crap. 

I had a really challenging freshmen and sophomore year because my dad died and my mom was in depression and unable to work for 2 years, I basically have to work a full time job and full time student to support her and my little sister. At the time, I really didn't know what I was going to do. I was majoring in Chemistry but I was really tired from overwork myself, and I took a bunch of irrelevant courses that didn't interest me. After my mom finally back to work and can take care of herself, I had more time to really think about what I want to do, and by the time I got back up on my feet, my grades already bit the dust. I already used 1/2 of the course forgiveness to make up for those dumb History and political science classes, but I still got about 3 more courses that are below a C-. The GPA has prevented me from applying to many internships and jobs that I want. And I really hate myself for letting myself slide for those completely unnecessary courses that I could have done better.

I really want to choose Waterloo SE because as a US citizen, the end goal is to work in SV and I know that Waterloo SE is pretty much the best option for that.  The very real possibility of getting coops in Cali makes Waterloo seem like the obvious choice.  If it weren't for the Schulich scholarship I would not even be considering going to UofT.

My CS teacher in High School always encouraged my growing passion and kept talking about how I will have no issues at all getting a job right out of college because everything computer science is in such a high demand right now. However, I recently discovered this subreddit and I see more and more people complaining that they're still without a job after graduating months ago.

Is this seriously a common occurrence? I know CS is my passion but this outlook that I found on here kinda made me nauseous…

Also, I will obviously try to do internships, etc. but is it really that bleak of an outlook without?

Plus, how much is attending a state school in Florida gonna hurt me? I see people from very prestigious schools around here who struggle to find a job and I'm worried how bad my chances are with a state degree in a not so much state of the art area which is Florida."

I posted about having a hard time finding an internship in the Southern California region where you have to compete with UCLA, UCI, USC etc etc for internships.  Well lo and behold I just received an offer for a medium sized corp here in LA after having an interview last week! The interview questions were not too bad, I had to reverse a string, write a Linked List from scratch, and finally write some simple sql queries. Needless to say I am beyond happy as my first real experience in the field.

I have to say thanks to those who gave some great advice in that thread, particularly /u/c4t3rp1ll4r and /u/programstuff. My advice to anyone in the same position is to read what they had to say and build projects. Also, many of the callbacks I was getting were interested in my C#/ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI skills so it seems like that tech is very in demand, at least in my region."
4hvws4,2,2016-05-04,Had an expunged charge show up on pre-employment background check. Where will it go from here?,KimJongUn_stoppable,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4hvws4/had_an_expunged_charge_show_up_on_preemployment/,"Hi guys

I recently got an internship offer pending a background check for PNC Bank. I took a fingerprint test, expecting things to go alright. However, I just received a phone call from an HR person saying a charge showed up, ""Sale Liquor Underage,"" and asked me to explain what happened. I was surprised to hear this because I had the charge expunged, expecting something like this not to happen.

A little background on what happened: my school began to get a reputation for being a party school, so police began to crack down on freshman. I was out one night and had a little too much. Not sure how, but I eventually got arrested for underage consumption, taken in, and booked. The charge was for underage consumption, but in my local jurisdiction, apparently there is a universal charge called ""sale liquor underage."" I was not convicted.

Now, I'm pretty worried about what this will mean about my internship offer. The guy I spoke to said that my offer will be put on hold for review, but expects that the other won't be revoked permanently. Now, I don't know if he was just saying that or truly thought that. The charge was 2.5 years ago and my resume shows that the charge is not a reflection of my character.

This is really concerning because I thought this was over and in the past. I didn't expect it to come back and haunt me; it didn't for other internships. But I want to know if anyone has any experience with something like this or familiarity about the law. I also hope that I can people's opinions about how this will affect my offer. Now, I realize that the readers are not my employer, so their answers aren't certain, but I'm worrying and am looking for some advice on what exactly is happening with this.

So, my questions are this:
1) What is the law in Ohio for expunged records on background checks? Does the Ohio law apply here, since PNC operates across states. Also, my job is in Chicago, IL.

2) Can this be used against me in the hiring process?

3) Do they have access to the police report from the incident?"

So maybe you guys have some advice for me as well.

My CV is a mess: Dropped out of Electrical Engineering, then started an [apprenticeship](https://www.matse-ausbildung.de/uploads/media/Profil_Englisch.pdf) in software development but had to quit after having completed 2/3 of it due to mental healthy issues (which is fun, since it turns out there's a reason for messing up that much in the past). Kept going to school though and will have at least some kind of paper in the end.

Now that I am back on track I though about finding an Internship first to gain some experience. Apart from a few small school projects I don't have anything to show yet so what kind of small project could I work on to put on github? Maybe something less common is better than yet another blog or pong?

Working on open source projects seems to be fun and rewarding, yet when I ""explore"" on github I end up with rather big and complex pieces of software. Are there any websites that could recommend something more manageable?

I have experience mostly in Java yet browsing jobs it seems most are about maintaining ancient customer or warehouse database applications and websites based on JSP and took like they were designed in the late 90ies.

Yet would it be best to go for one of those jobs and stay there for a while to get some references? Or rather hop onto something I am enthusiastic about although I don't have a lot of experience with it?

How honest should I be regarding the past and mental illness? Won't it sound like an excuse? On the other hand, what's the point in coming up with a weird explanation as to why things turned out the way they did?

Cheers!"

1. Java EE (school project that had to be in Java)
2. C# MVC (internship and a freelance gig for a couple of months)
3. Rails (one project because I was thinking on switching to rails)
4. Nodejs/MEAN stack (currently working on my own project in this and on a freelancing project)

So first I thought C# is awesome I like it and started going that route, then a few of my friends started doing Rails and I thought I'll give it a try. After that I wanted to see what's up with the whole Node thing and I like it a lot.

So is it possible to kind of go back and forth between these frameworks or is it just better to stick to one?

And do you think it's smart to go the node.js route even do I do know other languages/frameworks?"

I recently just graduated High School, and I was incredibility grateful to get an internship with my school districts IT department, and because I did so well during the internship I was hired when it was over. So, now I have this amazing job right off the bat, 18 year old with a 24k salary. 

Now, my problem is I'm not sure what to do? I am doing college currently but it is the end of my second semester at my community college, and I hate it. I have a chance to stop going next semester and I believe I am going to stop attending. I hate not being able to directly study my field, I very much want to get into the IT career path and learn more than I already know about Information Technology, I really love IT so far and I've always loved working with computers, so I know this is the career path I want, and I am primarily looking to be apart of IT security, but that is down the road.

I am not sure if I should continue with my current community college taking silly courses that do not even pertain to my field or should I go right for my certifications, like A+, Microsoft and Apple cert's.

Please I really need help with this, I am not sure weather the path is obvious or not, and it is really putting stress on me.

This is my first Reddit post - Please be gentle :)

I feel like I could be such a better person. Not in an ethical way but in a hey that guy is pretty interesting kind of way. I spend a lot of my free time running and watching movies so i am pretty physically fit which is one of the things which I never really stress about anymore unlike high school where most of my stress came from running performances. Now it is a complete 180 where I am now stressed about pretty much everything else and not running at all and it is kind of overwhelming. Here is what I am specifically worried about right now:

Summer plans. Im upset i couldn't get an internship or at least an interview for some summer position and my options right now are working at the patent office across the country for no money where I would live with my aunt and uncle and know no one else (most people will at least juniors in college interested in law degrees) or stay at home working a job as a tutor/retail position both of which are really boring to me and I'm not sure what to do about this. 

my friends are great people but next year stuff will be changing because I am staying on campus taking on a random roommate which I am nervous about now because it will mean I will likely be living with a freshmen which isn't exactly appealing to me right now. 

major. actually not too worried about my grades so I guess thats a plus. 

relationships. so this girl has seemed to be very into me over the past 3 to 4 weeks and I never really had an opinion one way or another and then after she texts me first a few days ago she seems less interested now and idk if I screwed up but I think I just wanted her to like me but i'm not sure if I actually had feelings for her as well (i thought I did at points but others I didnt) so i'm not really sure what to think about this at all and that kinda worries me.  


So the reason all of these feelings are catching up with me here could be a couple of events. the leading theory in my mind is that in last July I was really into this one girl and she appeared to be into me as well where she gave me all the signs you could think of that all of our friends were really excited for it and then bam she said she was never into me at all and actually thought I was extremely annoying so that sort of ended and it upset me a lot I guess considering I never was in a relationship and this was truly heartbreaking for me. 

So what should I do? How can i figure out my life? I need a goal to work towards so what should that goal be right now? 

any advice is appreciated even if it just you telling me a story about something you went through that might be related in a single aspect or not at all. "

I really want to make sure I work on something really interesting and cutting-edge.

[The ABA just celebrated the 50 year anniversary of the Miranda decision - are there any recent (last 10-15 years\) Supreme Court criminal decisions that come close to the massive effect of that ruling? If so, what case and how?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tu4h8?context=5)|There are two cases that come immediately to mind. THe first is a Supreme Court case called Booker in which the Supreme Court decided that the mandatory nature of U.S. sentencing guidelines was unconstitutional. THat presented a sea change in federal sentencing law.
[(I'm a young civil defense lawyer but criminal law still fascinates me\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tu4h8?context=5)|The second case is Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts. That came out in 2009. The Supreme Court held that the prosecutor in a criminal case can't use sworn affidavits to substitute for witness testimony in a criminal case. That changed the way criminal cases, particularly drug cases or cases involving DNA evidence, are presented by the government. Before this case, the government would try to use sworn certificates to prove authenticity of drugs that had been seized. This case held that that procedure was unconstitutional, because it didn't allow for the defense to cross-examines who had taken the action that led to the creation of these affidavits. 
[What is a bit of advice you would give to someone considering going to law school?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tsewu?context=5)|To me, it doesn't make good sense to go to law school unless you want to actually practice law. There are some people who would say a legal education is a good education unto itself, but I disagree, particularly because of the cost and the time and energy involved in pursuing a law degree.
 |I highly encourage people to pursue internships before they decide to go to law school. For me, I did an internship with the Public Defender's Service in Washington, DC as an investigator when I was 23. That was what made me want to be a public defender.
[If you needed to hire a defense attorney, what should you look for?...  Is there a checklist that you would recommend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tuecj?context=5)|I would look for someone who is an extremely hard worker, who specializes in criminal defense work, and is accessible. The last thing you want to do is hire someone to represent you in a criminal case who, for example, is the cousin of a friend who is primarily a real estate lawyer that sometimes takes on criminal cases.
 |It's sort of like picking a surgeon who is going to operate on you. You need to be very sure they have the experience and skill before you let them cut you.
[When new students enter law school, what percentage claim they want to practice criminal law? Due to so many TV shows and movies it is the type of lawyer that is the highest profile - I often wonder how/why people gravitate or end up in the other types of law? How easy a decision was this for you and when did you know for certain where you were going?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tttrk?context=5)|The reason I wanted to become a criminal defense lawyer is because I was in the Big Brother program when I was in college. Through my interactions with my Little Brother and his family, I saw how terrifying and fraught with problems the criminal justice system is. Then, I did an internship right out of college as an investigator at the Pubic Defender's Service in DC where I investigated rape cases, homicides, etc. on behalf of indigent clients and that is what made me want to be a public defender. After I entered law school, I was totally focused on that goal.
[Have you ever turned someone down because you thought they were guilty?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tsjps?context=5)|The short answer is no. One of the key purposes of my job is to represent someone to the best of my ability. Whether they committed the act that they are accused of is irrelevant to that goal. The whole point of the criminal justice system is that every person gets the best representation possible.
 |For example, I've had many cases where I've represented people who had committed one of the ten acts they were charged with by the government. 
[Has the recent decriminalization of marijuana in DC increased your caseload at all? Do you have an opinion on the decriminalization of Marijuana?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2tt068?context=5)|The decriminalization of marijuana has not had an effect on my caseload in particular. But, I agree and believe that marijuana should be decriminalized, both because of its proven medicinal benefits and because it has been used to justify unconstitutional actions by law enforcement for several generations. 
[Why do prosecutors engage in prosecutorial misconduct? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4hzyjg/i_am_david_benowitz_a_criminal_defense_attorney/d2ttqqc?context=5)|My belief is that some prosecutors engage in it because they don't know any better, and haven't been trained properly.

4i0rai,3,2016-05-05,I lowballed badly for my desired salary and not sure what to do moving forward?,throwitawayyyyyy12,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4i0rai/i_lowballed_badly_for_my_desired_salary_and_not/,"Hi all, I frequent reddit but have never posted and made an account specifically for this issue. I'll try to keep it short and relevant. I hope I'm posting in the right subreddit!

I graduated with a BS in Biology in December with intentions of working to save money and eventually start my masters (probably going to pursue an MPH) within a year to a year and a half after graduation. I started my job search a couple months ago and received 3 calls for interviews. One was a temp agency that didnt have openings now but said they probably would in the summer (and its temp to hire which is cool). The other was also a temp agency that was offering a temporary technician position at $15/hour but frequent weekends and 12 hour shifts. With other obligations, this would be difficult to commit to although I was willing to make it work if nothing else came forward.

Then comes an interview with a position I know I'm under qualified for yet applied to anyway. It's a position as an analytical chemist for a small pharmaceutical company. It's conveniently just a couple miles away from my house. I frantically research and prepare for the interview as best as possible while perplexed as to why I was even being called in (My only experience is an internship for one semester in a fly lab).
I didn't look into what people make at this company and it didnt even cross my mind. I dont come from a family of professionals and I've always been taught to hold onto anything you can get, no matter the pay. Given what I know entry level bio lab techs make and the fact that I'm not qualified to be a chemist, I write $13/hour under ""desired salary"" on their forms. I know it was probably beyond idiotic having done no research, but I cant go back now.
A couple days later, I go on Glassdoor and see that chemists are making $25.45/hour at this company. I get a call yesterday for a job offer and when I inquired about the salary and mentioned renegotiation and that I requested something lower than I'm comfortable with, the woman who interviewed me said that her boss agreed to the salary I wrote and I can revisit a raise in 6 months based on my performance.
I took the position (I start on June 3) and I'm just confused as to how I know what salary I deserve. I have no experience essentially and I have to be trained thoroughly (about 3 weeks) for this position, yet I'll be making $12 less hourly than those around me. Also, 2-3 weeks is for basic training and if I perform well then I may later be trained on utilizing HPLC analysis among other more advanced techniques.
I know I technically asked for it, but is my pay reasonable? What should I ask for in terms of a raise in the coming 6 months and how do I discern if I even deserve a raise? I'm really confused and I'm not necessarily upset but I dont want to get screwed over or get paid less than I'm worth. At the same time, my job search hasn't been totally successful and I was willing to apply to retail jobs just so I could save for grad school.

TL;DR I'm going to be paid $12/hour less than my coworkers but Im less qualified, have no experience, and need ample training. Also, the experience I'm gaining is invaluable. Am i being screwed over? Should I do something about it, I don't even know what to do D: I'd love some feedback"
4i0vs9,128,2016-05-05,Tips for new starters (looking for your ideas),QiuYiDio,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/4i0vs9/tips_for_new_starters_looking_for_your_ideas/,"Hello all - in anticipation of the onslaught of interns and new starters about to hit our subreddit, I've been working on a ""tips for new starters"" wiki page over the last few weeks. I think I've got a decent start below, but would love to include anything else the community might think of.  Looking forward reading your ideas!

**Staffing**

- There are four major levers for staffing: function, industry, team, location – when you start, it is unlikely to be able to pull all 4 levers at the same time, so prioritize which is most important to you

- You have the highest acceptable margin for error when you are early in tenure, so that is the best time to take risks or try something different

- Signals of a harder project: first project with client, due diligences, client is a former consultant, brand new Manager, Senior Manager on cusp of partnership

- The staffing game is played around the clock – even if you are currently staffed, making the right connections will help you get on that dream project down the line

 - Read the Wiki for tips about life on the bench

**Starting a Project**

- Read the SOW and clearly understand the ultimate goal of the project

- Read as much as you can about the client and industry!  Use Google News, 10Ks, internal knowledge sites, and research reports

- Set up Google Alerts for the client, its major competitors, and the industry

- Clarify with yourself what you want out of the project – if seeking a promotion, it is helpful to look at your firm’s promotion criteria

- Have a team introduction where everyone shares their strengths, desired areas for improvement, work habits, and lifestyle needs – pay extra attention to those of your Manager’s!

- Obtain your Manager’s / Partners’ favorite decks – this will allow you to stylistically mirror what they already like

- Obtain the organizational chart of the client (or at least draw one for the key stakeholders you will be working with)

- Take the lead on planning team dinners and events

- Set up feedback sessions in your Manager’s calendar - feedback is critical to improving your performance

 

**Slides**

- Before opening PowerPoint, write the storyline on paper

- After writing the storyline but before opening PowerPoint, write the leads/taglines for each slide on paper

- After writing the storyline and leads/taglines, but before opening PowerPoint, draw out your slide deck on paper

- After drawing your slide deck on paper but before opening PowerPoint, review it with your Manager

- Make sure all graphs, axes, units are clearly labelled

- If creating a deck by committee, align with entire team on abbreviations, units, and all other stylistic concerns

- Learn and memorize shortcuts!  A tool like KeyRocket can help

- Start compiling a folder of killer slides

- Proofread – after you’ve finished, proof read it again.

- Make sure all numbers across your deck tie together

- If your firm has slide production, outsource as much as humanly possible to them – before going to sleep every night, consider what they could help you do to make life easier

- Check your outsourced slides when they return

 

**Modeling**

- Fully agree with team and client on the desired outputs of the model

- Before opening Excel, sketch out the model structure and how it will link together – use a separate sheet of paper for each tab that you envision - review it with your manager 

- Keep all raw data files together and untouched in model – modify as needed on new tabs

- Keep all assumptions together (on one tab, or a set of assumptions tabs) and source them

- Do not hard code anything within formulas!

- Within the model, create a separate column for “units”

- Index / Match is a much more flexible and faster way to do lookups

- Early on, anchor yourself on several key outputs for ongoing sense checks – as you develop the model further, refer back to the numbers to see if they have changed or not

- Learn and memorize shortcuts!  A tool like KeyRocket can help

 

**Client Interaction**

- Before going into any meeting, visualize and understand the desired outcome

- Don’t be late

- Understand who you are meeting with – their role, their expertise, their politics, how much they know about the project, how much they should know about the project

- It is better to lead the client to the right answer or help the build it, as opposed to giving it to them

- Be in the mindset of a good client advisor – clients are not always right, and it is our job to tell them so in an appropriate way; earlier in your career, you should go through your Managers first before engaging the client

- Open ended questions are much more useful than binary questions – questions that make clients introspective are even more useful (‘what if’-type questions)

- Look out for opportunities to connect clients with the firm’s expertise

 

**Travel**

- See wiki article

 

**Tech**

- See wiki article


EDIT:

Other thoughts:

- Check-in and check-out with your Manager daily

- Send an 'end-of-week' summary email to your manager

- If you are unsure about something critical, form an opinion but ask for clarification from your Manager - do not assume!  If you must assume something you are uncomfortable with, note it as clearly as possible

- Go to the office on Fridays and try to get involved in office activities to build your network"

Since then I've been applying for jobs non-stop in the Sacramento area and I just landed 3 interviews within the course of a week. The first 2 went very well and just today I've received offers from both of them. One is at a small tech company and they're offering me $20/hour (this one has a 30 minute commute), the other is in a University lab as a paid intern for $12-15 an hour with the ability to hire on full time for potentially more in the future (no commute). I think I would be very happy with either of these jobs. The last interview, however, isn't until tomorrow and it's with a large tech company which would likely be the best job out of the three (also no commute).

&amp;nbsp;

My question is should I accept one of the two I've already landed or should I tell them I need time to think and wait until my interview with the third company?"
4i174i,2,2016-05-05,FaceOSC help,deathlymonkey,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4i174i/faceosc_help/,"Hey there guys! I'm not sure this is the right sub to ask but I'll go ahead anyway.

For a summer internship project, I have to get used to working with FaceOSC (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker), an openframeworks facetracking application based on ofxFaceTracker and ofxCv. 

The problem is...I have literally no idea how to get it running. I've read a bunch about it in the past few days and did a LOT of googling, but I just can't seem to find anything. Almost every link I find says to just run the application, but it's not working for me. I can't get it running and I can't find an appropriate program to run it and collect data (I'm on Windows).

I have very limited experience with GitHub and I have never used openFrameworks before (managed to install it and ofxCv) so that might be the issue.

Has anyone ever used the application? I would love any input or story with the software.

Thanks a lot! If this isn't the right place to ask such a question, feel free to tell me where I should post about it."

4i1py1,5,2016-05-05,"Feeling stuck in QA hell, need advice",escape_of_da_keets,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4i1py1/feeling_stuck_in_qa_hell_need_advice/,"I graduated summa with my BS in CS from a decent school and a heavy C/C++ background a few years ago and got an internship at an embedded systems company doing QA work. I wasn't thrilled at first, as I wanted to go into development and ended up doing a lot of manual testing that was very monotonous - but I decided to tough it out as almost everyone I'd talked to said that QA was pretty much the only path to development.

After about six months they gave me an offer for a full-time position doing basically the same stuff and I took it. I had a conversation with my manager saying that I eventually wanted to get into some kind of development and we reached a sort of mutual understanding that we'd work towards it. Eventually I started getting heavy into automation stuff and I'm now pretty respected in that aspect (I was promoted, and one of only a few people recognized in a meeting for the entire organization), but it was always and still is mostly on the side to manual testing.

Now I've been working here for over two years and feel like I've made no progress at all. I made a lot of headway on one team to the point where I was actually fixing bugs that I found in the product code, but my company changes teams around often and every time I get onto a new team I feel like I'm starting all over again. This happened again very recently and I felt like I just gave up, and that management was just throwing me bones and making empty promises to keep me happy and keep me doing what I've been doing. At this point I don't know what to do; I voiced my dissatisfaction to my manager but it just feels like the same old shit. I'm not happy at work. I don't feel challenged. I feel bitter and disappointed in myself and I feel like I'm never going to fulfill my dreams, and I'm worried that my skillset is decaying and I'll have an even harder time finding the job I want in the future if I decide to leave.

I don't know if I should try to just draw the line or look for a new job. Any advice would be appreciated."

4i25k7,2,2016-05-05,Shade in my life,Tearlyn,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4i25k7/shade_in_my_life/,"Alright so I did what I know for a fact I shouldn't have done, I did the ritual from ""Cigarettes"" honestly I think I'm going mad now. I have had nightmares ever since I have done this stupid ritual and I'm paying the price, this is overall just a warning for all of you people who are trying to do rituals for the fun of it, its extremely dangerous for yourself. 

Now here it goes for when I did it. I did the ritual as instructed, I used a bathroom at a Gas Station, I had a pack of Marlboro's on me. I immediately checked around my general vicinity to make sure nobody was around to disrupt the ritual, thankfully not. I checked my clock on my phone to make sure it was past 12 I flicked the lights, then I started smoking the pack (I only bought them for the use of the ritual I barely smoke as is) as I looked at the mirror my eyes did start to water a little. The room did not get as filled with smoke as I expected but it will went onward. The eyes formed as expected and the Shade asked for a smoke, I passed it one. (Honestly should have ran out right then) it asked for a light of course, when I lit the cigarette for it, the shade began to relax and enjoy itself.

I started to ask it a bunch quick yes or no questions that could be easily predicted in the future, since it is supposed to be all knowing (No I did not think to ask how to time travel and cure deadly diseases honestly just didn't think of it at that time). I asked it a dire question ""When will I die?"" I kid you not, the Shade's mouth materialized and almost looked as if it were grinning almost as if it predicted what will have happened next. Of all things it didn't tell me, I guess the rules in ""Cigarettes""  left something out. I looked at the cigarette and it immediately started to burn up even faster. I chad to speed up the rest of the ritual, I snatched out its eyes, and they started to burn hotter than the flames of Hell (Ever burn your hand on the stove? Picture that times around 8000). I ran and flicked the lights on as soon as I grabbed the eyes. I kept my hand closed until 4 AM, even though it said 3 AM I wasn't going to take a chance. I said aloud to myself ""Well that was fun..."". I opened my hand and I cant even describe how odd the burn marks looked. 

So now my current life situation with the Shade. He is pissed, royally pissed I can tell that much. So, as the ritual goes I've had nightmares every night, some make me awake immediately (Those are good nights, usually can fall back to sleep). I don't even bother paying for heating or air conditioning anymore since I'm always cold. (Similar to a cold feeling after it rains in early spring to give you an idea) You may or may not believe this, its fine if so. Every day drags on and feels as if Monday everyday. 

So I still need to work like the rest of you, unfortunately my small brain decided not to ask for the power ball numbers. When I went into the bathroom at work an intern thought it would hilarious to turn off the lights. (Shit got real, real quickly) So as I start to get out of there (Was washing my hands, or I would have never got out) As soon as I started to make a bee line to the door I heard a few dogs behind me, I could tell they were the Shade's hell hounds. From the way they sounded running I would have guessed about four or five. (Could have been more) Got to the door in time and got out. Overall not a lovely experience. I know that it is one powerful Shade of all the luck...

Life has been difficult believe it or not, the whole minor miracles thing is like winning a five dollar scratch off or being first in line for the cash register. Would not say they are miracles but hey, there they are. Please do not try it, its more of a hassle than its truly worth.

4i27z2,0,2016-05-05,Am I qualified for an Android development position in SF?,abacona,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4i27z2/am_i_qualified_for_an_android_development/,"It's been my dream since I was 15 to live in SF (for many reasons besides just tech), and I am graduating with a degree in CS in 3 weeks. I didn't focus on much programming outside of class until 2016 (wrongly assumed that my degree would be 'good enough'), but I have been hitting it hard since February 2016. I already have a job lined up, and it's ok, but it's not in SF and it's not really something I want to do for longer than I have to (Salesforce programming). I was wondering if the following experience would be enough to land me a junior android position, or if I should continue learning and studying before shifting my focus to a job search...




* This year I won prizes at 2 MLH Hackathons for Android projects, one of which I did most of the coding and project planning (to be fair there were a lot of prizes awarded at the Hackathon where I led the efforts)
* Contributed somewhat at a 3rd Hackathon (web app project, also this year). First time ever doing web dev beyond HTML/CSS) so it was mostly learning the basics 
* Android development internship (over a year ago) for a tiny startup in SF. On my resume I claim this is where I learned Android development, but in all honesty I didn't learn a damn thing here. I ended up learning Android a year later (Feb2016 - now) on my own. Most of my team worked remote, and I was largely neglected for the duration of the 'internship', even though I was paid $25/hr. I felt like Bighead from Silicon Valley, but even more neglected because I was 'working' remote! I would be amazed if they ever used a single line of my code. I was only hired because I taught the CEO's daughter to code on the weekends via Skype. I was let go when they realized I was useless and that they couldn't really teach an intern remotely with their resources.
* Small Android projects here and there, mostly stuff I've modified from the online courses I've taken to add functionality, or things I've hacked together (API's etc) just to see what would happen. No large projects that were written from scratch (that I'm proud of).
* I'm a good speaker and have strong soft skills



Given enough time, I could probably write a basic Android application that works how it should. I'm pretty confident in my ability figure out how to use a majority of the more common libraries (Butterknife etc). I understand how Android deals with memory management in different states etc. I've learned a lot outside of class and while I'm not amazing, I'm a better programmer than a lot of the CS students at my school (which is not saying a whole lot).



**Weaknesses:**

* School doesn't offer an algorithms course, and I'm only 1/3 of the way through the Stanford Coursera course
* Major GPA of 3.2, Cumulative GPA 3.1 (school is not terrible, but not amazing either. CS program here is not amazing)
* No great projects or internship contributions to show off. The other internships I did were teaching CS to kids, and an IT position I took because I only had a few weeks of the summer to work (was studying abroad).
* Interviewed at Guidewire and Addepar in NYC/SF, didn't make it past their first round interview, but was able to solve the problems with a little help. However, these weren't Android positions, they were just systems development and data engineering interviews. (got in thru alumni connections)



Would I be wasting my time looking for positions now? I feel like I could be more confident in my abilities by the end of summer. Should I be spending all of my time learning, or looking for jobs? Should I do both? What can I expect?

Thanks!!"

It is their understanding that I don't know any python, and they are fine with that.

Instead of sitting back and waiting, I've started learning. I've read some docs, played with some code, and did googles python class with the activities. I've also used the built in unittest module a bit--still have more work to do here, and looked at other testing frameworks like nose and py.test.

What else should I do to prepare myself? I've watched several python talks hosted by google on youtube to get a feel for the python way of doing things, but am looking for insight on what else I should take a look at before my first day.

4i2xpp,0,2016-05-05,Computer Science student IT intern for '16 Summer,ttrigger10,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/4i2xpp/computer_science_student_it_intern_for_16_summer/,"Hello,

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student and am going to be interning for a big company here starting in late May. I am super excited, but also kind of nervous about it. I met my supervisor last month and he has been emailing me about some of what I will be doing over the course of the summer months.

Here's one of them: 

John,
I wanted to connect with you and let you know we are excited to have you join us this summer for an internship.  We are working through project assignments and activities and have aligned you with my team.  I lead our integration team for SAP which includes cross-functional SAP efforts, escalation and problem management, IT process and metrics, and working with our business partners and super users. We have a lot going on and are glad to have you join us this summer. 

Best regards,

My supervisor



Now my problem is this... I have not worked with SAP at all. In fact, I have rarely heard of it before he emailed me and I did a few google searches. However, I feel like I have learned a lot from the many classes I have taken at my University. 

Classes taken:

Java I            Operating Systems       Database Management Systems       Discrete Math for Computing
Java II           Networking I                VBA Programming in Excel              Data Structures with Python
Java III          Networking II               Computer Assembler/Architecture    Calculus I and II


As you can see I have taken no SAP classes. I have checked out a few books from the university library that are introductions to SAP, but from what I have seen it is a very broad broad field. I am not too worried because I informed my supervisor I have had no experience with SAP. He said that's perfectly fine and that the first week or two is training anyway. 

I am a good student with a good GPA and am a hard worker. Does anyone have any advice for me in what I can further do to get prepared for my first REAL job? Mowing lawns and laying concrete the past 3 summers don't count in the Computer world I'd assume :P I'm thinking some of the SQL statements and concepts used in my Database class will be useful?

I am considering majoring in CS but I haven't decided yet. 

I have little programming experience aside from the fact that I have taken two programming classes in high school (Advanced computer math and AP computer science). These classes covered only basic java programming (Arrays, Arraylist, Greenfoot, processing, PracticeIt). I didn't completely suck but I don't feel like I excelled in these classes either. I don't think these two classes alone are a fair representation of the CS as a whole, and I would like more exposure to the field to see if it is right for me. 

I have a whole summer before college that I plan to be productive in. I have a job to earn some money and save up for a laptop. I plan to start reading and exercising. I'd love to add CS to this list if possible! 

What advice do some of you CS veterans out there have for an upcoming college freshman? What is there that I can do over the summer to expose me to CS and maybe help me become a better programmer overall? Perhaps i could get a jump start on college and teach myself some programming? I feel like only good things can come from this because if I find that I don't like programming very much then I'll know before I even get into college that CS is NOT right for me. 

Is there anyway I could get an internship or something similar with little to no real programming experience? If not, what paths should I take to ensure that when 2017 rolls around I'll have much more experience under my belt? 

Any forums or communities I could join? Events I should check out? Anything would beat sitting at home during summer and twiddling my thumbs! 

I greatly appreciate your help reddit! Any general ideas/advice are greatly appreciated! "

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student and am going to be interning for a big company here starting in late May. I am super excited, but also kind of nervous about it. I met my supervisor last month and he has been emailing me about some of what I will be doing over the course of the summer months.


Here's one of them:
John, I wanted to connect with you and let you know we are excited to have you join us this summer for an internship. We are working through project assignments and activities and have aligned you with my team. I lead our integration team for SAP which includes cross-functional SAP efforts, escalation and problem management, IT process and metrics, and working with our business partners and super users. We have a lot going on and are glad to have you join us this summer.
Best regards,
My supervisor


Now my problem is this... I have not worked with SAP at all. In fact, I have rarely heard of it before he emailed me and I did a few google searches. However, I feel like I have learned a lot from the many classes I have taken at my University.
Classes taken:
Java I          Operating Systems                                 Networking I                                 Networking II
Java II         Database Management Systems               VBA Programming in Excel             Computer Assembler/Architecture
Java III        Discrete Math for Computing                   Data Structures with Python           Calculus I and II

(CS),good_eugooglies,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4i3j4a/should_i_do_a_masters_where_cs/,"I unexpectedly did better than I thought (I thought I would legitimately fail 3 of my classes) so I think I stand a decent chance at a masters if I don't fuck the next 2 semesters up (3.9 GPA, Sophomore, listed as an author on a conference paper). I intend on using this summer to prepare for the GRE and better internships for next spring and/or summer. I want to focus my goals as early as possible and be realistic.  

I'm in CS, and I don't go to a well ranked school - I'd like to get a ML/CV/NLP or related masters at a decently regarded school (UNC and Duke on the low end, Columbia, Penn, Harvard, CMU, Stanford for the reach), but I don't know what tier I should be aiming at. I should be clear that a significant portion of my interest in doing a masters is because I would really like a better school on my resume, and because the fields I'm interested in aren't studied at my current university. 

Additionally, I'm not sure what part of my application I should focus on - is it reasonable to focus on research instead of more relevant Statistics or Pure Math courses? I'd like to get a first-author paper published before I start applying. Additionally, are coursework masters worth it? I'm confident I can secure interviews at at least 4-5 of the companies I can work at (Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft) but doubt I can at the up-and-coming ones (Airbnb, Dropbox, Uber) that could have a bigger payout. 

My research mentor is more favorable to the PhD route, but I'm not sure if that's for me. I'd be taking out loans so cost isn't much of an issue, but I'd like to work for Google/Facebook/Uber/$Hot_PreIPO$ when I graduate.

I updated all online profiles and added projects to my GitHub and every small or startup company I apply to has either rejected me or not even bothered to respond.

I live in a small midwestern city and the opportunities for an entry-level web developer are dwindling.  As I get more and more rejection e-mails, without an interview, I find that I am slowly losing my mind and cannot sleep.

This has been going on for a month.

Her resume said that she knows how to use Microsoft Word, which is true in the sense that she knows how to type words into it. I asked her to make edits to a large document, and after she made edits I noticed a ton of issues with formatting. I was going over some of them with her, and her eyes just got really big when I explained things to her like how to make different section headings. I pointed out that a table was way over the margins, and she agreed, but then just kind of stared at the screen. I said that she should adjust the table so it doesn't do that, and she asked what I meant by that. I adjusted the columns so the table fit on the page, and she gasped in amazement.

WTF is this? I'm 30 years old, she's 24. I just assume that people who are younger than me know how to use Word, and are generally more tech savvy than I am. At the end of the meeting my intern said she was sorry, that she thought she knew how to use Word but now she realizes she has a lot to learn. I shouldn't be angry, part of an internship is learning new skills. But for me these things are basic skills that she should have come here with. It's fine, and she's been Googling a lot of things and learning how to make formatting adjustments. I'm just weirdly frustrated about this and needed to rant."

**TL:DR at edit of post at the bottom!**

Hi everyone!

Before I start, I would like to say that this is my first time posting on reddit so please go easy on me! This post is more of a personal one too! If you can bear reading through it.

After much consideration I felt that it would be helpful for me to seek help from the people of reddit and the internet, as most of you would probably be able to provide some good advice and insights. In this post I will be asking more for guidance rather than asking what type of coding to pick up. But I will get to all the details. So let me begin!

To start, I will tell a little about myself. I am 24 years old, turning 25, and I am a recent graduate with a major in Digital Marketing. I live in NYC and went to school in NYC. I currently work as a driver for Uber (to support myself) and I also kinda intern at a small videography company. I am an avid gamer and I always loved working with computers and reading about all sorts of computer-tech related stuff.

I ended up going to a business school for my undergrad and even in the first few years I was pretty undecided on my major until I eventually picked Digital Marketing, as I felt that traditional marketing would be too boring and that Digital Marketing would be more closely related to the modern and evolving tech, such as social media, mobile, and etc, and it would be much more interesting and interactive. Due to circumstances in my undergrad years, I was not able to intern for companies like other students were, and was only able to intern after I graduated. I graduated in June of 2015 and I started interning on November of 2015. However, I feel that the place I intern/help out at is not really providing me with the experience and hands-on stuff that I should be getting. My duties are pretty much helping my boss with establishing her brand more and helping it gain awareness, by revamping the website, social media, and etc. I feel as if I should be getting my feet wet a lot more to see if I truly like the field or not; to see if I can do Digital Marketing as a career in the future. So now I am a bit worried and questioning myself, my major and my future career, as to whether I should stick to marketing or find something else and basically almost having a quarter life crisis. 

Now to get to the point. A couple years back a my old roommate gave me the idea that I should pick up coding/web development and see if I like it and where it would take me. I ended up buying a book but I never really got started on it due to work and school. Now that I am finished with school and have a bit more time to spare, I felt that it would be a good idea start learning to code, mainly due to the demand of the field and my questioning of my own major. However, just a few days ago, I had a long discussion with my friend, who is a developer and has been programming since like 10, about the whole ""Learning to Code"" thing. He feels as if I want to learn to code just for the money, that I don't have a drive for it and desire to actually do it. His argument is that if I really wanted to do coding, I would have finished the book long ago and already be doing coding, instead of making excuses and off-putting it. Instead, he feels that I would be wasting my time with trying to learn code and instead should look for better internships for Digital Marketing or even take a few career choice exams and see what I truly like. He also mentioned that me wanting to try coding is like me wanting to try out ""Spanish"", and it just doesn't make sense. His belief is that coding itself has much more to it than just learning it; that you need a drive for it, a desire, and the ability to spend hours upon hours learning about it, figuring it out, and etc. He simply feels that I will be wasting my time doing it because it's the ""hot new thing"" and should think about it much more seriously.

My stance was that I just want to try it out, see if I like it and if I end up liking it maybe proceed to making more of a hobby out of it and maybe a career out of it. I feel that there is no harm in learning something new. I am aware it is a lot of effort to pick up a language and learn. But I don't see it as being a waste of time. My argument was that learning to code is also a good skill to have in general. I also felt that without even trying it, how would I know if it is for me or not? 

We ended the discussion shortly after and just ended up talking about something else. But it kinda bothered me the next day, so I felt the need to ask more about it, hence this post! 

I am very well aware of the fact that if I end up not liking it, I would have lost plenty of precious time that I could have spent doing something else. But, personally, I always had a desire to be more involved with games, rather than just playing them. My plan is to learn the basic HTML, CSS, Javascript just to get an understanding of web development, and maybe proceed into learning Java or Swift, cause I do have some ideas for phone apps. I also would like to maybe even make a game of my own somewhere down the line.

So if you're still with me after the whole story, I would simply like to ask for your suggestions or opinions on the whole matter. Is coding something that I can try to learn; to see whether I like it or not? Would there be any harm in doing so? Is it possible, for a complete beginner with zero knowledge of it to make opportunities out of it and maybe set my life into a different direction?

I appreciate the help and I apologize in advance for any grammatical mistakes (lots of personal thoughts and ideas to pour out the first time!) or if this is in the wrong section!

Feel free to ask any questions too!

Thanks!

EDIT:

**TL;DR:** 

**I'm a recent undergrad in Digital Marketing trying to get feet wet in the field to see if I like it or not, but things are not going too well.** 
**Thought about picking up coding a while ago but couldn't get to it because of school &amp; work.** 
**Now that I graduated, I have more time to try it out, but a programmer friend of mine is saying I will be wasting my time and that me wanting to try coding is like me wanting to try out ""Spanish"", and it just doesn't make sense.** 
**I feel as if there would be no harm in learning the basic languages and see if I like it and if I end up liking it maybe proceed to making more of a hobby out of it and maybe a career out of it.**

I am a junior CompE student at a small top 50 engineering school in the North East. This semester I applied for a technology internship at a medium sized financial services/trading firm in PA. Interviews were tough (online coding exercise, developer phone interview, full day on-site) but somehow I pulled through and received an offer, which I accepted.

The internship itself seems great. The company itself seems very well regarded in its field, compensation is through the roof (40+/hr), and their internship program sounds great. However, I have heard (after accepting the positions) that firms like this generally treat their tech interns as second citizens compared to trading interns. 

Also, I have been hearing a lot of talk from my professors that FinTech is not the best industry to be going into for Computer Science. Most of what I have been told advises applying for positions in either large, well known technology companies or looking for some great startups to intern at. 

Does anyone have any advice on this? Any personal stories from people who have had experience in Financial Technology? I am doing work with data analytics this summer, however are there some areas that one in the industry would be better off specializing in?

Hi folks,

for our small office i would like to set up a completly new pc-system consisting of 3 pcs and one server.

We mostly do 2D-CAD work so the actual build shouldn't be to expensive. It would be great, if we could get a build for 500€ each without monitors, peripherals and OS.

I would like to build 3 new systems and out of the old ones a storage server, but that will be a story for another time since the current server still works fine.

**Part Draft:**

I never really build a pc from scratch. I don't know if i just should get a specific prebuild pc, but i also would like the challange of building a new system.

All in all the main factor for the pc should be **cheap, high single thread performance and ram**, since the only thing the pc is used for is 2D CAD and general office stuff. 

So below is a list of components that i think could be ok, but i would really appreciate your advice and improvements.

Background
Work experience: I'll start working with the above stated company in June, I plan to stay there for at least two years. I've also interned in sales engineering, IT, and software development.

Extra curriculars: President of computer science professional society, brought speakers from Google, Amazon, IBM, etc. on campus for recruiting and networking events. I know of 9 people out of a graduating class of 15 who got jobs or internships specifically because of these events.

Undergrad school/major: American University, Computer Science

Other education/coursework: N/A

Race/nationality: Asian and white
Sex: M

Stats
GMAT Score (include breakdown!):
Undergrad GPA: ~3.5, not final yet but this shouldn't be too variable

MBA Info
Goal of MBA: Move into strategic management or business development. I enjoyed sales engineering but I wanted the chance to get my hands dirty in a more technical capacity earlier in my career. I'm not entirely sure an MBA is the best way to do this, but that's part of why I'm posting.

Target schools: MIT and University of Michigan seem to have programs that are best suited to my personal style of learning (""action oriented"") but at this stage I don't have any strong preferences."

My internship will be building a simulation in python of virus spread by mites in bee colonies, I am considering trying to turn it into a web application (for fun and for portfolio) after I’m done with my MSc.  During my thesis I was ‘forced’ to learn Matlab on my own and I loved it. Programming is magic; this complicated, fast and wonderful machine does exactly want I tell it to do, it’s delicious. 
In my free time I also learned some LaTeX and did some basic online python courses to prepare for my internship and I’m following a course in the next period that will include more coding in python. My knowledge of CS concepts such as networking and big O is limited, but I am a fast learner (and love learning) so I expect this will be fine. 

*What I am not interested in*

Fast track, high pressure and competitive environment with long working hours. Working on networking, sysadmin, mobile, QA and bioinformatics.

*What would be my ideal job? Keep in mind that this is a mid-long term goal (3-5 years).*

Part-time work week (32 hours), decent pay, relaxed atmosphere, enough time at work to learn new skills and keep up with new developments (I do love learning). If I am comfortable with my skills I’d like to transition into remote working (for similar hours). 
Perfectly fine with earning a moderate income, since me and my girlfriend are both frugal it’ll leave us enough to save and live comfortably (for our standards) while having free time for personal projects.

I work for what I think is a decent sized company. I started working there as an intern before graduation and then was made a full time web developer about 2 1/2 years ago. I really was enjoying the work but over the past year the workload has begun to frustrate me and no one seems to care. Let me state that this company has never had an in house web dev and I'm an intermediate PHP programmer at best. That is the only real web programming I know. 

I have been mainly building ecommerce sites using an open source shopping cart solution and trying to maintain several other sites I built at the same time.

At the moment I'm in the middle of a large project. I'm building a very large ecommerce site as the lone developer with a few outsourced helpers from India. Up until this point I was 95% responsible for gathering and formatting product data(70k items and climbing quickly), programming the site and managing a few other large projects unrelated to this one. The boss is constantly on me and nitpicking everything about the site(and my other works) and adding more and more features that I honestly can't program on my own and it's hard to find people that can reliably help me. I feel like I was given impossible deadlines and the stress of meeting these deadlines, long hours without lunch and the constant emails about my work all hours of the day and night 24/7 is taking its toll on me mentally. I have actually talked about killing myself and I feel like a total tool for even saying this because I have never felt that way in my life. I have student loans, rent, car payment and I'm about to get married. I can't sleep because I'm constantly thinking about work, I can barely eat and I'm beginning to take it out on my woman when I get home(she's a great person and doesn't deserve this). On top of all of this I'm still making an entry level salary and honestly if I was making twice the amount I still don't think I could take this job. I have voiced my concerns and was told ""I don't care"" or ""I'll just find someone else to do it"".

Let me say that my boss(owner of the company) doesn't know the complexities of the things he asks for and constantly tells me ""It's easy, I can do that."" and that to me is the most infuriating part. He thinks he knows web development but he's a business man not a developer. Here's and example. He discovered ""inspect element"" in chrome and asked me to literally build a copy of a site he found online. I told him it would take me a couple weeks to build. ""Just copy all the code from inspect element"" he says and acted like I was lying when I told him it doesn't work like that. Anyhow, the list goes on and on and on. 

For the past couple weeks I have been job searching and have actually had a promising interview a couple days ago and have a couple more interviews lined up for next week. The one thing that I do like about the company are my coworkers and manager. We all have an awesome relationship and actually met up outside of work sometimes. I just want to leave though and move on to another job with less stress and demanding work. I feel like a pussy and like I want a pity party but it's not that. I'm burnt the fuck out and need to leave for my own mental health.

My delamma - Would it be wrong for me to put in my 2-weeks(after I find something else) and dip out leaving them with an unfinished project that they are really counting on? I know it would take them quite a while to find a dev to pick up all of my projects. I'm depressed and hating life right now but I don't want to fuck my coworkers over. I just need to lookout for my own well being even if that means taking a pay cut.

Tldr: Overwhelmed, frustrated and burnt out web developer  that wants something new but in the middle of a long project that will most likely drag for another year or more. my mental state is in serious decline and I'm interviewing for other jobs. Am I a dick to put in my two weeks and leave projects unfinished?

Typed all of this on my phone. Please forgive my long list of errors. "

After drop day I tried to seek help for depression off-campus by making an appointment with a psychologist to become a patient, waiting a month for said appointment, only for me to see them and then have them tell me that they were no longer accepting new patients and to try another place. I then tried to find another under my insurance, but no place could see me in time for me to get real help before the semester ended and now I'm going for a summer internship in CA and I've already made an appointment for me to see a psychologist there.


I'm asking for advice because I'm at a total loss on how I should go about seeking help from Georgia Tech/ reporting my depression and asking for some type of forgiveness. I never went to the GT counselling center because I was told I'd be told to seek help off-campus anyway. What do you guys suggest I do and what experiences have you had before? "

I have been accepted everywhere except Waterloo CS which was my first choice and I cant quite decide which one to pick out of these two options. Please help me decide.

I am more interested in the software field than the hardware, its not that I don't enjoy physics or sciences. Its just that I prefer software and theory based math. I want to work in the software field but it may be nice to have hardware related options in case I change my mind, I am very career focused and don't exactly care about grad school or research opportunities. 

The only reason I liked Waterloo is because of their career focus, their industry connections, and their startup scene and things like entrepreneur option. It feels that Waterloo has a lot to offer in terms of career opportunities. The most appealing thing is their coop program which I hear almost everyone gets a job from. I also hear that towards the last work term, almost everyone who put an effort in ends up working at their desired type of workplace, whether that is a big company in silicon valley or a startup that gives a lot of freedom. 

I understand that toronto offers a lot of opportunities as well(PEY) and students can do internships during summer but it doesn't feel nearly as comparable in terms of opportunities due the amount of companies that reach out to waterloo through their jobmine. I hear that students from Waterloo get an insane amount of interview practice while toronto students find it much more difficult scoring interviews because its not as spoon fed as Waterloo. I have heard that it is difficult but possible to score interviews in first and second year at toronto while at Waterloo my friend got tons of interviews in his first year and many offers. My problem is that if I end up going to Waterloo I will probably have an insane schedule learning all the hardware stuff while I will end up going in the software field regardless. Another problem is that engineering will not give me flexibility to do side projects and the I fear that the course load will be insane. 

In terms of campus, location, and my personality, Uoft is a much better fit. I personally found Waterloo to be quite dead when I talked to engineers or visited the campus. In comparison, Uoft gave me a much more enthusiastic vibe and the diversity was quite appealing. Most importantly, there is a lot more to do around the campus. I am an outgoing person and the C. Eng program at Waterloo seems very busy and in all honesty depressing.

Sorry for the long post, I am just so unsure about which one to pick. Any insight would be appreciated.

tldr: toronto campus and life is preffered. CS is more flexible and more in line with my interests. Waterloo has more career opportunities. Spoon fed Coop system. Even first years score tons of interviews. I can still go into software field from C. Eng. but have to take a lot of stressful courses that I don't want to. More learning on the job. good jobs by the fourth work term. Toronto harder to score interviews and have to hunt more. Waterloo entrepreneur options and startup scene. Known for their Undergrad for engineering and CS. Greater presence in tech companies."

4iewnq,1,2016-05-08,Please critique my insurance resume,SnackyFace,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/4iewnq/please_critique_my_insurance_resume/,"http://docdro.id/mtaRyqL

This is my new resume that I have been working on since I've developed more experience. The internship is there because otherwise I have to show a 1 year gap in employment- I feel this would be better.

The insurance industry for underwriting likes their continuing education so I made a page outlining what I've done. If you have suggestions on what to do with it please let me know. I was thinking of potentially putting a ""skills and technology"" section in there to talk about things such as windows, microsoft office including excel with formulas &amp; pivot tables, and CRM software. Would it be reasonable to make that section underneath the education?

Any feedback is greatly appreciated, thank you!"

All around me though I see my peers getting internships, maintaining a 3.5+ GPA all while still being able to have a good social life and getting internships and I just feel like I'm putting in 110% into my academics and doing just well enough to get by and it's got me down.

I applied for about 20 internships for this summer but my resume is pretty bad and I wasn't really expecting to get anything. I didn't even get an interview :( But I really want to get some work experience next year.

Currently all I know is python. But I am trying to learn java over the summer and my goal is to release one (shitty) game to the google play store. I was also thinking about creating a personal website where I could list some accomplishments and course work, ect. My first year gpa should be around 3.8 - 3.9.

Would this stuff be enough for me to get an internship next summer? Are there any other projects that I could do to increase my chances of getting an internship (or at the very least an interview)?"

I unexpectedly did better than I thought (I thought I would legitimately get a B in three of my classes) so I think I stand a decent chance at a masters if I don't screw the next 2 semesters up. I intend on using this summer to prepare for the GRE and better internships for next spring and/or summer as well as work at the internship I have already. I want to focus my goals as early as possible and be realistic. 

Profile: 

* Current sophomore in CS, school ranked ~50. 

* 3.9/4.0 GPA, 4.0 Major GPA (One A-, B, C+, everything else A's and A+'s). 

* Listed as an author on a paper that will be submitted to conferences soon, my own project next semester. Project is on Security and ML (my contributions are fairly minimal, to the pipeline). 

* Targeting 3 - 4 industry internships by the time I graduate at 2 - 3 companies (no big names yet, hopefully next summer). 

* Taking GRE in the fall or next spring - SAT wise I was 700M, 800CR (strange for someone in engineering yes). 


Currently I'm looking at the following schools: 

Target: 

* UNC-CH

* Duke

* UW-Madison

* Penn State

(Last two with PI recommendation, who has connections at both). 

Reach: 

* UWash

* Columbia

* UPenn 

* Harvard CSE

* CMU 

* Stanford 

My primary impetus for wanting to do a masters is: 

1) Learn more about topics that aren't well covered in the CS program in my own undergraduate school, like Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision.

2) Make up for my undergrad school's relatively low ranking, name recognition and recruiting ability for the ""hot"" ""startups""  and financial firms (Oculus, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Citadel, Palantir, 2Sigma). However, we/I have good connections with Microsoft, IBM Research, Google, NVidia and the like. *IMO, this is the weakest reason to do an MS*. 

**Note**: I have already brought up many of these questions with advising at my own school and my professor, but many are steering me towards PhD programs or are not knowledgeable about admissions requirements at higher ranked schools (which is fair of course, they do vary quite a bit). 

Questions: 

1) What schools are completely out of reach? Are there any that I should consider?

2) I like research, but I currently do *not* want to spend 4-6 years on a PhD, so I'm going for a MS instead. The conventional wisdom on this subreddit appears to be that MS programs are *generally not worth it* if a visa isn't involved. 

3) Should I focus in on a research Masters or a coursework Masters? Is a coursework Masters even worth it immediately after college?

4) What would the timeline be for graduate admissions? I intend to also interview at Big4 + Local companies before I graduate as a fallback - if I receive offers from one, would I have enough time to weigh a graduate admission as well, if that does happen?

5) If I do a coursework MS without fellowships, could it still pay off with a higher starting offer at an established company or startup? My current interest is in an ML Scientist position or similar, but I know many of those are PhD's only. 

6) If I'm not targeting a PhD, how much will my current coursework concentrations matter? I intend on taking all of the Computer Science classes related to ML/NLP/CV available, but I have only taken the major requirements for Math and nothing more. Would it be worth it to take Differential Equations, more advanced Statistics *purely* for purposes of admissions for a coursework masters? What about for a research masters?

On one end the Navy is offering a NUPOC program and to put the information out short they will pay me around 4k/month with a 15k sign bonus if I commit to working as a Nuclear Officer for them 5 years upon graduation, I go to navy nuclear school and a OCS training and work 5 years thereafter but the problem with this is after 5 years I would think I would feel kinda useless with my programming skills, plus, I wouldn't necessarily be marketable to any IT field having no prior experience on anything related; therefore, I thought of getting an MA with the GI BILL.

On the other hand, I could just get my BS and work for an IT field and have the company pay for my MA (if not I could try to get it on my own), I will rather do programming than any nuclear-related stuff so I have built this table.


NAVY

pros:
travel
veteran
no student debt
GI BILL
cons:
getting far behind in IT field


IT company upon graduation:

pros:
doing what I like
start growing as a professional CS
cons:
student debt
being poor till I graduate
having a ""burden"" on my parents while they try to pay for both me and my brother education expenses.


TL;DR
I am trying to decide what I should do vs what I think I should, how to ultimately decide ? I know the final decision will be mine no matter what people say but if anyone of you has ever felt this way and chose something over the other, what was the deciding factor and do you regret not doing something while you had the opportunity ?"
4igprb,1,2016-05-08,I'm thinking of cutting off my parents from my life when I graduate college in December. (Long),BenZoobs,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4igprb/im_thinking_of_cutting_off_my_parents_from_my/,"I have always been the most civil and understanding person when it comes to my parents. My parents had a horrible divorce. My family pretty much split up right there. My brother and sister took my moms side because my dad started dating someone shortly after. I however didn't pick sides and just let my parents do what they had to because they are my parents and I love them. 

With that being said, my parents constantly bad mouth each other to me and my siblings. To the point where I just feel so uncomfortable.

Recently, I needed someone to watch my puppy because he was sick and I had prior responsibilities. Since it was near my dads house, I asked my step-mother to do so. She didn't mind at all. Being that the responsibilities had to do with my mother, I was forced to bring her with me to drop my puppy off. No big deal. But when I came to pick him up, my mom was in my car and my dad and step-mother freaked out at me for bringing her to their home. I understand them being upset, but I didn't have another choice.
This led me to realize how much my father abandoned me for his new family. He has gone on multiple vacations with her kids and I have never been invited once. (In a span of 7 years.)

On the other hand, I have my mother who is single and has very few friends. I'm currently living with her while I finish up my degree because it's cheaper than having rent while I finish my internships. I constantly express my plans on moving somewhere else in the country because the town I live in is one big retirement city and I want to try something new. She makes me feel like shit about it because I am ""leaving her all alone"" and that she ""might as well die"". It's an extremely negative environment for me but I don't really have a choice until I graduate.

With this being said, I am considering cutting both my parents out of my life. I've been going to therapy for the past 4 months to help deal with the stress of them. I love my parents and would rather them support me and not bring me into their negativity but I think their stubbornness will not allow it. I'm about to start my career as a teacher that I have worked hard for over the past few years. (I'm a 4.0 student)

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Is there a better option?"

There may be another more accurate term to describe the type of design I am going for, but my description is going to have to suffice for now. I have provided examples from around the web that I like, and that you can draw some inspiration from. You'll find those links below. I have also included a link to a graphic I made (that everyone seems to dislike, and I dislike as well) as an example of what not to do. 

The purpose of this graphic is to replace the existing hero image on this website: https://trindy.co/hacktern which is a web page that promotes our team's summer internship program. It should invoke a sense to the reader of wanting to be a part of something larger than themselves. The graphic will also most likely be used in some ads that promote the website. 

For the most part, you have a good amount of creative freedom here, provided you stick to the core idea of what I'm trying to accomplish. The actual phrase itself must remain unchanged however. You may use any fonts you'd like, as long as they are easily legible both at larger and smaller sizes. Capitalization is also up to you, should you find that certain words look better all caps or all lowercase, etc.. I had the idea that the word ""bigger"" should be just that, bigger than all the rest of the words. This seems to make sense to me, but I'm not a pro graphic designer like you ;p 

We do have some colors that are a part of our color palette already, you can find a link to our brand colors below. Make a best-effort attempt to at least work in some of these colors, although I understand if it's not possible to incorporate all of them. 

Requirements for final deliverables: Must be created in Adobe Illustrator or other vector graphics software. You can send me an .ai, .eps, or .svg file. NO Photoshop PSDs or other non-vector format files. If you're using custom fonts in the artwork, convert them to outlines please and document all the fonts used, in case we want to know what they are. *We're looking to have this completed very quickly, within the next day or so if possible. We're willing to be flexible on the timing, to be realistic of course.* 

Payment details and budget: *We're looking to spend about $250USD on this single graphic.* Payment via any way you choose, as long as it accepts PayPal :) Upwork sucks, but if that's what you want to use, I can do that too. We always pay on-time, usually within minutes of accepting the final deliverable. 

Please PM me with your contact details (Skype is always preferred for us), an estimation of the time and cost you think it will take for you to complete the work including a delivery date, and examples of past work of your own (link to portfolio is fine). Extra kudos if you show me examples of similar word art that you've created, or that you think match the style of what we're going for (don't have to be your own). 

**Links:**
Some ideas of what we like: http://imgur.com/a/5X5mA 
*(I've noticed there is a lot of cursive looking fonts in many of these examples, that is NOT by intention, and you do not have to use cursive in your graphic.)*

The graphic I made, that no one likes: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BypPmIwDqJbvNGFSWm1YUXctYm8 
*(Specifically, it feels a little ""kid-ish"" and does not fit in with our brand very well or the feel of the rest of the website. The colors are a bit bright for us, and overall it's sub-par work.)*

Our branding and colors: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BypPmIwDqJbvN0ptWTRnMGJkREE

* Beginner Programmers who lack CS fundamentals (OOP/DS/OS/Algorithms/Multithreading/etc)
* Anything in between 

I'm especially confused because some of these full-time junior developer positions seem like they require less knowledge/skill than an intern at a decent company. And then some people say New Grads are Software Engineers but not Junior developers...?

Do some companies just not have full-time Junior developer positions at all?

At my recent performance review, I was informed that they were not interested in keeping my on board after the contract ends. They said that my work has been fine, but that my shyness makes me a non-asset to the office environment. I quite like my routine of showing up around 9, eating lunch at my desk, talking only about direct work things, and leaving at 5. 

I got through school like that, socializing only with a very small group of friends. Concerned teachers tried to 'fix' me a several times over the years, but I always got good marks and was reasonably happy so just ignored them. University was even better- I studied engineering at a big 'degree factory' school where no one could have cared less as long as my fees got paid.

It feels like I'll have to fundamentally change my way of being in order to succeed as a professional. That seems futile, but I don't see another way. I chose a technical career where I just analyse data and write code all day. I thought my limited social skills would suffice in that kind of environment, but seem to be so wrong. 

Has anyone found a workplace where they can just be their unabomber selves? Where??!!  Are you hiring?"

Using a throwaway here because friends know my primary. Also, I'm going to be a bit vague on the place/jobs because they're rather specific. 

I'm graduating this weekend, and up until last week, I didn't have a job, which was causing me quite a bit of worry. I have since received a job offer, but I'm not sure if I should take the job or not. Hopefully you all will be able to give me some advice from an outside viewpoint I can't otherwise get from friends or family.

To begin with, I've been in a relationship for around four years, and we had both discussed where we might want to live. We decided together that we wanted to live in a city that fit both of our wants and that we could get jobs in. At the moment, she has an internship lined up in the same city that I have a job offer, but as internships go, there is no guarantee that she will have a job there at the end of it. On top of that, she has one more semester to finish school which is in a completely different part of the U.S. than the city we had decided on. Also, and this may be the most telling thing, when I received the job offer, I wasn't relieved like I thought I would be. The job is in a very expensive city and is far away from my family. I'm having a hard time looking at this from an objective standpoint because on one hand, I do really care for my girlfriend and I do think we have a future together, but on the other hand, there are a lot of unknowns and chances that I would be taking by accepting this job. 

I know this sounds like a fairly easy decision to make, but I don't want to look back and wish I had taken a chance; however, I also don't want to get to the city and it end up being a huge waste of time and effort. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!

So I’m finishing up my junior year and I’m feeling pretty depressed about things and would like some general advice.

Basically, I’ve always been painfully shy throughout middle school and high school; I had some good friends, but very few I saw outside of school. And it took me many years and countless crushes to ask a girl out, and when I finally did, she never really took me seriously as a romantic interest. I came into college and saw it as an opportunity to get a fresh start, and had certain expectations for myself — I’d be able to make new friends, meet a girl, and expand my social circle. Unfortunately, I’ve found that a lot harder than I’ve expected it to be. Freshman year, I tried going to club meetings during the first week or two, but wasn’t really putting effort into getting to know people and talk to them, which in large part is due to my horrible social anxiety that made me afraid to speak up. It was the same thing in classes and on busses. FWIW, I’m not into the party scene; I have zero interest in frat parties, although I do often enjoy “parties"" with a small group of people, even if I’m the only one not drinking. I got along with my roommates and met some other cool people on the floor above me, and spent lots of time with these guys throughout freshman year, not really expanding my social circle much — but I was alright with that, because I was still enjoying myself.

Sophomore year, things became much worse. I did join one club because my friend is in it and he encouraged me to, and I got along with many of the people there, but still was (and still am) fairly reserved at meetings and events and didn’t/still don’t really talk to the people I met there outside of club-related stuff. I allowed myself to get terribly isolated — my friends from freshman year just wanted to sit in the room and play Smash Bros Melee all day every day, which was ok for a little but I quickly grew tired of it, and I spent most days in my room, doing homework and watching TV on my computer and not really talking to anyone outside of my roommates. Wasn’t meeting girls or new people in general, but I thought the only way to not let the feelings of extreme loneliness and social anxiety bother me was to run away from them entirely. My grades were good and that was what I was mainly focused on, so I didn’t really make an active effort to change. This continued throughout fall semester junior year, when my friends from freshman/sophomore year basically stopped invited me places for reasons I still don’t understand. I had basically nobody besides my 3 roommates and a couple of other people.

One day, around November this year, I got into a fight with one of my roommates and he stormed out of the room (we quickly made up, but that’s besides the point). While he was gone, I broke down in tears, because one of the only people who I truly felt like I had made a genuine connection in my 2+ years in college with was so pissed off at me, which really hurt. My other roommate, who knew this whole story, saw me breaking down like this, and recommended for me to get help, because he knew how long this had been going on for and knew that I couldn’t run away from this stuff forever, and he was right. 

So at the beginning of this past semester, I called up CAPS and explained a lot of my issues — social anxiety, wanting to meet girls (and guys too, but to a lesser extent) but being held back for reasons I couldn’t really explain at the time, and feelings of hopelessness and loneliness. Through individual and group sessions, I did make a lot of realizations and made some noticeable improvements. I talked to people at events and stuff (girls and guys) and even had a study session with a girl in one of my classes during finals. This summer, I’ll be working as an intern during the week (albeit an internship I only got because of nepotism) and am looking to volunteer at an animal shelter on weekends. I’m also going to keep going to individual sessions at CAPS once a week.

Before anyone asks, yes, I have reached out to some friends to talk through these things as well, and will take their advice to heart more than the advice of strangers on the internet. And yes, I know “I can’t make friends” posts are very common, but most of them are from transfer students or underclassmen, so I’m a little more panicky in the sense that I feel like I have less of an excuse, if that makes sense. All of that being said, the reason I’m posting here is because I’m looking for as many different perspectives and avenues for advice that I can possibly think of. Basically, a lot of my major concern is that I finally have a better idea of how to go about things, but I’m terrified that I might be too late. I allowed social anxiety to ruin my first 3 years of college life, and I can’t take that back. There are maybe 4 or 5 guys and exactly one girl that I can say I’ve truly developed good friendships with here, and zero romantic interests. I have an idea of clubs I might want to join for next year — is it too late to really form connections with people at clubs as a senior? While finding a girlfriend isn’t my #1 priority in this, i’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a huge motivator. Is it something that could be attainable in such a short period of time? I’ve only really pursued two girls in my life romantically before, and I have very little experience and knowledge in making connections with them (and yes, “treat girls that you’re attracted to like anyone else you come across”, I know, yadda yadda yadda). So while I’ve made good progress, I still feel like I have a really long way to go, and I’m not sure if I can get where I want to be in such a short period of time.

I realize this probably comes across and overly neurotic and paranoid, and it probably is, but whatever. One thing I’m focusing on is not giving as much of a fuck what random people think of me, and you reading this are just another one of those people, so if you think I’m a neckbeard loser who’s destined to die alone, whatever. Anyway, I’d just like some advice and assurance that I’ll be okay and that I might be able to turn things around before I drive myself insane, as it’s become increasingly difficult to focus on school and class, causing my GPA to take a moderate hit (although I’m still satisfied with what I have). Thanks a bunch if you managed to get through all that, and I appreciate the advice in advance.

**TL;DR: Lonely rising senior who fucked up my first 3 years of college socially. Have made improvements but am concerned I’m too late and am just looking for reassurance.**

Also, to any upcoming freshman or underclassman reading this: don’t let this happen to you. Make an effort in getting to know people sooner rather than later, because if you don’t, it’s gonna hit you like a ton of bricks later on.

I am 34, I live in Brisbane, I am a qualified plumber and drainer I have worked 6 years on oil and gas drilling rigs and 3 years ago I went back to school and gained access to university so I could go back to the oil and gas industry as an engineer with experience. 

But I have a feeling that a traditional trajectory of university, internship, then job might be unrealistic for me, especially at my age. 

As I stated before I wish to get back into the oil and gas industry but spending another 3 plus years in a class room is too much. 

So reddit community what suggestions do you have?

I just don't where to begin? I want to get back to the resources sector but where do I start?

Let's say I use a formula, a big one (eg a VLOOKUP on a table with 30k+ rows), *twice* inside another formula (typically : IF VLOOKUP(*there*) returns this, then VLOOKUP(*there*)).

Do you know if Excel is programmed so that it remembers that it made the calculation the first time, and therefore can use directly the result from some kind of intern variable ? Because I don't want the VLOOKUP to be calculated twice, considering the time it takes.

I know I could calculate the VLOOKUP part in another cell and then have the 'IF' part refer to that cell, but I'd like to keep the table as straightforward as possible (I won't be the one using it).

I hope the question is clear. It's not really a problem but I didn't know how I could Google that. Thanks !

(PS : I'm using the VLOOKUP function as an example, I usually try to use its alternatives)"

I've been working at a company as a software developer full time for a year now. I initially started as an intern and they hired me after i graduated.

There are only 2 other junior developers at my location and we sometimes need guidance and its not always easy getting in contact with the 3 senior developers at the other location.

Dont get me wrong i google like a mad man and only approach them if i am significantly stuck or just need general advice about our code base.

I will say the company is planning on hiring a Senior level developer at this location to help this situation.

But I am wondering if i am being too dependent on help of others?
Should i be working even harder to finish my work without their help? 
Or is it normal to be pretty dependent when you're still new to creating actual software in a team environment?

I personally feel like after a year i should be way more comfortable than i am, but lack of guidance is the issue...

I feel like 3 years of my life have been completely wasted. The quality of instruction is awful, there is no personal attention, I still don't even have an advisor because nobody seems interested in supervising me. The department gives me no support. There is no sense of community among the grad students. All of my time and energy has been sucked up by the stress of coursework and exams and deadlines, and the one thing, the *one thing* I came to grad school to do-- ***my fucking research***-- is now going to be delayed *another* three months while I prepare for the retake.

I just feel like it's a scam. Like doing research will always be a carrot on the end of a stick that I chase while they use me for teaching. The field I came here to study doesn't even *have* an exam. I have to take one in a field that is nearby, but fairly disjoint, something that I am not very interested in, at least evidently not enough to be able to absorb enough for a PhD exam. I am starting to even lose interest in my old field. Coming out of undergrad, I'd published in top journals, first authored, had many different projects going, was super excited about my work and my future. But now it's been so long now since I've worked on my them that I don't even remember half of what I used to know.

The more time passes, the more I don't know how to get the enthusiasm back that I had before being crushed by the lack of freedom and terrible culture.

There is a growing bitterness in me that I've been duped out of what should have been the best years of my research life. I've stopped thinking ""I am..."" and starting thinking ""I used to be...""  I know this negativity has been affecting me. I let myself get optimistic again, then something will happen. The admins will write me a nasty letter, or I'll do worse than expected in a class, or I'll be refused for another internship (nobody seems to want me anymore now that I'm in grad school, not sure what happened to all the offers after the BS). I'll have to spend the next week stressed and fighting off negativity while getting less work done than I need to be. It's a cycle that prevents me from having the successes I need to sustain this war of attrition.

I can't leave, though. I don't know what else I could even do with my life if I left grad school. The interesting non-academia places to work in my field (silicon valley, national labs, government, etc) seem difficult enough to get even with a PhD. I have a really hard time with the idea of starting over in industry at the same place as I would have if I'd never gone to grad school (or worse, since an MS makes jobs harder to get, even if they are higher paying), or put much effort as I did into undergrad. If there was a Plan B, it was going non-academic after the PhD, not leaving grad school. And I won't, anyway. I am too stubborn. The only way I'd give up is if I was forced to. But I'm still miserable.

Guys, I'm feeling pretty negative. Is anybody succeeding at grad school after feeling as negatively about their situation? How did you break the cycle of resentment?"

I'm considering a master's in computer engineering (focus on computer architecture). I graduate in December 2016.

[Full story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hpina/research_vs_internship_for_this_summer/)

Short story. I'm very unqualified: 2.7 GPA after this semester. Major gpa will be same. C- in computer architecture. I go to [this school](http://www.aus.edu) (ranked ~#400) outside the US. (I'm American though).

I could have great LoRs because most professors think I'm smart (competitive programming experience) but that's all I have going for me.

A professor has given me the option of doing research (unpaid) for him over the summer. In his word he'll give me some projects he doesn't have time for to work on. 

I'd have to decline a paid internship offer from Accenture here in Dubai for that. I was originally planning on using that second internship to help in securing a good full time job later.

What do you think my chances for getting into lower ranked schools for masters is. If it's not good I should probably just stick with my internship and go into industry after I graduate."

Currently, I am 19 and a ""pre-junior"" (ie 3rd year) at Drexel University studying CS (Drexel is a 5-year program with Co-Ops for those that aren't familiar).

I am somewhat unique in that I had a 'real' internship with Lockheed Martin and a DoD contractor while in high school and spearheaded several research projects at the latter--it is long story but I'll explain if you want. 

I have always been self-taught with respect to CS, I started when I was in middle school and continue to teach myself every day. To my own amazement, I have never really been challenged by any of my CS courses. I maintain a strong 3.9 GPA and have never gotten less than an A in any of my CS courses. The courses included a data structures and algorithms course along with math courses like Linear Algebra, Multivariate calculus etc ...

I've always felt like dropping out but I never really had the ability financially--it just would not have been feasible. But. Right now I am on a Co-Op for Drexel and am working for GEICO (15 minutes could sav....). Not in love with the work at all. However, my employer is willing to do something I only mentioned jokingly--increase my salary and give me a full-time position in exchange for dropping out and instead pursuing an online degree in my spare time.

The money is good, yet I am unable to come to a sensible solution to this, as I can't decide which is a better option for me. Notwithstanding any external considerations like my parents and friends, if you were in my position, what would YOU do? For me, I am leaning toward going with them. But I am worried that an online degree will not carry the same weight as a ""traditional"" degree and so if/when I decide to leave, I'll be at a disadvantage when looking for a different job.

Thanks in advance."

I'm relocating to live with with my sister so bills will be minimal, but I'm a little worried about only having 3 months of steady income. I won't be able to go back to my old job. My girlfriend does have a decent job and I will have at least a few months of a cushion saved up.




My main question is how likely is it, if I work hard, to get some sort of full/part time offer after this? I've done a few side projects and studied a lot outside of school, so I would say I'm not an ""average"" freshman/sophmore. At the same time I feel it's unlikely for me to be hired at this point. If I don't get an offer, should I just apply for a standard retail job to get me through till next summer?



Just looking for some advice on what you might do if you were in my shoes.

Day one, I regretted it, and it took me two years to figure out my next step and work up the courage to quit. It took a huge toll on my mental health and confidence.

&amp;nbsp;

One year later and in a new city, I’ve had a couple internships and have been without a job for three weeks. I still have only a vague idea of the career I want to pursue, which has paralyzed me in many ways from seeking out opportunities, since I’m not sure what to look for. Beyond that, my experience in my first job (and throughout college, really) has made me indecisive, scared to take one wrong step that might put me back at square one.

&amp;nbsp;

Example one: I was offered a retail position today, and I took it, but I immediately regretted it and am considering backing out. I have money saved to float for a few months, but I applied thinking the extra cash would be a smart idea. I know it is my prerogative within reason to quit at any moment if I get a permanent offer, but the process of doing so, possibly much earlier than they would have hoped (it’s a temp position), is already making me anxious. Did I act too soon? Should I have given myself more time to find something permanent?

&amp;nbsp;

Example two: I’m afraid of taking a position and hating it again. I’ve done so much reflection, so much exploring, and I know that at some point I will just need to *try* something, but the thought of ‘wasting’ all that time and energy just to quit and look for something completely different sounds not only scary but exhausting. Where do people find the mental capacity to ‘find their passion’ through trial and error? (for the record, I do network, talk to people, try to learn as much as I can about different career paths, but…hearing and doing are different things)

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr: I’m scared to take a wrong step career-wise. I have commitment anxiety. Help me get rid of it?"

I'm going to do an 3-months internship in Gatech. There are two professors have offered me the internship. But I have no idea which professor is more suitable for me. 

Prof. Gil Weinberg, the director of school of music. We had a nice talk on Skype. He told me he was trying to find a Deep Learning researcher to help him in the study of music, and my experience is good fit for his group.
Prof. Yao xie, an assistant professor in ISyE. Her research interest is Big data, and we have a good match, but we didn't talk too much, so I have not enough information about her. It seems that she read my CV, and gave me the offer immediately.

Talking about myself, I'm a graduate student outside of America. I major in Computer Science. And My research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Mining. I hope this internship experience would give me a big help on applying PhD program in 2017.

The thing is both of the professors are great. I don't know how to make this decision. You know Prof. Weinberg is famous but I don't know is it appropriate for me to do ML research in School of Music... 

Is there anyone could help me out of this? Any suggestion is appreciated."

The second one in my junior year went great. But they still rejected me... well tough luck. I got an internship with another company that year (w/ Cisco's biggest rival).

The third interview, I was pretty confident. I had taken a ton of CS courses, a ton of projects and 1 full year of internship experience. And the interview went great. Still rejected...

1 week after rejecting me 3rd time. They again invited me to apply for a full-time position and said that I am on top of their list. They want to interview me around the time when I graduate in December.

4ins4f,6,2016-05-10,Just finished assessment: waiting to hear diagnosis. Freaked out a bit.,Twice_Distilled,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4ins4f/just_finished_assessment_waiting_to_hear/,"Hello, Reddit. Been reading posts in this subreddit all evening and you all seem like supportive, thoughtful people. I thought I would share my story. 

I've been convinced I've had ADHD for years. Every single teacher in elementary and middle school asked if I had been tested for it. My mother, naturally, gave the runaround. ""He's just bored. School isn't challenging."" I'm sure she just didn't like the idea of me on medication -- an irony, to be sure, since my whole family are addicts of one kind or another. But, je divague. 

After being a failing student in middle school and a mediocre one in high school (my graduating GPA was 2.3) I did a couple of years of professional work (I'm a director in the theatre) and went to college. College, surprisingly, was much easier than high school. But during college I had some depression issues and went to a therapist, who conferred with an MD and put me on Adderall for several months. 

This. Was. The. Best. Several. Months. Of. My. Life. 

I was so happy, all of the time. My socks matched. I didn't lose my house keys. I remembered to feed myself and my dog regularly and got out of the house far more often. I wrote and published my first book. My grades stayed acceptable and consistent. For the first time in my adult life, I felt like a fully-functioning, normal human. On roughly 20mgs a day of Adderall, I didn't run around like a hopped-up Superman; I was just finally competent, engaged, and so happy. 

The MD was firm in that it was only meant to be a temporary thing to keep me active while I dealt with some life circumstances (bad relationship ended traumatically). Then I went to grad school. Grad school is even EASIER than undergrad for someone like me: reading and critically engaging theory in your field is work, but it's very pleasurable and, like all cerebral masturbation, really is done on your own time. Ergo, I have a 4.0 for my Master's Degree. However, I felt the same problems I faced in my younger years: I find myself not doing the work much of the time. Instead I fill the gaps with well-constructed bullshit, skip chapter readings I know I can fake, and otherwise deny myself the full benefit of my education because I am distracted, bored, and mentally rebellious. 

So I decided to go into my school's counseling center and get tested for ADHD. The first thing they looked at, obviously, was the fact that I have a 4.0 in grad school and seemed skeptical. The doctoral intern doing my tests really didn't seem impressed with my humor nor terribly sympathetic with why I was there. She was distant and didn't exactly radiate empathy as I tried to explain the struggles with what I am certain is ADHD. Trying to get my report cards from elementary and middle school was a failure: it appears they are not on file anywhere. All I could really do was tell my stories and take the tests. 

The tests, I swear, I did my best on: some days I nailed them, some days I struggled, and it was impossible for me to tell whether or not my performance was indicative of what I know is going on in my head on a daily basis, the kind of inability to focus, remember, and apply myself in a way that constitutes a fully engaged and competent life. 

Anyhow, I finished the testing last week. The intern said she would compile her report and look it over with her supervisor and call me back in to tell me their diagnosis. And, to be rather honest, I'm freaked out about it. I know a lot of college students try to fake ADHD symptoms to get drugs, and that is absolutely not me, though by the intern's cold shoulder I feel she probably thinks this. All I know is that I can't remember what day of the week it is, basic appointments, most people's names, and when I sit down to do work end up staring at the wall for a while instead. So many of the symptoms I've read in this subreddit and in the literature concerning ADHD *and* seen in my previously diagnosed friends applies identically to me. 

So, anyhow. I guess I'm just hoping they come to the conclusion I feel is right and will give me the help I need. Did anyone else feel this way between testing and diagnosis? Did anyone *not* receive a diagnosis the first time and seek a second opinion? I'd love to read any thoughts and advice on this and hear more of your stories as well. Thanks so much for reading, and many apologies for the length. "

Last week, two new interns joined my department and I very much want to get to know and befriend them. However, it has been 4 days since they joined and I have yet to say a word to them. 

During work hours, when everyone is at their desk, I am afraid to approach them to start a conversation as they might find it unexpected and weird as I seat 4 desks away from them. Also, truth be told, I am afraid of my colleagues judging me as I have kept to myself for the past month and suddenly introducing myself to the interns will be out of the ordinary. 

So, I have been planning to start a conversation with them at the pantry or lift lobby when they leave for lunch or after work, however I have yet to bump into them.

Should I wait for them to leave and follow behind them in order to start a conversation? Will they notice and avoid me? Or should I just wait for the opportunity to present itself?

This has been bothering me so much as I feel that this is the perfect opportunity to break out of my shell and make some friends at work. Please help me guys, would appreciate any advice. Sorry for the long ass post. 

P.S. They are a guy and girl and are always together, where ever they go. I am not sure if they know each other previously from school etc.

I'm on my 4th year of study in a game design school (*Supinfogame*, it's in France) and this June I'm supposed to find an internship. Many friends already found something with ease but most of those are artists. Indeed most of my class (Game design) really struggles to find anything, and of the few that did find an internship, most of them are almost unrelated (Q&amp;A for example). 


I don't really know if it's dependent on the country but, at least in France, I've seen two main tendencies : 

* On the one hand you have really small developpers with really shady practices (""1.5 month internship which could end in somekind of unclear Freelance status""; 3 employees and looking for 5 interns for the summer ...)

* On the other hand you have big developpers like Ubisoft which simply aren't interested in taking a intern for 4 month when he's going to spend 2 months learning the home engine and the way everything works)


And here I am struggling to find something that fits me (I study Game Design but I'm more interested into anything ""in-engine"" like level design and building) or even find something at all. I've looked at what most people recommend so I made a portfolio with past projects and mods I worked on (Although I use an ugly wordpress I'm working on a real website made with Muse). 

The tip that everyones tells is to make contacts, and I have a few contacts but they all work in big AAA studios which have no interest in a 4 month internship. 

So here's my real question : Does anyone has real good advice on how to position myself regarding an internship offer (I would love to ""get my hands dirty"" and work on level design, but should I still apply for a pure ""game design make documents"" type of internship?)? Should I value some of my skills more than others (I have after all the same education as my classmates, should I insist more on things like modding)? Should I apply for intenrship outside of France ?(Because it apparently cost a lot to make a stranger work in, let's say the US or UK).

I'm sorry for the not really well written message, I'm a bit lost and stressed even though I'm just in the same case as most of my classmates, thanks for you time anyways :)

I've been looking into the OMSCS degree, and I would be considering applying for the Fall 2017 or Spring 2018 start, but I have two questions:

* How is a candidate that has just finished his undergraduate studies seen? I see that some of you have years of experience. I will most likely have one internship this summer, maybe one next summer (for the Fall 2017 entrance it wouldn't matter anyway) and a 3.0 GPA (my current GPA). Would I fall short of the requisites?
* Do you know if it's allowed to pursue the OMSCS while pursuing another masters in a different institution? From what I read, it's not possible to be accepted into the degree if you already have a masters in CS.

I've always wanted to go to grad school, because I genuinely love learning. 

I'm considering pursuing a CS career rather than being a mechanical engineer. I realized all my favorite projects I've worked on involved software. Specifically, at my internship, I programmed a sun tracking robot for a high altitude balloon payload. I loved the process of creating an algorithm, debugging, and improving it. I'm also great at math. So I could definitely see myself working in software. 

If I were to get an MS in CS, I would definitely have to spend some time taking prerequisites. It will also be tough to get into a great school, even with my GPA and experience, since my BS is in Mechanical Engineering. Honestly, the idea of getting a second BS appeals more to me. I would be able to take my time learning the fundamentals. But from a little research online, it seems like most people recommend going straight for the MS if one is coming from an engineering BS.

Right now I'm in my second year of Network &amp; Security Engineering (university of applied sciences in the Netherlands). I love it, programming, ISO network layers, security it's fucking awesome.

I'm facing one problem though. At school I'm quite good at programming. Especially Java and C. Most programming project are 7/10 or higher. Those projects are always in group between 2 and 4 people, to improve our collaboration skills. Last period had an internship at a web dev company. Worked there as a front end dev, not my thing but learned a lot. My supervisor said I had a lot of dedication and self discipline. 

So looks great, right? The problem starts when I'm try to program on my own. Like building a prime number finder that saves it results in a database. I just don't know where to start and when I got something: how to expand in a controlled way. I start to over engineer it like crazy with UML and ER diagrams for the simple C application and accompanying database. I just don't get really far and abandon the project.


**What am I doing wrong?**


tl;dr: Find it hard to start a solo project, start to over engineer like crazy. What am I doing wrong?"

My first interview with Qualcomm went really well, and although I don't want to be overconfident, I am fairly certain I have a good chance at receiving an offer with them as well. 

My predicament is that when I receive Samsung's offer, I'll have at most a week to accept or deny.

Should I try emailing Qualcomm with my situation and see if I could get an earlier interview?

So am I ready to take on the IT World with my experience? What jobs can I qualify for? 

Is there something else I could have done maybe?

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Experienced PC builder. Build a handful of personal PCs, including my latest mITX watercooled one. I move 2-3 times per year for internships, school, home, etc. and even though my mITX is small and portable, I'm not a fan of moving it since it's watercooled, I'd like to avoid re-hooking everything up when I do move around, and, I guess I'm just looking to build another PC! It's a hobby of mine and I tend to build one every couple years. This time around, here's explicitly what I'm looking for:

* I have a 980 in my mITX with a 3440x1440 monitor; in the summer, I'm usually gaming on an old 1080p monitor; so I'm looking for a **low budget** system that'll hit **60 fps** at **1080p** on **medium settings** with **modern games**. With my experience with PC building, I foresee myself spending **$350-500**, since I already have everything else, this is *just* the tower. 

 (Note: Another thing I am considering is using a laptop with an external GPU, e.g. [Razer Core](http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-core), but I am skeptical of performance I'll gain from that. It seems gimicky; while the GPU *may* not be the bottleneck anymore (can anyone give me information on how bus speed via thunderbolt as opposed to PCI-E affects GPU benchmarks? Does it even matter?), laptop CPUs aren't great either. So I feel like I'm going to notice significant FPS drops when game effects are performed on the CPU; Looking at you APB, when people threw grenades, the smoke particles were rendered on the CPU, which made my laptop shit the bed. Is this technology better now?)

* **CASE**: This is probably the part I'm having the most trouble with. There are obvious, small-scale cases designed for portability like the [graphite](http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Graphite-380T-Mini-ITX-Portable/dp/B00LA70SKO), e.g small cases with handles and such designed for portability. *However*, the more interesting discussion lies with these kinds of cases: [Bravo](http://www.xoxide.com/chieftec-bravo-case-vesa.html) (as asked in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/19ig19/is_there_such_a_thing_as_an_ultraportable_gaming/) thread 3 years ago in /r/buildapc) Can anyone recommend/have experience with cases like the Bravo? True portability as it includes the monitor?

* So here's what I'm thinking: If you're on a budget, AMD carries more weight in the AMD vs Intel decision; I think a 4-core+ AMD CPU would be sufficient. What about one of these?

 CPU: [Vishera](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113286) or [Kabini](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113364)
* GPU: Since I typically don't constrain my budget on gaming builds, I've been going NVIDIA. Now that I know this is only to game at 1080p, I can really skimp with a medium-level GPU. I'm not sure about AMD cards, but could anyone recommend the AMD equivalent of GTX 950/960? (NVIDIA users would probably agree with me that the 50-60 series is capable of 60fps/1080p gaming, correct?)

* PSU: Since I'm powering a mid range GPU/CPU, I anticipate I can get something around 350-450W? I think that should be sufficient.

* RAM: 16GB DDR3 should be sufficient and appropriate for my budget.

* I have the rest of the components already picked out.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

* 1080p
* 60 FPS
* Medium settings
* Modern games

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$350-500

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States - NewEgg/Amazon

Recently I got hired at my IT internship that I worked at last summer and LOVED but it has turned my life completely upside down schedule wise. 

Before this, since september I have been at community college classes from 10am-1pm then I lay around for a few hours and then go to my retail job from 5-10pm and then go to sleep around midnight.

The symptoms were very much reminiscent of a type of malware I'd read about. [One of reasonable historic note in IT, even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm). While that one had plagued networks 20-ish years ago, SalesClient had found a more modern version of something quite similar: a piece of malware that constantly replicated itself until it inhabited all unused drive space. I sent our senior security guy Jim a sample of the worm, mostly so he could find an updated definition to get their antivirus to par in stopping this. 

And SalesClient had put it on their file server, and spread it to nearly all of the office. 

OtherSalesClient was mid-transaction. From my limited exposure, SalesClient used some software tool to make transactions and documentation on their local machine, but when they clicked Save it would upload their changes to a database on the file server. All transactions required a time and date for transaction submission as a sort of 'close time', and when this particular time and date came up the software would make the transaction charge and send an email with a receipt to the customer and SalesClient. This let everyone work on separate things simultaneously but still have a centralized compilation of all sales data, and clients are charged when their purchase would take effect. From my Google-Fu, any orders that weren't submitted while the software isn't running will get backlogged and sent at next possible time. 

I explained the situation as best I could to SalesManager. While he seemed upset about some random malware getting past their firewall and antivirus, he had confidence this was to prevent something more disastrous. He manually ran a current summary report of the file server and knew something bad would be happening soon if I didn't intervene, and gave me the all clear. I disconnected network from their file server and had all suspected infected in the office disconnect from the Intranet, then started the tedious process of clean-up. 

Partway through cleanup, Jim sent me a batch file that killed the running process and cleared up remains of the malware, which cut down cleanup time significantly for end users instead of taking their machines down and running malware removal software from another machine. The file server took the better part of four hours to clear off, while a user machine was closer to 20-30 minutes. Luckily, I was able to do a lot of this work in parallel. 

The users were cleared a little before close of business, but I had to hang around a little longer so I could get their server back up and running for tomorrow morning. SalesManager leaves me the key to lock up when I'm done and I do so once I've finished up and checked connectivity. No word from Jim, or anyone else from Orangered. I decide to drop off my work supplies back at the office and check my email before heading home.

While I was cleaning up the mess, reconnected their file server, deleted the suspicious email and sent out an explanation to the users of how to treat suspicious emails, I got the typical message from Dave:

'Client had unexpected downtime per your actions. Send a report of this incident by close of business today.'

Not a soul was left in the office. 

By now, Jim from our security team had nitpicked a fair amount of the sample I sent his team and I had a full analysis from someone far more knowledgeable than I regarding the type of malware this was, I had the source identified and had probably the most bullet-proof report I'd ever written for Dave regarding any issue I'd encountered with Orangered. Things honestly couldn't have been better from our response: I'd been onsite before we recognized this as a network incident and even prevented several workers from getting their machines infected. No data was lost, but two business hours were considered downtime for their server, the rest of the time was outside their normal hours. 

My 4-page report detailing the incident was summarized to one short email from Dave:

""So why did you take down the file server for this? The uninfected machines could have kept workflow going while you cleared off infected PCs.""

I honestly didn't know how to explain this. Dave *owned* the company, I would have expected him to understand this was a measure to prevent spread before we had identified what this was. 

*The next week*

There's no slots for taking the Security exam outside of business hours, so I schedule to do it over my lunch break. After a gruelling 40 minutes, I get back and finish the day. My results are emailed to me the next day: 95% (one question missed). Quite acceptable. I forward this to Susan as well as a photocopy of the expense. She sends me a congratulations for being the first to finish a certificate since our meeting and says the reimbursement will be included in next week's check.

Still no word on that raise, though. 

Rather bothered by the fiscal situation, I decided to take a look at that feedback for tickets we reviewed to see what was being used against me. I'd setup the new Orangered Helpdesk Software on a virtual machine we'd just setup weeks ago, and since the old Orangered Helpdesk Software wasn't compatible I archived all of our old tickets in raw text on the virtual machine for reference. The file was quite jumbled, but I was able to search for the blocks relevant by ticket numbers. 

What I found was ... concerning.

&gt; So, the ticket was closed on 28 May, SalesClient sends feedback 29 May. But a day before our meeting in mid-June, a user named MisspelledSalesClient edited the feedback from positive to negative and left some vague complaints.

  This is my first text post on here, but I've been following a few subreddits for a while now. I apologize if this is just another annoying career advice thing, but I've been putting it off posting it here because I've read a lot of other peoples and I want to make sure I'm putting the right information at there that I think would be helpful for you all to help me.

  I am looking for career advice and here are the basics about my educational background and some personality information to help you all get a sense of where I'm coming from. 

* **Background**

* I am an INTP. I've tested INFP maybe twice, but the majority of the time I test INTP and relate most to this type. 
* I am currently a year from graduating college. *BA in Anthropology/Minor in ""Creative Work""/Honors College*.
* In high school I wanted to be first a neurosurgeon, then a neurologist, then ""not really sure, but some type of physician"" 
* Senior year of high school came and after doing some clinical rotations at a pretty non-eventful suburban hospital, *I decided that there were a lot of things I didn't explore whilst in high school that I was interested in*. Went in as a bio major, but switched quickly before classes started to Political Science (decided, let's be a lawyer! and then the idea kind of wore off). **Political Science --&gt; Graphic Communications** (Graphic Design basically. Because I've always loved art, but the studio hours and my inability to manage my time [[will cover this part later]] really messed up my sleep schedule and started to affect my mood/mental health. We're talking really bad sleep paralysis almost every night, bad eating habits, bad thoughts all around) **--&gt; Anthropology** (took an intro course in cultural anthropology, fell in love, wasn't 100 percent committed to being an anthropologist per se, but I LOVED the curriculum). My Creative Work minor was out of curiosity and seemed to supplement the Graphic Design major pretty well, but in all honesty, I stuck with it even after changing my major to Anthro because I just really enjoyed studying art philosophy. Like REALLY enjoyed that. 
* Time management thing: After a bit of research, I've come to the conclusion that I probably have ADHD. But apparently it affects women differently (was completely unaware of this until now) and after reading about HOW it affects women and after talking to someone about their experiences and their late diagnosis at 30-something, I have come to realize that I am almost 97% sure that this is what causes me to....idk. Do the thing. The thinking out a concept thing for like an hour in the shower sitting in the tub and then following all the points it leads me to for another two hours as like everything that needs to be done goes **very very undone** Crazy messy room. Really hard time organizing things *(although I have recently gotten better at this)*. And really hard time with procrastination. I hope to talk to my physician soon to discuss treatment. 
* If any of you are aware of Dabrowski's Overexcitabilities: My main overexcitability is sensory. Second is intelligence. (I think this helps to better understand affinity of the arts)


 **The Nitty Gritty**

Now that we've gotten the introductory over with, here is my problem right now. And I hope you guys can relate and offer some friendly advice or possible areas to do more research in. 

As an almost senior, I am fast running out of ideas for my next move. I am still not set on a career really. My mother has convinced me to give medicine another try. (Except her advice is to go into nursing because it's more immediate and I'm running out of time really). I entertained this idea for a little while, but I'm still not entirely sure if I'll enjoy being an RN. I'm currently interning in curatorial research at an art gallery, but I'm not really that sold on that either. In fact, both of these things I mostly have to feign interest in in order to convince myself that these are viable options for me. (Bad I know, but the anxiety of not knowing is very overwhelming right now). 

As of now, I am enrolled for another year of college (technically will be my fifth year) so that I can take nursing prerequisites for a nursing program that I would enroll in after I take a year off to teach English in either Spain or France. Also I think it's important to note that my mom is suggesting nursing to ultimately become a nurse anesthetist which I know is definitely jumping the gun a bit which is why I'm trying to sort all this out. Make sure I'm doing the wisest, smartest thing. 

I figured advice would be more comprehensive if I put down what I've done and what SPECIFICALLY about it that I like, share a brief conclusion of what I came up with in terms of finding a commonality with all of them and then see what you guys think.

* **Medicine**: again, I've interned at a private family practice office in a pretty rural setting and I really did not like it at all. Mostly geriatric patients with a LOT of prescriptions and refilling prescriptions and I just can't handle the ideology behind that...if that makes sense. 
      I also participated in a year of clinical rotations at my high school my senior year at the suburban hospital. The only parts I remember/enjoyed was pharmacy because the people seemed laid back. And the OR of an ob/gyn department during a C-Section because surgery is like oh my god amazing to watch and be even remotely apart of. **Me likey the guts and the blood and the opened body and the buzzing energy of everyone's fast thinking brains**. I also visited some hospitals with my class closer into the city and I really enjoyed that environment. *So I didn't really like the suburb or private practice stuff, but being in the medical center and watching open heart surgeries was really the most interesting/amazing thing about the hospital*. I've also taken an art philosophy course where we visited the hospital weekly (long story) but that was very interesting to hear about the humanities side of medicine. And again, really like the environment of being in like a huge medical complex. 
------   **It has occurred to me that the real basic reason as to why I find medicine fascinating is because the human body seems so complex and infinite in the way it works or can possibly work.** (I believe this is why neurology interested me the most about medicine because it's so multifaceted and the information we know is continuously changing and growing). I think this is why the private practice and suburban hospital didn't work for me because it seemed to lack a certain stimulus? And then of course being able to more or less master that subject material. Or always being on the cutting edge of new information that affects HUMANITY, is like yes. That's the sweet spot for me right there. Also I like the idea that in medicine the results seem very immediate. 

* **Art**: I am *kind of* an artist. I've always drawn/painted as a kid. Got a scholarship for an art course at a pretty prestigious art school over the summer. But really, I think I just admire creativity, more than I actually enjoy doing art? I think this has MOSTLY to do with my childhood. My father composes music for symphonies and orchestras and I think growing up in that environment really inspired me. But again, studio work isn't for me and I only want to paint as a hobby, not as a career. But I really enjoy discussing the human spirit through art. And I enjoy the philosophy of that. **But I'm finding that the art industry (at least the traditional visual art industry) is not for me.**

* **Anthropology**: I like studying the human spirit, again. Or ""the human condition"". **Very big fan of futurology**. I like to take individual situations across time and space and analyze them to understand like larger ideas? If that makes sense? I like taking little pieces of information to understand more complex phenomena. And life. Life is wild/interesting, so that's always fun to understand --someone else's perspective of life and how they clash and what we historically tend to do about it and how we can do that [living with each other with seemingly different ideology] better. And studying anthropology is studying a large enough system of information where you can really draw from an endless arsenal of stuff. It's like infinite, never boring, always changing. I also like studying peoples movements and migrations and literally I can talk to myself [like actual talking out loud in my room] about this subject for a very long uncomfortable time. I recently took a physical anthropology course on human variation (first scientific anthro course since my intro one which I definitely got a D in) and got an A because the subject was more detailed and somehow more interesting this time around? Really enjoyed thinking about the prospect of genomics. But still, even with the science part, the most important part to me was that it still had very strong social significance. 

-----------------------------------------------------

**In all** My friend (INTJ who seriously is the best at listening to my like endless thought vomitting) and I have come to the conclusion that **I ultimately seem to be strongest/am happiest when I get to theorize. And the topics I enjoy theorizing about have to do with the human condition, futurology, humanity etc. But I would really like to make that theorizing APPLICABLE in some way.** I just really enjoy thinking, but ultimately at this stage in my life (because like let's face it, **I want like a very nice sizeable income for ideal lifestyle purposes**) I need more help doing. 

Okay wow this is SO long, and thank you for bearing with me through that (if you have). I am so open to like any advice. Even if you feel the need to give me a reality check honestly. I appreciate honesty. **But career advice that could perhaps COMBINE these areas of interest and still have the thinking aspect to it as well is the ultimate goal here**. Because anything I do, if I'm not able to think by way of theorizing, analyzing, reflecting, it will get very boring and dull to me. (As evident through other jobs/internships I've had)

THANKS. 

Okay thanks again!! Let me know if anything needs more clarification for you guys!

**TL;DR**: INTP majoring in Anthropology, minoring in Creative Work, has some medical experience via high school internships, shadowing, clinical rotations and experience in art field, but not sold on them as career yet. Looking for career that encompasses theorizing on subjects such as the human condition and futurology but in an APPLICABLE way."

:--|:--
[Hello Pieter. I'm a medicine student, one day maybe I'll become a doctor. I'm in the hospital as an intern every day, and I see a lot of patients with many different stories. There's a question I always wanna ask them, but never get the chance to do, so I'll try with you on this ama.  How do you see your future? Does the word ""future"" mean anything to you, if so, what?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30ie5y?context=5)|I see my future short term, obviously. Hours, days, weeks. No summer vacation, no thoughts about a meeting in a month (except that wake/party/riot I'm giving), no conference trips. It's like when you're driving a car down a great long desert road and you know you're running out of gas, and it's a matter of when, not if. There's no big city waiting for you, just beautiful scenery, and hopefully the car will run out of gas somewhere pretty.  In hospital it's even more so: all ""normality"" ceases to exist and you focus just on the ticking clock and the minutae of pain and medicines, discomfort, needles, round-the-clock blood pressure and oxygenation measuring, and so on. There is no future until just before you are released and even then it's measured in ""how long before I get home."" 
[Pieter,](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d300rri?context=5)|Hmm, good question. I've been deliberately accumulating material for my kids to read and think about, for years. It was part of the reason I became a writer, and the main reason I wrote a book like The Psychopath Code. For instance I've kept a diary since my daughter was born, addressed to her, and will give it to her in printed book form. She'd lose a USB drive. A book is easier to hold onto.
[In your blog you mention your young children and the resources that they'll have to see you, such as Youtube recordings. You have been very organized in transitioning the ZeroMQ project over to the community over the last several weeks. As with the community, are you preparing archives, books, or other materials (digital or analog\) for your children? If so, what are you archiving and in what formats?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d300rri?context=5)|Yet the most important gift, I think, for my children, is what I've taught them over the years about self-reliance, standing up to bullies, exploring the world without fear, and taking responsibility for creating order out of chaos. They are young and will forget me, especially the youngest (five), yet I'd like to believe the last years (and we spent every possible moment together, doing so many different things) are deep inside them and will be the main resource I pass on to them.
[Thanks again for all your hard work and contributions over the years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d300rri?context=5)|Even this, dealing with incoming death, is something they'll watch and learn from. Everything is a lesson, if you are equipped to learn. 
[If you don't respond well to chemo what is the estimate doctors have given for how long you will live?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30juz6?context=5)|A few months, is their guesstimate. They don't really know because this is a rare case in the West. Some background: read [/u/mrynx](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3090qx)'s comment about opisthorchiasis being a neglected disease. This is what caused my cancer as far as I can tell. It's a killer of the poor in SE Asia and almost unknown in the west. There is little data on it, especially for metastasis (I was so lucky to have it removed surgically the first time).
 |So what do we know: the cancer is aggressive and grows fast. It does not generally respond to chemo. It is in both lungs. (I haven't seen the PET scans yet, just got a copy of the CT scans...) I'm already coughing and every few hours my lungs get clogged up and I need to cough to clear them until I vomit. It ain't pretty.
[Have you considered giving yourself a non-zero chance of continuing by getting cryogenically preserved?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d303th1?context=5)|Someone asks this question in every thread I've done, with two meanings. One, to give myself a non-zero chance. Two, to preserve my DNA to help my descendants understand if my cancer had a genetic basis.
 |The second is sensible though doesn't need cryogenics. Though in my case the cancer most likely came from eating raw fish from a farm in SE Asia somewhere. Liver fluke, charming little animal, produces carcinogens so it can munch on the tumors. Bile duct cancer is a leading cause of death for 50+ men in many SE Asian countries. I assume cheap raw fish made its way into sushi I ate somewhere along the line. No genetic disposition except ""being male and about 50"".
 |As for non-zero chances, I find it almost obscene to waste time and money and hope on such things.
[Has the new diagnosis changed your day to day life in any dramatic way?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3002ez?context=5)|Yes, the change has been dramatic. I've been so heavily involved in the free software community for instance. One of the first things I did was look at all my responsibilities and assets, and try to find safe homes for them. Then I made that happen, and have now mostly stepped back from e.g. the ZeroMQ community that's been my main focus for years. It was really nice to see how other people, my friends, took over and took charge.
[I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis and prognosis. You say that your family loves you and they support your decision. Have you discussed with them how they want you to die? Are you at all concerned that they might support your decision, but wish you were making a different choice? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3008jw?context=5)|We went through the process with my father, who died on Easter this year, euthanasia. It was clear to everyone how well that worked. I mean in terms of the social group, family and friends, as well as the technical details of dying. So different from the heavy, miserable, stunned atmosphere at funerals. No drama, no suffering, just goodbyes and passing sadness.
 |Perhaps if we'd not been part of that, we'd be less sure as a family. Personally it would have been harder for me to make this decision. Yet after that experience, we're all agreed, and honestly, anyone who told me they'd rather see me rot and suffer from massive organ failure, out of some 'principle', I'd probably ask to leave and never talk to again. 
[Honestly, if your 12 year old said ""daddy, i'm not ready. try a little longer."" you'd asked them to leave and never talk to them again?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30227t?context=5)|Is that how you interpreted what I said? It seems an unrealistic scenario and I was thinking of adults making moral judgments over others, not my kids asking me for one more cuddle.
 |Have you ever been really sick, in hospital, with tubes and machines all over? I have. It is a feeling of utter helplessness. You are trapped and it's small acts of defiance that keep you going. To some extent, the decision that this is the moment to end things is such an act, as I saw with my father. It gives you control back over an intolerable situation. Perhaps not for long, yet it's there, solid, determined control. And that is how I want to die, not the unconscious victim of circumstance.
 |There are some people I know who object to euthanasia on moral grounds, and frankly, I see that objection as so selfish and unempathic that it flags such people as ""toxic"" to me. If they would try to talk me out of it, I'd have them removed. Similarly if someone asked me to try prayer, I'd have them removed.
 |Children aren't equipped to assert such views on others.
[Am I correct in thinking you are going the same route as your father in being euthanized? If so, will you have anyone three with you? What do you want your last days to be like?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d306ml6?context=5)|Yes, given that my cancer will spread down from my lungs into my stomach, then to my digestive system, meaning I'll be unable to eat and will be in real and constant pain, and will lose weight and then start to have circulation problems... I will go the same route as my father.
 |I'll let anyone be there who wants to be there. That's a personal choice I won't influence. My kids, I hope, will be there so they see death close up and it loses its mystery and dread for them.
 |I hope my last days are well drugged up. :)
[Back in 2009 I was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in my sinus and was given the bleak statistics of my not so bright future.  For once in my life I thought, well shit, 2009 and science can't do shit for cancer yet? That sent me running to so called crazy/alternative therapies, and kind of glad I went against my own way of thinking to get cured.  In addition to the standard therapies, did you look into alternative treatments for your problem?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30hlu1?context=5)|I'm not interested in that, for various reasons I've tried to explain in my article ""A Protocol for Dying"". The main one is pure skepticism. I don't disagree that some people will survive after getting alternative treatments. However some people survive even the worst diagnosis, without any treatment at all. You can't call it science until you have control studies and sufficient data. ""Alternative medicine"" is just wishful thinking, as afar as I'm concerned.
 |As for a tumor in the sinus, I'd hope that could be removed surgically, since cancer isn't fatal unless it cannot be resected, and spreads. 
[That sounds like a pleasant way to go :\) I know you haven't requested the euthanasia yet, but have you made any final plans on what you want to happen on your death bed? songs to be played, last things you want to say,...](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d304jvs?context=5)|&gt; I have no last words.
 |Also, next month I'm organizing a wake/bbq/riot/party at my place and I expect a hundred or so people to turn up. Should be fun. :)
[I do feel like this is also the perfect opportunity to leave a few pranks here an there for when you're gone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3050vd?context=5)|Well, say I've set up a few pranks... I'm hardly going to reveal them on Reddit, am I? :)
[Can you set up an automatic generator to post it after your death? (have you ever read Daemon :p? \)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d3064ns?context=5)|I don't really have any pranks. Seriously.
[How's it going?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d300370?context=5)|Honestly, pretty good. I'm mostly cheerful anyhow, yet the diagnosis and reality of dying in the near future has put an edge on it, my mind is super active. Last week I wrote a new book (Social Architecture), taking pieces of writing I'd not yet published and editing it into shape, formatting and publishing. It took an hour and a half total. So it's going pretty well, I'd say. :) 
[Are you exploring any new treatments in addition to chemo? I recently saw an innovative treatment involving genetically modified viruses that allowed the body to have an immuno response. Might that be an option if it's available? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ipl7o/im_writer_and_free_software_author_pieter/d30hs7n?context=5)|My oncologists are exploring other potential treatments. There are some research clinics that have programs. I'm not familiar with the details. Since I'm in good health apart from the cancer, not a smoker, etc. I would qualify. As for looking for experimental treatments myself, no. Too much work and cost and without the support of my doctors, no way to know how real it is.

I am currently on a coop term, can I apply to jobs for the Fall term while on Coop? 

I am supposed to be on a study term in Fall of 16'  but incase I find a good internship, I don't mind talking to the advisor and doing a coop term instead.

I am doing this because I feel that I don't have much time for preparing for interviews while the study terms.But I am relatively more free during my work terms. I am a CS major. 

Is this possible?  Has anyone done this before ?

I'm 25, have a degree in Computer Information Science, and my job probably pays me way less than it should.

I think I'm long overdue for a new job. My current job only pays me 30k a year. Yes, I know, ""30k a year for a web development/business application programmer? That's really low!"" I didn't really have many options at the time when initially looking and sort of got too used to the job and decided to stay longer than I should honestly. I should've left when their idea of a ""raise"" was $25 extra a month. 

I don't even know what sort of job I want now. I'm getting kind of tired of programming honestly, or it could just be the job I currently have zapping all my enthusiasm I had for it previously. I think I'd enjoy Information Security, but I'm not even sure where to start with all the certificates available and even then, would I need to start back at square one for my career and get an internship job in the field before even attempting an entry level job? I also thought of trying to find a decent federal, state or local job to get some loan forgiveness for my student loans.

All I know is 30k a year with my student loans creeping up every year is not going to work out. What's really funny is that I had more money in my bank account prior to graduating than I do now and it's only going lower and lower. 

So, am I in a funk at my current job, or do I just need a new job entirely? Any advice would be appreciated."
4iw6e5,0,2016-05-11,Software Engineering Internship vs. Tech Consulting full time gig vs. BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY??,abacona,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4iw6e5/software_engineering_internship_vs_tech/,"Hello, (sorry for  the annoying title)

I'm a CS major, but have only been programming seriously since around February.

* GPA between 3.0 - 3.2
* Have internships that *sound* good (android at a startup that no longer exists but I didn't learn much (I've since learned a decent amount of Android though), IT position at Fortune 100 with little coding but I can make it sound decent)
* Won a few prizes at pretty big hackathons, and I am pretty passionate about tech in general (especially startups).

I signed an offer as a tech consultant in one of the industry's stronger firms (we'll call them Company A) in Sept/Oct 2015 (I'm graduating in 2wks) which is located in my small midwestern city. Nothing wrong with that, but I've been dreaming of working in the Bay Area since I was a kid. My skill set has improved 100% since I signed with them, I went from only coding for class to attending hackathons and doing side projects/learning.

I just got offered an unofficial remote internship at Cisco doing Front End Software Engineering (which is definitely one of my preferred areas), paying $20/hr for 25 hrs/week for 3 months (extendable to 6 months).

Here's my dilemma. My friend at Company A told me that his training last year (3months) was extremely easy, but they will make it a little more difficult this year (still 40hrs/week or less I'm assuming). Am I ok to work at Cisco simultaneously during my off time / weekends for their 3-6mo period? Or should I renege on Company A and work for Cisco from home until I find a cheap place to stay in the Bay Area (and potentially ask for more hours / intern housing assistance)? I am in the process of finding free/super cheap accommodations in the Bay Area (friends/family) just in case I need it.

Some additional information:

* Company A also has a branch in SF, but I'm pretty sure it'd be a year or more before I could transfer to that branch.
* Cisco knows I have a full time gig with Company A and that I intend to work at both simultaneously
* Company A does not know that I have an offer with Cisco yet
* Cisco does not know whether they will/will not have funding to take me on full time after the 3mo/6mo period
* If I finished my training at Company A (3months), there's a chance I could leverage my position with Cisco to get them to transfer me to SF (and use the additional reasoning that all of my family is in the process of moving out there, which is true)
* I'm not sure whether to tell Company A about Cisco now, in a month, after Company A's 3mo of training, or after 6mo (and just stay in the midwest working 2 jobs until then)
* Under no circumstances will I give up this opportunity to work with Cisco, unless an even better offer came along. I'd rather renege on the full time offer than pass this opportunity up. I don't want to be a consultant, I want to be an SE and eventually maybe a PM. 
* There is nothing in the offer letter / NDA from Company A that says I can't work at another company. (Just that they don't want me to bring other companies' deivces/secrets to Company A).

I guess I would just like the security and additional pay of keeping Company A on deck and doing both jobs simultaneously.

The ideal situation would be to work both for 3mo, then either transfer to Company A's SF branch or extend my internship with Cisco. If I stayed with Cisco, I'd be living in the bay area and interviewing in the area for a good chunk of my internship period (especially if I'm only working 25hrs/week, lots of time to apply/network and do side projects). My worries are that Company A will find out I'm working at Cisco and fire me or something. If I did get fired from Company A (but also still have Cisco), how bad would that be? Can people find out I worked for Company A if I don't tell them, or if I only list Cisco during that time? What would the consequences be in the future?

Am I crazy to even consider working at both? I feel like it would be an exercise in work ethic too."

I looked at the cert flow chart pdf but I'm not sure if the route for hardware would be applicable or not.  Is there a certification for this? I've heard of Scott Moulton's (My hard drive died) recovery class - has anyone done this and what has been your experience? Has the cost been worth it? Has anyone done a class similar to this? Along with the learning experience it would be great to have a piece of paper that shows I'm not a dumb dumb in this area.

Like the title says I'm a graduating senior with a 3.6 GPA with a double major in BS Computer Science &amp; BA in Political Science from a small private school in the Pacific Northwest. I always thought I was going to be a patent lawyer, but I recently decided to enter the work force for a couple of years and then perhaps apply to law school later. 

Due to this, I have no tech internships. And frankly, I believe my coding skills aren't as high as they should be as a soon-to-be graduate (next month). 

Right now, I am hugely stressed out about finding a job. I know I'm late in the game for everything, and I have no experience. From reading this sub, I know I am in some what of a hole. I'm also pretty busy with finishing up classes for the quarter and working at my part-time job (retail) to pay for my daily living. Therefore, I need to use my time as efficiently as possible to maximize my chances of getting hired. Currently, I know C++, HTML, PHP, and Im beginning to learn Ruby on Rails independently. Should I be using my time learning this new language or focusing on studying up for the tech interview? Or perhaps trying to build something?

Also, should I even bother applying to jobs? I feel like if I were to take on a tech-interview right now, I would fail miserably. Do I look for a post-grad internship? Do those exist?

Please help me out! With graduation fast approaching I'm really freaking out!"

I'm a very active person and have a lot of hobbies outside of coding, so I'm wondering what type of job in the computer science field would suit me, if there is one.

I like to be up and walking around. Throughout high school I was in sports, but outside of class and sports I spent 90% of my free time playing computer games (at a very high level, I'm very competitive). Now that I'm getting older I've spent barely any time on my computer except to code or read reddit. Instead I've moved my time to things I feel are more productive, like playing guitar/drums, improv, weight lifting, boxing, or training for marathons. I don't go out to socialize much anymore unless my girlfriend makes me (lol), but I would consider myself a good public speaker.

I still enjoy video games, but I have a hard time playing them for long periods now without feeling guilt. I value my time a lot more and spending hours playing a game makes me feel like I'm stagnating with my progress as a person.

I chose computer science as my major for many reasons, and the main ones are because of the job security and pay. I'm an ambitious person and like having the opportunity of possibly running a company, or developing my own games, or something along those lines.

My question is, what type of job should I be looking for after I graduate? I might be able to get a very good internship in about a year or so, my junior year. I have been considering trying to grind out and try to get a job at a place like google; I've though about switching my major to Computer Engineering (I recently built my own computer and really enjoyed the process); I've also thought about trying to get a job somewhere in the gaming industry.

4iwy1d,2,2016-05-11,Is this a solid backup setup for a small business?,BackDatAssUpppp,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4iwy1d/is_this_a_solid_backup_setup_for_a_small_business/,"Hi all,

I'm in the middle of piecing together a new backup solution for my small business. We're in the fashion world and have 6 employees, but we're growing reasonably quickly so I'd like to build a new backup system to ensure all of our files are safe as can be.

Current Setup - All files are currently just on my computer, my business partner's computer and synced to the cloud with Dropbox. Certain folders are synced via Dropbox to other staff members computers too. That's all we have in place at the moment, eeek.

Some facts:

- We currently have ~60GB of files synced to Dropbox. A lot of photography, graphics, Photoshop/Illustrator files, PDFs and videos. All of our company's files are stored within Dropbox folders, other than the files mentioned in the next point...

- We also have 2 x external hard drives (one in the office, one off-site) for every photo/video shoot we do. This holds all the raw footage + photos, plus the edited versions &amp; editable files too. These files normally total ~100-200 GB, hence why they aren't all in Dropbox.

- I'm looking for something solid that doesn't take a crazy amount of setup time or technical skill. It can't be something that requires tinkering to get it working again every few weeks.

- Everyone in the office uses a Mac at this stage.

This is my current idea for a more solid backup solution, can you tell me if you think it'll work? Is there a better approach than this?

- Continue syncing all company files from our computers to Dropbox. Upgrade Dropbox account to have unlimited file recovery. This creates Backup #1 of the company files and eliminates the possibility of an intern overwriting/deleting files from within Dropbox.

- Purchase a [Synology Desktop NAS](http://www.ebuyer.com/742675-synology-ds216j-2-bay-desktop-nas-enclosure-ds216j?gclid=CMGp-Lrr0swCFWoz0wodnn4LiA#fo_c=951&amp;fo_k=1a8d2dbe364eaf19d9ebcd8e329257a6&amp;fo_s=gplauk?mkwid=s_dc&amp;pcrid=51482423219&amp;pkw=&amp;pmt=) with ample storage. This will automatically sync with our Dropbox. We'll also store a copy of each drive we take back from a photo/video shoot on here, making them remotely accessible. This creates Backup #2 for the company files, and backup #3 for the photo/video shoot files.

- Backup all the NAS contents to the cloud with [CrashPlan](https://www.code42.com/crashplan/) to create Backup #3 for the company files, and backup #4 for the photo/video shoot files (but just cloud backup #1 for the photo/video shoot files)

What do you think? Is this enough? Is there a weak link somewhere? Am I being an idiot? Is this overkill?

Hugely appreciate your advice!

To give some context, I have only started to get into and learn more about finance over the past month or two. I'm currently a university student on a 1 year paid internship and going to go finish up my last year of my undergraduate degree in the fall. By the end of my degree I'll probably have around an OSAP debt of around $50,000. I only began reading ""The Wealthy Barber Returns"" and opened up a TFSA account at TD about a month ago.

Being said I am currently trying to change my account into an e-series account. Would it be wise for me to continue putting in the minimum amount of money into the account or should I hold off until I get a real job and paid off my OSAP.

Secondly, is it wise or unwise or even possible to pay off my OSAP straight away via  line of credit from a bank? My parents have given a suggestion of mortgaging their property (condo apartment) to pay off the debt and I pay the mortgage instead.

Much Appreciated!"

So, for context, I'm currently wrapping up my third year of civil engineering undergrad at a midsized engineering school outside of NYC.

Since my sophomore year, some pretty bad personal things have happened (brother died, grandmother died, dog died...) and I think these events may have left me (among other things) a bit burnt out and apathetic towards academics. That, coupled with perhaps taking on a little bit too much over this past year (three internships in the past year, research, leading EWB at my school) has left me, as I've said, burnt out.

 My GPA has fallen from a 3.8 to around a 3.5. But more importantly, I just feel completely unfulfilled with what I'm doing. I thought I would be excited for the future, entering the work force or pursuing grad school, but now I'm filled with either dread or simply apathy.

Because of my poor academic performance, I'm also really afraid I won't get the future I want, if I eventually decide what that future is... I really wanted to pursue grad school, UC Davis mainly, but now I'm concerned I won't even get in. And that's really just adding to the dread for the future I'm already experiencing...

I guess what I want to know is, have any of you ever felt this way? Burnt out, in a hole, not sure how to get out or get inspired again?

Thanks.

I got the internship!,LetsEatGrandpa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ixozq/summer_internship_questions_i_got_the_internship/,"Hey guys!  I'm a CS student just finishing up my sophomore year at a university where I live. I have no experience in the field and so far have only done basic Java programs in school. Other than school and helping my brother build a gaming PC 3 years ago, I have minimal computer experience in general (but I am extremely excited to learn).So I met a guy that is the Director of IT for an architecture company on Saturday. We talked a bit and he asked what my career plan is. I told him I would really like to find an internship so I can get hands on experience. As luck would have it, he has room for an intern in his office and would like me to consider a summer internship there. Uhhhh dude... Let's do this! So we exchanged information and he said he would call me Monday morning. I've been disappointed enough times in life to know not to get excited at that point. Monday morning comes and I get the call! He wants me to start ASAP. I went and took a tour of the office that very day and started working the next day (yesterday). So far everything is extremely chill, but I have learned a ton already (though probably just things you guys would see as basic knowledge). We have a small team, just 3 of us total. Basically so far the only tasks we've done are getting computers set up with the correct settings and software that the architects need and we also answer any computer related questions that may come our way from anyone in the office. 

On top of the experience I'm getting, this is also a full-time, paid internship. I also feel like the amount I get paid does not reflect my knowledge at all (as in I get paid way more than I feel I deserve). But hey, I'm a broke college student so I'll take what I can get. 

I would really like any advice that can be given to me at this point. What can I do to be more of an asset to my company while I'm at work? Are there resources I may not be able to locate easily online that can help me learn faster? If anyone has been in a similar situation, what is some advice I can use to maximize my experience the next 3 months? "
4ixphx,2,2016-05-11,It's over for me,xxs02,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4ixphx/its_over_for_me/,"I'm 19 years old, coming from France. I'm going through a very hard time right now and I'm feeling I'm gonna die soon, even if I don't suicide.

I've had a complicated childhood, my parents used to live in Paris and had a pretty good life, but then after a chain of events they ended up having to live in a small town with around 200 people, and I'm born at that moment. My parents were not happy together few years after, not because of me.. I think, but they ended up being alcoholics. While I don't think it hurted me that much, I guess it changed me at some point.
My principal source of despair while I was a kid comes from the fact I've always been rejected by people. I do have Algerian origins and the least I can say is that in my town people were not open minded, and kids follow what their parents says, so I ended up being insulted by a lot of them.

I had the chance to have my mom, who gave me education at home before being 6 years old, I learned a lot from that and I was a bit in advance on other people, which did not helped to connect with other kids.

At 10, my parents broke up for good and I moved with my mom, to a medium-sized city in South France. I was gonna enter in high school and it did put me a lot of pressure on my mind, knowing that I've been rejected and that the climate in high school is catastrophic. I wasn't wrong when I got rejected again by my entire classroom. Starting from that, everything fucked up.

I started to not go to school, a few days per months, then a few days per week, and then weeks after weeks. In the meantime, I wasted my time on online games. It gave me a lot of hope, because I was able to ignore my sadness a little and try to hope for a better future.

I changed high school a year later and the same problem happened. I've then got put into a system that they call ""home hospitalization"", I believe it's the good translation. I've had an educator who came at my home and brought me to school, spent time with me a day in a week to do activies, like going to see a movie, learn to cook.. But nothing did changed what was happening.

Then at 14, they decided to send me to a medical center. It wasn't a psychiatric hospital, but we had therapies about it. This is the time my suicidal thoughts started to gain a level. I got rejected as well in there and it was very hard for me. Near the end, some girls sympathized with me and they were awesome. Unfortunately, when I came back home, I fastly got back again into my problems and stopped contacting them, as it was bringing me pain.. I regret this a lot.

I've tried to go back at high school for my last year, I was still rejected but I tried to get over with. I lasted 3 months and I never got back to it ever since. Somehow my hospitalization has been stopped after that, I wasn't even in the legal age yet to stop the school but I guess no one cared for a kid who wasn't able to go to school, that it was too late.

Few months later, an happy event happened to me, something that changed my life. I got to meet someone, on a online game, that I spent time with and enjoyed a lot discussing with him. I did fall in love with him and so did he. It's an event I never expected to happen and I was happy like I never did ever before. But it ended up bad as well, because we were too different and even if we had real feelings, I think it's because we were both very lonely back at that time so we somehow sticked together..

I did reacted very badly to that and started to have more than just suicidal thoughts. I did not attempted suicide but I know I was very near to it. I also had homicidal thoughts as well, because he brought me a lot of pain, I felt betrayed, abandonned, and I wanted him to suffer for that. However it didn't ended up at all like this. After a few months of near-harassment, we talked like friends trying to reconnect. A few months later I knew I was still in love with him but he wasn't at all, so I stopped talking to him. This was 2 years ago. This means we talked ~1 year after breaking up.

6 months later, I was still in a bad mood but wanted to find someone to have some good time with -as in sex-. I met a guy (let's call him David) through a website and we saw each other the week after. He's been really nice with me, and I was very happy to see him again. As it was a few months after I stopped talking to my ex, I didn't felt like I wanted to necessarily be friend with him, or at least, I needed some time to do so. But he was so very nice with me that I couldn't resist. For me, he is a real friend, someone I can go out with, have fun with when I'm not in a good mood.

The first 3 months were awesome and it's the only 3 months I considered myself being really in a good mood, like a teenager should be, because it was real, it wasn't on Internet. But since the end of 2014, he started to make himself distant. He have mental problems as well, problems that I can't help him because I can't understand, I tried however to help him, but you can't change someone alone like that.. We used to meet at my home almost every week, but since then he didn't come. We stopped talking to each other multiple times, as we were both source of stress to each other, seeing him being in a bad mood was making me sad as well.

In September 2015, I started a professional training for web development, something I think I would never have been able to do if he wasn't here, because I couldn't focus enough on my life.. During that time we stopped talking to each other again, this time I initiated it. We stopped until January of this year, and we both felt very bad for that event, I told him I never want to ever feel that again, that I was caring about him and he is important to me.

We saw each other again a couple of time, and everything goes wrong again. He learned that his neighbor was gay and in a break up. He went to meet his neighbor and sympathized. His neighbor however, is an hyper-possessive guy. David spent 4 hours with me a few days after, telling me that he couldn't handle him, that the guy was nice, but very annoying because he felt being watched constantly. I spent those 4 hours trying to tell him to stop everything before it goes too far. He never listened me.

They are now in couple, BUT David tells me he don't feel like being in couple, he stays with him because he is not as sad as he was before meeting him. I didn't realized it at first, but since 3 weeks now, I'm feeling like I'm totally losing him. I've called him 3 times and he told me that he was caring for me, that he wasn't forgetting about me, but that he don't want to stop with his neighbor, that I have to wait until he finds a way to see me. I've tried to trust him, and I was supposed to see him last week, as well as this week. The reason I could see him is that his neighbor was going to job internship. A thing that didn't happened at all because his neighbor decided to drop it.

The result now is that I'm back feeling totally useless, totally unpowerful over that, I don't know what to think .. Does he love him ? Does he cares for me ? Does he wants to still see me ? Or is he just doing like with his neighbor, wanting to see me but wanting to get me out at the same time ?
I know some people might think that I should just stop talking to him because he is very complicated. Sometimes I think that's true. But he is the first person in my life I consider a real friend, the first person I consider having happy time with, I can go out at restaurant with him, and this is important for me.

If I lose him, I'm scared to do something unforgiveable. I feel terribly bad and I try to not push him too hard because I'm scared to lose him forever if it annoys him. I'm spending days after days in my bed, without eating and drinking the minimum possible, because I feel like I don't worth living if noone cares for me. I can't handle losing someone like him at all, I know I can't. Even if he don't stop me from being sad from time to time, he brings me a fair balance to not being all screwed up, he brings me a certain peace with myself. And I feel like I already lost that. I feel like something broke between us. I know it will be very hard for me to trust him again because until now I didn't realize it would hurt me to bad to lose him.

I don't know what to do.. I have nothing else to do in my life. I can't focus on my own future when such events happens. I have no one else to talk with. I never felt that lonely and ""on the edge"" that much before.
I don't feel myself good with my own body. When I met him I was doing 88 kgs and now I'm doing more than 120. I took all that weight because when we were not seeing each other last year, I had nothing else to do but eating to compensate. And now I'm fat as fuck and I don't know what to do to go back.

There is so much to say.. but I think I already wrote enough, I know it might miss a lot of information but if you really need them you can ask me. I'm asking for help, if someone ever felt the same way as I do right now, and what can I do.. I consider going to his home tomorrow to try talking to him because I need to know if he still cares for me, I need an answer before doing anything stupid. Please, I beg you, whoever you are, to try understand me and to talk with your heart about your own experience..

**EDIT**: I would also add that David don't seem to understand what I'm going through, despite what he says. He think I'm just jealous, which is a bit true at some point, but it's so much more than that ... He think I'm being thinking only to myself when I tell him that he should stop with him. I told him by SMS yesterday that I don't think he does understand me, as it is the kind of thing you need to live yourself, and that if he did, he would react differently. He didn't answered since then. It's someone who is really scared by the death, that's why I'm not telling him I'm having suicidal thoughts, but if he was in my role, I'm pretty sure he would be as broken as I am and that he would try to save our friendship.. At least if he does care for me.

**EDIT 2**: I would also like to add, that aside from all my social problems, I do have problems to enjoy the life itself. Already back when I was a kid, I was constantly bored all the day, I could not put a single effort of doing something .. Watching TV ? Nah. Reading ? Nah. And it's pretty much the same today. I got interested enough to watch a TV series that is about to end, and so far it's the only reason for me to wake up from my bed in an entire week, so that I can spend 1h watching it live ...

I'm interested in computers, video games, everyone thinks I'm even addicted to it. The truth is that I don't.. It helped me when I was in high school to run away from my problems but today I can't run away from it. I don't get any fun being on a computer and when I'm not I tend to even feel better. But then there is nothing else for me to do.
I tried to play a game I've expected for, thinking it would bring me some hope like I could before, but it ended up being even worse for me, because I was losing almost every games, and it just make me think about all my failures in life. I can't handle defeat and loss, it's too hard for me anymore.
Life always seemed so annoying for me. Everywhere I go I see happy people, and knowing that I'm not, it just keeps me depressing even more...

The only recent event I've been happy about was when David took me to my first ""fireworks party"", I don't know the translation I'm so sorry. It's basically my city did an event where they launched fireworks for 15 minutes. I've never saw it before and he made it possible. This was awesome, I miss him so much when he was like that ..."

I also delved into database with a couple courses. Most places wont hire someone without experience and I don't even have an internship. 

I looked for internships recently but they all required you to be in school. 

Has anyone found internships after graduating or do I have some other option to be more hirable to employers?

Majority of my CS education is from online courses and my personal projects. I was able to to get an internship this summer in financial industry with good pay. However, I would be a Business Analyst Intern. My goal is to be a godlike coder in the future. 

*Option 1: Stay at current school.

* Pros: Graduate on time(4 years of college) with an internship and go to work. 

* Cons: Don't know much about CS despite having high GPA. Harder to find good job because career fair is not that good.

*Option 2: UNC-Chapel Hill, cost $3k/year

* Pros: Better CS education for sure, good career fair (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM...). Extra year to build personal projects and more internships.

* Cons: Set my life back a year. Retake CS course all over again (this could be good).

*Option 3: University of Michigan, cost $7k/year

* Pros: Good CS program, legit career fair. Best option to improve my networking.

* Cons: Set my life back a year and half. Bad weather.

*Option 4: PennState, cost $5k/year 

* Least favorite option. Still set my life back a year but I don't think it's worth an upgrade to my current school.

I've been browsing here for the past couple years or so, and it's really helped me over the course of my college career, from starting out as an unpaid intern at a tiny startup during freshman summer (maybe you shouldn't be doing this...)  to now, finally, working back to back internships at two of my dream SF/Bay Area tech companies with a pretty good chance at a return offer if I don't colossally eff up. 

I'm not a CS major per se (shoutout to the UC/UW/UT/other schools whose internal CS admissions have gotten ridiculous), so I didn't really have a ton of close people who I knew from classes (one of the big downsides of not being a cs major in my opinion) to ask questions about what decision to make with an offer or courses to take in the beginning. 

And while I admit there are some things to be desired on this sub, a good deal of the resources and threads that were posted here helped me immensely with practice at both the interview and resume stage, and just solid nuggets of advice in general, from sourcing interview questions to places to apply to (truthfully speaking, I think I practiced more questions I found through here than from CTCI). Although I sacrificed the better part of Oct-Feb taking said advice, the end results (and all the offers! awesome feeling) were, I think, worth it. I used to be a pretty nervous wreck in interviews (topped with a healthy dose of ""I'm not even a major!"") and even choked on some easy questions (which sucks immensely when interviews alone are so tough to come by), but the commenters here gave me great advice on where to go to improve and other helpful stuff. 

And as of a couple days ago, I'm all set to start. :)

This is my first post on PCMR, and i thought it would be cool to come with a cool idea off building a pc with only used parts. It is probably done before me here I am not sure. But anyway I want to know if anyone here would be interested to know how this little project so going to happen and follow the progress.

A bit about me...

I live in the Netherlands I am 20 years old and I'm currently studying IT and working as an intern at a company specialized in distributing vegetables and fruits (I of course work at the IT department). I play games since I was little on the Supernintendo, PS1 to PS4 and of course the PC. I didn't know much about building one and about components, but thanks by my friends and classmates I pretty much learned everything. 

Now about the Project.
So getting parts wouldn't be very hard in Holland there are plenty of places and people to get them from and because it isn't a very big country it's easy to get everywhere with car within 2 to 3 hours. 
For example I saw some great deals for high end GPU's because of the up and coming gtx 1070 and 80.
Like the gtx 970 for 250 euro's.

So I think I could come up with a pretty good and powerful PC with a Low-mid-end budget.

I'll gladly want to hear any more ideas and suggestions.



Edit: I think we should set a budget like 400-600 euro's ? It is after all, all about building a second hand build powerful but yet cheap. I search for some parts tomorrow and post them here. STAY TOONED

Edit: http://tweakers.net/aanbod/993727/asus-strix-gtx970-dc2oc-4gd5.html maybe still a bit to much for a cheap second hand build. But it is of course an amazing deal."

So, here's my situation-

I graduated college four years ago and since then, in an effort to gain experience which is key to working in the non-profit sector, I have been working mostly in either unpaid internships or federal public service programs. Immediately after graduating, I had an unpaid internship with a refugee center and also another with a grassroots citizen diplomacy organization which worked with the US State Department. After those, I worked a little over a year as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer and now, I'm finishing up Peace Corps service abroad.

I recently find a job posting near home in the US that I really like and think I would be an excellent candidate for but, in addition to a cover letter and resume', the posting also requires that I include a salary history as well.

This concerns me for two reasons-

First- I do not actually have a salary history due to the fact that my internships were unpaid and the federal public service programs I participated in only provided living-allowances as ""payment"". So, I'm not really sure what to even disclose to them for that. The last actual wage-based job I had was during college when I worked at a coffee shop. I've thought about just giving yearly totals for the living allowances I received as my salary history but I'm not quite sure that's what they're looking for.

Second- If I *do* in fact include my living-allowances as my salary history, I fear that the recruiters for this position will see how little money I've made over the past four years and if I did actually get hired, I'd be offered less money than somebody who disclosed a legitimate salary history when applying. 

I mean, in the non-profit field, there's not much money to be made in general but I definitely have an idea of how much money I think is reasonable for me to make given the experience and skills I have and also what this position entails.

Any and all advice in regards to what I should do would be greatly appreciated."

I'm using my throwaway account for this reason. I'm literally the only person on the North American continent who does what I do with the specific leagues/series that I work with. Let's just say I really love a certain sport and thought I wanted to work in the field. So I got a communication degree and got into sports PR.

I had an internship with my home town NBA team, then another with a big name team in another league/series, and now I'm a full-time employee working in PR, media relations and marketing at a premier sports venue that hosts my favorite sport. Mission accomplished.

And I feel like a fish out of water. This field does not fit me.

I took the StrengthsFinder 2.0 assessment a while back, and my top 5 strengths are Analytical, Consistency, Individualization, Strategic and Intellection. Analytical is me in a nutshell.

Ever since I was a kid, I loved taking things apart to see how they work. I still do. I love digging through information and finding that 'Aha!' moment where you come up with something useful in a pile of otherwise meaningless numbers. It would be great to get into an analytical field, but I have absolutely zero professional experience. I've never used any data analysis tool other than typing numbers into a spreadsheet and coming up with formulas and ways to analyze them.

Nobody at my current employer does this sort of work. We used to have a two-person business intelligence department. But we brought in a new CEO who doesn't give a crap about data, and that department disappeared. So getting experience at my current job isn't a possibility.

How can I get into that field without a data-oriented degree and no professional experience? I do have some technology experience as a former Apple Family Room Specialist (basically a Genius who only works on mobile devices, no computers), but that was 6 years ago.

I have too many financial obligations to do unpaid work, and I want out of my current job yesterday. Even if I liked my current field, I would want out of this company. I'll only ever get more responsibilities, never a raise or promotion, but that's a different issue.

So I'm trying to find a new job in a similar field that will pay the bills while I try to learn data analysis and other IT skills on my own.

The problem there is, I'm a jack of some marketing trades and a master of none. Basically I do what needs doing for the Marketing team, regardless of discipline. I do:

* Event planning - I plan the media operations for our events. A lot of media come to our events, and we need to feed them, give them facilities to work in, distribute information, etc. This is the heaviest lifting I do. There are a lot of vendors to work with, volunteers, temporary staff, personnel from the leagues/series, media attending the event. There used to be a 3-4 person department to run all this. Now there's just me.
* Business administration - I administer the paid advertising budget for our events. Keep track of spending, make sure we follow all the accounting procedures, get all the I's dotted and T's crossed, etc.
* Public relations - I send out press releases, but don't write them. I field PR inquiries, but I'm not empowered to do interviews and make statements on the company's behalf. I don't do social media or any other public-facing activities.
* Media Relations - I go through media credential applications and approve/deny them to attend our events, as well as act as their primary point of contact during events.

I'm looking for jobs, and there are a lot of jobs for which I meet some of the requirements, but very few where I meet all of them.

I am currently Interested in working as a Intern at Companyname in IT, this is  because I have a strong passion to work as a IT technician, and also because like the individuals who work at your company I share their passion to work and grow as a team whilst maintaining professionalism.


I believe that the opportunity to work along side professionals in the IT industry, whilst learning and getting  paid for it is something that should be valued and appreciated by job seekers attempting to get into IT but also students seeking IT Jobs in the future, as it allows them to gain valuable work experience and skills needed to progress further in their career and through life.   

The reason I believe that I would make a good candidate for the IT internship is because I have voluntarily helped my friends and family with IT for the last 10 years, this has included, networking both wireless and wired and setting up of PC's and printers, I have also installed and troubleshooted software including operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office and also  antivirus software. 

Along with my voluntarily work experience in IT, I am eager to learn new skills and put them into use in a professional working  environment, in which I can progress further up the career ladder and hopefully end up working as a 2nd line IT technician as I would like to work closely with computer hardware in my career.  
 
Finally, I would like to say thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing back from you in the future. 

Yours Faithfully,

I finished my sophomore year at a well-known Canadian university, and I just got rejected from the on-site interview from a growing startup in Bay area. As much as it is devastating to be rejected for 17th time for an intern position (especially this late in the game), I'm wondering if I should keep looking or not. 

I'm Japanese and so I applied to Japanese startups in Tokyo as a backup. I got two offers as a software dev intern, so at this point  I could go back and spend my summer there. The thing is, I would rather spend my summer in US since I fit much better culturally here than in Japan (also since working environment in Japan as a software dev is pretty shitty). It might be interesting to work in a foreign country, but the pay will be significantly lower than what I would make in US or in Canada.

Is it too late to keep looking for summer internships in US / Canada? Since this is my first summer with an internship and I'm mainly looking to gain some experience for next summer, should I stop being obsessed with working in US and just start working in Japan?

I have heard that in the software industry ""You can get a job if you can code well, period"". I've heard of many many people who have successful software engineering jobs without finishing any sort of formal higher education, as programming is rather easy to self-teach and practice at home compared to many other subjects (like, say, chemistry). 
My question is how do I know when I'm worth employing? I know how to use the features of c, c++, and python but I've never worked a ""real"" project. The biggest thing I've made is a (bad) one-level platformer in c++ on a team of 4. What steps should I be taking? Should I just make a github and fill it with random projects I create as I continue to learn? Should I just apply for jobs over and over as I continue to learn programming until someone hires me? Can I apply for the same job more than once or will they start ignoring me even if I improve? Should I try to master one ""type"" of software (like games or backend server stuff etc.) or try to have a wide variety of weaker skills to appeal to more places? I assume the first actual job I get will stem from an internship at a small company, so that's probably what I'll be looking for.

My wife has recently graduated with early and middle grades, and she's just spent the last semester as an intern teacher working several weeks at a few different schools. Naturally she's  looking for a full time position for this coming school year, and she's been putting in applications all around our area.

I want to make this clear, because I think it's an an important fact, the area that we are in is a very saturated job market for teachers and one of the worst areas in the country for teachers find work. 

My wife was born to teach, she's very bright and creative, and kids flock to her like Santa. She also won student teacher of the year at her college, and has received very high praise from the principals at the schools that she's worked at this year. 

Her scenario is strange mostly because teachers around this area don't usually have multiple options, especially first years.

She has been unofficially offered 3 jobs week. One in a higher paying County (Money), one in the lowest paying County (Poor) and one kind of inbetween (Mid). She has worked at Money and Poor, but knows nothing about Mid. However, Mid has scheduled her an interview this coming week and she's been told that she is possibly the only candidate they plan to interview. 

She really likes Money and Poor, and they both work with kids in bad neighborhoods, which she enjoys most. Neither of these schools even interview until mid June, and she isn't certain if the positions will even be renewed. It is a possibility that one or both positions will not be rehired.

If she taken the Mid job, how poorly will it be received if she is officially offered Money or Poor and chooses to take one of those jobs instead? The issue is mostly that we can't afford for her to turn down the Mid school and neither of the other two pan out.

Is this something that teachers do? And if so, what is the best way for her to go about it? Also, is it normal to negotiate pay or benefits?

I am a BS Math major at the University of Arizona with an emphasis in Computer Science. The three following courses are the last I have to take for my CS minor (Cloud Computing, Web Programming, and Essential Computing for the Sciences). Although the school on requires these and 2 semesters of intro programing in Java I have also taken Object Oriented Programming and Design as I flirted with a double major for a bit. 

I should have all but the programming for the sciences courses under my belt before any internship interviews. My GPA is not stellar (about 3.0) and honestly my biggest concern is I don;t find myself to be a particularly good programmer. I can't recall much about how to go about using a BST or linked lists really. Is there some sort of online videos I could be watching or free classes I could watch to get a much better feel for those? 

I don't want to simply be another unemployed math degree holder at age 37 when I graduate. So any guidance on what to do to bolster my chances of landing a job would be great. Ideally I would much rather work in the sciences than for a software company, but on that I also have little clue on where to look.

So...

**Demographics:** Junior attending large public school (600 in my year). White male in Southern California.

**Intended Major:** Cognitive Science or Biomechanical Engineering (depending on the school), and then PhD in Neuroscience.

**Academics:**

GPA UW: 4.0, W: 4.86

ACT: Composite 34 (34 E, 36 M, 34 R, 33 S) 

However I really messed up on the Writing portion (24), so I'm going to retake it in June.

SAT: 1420 (On the new scale, 2130 converted)

SAT II's: Going to take Math II, Physics, and U.S. History in June.

Class rank: 1~2 out of 600

**Coursework:**

* Freshman year: Almost all honors classes except for Digital Applications, Woodshop and Spanish 1 (my school doesn't offer honors for these).

* Sophmore year: AP European History, AP Calculus AB, Spanish 2, the rest are honors.

* Junior year: AP US History, AP Calculus BC, AP Physics 1, Spanish 3, AP Music Theory, AP Psychology, AP English Language.

* Senior year (hopefully): AP Statistics, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 2, ASB, English 12, AP Economics/AP Spanish (see questions).

**Extracurriculars:**

* Did FIRST Robotics all 4 years of high school, will be the Team Captain this summer and senior year. Learned a lot about engineering and Computer Aided Design (Am design lead, and designed almost the entire robot this year in Solidworks). I also won the Dean's List Semi-Finalist award.

* Joined a Jewish youth group my sophomore year, where we volunteer in the community and generally help out the public. I have been in it since, and it has been absolutely fantastic. I have never documented the service hours with my school though. Also running for the president of the chapter next month.

* I ""productively"" procrastinate by playing piano, ever since I was 7, which is why I took Music Theory this year.

* Been a member of Junior State of America for 3 years; I went to the JSA Summer Camp at Stanford University before my Junior year and studied AP Government.

* Been in ASB (Student Council) for 4 years (2 in middle school 2 in high school).

* Likely getting a research internship this summer at a local college to research neuroscience and possibly Autism Spectrum Disorder.

**Essays:** I'm honestly swimming with ideas, but whenever I try to start on one it ends up going terribly. For my personal statement I'm planning on writing about family, and everything I have learned from them and how they've helped and developed me as a person. Every time I write though I feel it just sounds... wrong.

**Letters of Rec:** Great (I think), I'm going to get letters from my science and English teachers at my school. For the optional I'm (hopefully) going to get the lead mentor on my robotics team to write one. 

**Schools:** Stanford for REA (Dream since 7th grade), MIT, Yale, Caltech, really all the top science schools for general.

**Questions:** 

1) For my senior year, I have to take Economics (It's required by the school), however my Spanish teacher recommended that I also take AP Spanish my senior year. I don't have room in my planned schedule already, but since AP Econ at my school is a one semester course I was thinking of just taking it online over the summer and taking AP Spanish in the school year. What should I do?

2) Is there anything I could do to strengthen my application? Constructive criticism/suggestions welcome.

3) I feel the essays are the chance to really show what I've learned in my life, however I'm not that powerful of a writer ~~(24 Writing ACT)~~ . Any tips for the personal statement / supplement writing?

4) Does the lack of an official sport hinder me in anyway? I do swimming and mountain biking with friends occasionally but not anything competitive. Should I mention this on my app?

5) How was your day today? :)

Thanks for the help."

I graduated last year as an Information Science major from a solid university. I ended up going back to the company I interned with over two summers, doing specialist call center work. It's thankless but pays well, and I was sort of cool doing it at first because I figured it's an easy way up the ladder when most of the IT division knows I'm dependable from my internship work. Right now one of my old bosses is hinting that he wants to poach me for the network analyst group that he moved to... But it's got some bad hours (horrible shift rotation) and I'm already working an evening shift that kills my free time pretty bad.

After I've been asked for assistance with programming assignments a few times in the past month by friends and colleagues it made me realize just how much I enjoyed programming all throughout college and high school, and trying to learn Unity recently has been making me yearn for it. But I don't know what to do; outside of school I've never really had the chance to do programming work and that worries me.

Right now, I'm gunning for the higher-level systems architecture work that I assisted with as an intern; that side of IT interests me, along with human factors work and the psychological side of interfacing. It's a living and a good match for me, but programming is something I can do for **hours**.... I have ADHD but given an explicit end goal I find it easy to chug away at programs for hours with no issue and I enjoy it. (Gives me the same dorky endorphin rush that working on sudoku or picross puzzles do...) 

And yet, whenever I think about how I wasn't in a CS degree I feel awfully insecure about it. I know Java and SQL pretty damn well, and I've worked with Javascript, HTML/CSS and Objective C... But it worries me that my programming background was never really rooted in nitty gritty things like real attempts to optimize my code, and I worry I'd never make the jump because I don't have the advantages that my CS peers got.

So what should I do? I don't know what job would fit me best. I really do enjoy IT (while I'm not working with angry users...), but I feel like I'm missing what I loved most. Coming from an IT and not a CS background, am I missing too much to make coding a career? And if I enjoy programming in general, interfaces and human factors, databases and system architecture stuff, what would be a good fit for me if anything?"

Should I ask her to reconsider/meet with me again or should I try to find another psychologist within Kaiser to evaluate me?

**Full story**: Basically, my teachers have ALWAYS said I have been very gifted and ask the best questions in science classes, etc but ""if only I would apply myself."" Boy I love that one. I almost never did homework in elementary school, barely in middle school, failed english three times because I couldn't get myself to get through the readings, etc. In high school I took easy classes because I knew I was going to a community college and transfer from there and so I never really studied or anything for that. At community college, it really didn't require much studying and the homework (which I tried my very best to complete because I knew my future was riding on it) generally prepared me well for exams. I had a desk internship for 8 months during my time at community college and I couldn't stay at my desk for more than a few minutes at a time. I couldn't work on tasks at a steady pace. I would have to get things done absolutely as quickly as possible and then I'd feel like I needed a break. I would go make coffee, tea, or whatever I could just to get out of my desk and do something else. I could tell it didn't look good to others.

Well now I've spent a summer and two semesters at a top ranked public university and can't function properly with my academics. I always try to start papers, studying, etc early on so that I'm not cramming everything at the last minute but that's ALWAYS what happens. Every single paper I wrote was written the night/morning of with the help of a very unproductive all-nighter. One of them I didn't even get the page requirement. I just end up staring at the screen and googling some random thing that springs into my head or driving somewhere or doing something random that I think is really urgent. The studying is MUCH more intense here and I simply cannot get through the content that I need to study even once before the exam. Even an outline, I can't process the whole thing. It just won't go in my head without me losing focus and it's obviously very humiliating and irritating. 

Anyway, I called to see the psych first in December but got an appointment for March, then another for May and then another for the TOVA test (which with her sitting right behind me watching me did not make me feel like it represented my symptoms well at all). She asked me a ton of very specific questions about my childhood habits in school and at home and habits at work and everything and to my huge surprise, my history was absolutely LITTERED with examples of how my inattentiveness has hindered my progress in life. At work, at school, even with my family sometimes. She, as did I, appeared to grow more convinced that I had it, and she even told me at the end of our last session that she could tell I was very intelligent and that that can mask the signs of childhood ADHD until it surfaces later like in college when intelligence is not what you need to succeed and where being attentive for hours and hours is what you need. 

So she calls me today and says it doesn't seem like I have it. I was utterly speechless and shocked. I asked, well do I have anxiety, depression, anything that could be leading to this crazy inattentiveness? And she basically said nope, everything looks pretty normal. I am utterly stunned and can't understand how despite giving her hundreds of examples and a cohesive and completely true storyline that explains how it could go unnoticed for this long, that she tells me I don't have it. 

I am fully aware of the epidemic of college kids buying adderall from prescribed people to cram for exams and frankly, if I wanted to I know I could do that. But that's not what I'm after. I want to work with a psychiatrist and figure out what's best for **me**, not just for school but for being able to function more efficiently on a daily basis and for being able to feel like a normal person. I have never done drugs or even drank and I'm 20. I would absolutely never abuse the drugs in any way and simply want to be able to live my life in a productive manner. It's crazy to feel like you have to work so hard to prove yourself. I'm just truly stunned by her opinion. 

Would you ask for a more thorough evaluation or a reconsideration or something along those lines? Would you try to seek a second opinion? Has anyone had this experience? "
4j5uri,0,2016-05-13,Why college students and employers pursue internships as a path to future employment,PursueAsia1,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/4j5uri/why_college_students_and_employers_pursue/,"As thousands of college seniors wrap up final exams this month and head out into the working world, the job picture looks relatively bright.
That is especially true for those with internship experience, employers and researchers say.
A spring survey for job search engine CareerBuilder found that 67 percent of employers plan to hire recent graduates this year. That was up from 65 percent a year earlier and marked the highest level since 2007.
Separate research by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce estimates that nearly two-thirds of college students who finish a paid internship will get a job offer upon or even before graduation, while only about one-third of those without an internship to their credit are likely to have similar good fortune.
Brianna Rippin, a 20-year-old junior at Baldwin Wallace University in Ohio, is among the growing number of undergraduates recognizing early in their college careers that internship experience can complement their studies and give them an advantage in an increasingly competitive job market after graduation. Double majoring in economics and finance, Rippin started scouting out opportunities early in the school year before landing a prized gig this summer as a quantitative analyst intern at Progressive Insurance.
""I firmly believe that the completion of an internship is the No. 1 step an undergraduate student can take in order to obtain postgraduate success,"" Rippin said. The message she and other students get from future employers is that they are ""really interested in your ability to apply knowledge in a real-world situation.""
Indeed, employers say they increasingly view internships as prerequisites for many jobs. Many of them also view internships as an important way to make ties to top students they want to cultivate and potentially hire as full-time staffers after graduation.

""Firms like it because they can test out talent before they hire,"" said Kevin Jacques, a Baldwin Wallace professor who doubles as the school's finance chair.
'We want to make conversions'
Emily LeFevre, human resources director at Phillips Edison &amp; Co., supports Jacques’ assertion.
She said Phillips Edison, which provides redevelopment, leasing and management services for grocery-anchored retail centers, largely gears its internship program toward ""converting"" students into postgrad hires. Phillips Edison, which has offices in multiple major markets across the U.S., including Salt Lake City and Cincinnati, regularly works with several universities, including the University of Utah and a host of schools in Ohio.
""We want to make conversions,"" LeFevre said, adding that such hires can hit the ground running and are more likely to shine with the company. ""It's a huge part of our recruiting practice.""
She emphasized that meaningful work experience along with a college degree is “almost an expectation."" If graduates don't have that experience, she said, ""it's a huge question mark because it's just so standard.""
Danielle Brindisi, a 2014 University of Cincinnati grad and a former Phillips Edison intern, said her own experience mirrors LeFevre's assessment.

The 24-year-old political science major said a majority of the degree programs at her college required an internship before graduation and the school provided information and guidance early on. She started laying the foundation for an internship her freshman year. By her junior year, Brindisi was interning at Phillips Edison, with an emphasis on professional experience and the hope of opening the door for a full-time job.
Brindisi started out in the property management group, reviewing lease language for clients, and then later worked in the HR department. She found her niche in HR and eventually won a job there upon graduation. Now she has come full circle: She runs Phillips Edison's internship program.
Her experience sums up what many employers say they want to see develop from internships. ""It's a great way to start reaching out to people at a young age,"" Brindisi said, ""a great way to identify and connect with talent.""
Dylan Schweitzer, Enterprise Holdings' corporate talent acquisition manager, said the car rental giant shares that view. Enterprise runs a national internship program, hiring some 2,000 per year, aiming to make connections with possible future hires.

""It's a very big part of our recruiting program,"" he said.
An upward trend
Among 2015 bachelor's degree graduates, 65 percent took part in an internship or cooperative education assignment, according to a nationwide survey of college students by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.
That marked the highest level since NACE started keeping tabs in 2007.
Separate research from NACE shows that the so-called conversion rate of interns to full-time employees topped 50 percent a year ago, up from about 35 percent a decade earlier.
NACE research associate Kenneth Tsang said conversion is likely to continue to be a primary focus for employers. NACE members increasingly report that they want new hires to have on-the-job experience, and many say they view internships as a way to ensure that experience is meaningful to their companies.
""It's no longer just something nice to have,"" Tsang said of internships. ""It's almost a minimum requirement"" to get hired.

He added that paid internships are not only coveted by students for obvious reasons, but they also are widely viewed by employers as far more valuable credentials for job applicants. The thinking, he said, is that the best students migrate to paid opportunities.
The 2015 NACE survey found that more than 60 percent of interns/co-ops were paid. Nearly 78 percent of private, for-profit companies paid their interns. NACE research shows the average intern earned $17.20 per hour in 2015, Tsang said.
Tsang summed up the message college students increasingly are taking to heart: ""An internship has to be a top priority.""

4j5ywi,4,2016-05-13,Will I Improve?,TaxPayer942521,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4j5ywi/will_i_improve/,"Hello friends,

today I sat an online quiz for an internship, it consisted of two questions and I'm fairly sure I ballsed it up.

I had an hour and a half to answer these two questions, the first was finding a word in a grid that was given to me as a list of strings. The words could be found going up, down, left or right.

I;m fairly sure I got this question, although I may not have done it optimally, still it took me a lot of time.

The second question involved finding the largest sum of 600 consecutive numbers in a list of 10,000 numbers. I am confident I submitted a completely wrong algorithm and I ran out of time at this point anyway.

My question is this, I am a third year software engineering student who has been coding for approximately a year and a half now. I have sat the main computer science paper my university offers and am halfway through its algorithm paper. The rest of the papers in my degree will be coding based, but I do not think any of them will help me answer questions like the ones mentioned above. Will I get any better at these kinds of questions? 

For example next semester I'm taking AI, humans and computers, a software engineering project paper and a network security paper. I don't see how any of these papers will improve my ability to solve problems like the ones mentioned earlier.

Are some people simply more gifted at coding? And have I started to find my 'potential limit' now that I've started to master the basics. Or will more time exposed to code help train my brain to think more optimally?

Thanks.





tl;dr

- sat a coding quiz today
- messed up
- worried i wont improve anymore no matter how much code i write"

4j6m3d,4,2016-05-13,Is it too late to get into CS from IT? (xpost r/advice),throwayayaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4j6m3d/is_it_too_late_to_get_into_cs_from_it_xpost/,"Hey guys- I need some perspective on what my skills are worth. Got a suggestion to post here from r/advice.

I graduated last year as an Information Science major from a solid university. I ended up going back to the company I interned with over two summers, doing specialist call center work. It's thankless but pays pretty well, and I was sort of cool doing it at first because I figured it's an easy way up the ladder when most of the IT division knows I'm dependable from my internship work. Right now one of my old bosses is hinting that he wants to poach me for the network analyst group that he moved to... But it's got some bad hours (horrible shift rotation) and I'm already working an evening shift that kills my free time pretty bad.

After I've been asked for assistance with programming assignments a few times in the past month by friends and colleagues it made me realize just how much I enjoyed programming all throughout college and high school, and trying to learn Unity recently has been making me yearn for it. But I don't know what to do; outside of school I've never really had the chance to do programming work and that worries me.

Right now, I'm gunning for the higher-level systems architecture work that I assisted with as an intern; that side of IT interests me, along with human factors work and the psychological side of interfacing. It's a living and a good match for me, but programming is something I can do for **hours**.... I have ADHD but given an explicit end goal I find it easy to chug away at programs for hours with no issue and I enjoy it. (Gives me the same dorky endorphin rush that working on sudoku or picross puzzles do...) 

And yet, whenever I think about how I wasn't in a CS degree I feel awfully insecure about it. I know Java and SQL pretty damn well, and I've worked with Javascript, HTML/CSS and Objective C... But it worries me that my programming background was never really rooted in nitty gritty things like real attempts to optimize my code, and I worry I'd never make the jump because I don't have the advantages that my CS peers got.

So what should I do? I don't know what job would fit me best. I really do enjoy IT (while I'm not working with angry users...), but I feel like I'm missing what I loved most. Coming from an IT and not a CS background, am I missing too much to make coding a career? And if I enjoy programming in general, interfaces and human factors, databases and system architecture stuff, what would be a good fit for me if anything?"

Also, I have 5-6 other projects not related to hadoop or distributed computing/big data on my resume, but I **do not have any internships**. My **gpa is 3.4** from an average state school with a well-funded CS program.

I put in some work on my own time in order to learn some front-end languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a bit of AngularJS) on top of the Java I was learning in school, but switching majors so late turned out to be too large an obstacle to overcome -- despite getting two interviews, I am without an internship this summer.

HOWEVER

I asked one of the interviewers what I could have done to make myself more attractive as an applicant, and he gave me a couple things I could do. 1. Go deeper into Java by learning parallel processing, Spring/Hibernate frameworks, or JVM (what even are these things). 2. Pick up Python. 3. Pick up MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) for a more web-oriented skill-set.

My overly wordy question to you guys, then, is: which option would be in my best interest, and what way should I attempt to tackle learning it? If it's at all relevant, I would like to one day be a software developer. Thanks!"
4j7g6z,10,2016-05-13,Junior system admin,trevorludgate,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4j7g6z/junior_system_admin/,"Hello,

A little introduction:
I've worked as a store manager at a computer store for 4 years (fixing computers, customer service, managing employees, etc)
Im 20 years old
No university but did an AEC program (a Quebec thing, in English that means roughly college equivalency - it's an 18 month program) in network/systems administration 
Did a 3 month internship at a hospital as help desk technician 

I have my CCNA R&amp;S and MCTS SCCM and actively studying for the following:
Network + (already have CCNA but I'm studying to brush up on network skills and might as well chalk another cert up on my CV)
CCDA (design) did course on CBT nuggets but need to review routing protocols
MCSA Server 2012 (may wait for 2016 - depends on how long it takes me to study) I already know my stuff and could _probably_ pass the exam but doing the CBT training just in case 
CCNA Wireless - did the CBT nuggets course for the new exam but many from /r/CCNA say the course doesn't prepare you adequately 

In queue (future)
-CCNP R&amp;S
-MCSE server 
-CCDP 

I'm leaning more towards systems administration, but I want to be qualified for network administration as well

----- end of intro -----

So I've been unemployed since February (I got a job offer and have my 2 weeks- then the company disappeared (really complicated but it was a government subsidiary that was dissolved and the current IT staff became govt employees and I got lost in the process)

I went to an interview for a Jr System Admin at a private company which went pretty well. They said they're willing to invest in me (certifications)
It's a really nice and modern office and they're updating EVERYTHING so I'll get to play with nice and shiny toys.

They asked me to send them a list of references so I contacted my colleagues at the hospital. Apparently, the job (at the hospital) has come back up and will be posted soon. I'm told that I'm their primary candidate for the position and that the IT director has given his OK for my hiring.
The position would be help desk technician (as opposed to Jr sys admin) but it's a great environment, unionized, close to home, and very relaxed. IIRC, the pay is around $45,000 per year + crazy benefits

The Jr sys admin would be $40,000 + benefits


So here's the dilemma:

The Jr sys admin job would be amazing for my CV (I eventually want to be a Sr sys admin) + pay for certs

The hospital would be help desk with higher pay, but to get promoted, I would need a bachelors degree (considering taking it part time). But I've already worked there so I like the environment and it's pretty low-stress. 

So here's my question:

If I were to receive an offer from both, which would be the best for me (especially long term)?

Thank you so so much for reading my ramblings and for responses :) :)"

I got accepted as a scholar recently to attend a huge developers conference in NYC. I am interning at Amazon this summer and asked for time off of work to attend.

I asked the person in charge of the conference if I could just attend 2 days (since the 3rd day is not the actual conference itself) and she said that I could, but I would no longer be a scholar and just a regular attendee and miss out on all the scholar perks (which I wanna do).

GPA:

I started off my college career with a very low GPA and have been inching my way back up. As of the end of this spring semester my GPA is a 2.98, and by the time of my graduation I'm confident it will be above a 3 and as high as a 3.2 (for the purposes of this question, assume it will be 3.1)

Internships:

I have 2 summers (6 months) of software engineering internship experience at the same company (relatively small ad tech firm) and this summer I'll be interning an additional 3 months for a SaaS HR company with pretty decent name recognition. total of 3 summers(9 months) of internship experience.

Initially I was planning on starting the application process in the summer so I could honestly list my third internship on my resume, and hopefully continue with interviews and sign somewhere during the fall. Now I'm wondering whether it would be in my best interest to wait until after Fall semester when my GPA will cross the magic 3.0 number before I start looking for jobs.

tl;dr, would it be worth it to wait until after my GPA crosses the border from 2.98 to ~3.1 to start applying for jobs even if it means I wont be set with a job when I graduate (also feel free to give any other advice you think would be useful to someone in my situation)

edit: I guess some personal info that you would need to answer this is how much it matters to me to have a job right out of college. I would definitely prefer to have a job right away but I certainly dont *need* to (I have support from my parents for how ever long I need it). The real crux of the question is how much it would benefit me in applications to apply with a 3.1 rather than a 2.98 (I dont plan on rounding my GPA on my resume because it feels dishonest)"

4j8cfm,30,2016-05-13,[anecdotal] How to leverage your intern status to meet new people and learn new ideas,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/4j8cfm/anecdotal_how_to_leverage_your_intern_status_to/,"To any prospective or incoming interns, I'd like to share what worked well with me during my last internship regarding meeting new people and learning new ideas. This sub is full of resources on networking, but in this post I turn my attention to day-to-day practices of leveraging being an intern to meet new people and learn new ideas. My present goal is not to recommend ""networking techniques"" but to instead help people who may unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the process of meeting more senior people. 

**Timing**

Get some project experience before you reach out to new people, enough to have something to talk about. Having a coffee chat day one in which you find yourself struggling to come up with an answer to *How do you like your current project?* or *What are you working on?* or *What have you found most interesting so far?* will not lend itself to meaningful conversation. Even if your internship is only eight weeks, take some time to settle in and orient yourself.

**Be calculated in who you want to speak to**

I found it most helpful to have a colleague ""endorse"" a connection, so to speak. When I reached out to people with whom I had no mutual ties, I found the conversations fell flat and were more formal and procedural. In other words, it seemed like these conversations were more of a check mark, with the other person feeling a sense of *Check, met with the intern today* rather than having a feeling of a rewarding conversation. In reaching out to other people, I found this most useful in initial emails by mentioning something along the lines of *""I'm currently working on a project with Sarah and she recommended I speak to you based on mutual interests."" In addition to a higher success rate of meeting with people, I found that having more in common helps the conversation along with both how much you get out of it, and how easy it is to progress.

**The WIFM principle: what's in it for me?**

The WIFM principle is one of the most important pieces of advice I ever received. Always ask yourself before meeting with someone what you can offer them, as people tend to always be thinking what's in it for me. Be prepared to offer yourself to help on a project (if appropriate) or to otherwise make yourself useful. This is difficult because interns don't usually have useful levels professional/social capital, but if you can demonstrate that you're not just taking their time, folks tend to be more receptive to meeting and chatting.

**Do your homework**

Before meeting with someone, learn about what they do, what projects they've worked on, and what interests them to the best of your abilities. I'm not referring to the creepy LinkedIn scouring for hobbies that you see some folks do before interviews. Instead, sincerely get a feel for what makes them tick, and ask them about that. If you're talking to a manager who specializes in energy, don't waste their time asking about what it's like to be at the manager level. Instead, try to get their unique insights on their industry, or whatever their interests/specialization may be.

**Ask advice and WRITE IT DOWN**

Perhaps the most important thing I've learned. You are an intern, and people realize that you have little experience and the greatest potential for growth simply by nature of your inexperience. Ask for advice at the conclusion of every meeting, but don't ask for general advice. Ask for specific advice. In other words, don't ask *Can you give me advice on being an intern?* Instead, ask questions that more specifically probe the idiosyncrasies of each relationship. The wording is up to you, but your question should be more along the lines of *What advice can* **you specifically** *give to* **me specifically**? The specifics will likely come from either commonalities you share or because the person you're speaking with has knowledge about a particular industry/area/whatever that you'd like to improve upon in your own professional experience.

After you ask for advice, write it down. It will give you the opportunity to follow up with the person in a few weeks to show that you've listened to advice. I often liked to remark to people *You gave me advice and said improve [x]. I did these three specific things and that helped me improve [x].* Don't bullshit this, be sincere and treat these as learning opportunities.

**Bottom line**

People are willing to chat with interns, I've found. It's useful to connect with people across functional and industry specializations. You learn a lot, and you can grow a lot from what you learn and the advice you receive. Make it personal whenever you can to deepen the level of mutual understanding and appreciation for the conversation. It's hard to make yourself particularly useful sometimes, but always try. Make sure to follow up with an email to thank the person with a conversation.

**Practical Remarks**

It's easiest to email people to set up a time to chat. Ask them for fifteen minutes of their time to grab coffee. They are more busy than you, and what they're doing is more important. If they want to talk longer, they'll keep chatting past the fifteen minute mark. Be sure to propose at least three times that work in your email, and always be polite. If you schedule a phone call, always ask if they'd prefer to call you or if instead they'd prefer you to call them. Usually they will call you, but it is a nice gesture regardless.

Thank you for reading!
TL;DR: **be a human and act like one**.

I did not, however, disclose information about a public intoxication ticket I received while visiting friends at a college town in Mississippi.

It was great and I did make a few friends but not as many as I would have liked. I'm back again this summer and I really want to make friends with people, specifically because they are mostly all in their 20s and I am 20. The thing is I can't drink yet (legally) so I can't really ask anyone out for drinks after work which seems to be the surefire way to make friends. It's also a bit odd because I'm in IT so we don't really interact as much with everyone unless they need something. However I guess this is also a plus because we talk to everyone, as opposed to PR people only talking to PR people you know? Everyone has a computer 

So how do I make friends even though I'm still younger than most people and can't go out and drink with people? "

4jabfm,23,2016-05-14,Now this is how you start a career.,ass_munch_reborn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4jabfm/now_this_is_how_you_start_a_career/,"We were hiring for an intern.  We are a startup that is ""ramen profitable"", so we only pay $11/hour.  This is peanuts, we know it, so we basically wanted someone with no experience.  We needed to have someone come in and help with blog writing, marketing, slides, branding, social media presence, etc.  And we felt enthusiasm and desire trumps experience.

So, this kid comes in, a guy finishing his Sophomore year in Economics at a good, but relatively unknown University outside our area.  Did some minor stuff for a car dealership, a few minor ""marketing"" things (which meant handing out flyers, manning a booth).  Nothing that screamed hire me.

But when this guy came in, he talked about how he researched and dissected our product with his CS major friend, how he talked with a Business professor about a possible marketing strategy.  We gave him a 20 minute assignment to write a couple of paragraphs about a publicly known product, and he did tons of research, found out people who used that product, and got their personal feelings about.

He took time to understood the space we were in, asked questions that showed he wanted to learn more, ""e.g. what is our market segment"", etc.

He explained how he would use this experience to propel his career.  He explained that he was excited, and showed it by saying how learning ABC would improve his career by XYZ.  He said to us, point blank, that we were his first choice.

We got a few more resumes tricking in, and my initial thought was to keep looking and make a decision in a couple of weeks.  But this guy was perfect.  We immediately stopped the interview process and called him to say he's in.

As a junior, he can go out and say, ""hey, this product - I helped with the marketing strategy"", with concrete proof, when he looks for another internship in a year.  He's going to have a leg up over a whole bunch of people.  He will have exposure to a startup, will probably talk to VCs (as we are in the final stages of seed funding), work in a growing space, and make connections and possibly help with sales. 

Essentially, this guy's career is going to grow like gangbusters.  And why?  He took initiative.  He looked for places to improve his personal growth.  He showed excitement.  He cared about career growth - and mapped it to how it can help our company.  

This is how you get hired.  This is how you start a career.

EDIT: Well, apparently, I guess I'm evil for giving a Sophomore in college with virtually no experience an opportunity to help prove himself in something he wants to move into.  Giving him a sense of ownership instead of ordering him around makes me exploitative.  Giving him flexibility means I'm making him give develop our ""entire marketing strategy for peanuts.""  Apparently, paying $11/hour to an employee with virtually no experience who would help and train is wrong, and sophomores in college deserve twice that much.  I thought I was helping someone out since every entry level job wants experience.  But I guess I'm wrong.

I kept seeing posts of how ""entry level posts always require experience"" and ""I just graduated and I can't find a job"" and I wanted to give an example of what to do to beat this cycle.  But apparently, that is evil around here.  I wanted to show what it was like to get that ""first job"", how you can break into an industry with virtually no experience - how to get your foot in the door.  I had that experience (at $8/hour as Sophomore BTW), which led me to a very successful career (~$120K/year), I wanted to give someone else that experience ,that push, that foot in the door.

Now it sounds like /r/jobs is the new /r/relationships.  For those that think business are evil and rant about corporations, you beat me.  I'm out of here for good.  Spread your gospel.  I can see why some one like /r/van_the_recruiter left.  This forum just wants to circle jerk about how they can never get a job - not talk about the sacrifices you have to make to get the job.  I wanted to instill the fact that, no, you have to work your way up.  But alas, I can't.  To those that disagree with me - you won.  Congratulations.  I'm out of here for good."

I graduated college majoring in a liberal arts degree, and like a ton of people choosing that degree I have had trouble finding a ""real job"" aka one that pays enough where I can move out and be financially independent.  I was applying for jobs without success, and in the mean time I just worked at a fast casual restaurant.  I finally, after spending waaay too much time without success, started looking for jobs that weren't necessarily in my major.  I had an internship in college that was basically a marketing/general office kind (but the subject matter was dealing with my major), so I started applying for entry level jobs in both marketing but mainly like general office jobs.  This led to me being contacted by two different staffing agencies.

I was obviously aware of recruiters, but for some reason I never really thought about using them at all until I happened to apply for jobs listed at each recruiters website, which led to them contacting me.  I met with both, and both said they would contact me with any potential leads.  

I landed a temp-to-hire job with one recruiter, which I currently work now. It doesn't pay enough to live off of, but my plan was to work this job until I was offered permanent work and either a)accept the job if it paid well enough or b) decline the offer if it didn't but then use both recruiters again to try to land a better job, which should be possible with the added experience (the other recruiter was totally ok when I told her about this job and wished me luck and to contact her if things changed)- while also still applying for jobs within my major on the weekend in case I somehow actually got a job in my major.  I also planned, after like 3 months (or whatever people could suggest), of updating my resume with my current job so I could also apply for full time office jobs and maybe the added experience would help.  I know it's considered ""bad"" if you quit a temp job, but obviously if I got a permanent ""real job"" it would be understandable.

So now that the background is given, here's why I'm posting: the other day my manager was just shooting the shit with our team (~15 members) and was talking about how much more lax with dress code, breaks, etc is at our place compared to most jobs, and he remarked that it's because we're temps.  He then elaborated to say he's ok if members end up quitting the job without 2 weeks notices etc, because he basically admitted that this job is a resume builder and will not lead to advancement.  I did not ask explicitly, but from what he said compared to finding out how long other members have been employed etc, that this job apparently is one of those ""indefinitely temp"" jobs where they can get away saying it's to hire but they don't give an actual timeline because they really don't plan on hiring people to a permanent basis. 

So with these new facts, should I contact the other recruiter pretty much now?  At the time she was right about to try to market me to a startup that actually had a timeline and exact salary for when you were hired permanently (I wish that I could have got a definite answer in regards to maybe an interview through her, but I didn't really feel like I could take the chance of not accepting my current job when offered), so I know she has jobs available if I told her I didn't want another indefinite temp job like my current one.  Or should I wait and in the meantime try to get a definite answer in regards to when/if/how temps are hired to permanent at my job, or at least spend more time there to soften the blow of me going back to the other recruiter and quitting the temp job before it's done?  Although I obviously would like to support myself fully ASAP I'm not going to starve, my family is still ok supporting me as I get my career situation straightened out.

Thanks!

I decided to take a break from software and I've been an English teacher here in Taiwan ever since.

In September I'm getting married and we plan to move to Europe, because she's Filipina and it'll be much easier for her to get a visa there than in my native UK. Since I don't really have any other skills (except English teaching, which pays very little in Europe) I'd like to go back to software.

The only problem is that I'm not finding it easy to find a job!

I've applied for plenty of advertised jobs I've seen and most haven't even bothered to reply. I had an interview with a company last week but they rejected me because they felt that I didn't have enough experience for their Junior role.

Does anyone have any advice on how I might be able to make myself more attractive to employers given my situation? One of the problems as well is that since I'm currently in Taiwan I can't attend an in-person interview or anything. I'm continuing to work on projects in my spare time but as I'm also working full-time at the moment I don't have a lot of time to make anything really great.

Any help or advice on this would be much appreciated."

I got into a few but I've cut it down to these two schools. Below is a pros and cons list of each. Does anyone have a suggestion for which I enroll in?

Bucknell:

Pros
-More fun (parties)
-Liberal Arts which means smaller classrooms with more discussion based learning. I have ADD so I would benefit from this over classes that are just lectures.
-Nicer weather
-Smaller school
-Hotter girls
-Harder to get into
-Graduates of Bucknell get higher paying jobs on average than Binghamtion graduates. 

Cons
-I would graduate with 40k in debt which I would have to pay off myself
-Greek life is super big there (like 2/3 of students join). I would probably still rush.
-The public transportation isn't great

Binghamton:

Pros
-Better options for undergrad research and internships
-I wouldn't have to pay anything and would have leftover money for grad school
-Better housing
-Free buses from the college to the city of Binghamton that run often

Cons
-not as fun as Bucknell
-A lot of kids from my high school are going
-Big
-According to a lot of people it's very easy. I'd prefer a more challenging school.

So which school should I choose?"

I graduated from university a couple years ago and after working full time in an industry I'm not too fond of, I have finally decided to quit my job come September and attend law school in BC. I'm looking for some advice on the best way to manage my finances and maximize my eligible amount for government student loans. By the end of August I will have roughly:

- $5k in ETFs in my TFSA
- $7k of my current company's stock through a Registered ESPP
- $7k in my chequing account.

My parents have told me that if necessary they are willing to lend me up to $20,000 interest free on an as-needed basis, which I am hoping would either not be necessary or I would only use at the end of my education to help reduce interest payments on student debt.

Total estimated cost per year: 10,500 tuition + 2000 misc school expense (textbooks etc) + 12,000 (9 months living expenses) = $24,500 x 3 years

I will most likely be working in the summers but I do not want to rely too much on this income in my budget in case I can't find an internship or want to take time off to volunteer/travel etc.

I am fully aware that with my current level of savings I will be graduating with significant debt. I considered working an extra year to save more, but after weighing the costs and benefits it seems like a better idea to take the risk since there is a good chance I will find a higher paying job after I graduate and I will not accumulate interest on government debt until I do.

I guess my main questions are:

- What are the chances I will be able to get government student loans that fully cover my expenses for all 3 years? I'm hoping to stay away from line of credits since there is no grace period on the accumulation of interest. Is there any kind of resource that can give me an estimate of how much I can expect to be eligible to borrow?

- Without committing fraud obviously, is there anything I can do to maximize my chances of receiving a higher government loan for the next three years? For example, will it make a difference for my application next year if I sell all my investments and put them toward my tuition for the year as opposed to holding onto them?

- under the Lifelong Learning Plan, it seems I can  borrow up to $10,000 from an RRSP to pay for full time education. My current plan is to sell my shares in my RESPP and transfer the funds to a newly set up RRSP account through my bank, and then borrow the full amount of the RRSP through the lifelong learning plan. I don't expect there will be tax on any of this. Are there any faults with this plan?

I'm a sophomore in high school. I applied to a (fairly competitive) summer program, and on April 20th, I was notified of my rejection from the program. I've crafted an email requesting feedback on my application, to be sent to the program directors. Does my email seem polite, or pushy? Is it too lengthy? Is it too late to send this email now? How can I express my gratitude more clearly? What can I change about this email to increase my changes of getting a reply? Thank you all for your help.  


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Subject Title: A Request for Feedback on [Program] Application

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Dear [Program Director],
  
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Hello! I'm [APCS Trash], a sophomore from [APCS Trash High School]. I submitted an application to [Program] this year, and was notified that I was not selected as a candidate for the 2016 program.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Firstly, thank you again for reviewing and considering my 2016 application to [Program]. Choosing applicants each year is an undoubtedly difficult job, and your time and efforts on behalf of the [Program] applicants are greatly appreciated.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I was initially disheartened by my denial from [Program], but self-betterment is the motto! There is a chance to learn and to grow from every mistake, and I would like to turn this rejection into an opportunity to reach out again and ask if you had any additional feedback on my application — anything you noticed that could be changed or improved on. I would truly be beyond grateful for any small piece of criticism or personal insight you have to offer, whether it's a weakness in my academic performance or a flaw in my essay writing style.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Hindsight is definitely 20/20, and looking over my application again, some potential flaws become apparent: I stated that my ""summer availability is subject to change""  because I applied to other summer programs, which demonstrates a lack of commitment and interest (not a smart decision!); I did not write an essay about my interest in Biomolecular Engineering, which again suggests indecisiveness and irresponsibility; I only very briefly touched on my experience at [Other Affiliated Program] last year, and barely connected it to what I wanted to gain from [Program]. Is this analysis well-founded? If you have the time to answer, what are other areas of weakness in my application? I hope to improve myself, both as a student and as an applicant, and a different perspective on my application would help immensely with identifying errors to avoid in the future. Again, I want to express my enormous gratitude for a few minutes of your time and a quick skim of my application.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure whether my 2016 application is still accessible, so I have attached my application essays (verbatim) in a PDF document below just in case.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


I completely understand if you have other priorities; I hope that my request is not a burden to you, but rather a small task to tackle in your spare time. Thank you again for making this year's [Program] program possible, and a final thank-you for providing this incredible internship opportunity to high schoolers from all over the nation!

4jgyrj,57,2016-05-15,Scored my first programming internship!,purethoughtndeeds,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jgyrj/scored_my_first_programming_internship/,"TL;DR: Decided to double major in CS, worked really hard in a Biology course, professor noticed me, I got a spontaneous job interview and got an internship.

I've been perusing /r/cscareerquestions for about a year now, and I am extremely grateful for the excellent advice and insight given on here. I'd like to share my mini success story with you all today.

I currently attend a top public university and entered three years ago as a film major hoping to specialize in virtual effects. I felt that the degree was not opening the doors I wanted and I had a very high unfulfilled interest in science and computing, so my third semester I enrolled in a Computer Science minor. Since then, I excelled in four programming classes and built up a neat little portfolio, but when I started looking at careers I found that a CS major would open more doors for me.

So after browsing this subreddit obsessively and rethinking my life, I decided to add a second Computer Science major to my degree, though it would add three semesters to my track.

My university has one of the most competitive CS programs in the nation, so the internal transfer process is ridiculously tedious. I had to take two non-CS science courses and a Calculus course, along with two essays to be considered for admission for this Fall. I had already taken two introductory biology courses for non-majors, but I had to take it AGAIN at major's level to be considered for admission.

I thought it would be a piece of cake since I had already had plenty of exposure to the subject, but boy was I wrong.

Bio ended up being an extremely difficult course, and the professor really worked us hard. But, my professor had great teaching methods I had not quite seen before, and in class he heavily utilized a classroom participation application that he created.

The professor took note of me because of my perfect attendance and my class participation, and after a class in which he recommend a book on cognitive psychology that interested me, I came up to speak to him about it. I told him about my double major and all that jazz, and he said he could try to get me programming work experience.

So at the end of the semester, as I was taking my challenging Biology final, the professor placed a card on my desk with his company's name and told me to meet him in a specific location on campus immediately afterwards. I was going to take my Calculus final in 6 hours, so my mind was mainly on that and I didn't know what to expect.

So I get to this place, and it turns out to be the office for his start-up. I am introduced to the team of software engineers by the CEO (who is the son of my professor) and I'm asked to talk about my background. Then the CEO asks me to show him my work, which I was not expecting. So I show him my chatroom and web applications I built from scratch, and in my code I had some cuss words and unprofessional comments because I had never expected anyone to see my code (but thankfully, he was chill and thought it was quite funny).

Then I'm given a marker and asked to solve a programming problem on the whiteboard. I was extremely nervous and took about 30 minutes to solve it, since I was not expecting a spontaneous interview, and was in between my two hardest finals of the semester. I finished the problem correctly, though it wasn't the most efficient algorithm, but he seemed satisfied with it and bode me farewell.

Two days later I receive word that I've received a summer internship for this software start-up, and they will consider me for paid employment for the Fall.

Only because I had taken the advice from this subreddit, worked hard to build up my personal projects and double major in CS and had an understanding of what a programming interview would be like, did I obtain this internship. 

So this is the perfect foot in the door for my first software-building experience, and I wanted to thank you all for your advice and support!

4jhckg,1,2016-05-15,I feel stuck in a loop in my programming career and need help breaking out of it,cs_stuckinaloop,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jhckg/i_feel_stuck_in_a_loop_in_my_programming_career/,"So here's the situation: I'm currently looking for a software engineer job and I don't want it to be like any of the other jobs I've had previously. I didn't graduate with a CS degree. I have a 4 year degree, but it's in some different major that just happens to be related to computing technology. We took programming classes, but nothing extensive. I didn't take internships or co-ops. Then close to graduation time, comes the start of the dreaded loop that I want to get out of. Here's how it panned out.

Basically, it's a cycle of working for a company that is hurting for cash most of the time, and then being let go, usually because of those financial circumstances. And following that up, a long period of job hunting. This has been going on for about six years now and the cycle has repeated itself three times. 

I think the ratio of working to job hunting is something like two to one. So for every two years of work I've done since graduation, I've job searched for one year.

I don't get these jobs from knowing anyone, and I don't start looking for a new job until I stop working at my old one. But what I want now is financial stability. To get out of this cycle, I am applying for software engineer jobs at bigger companies now, and sometimes I get interviews with them so my resume shouldn't be that bad. Still I haven't gotten any offers. Same applies when I try using headhunters/recruiters to help find me a job.

What other options do I have to get out of this loop? I prefer to get a good job now and not a few years from now, so returning to school is out of the question. "

I realize some of these questions can be answered through the school, but I wanted to see what others went through.

1.As an undergrad is it possible to carry on an internship and part-time job?
2.Did you get financial aid over the summer while at your internship?
3.How did you know when you found the right major?
4. CS and Math/CS are impacted. If I don't get into CS (or Math/CS), what would be a good fall back major - physics? Don't get me wrong, I am on top of it, but it's always good to plan for failure...

I've taken up to calc3, mechanics (calc based), C++, and Java. All were interesting/challenging. The main reason why I thinking physics is because it's difficult. The same reason why I joined the US Marines initially. Neither came easy, but I like how hard work changes a person.

Anyways, I keep coming across negative reviews about the physics major - even from some professors. They say go engineering or CS, that's where the $ is at. Those majors can also be pretty challenging from what I've researched, so I am not ruling them out.

I am conflicted because I could care less about what field I go into. Any path will be an adventure and I will enjoy it even if it sucks (thank you Marine Corps :D) I am just getting to that point where I have to choose and there's no clear indication on which path I should take. What do you think?"

Advice?,jobless_scrub,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4ji1vf/just_graduated_college_a_few_days_ago_feeling/,"Just 2 days ago, I graduated from my top private university, majoring in econ and minoring in math. My GPA is shit -- 2.88. Luckily, I was very involved on campus; I was on an athletic team and a fraternity, and participated in many campus performing events, so it's not like I just dicked around all of college. I worked all summers, and interned at a top hedge fund last summer. I already got in contact with the people I know at my internship last summer, and they currently don't have any positions available for me. 

One of my biggest mistakes of college was majoring in econ. I found it really boring, and liked computer science a lot better when I took a few classes during my second semester junior year. Thing is, it was far too late to change to CS, so I just decided to finish my econ degree. I'm not really sure about what I want to do careerwise, and would actually prefer to do a short term kind of job like an internship or fellowship as opposed to a full time thing. 

Sorry if this is all a huge jumble of information -- I'm feeling lost after all. What do you think would be the best course of action for me to take right now? Reach out to friends/family and ask if they know of any opportunities? Keep applying to online job listings?"

I was dismissed from my college sometime ago for my grades, and ended up getting reinstated soon after because it was due to personal issues.

I took some time off from school to go to a psychologist and get a part time job for a while. Eventually after having a job and taking some classes on the side, I decided that I was ready to return to my school.

So here I am now, in my first term back, fucking everything up once again.

I was never over my issues. I just convinced myself that I was. I've been telling my parents and friends that everything's alright and that I'm doing fine, but the truth is that I can barely force myself to leave the house or go to class most days; and because of this I ended up sabotaging myself once again.

Last day to withdraw from my classes was last week, but I couldn't even do that. I couldn't bare to tell my advisor, who has been helping me along this whole time, that I need to withdraw from all of my classes again (and honestly, since I'm on reinstatement contract I don't think I would be able to...)

So now I'm very likely going to fail 2 out of the 3 classes I took this term, thereby failing the reinstatement contract requirements, and failing out of my school.

I'm a computer science major with a decent amount of experience (had a 6 month internship and helped develop a website for the past 4 months), but I don't think that will matter much without the degree.

I don't even know what to do with my life right now. I want to just go in a hole and die. I'm not sure what I should even do after this. Should I go to a community college and see if I'll do better there(if I can even go with getting kicked out of this school? I don't really know how they work to be honest..)? Should I try to get a minimum wage job? Should I try to apply for a computer science related job? It also really doesn't help that the school I currently attend is very expensive and the loans I've already taken out are going to kill me without a decent paying job.

I really need any help I can get. I'm just sitting here unsure of what to do with my life anymore.

I was 3 years into this school and doing fine, then this whole disaster happened.....and now I really don't know what I should even do...help please..."

Should I go ahead and get my master's degree? At the university I'll be attending, I can complete this in just one additional year. If I do, should I get a master's in science or a master's in engineering? The university offers both. What's the difference? 

Other than internships, what sort of work experience would an employer like to see? Office work? General labor at a manufacturing plant? I currently have 4 years of experience in construction, mostly tile installation. 

What computer programs can I begin learning? What sort of projects could I work on in these programs that would impress an employer? I just built a high end PC for this purpose. (I'm just using Fallout 4 to test my system, I swear :P)

If everyone tells you you're crazy, and you are crazy and unable to see it in yourself (because you're crazy), then they are right.  If you are not crazy, and everyone tells you you're crazy, that would make them wrong.  In either case, you would believe yourself to not be mentally ill.  So how do you tell if you really are, or if it's just everyone being a fucking idiot around you?

Parents want to diagnose me with depression at 28 years old.  I am currently battling chronic illness.  Parents have never read DSM 5 or even know what the DSM is.  They rely on others to tell them what to think.

Doctors tell me about the ""mind body"" connection, and suggest SSRIs and that I am in ""deep need of psychiatric help"" despite the fact that I have gone down that road before, taken the drugs, and nothing has worked.

Diagnosed with ""Autonomic Dysfunction with Vagal Neuropathy"" which is a nervous system disorder, but everyone wants to tell me that my ""depression"" that I don't believe I have is causing my health problem.  Could it be that because I'm sick and sometimes cannot get out of bed it may look like depression when in fact it's just chronic illness?

The problem with being surrounded by these people is that I have no objective evidence to support my state of mind.  I am being driven insane by these people (family, friends, doctors) who, without evidence, tell me I'm depressed, and are not open to discussion on the topic.  I hate authority.

When you live with these people you start to question your own sanity.  I have always done very well in life (school, internships, jobs, military experience, etc.) and have excelled at every job/position I have ever held.  I believe myself to be more competent than my fellow workers, as evident by my success in life.  Why all of a sudden am I doubting myself and questioning my own sanity, just because the herd wants me to question myself and take their pills, when I've had a tremendous success in my past?

I deep down do not want to take any more psych drugs.  I want my nervous system fixed.  All everyone wants to tell me is that ""when the depression goes away so will your health problems"", as if someone with AIDS or cancer can just take effexor to make the problem go away?

I'm going mad.  I can't stand these people.  Is it me and do I need to be on effexor to shut them the fuck up, or is everyone else, those god-worshipping ignorant cocksuckers really as stupid, closeminded, and irrational as I think they are?  The same people that cannot plan for the future, are incompetent at work, and unable to hold a basic conversation with me without warping the truth?

The biggest problem I have is that I now find myself ignoring evidence in front of me because ""Dad doesn't believe it"", sort of like how I was indoctrinated as a child to not think for myself and just follow orders.  I could do a Calculus problem and know it's right, but still not believe it, because Father or Mother wouldn't understand it and say I'm wrong.  I could be staring the answer in the face and not believe it, even though my logical brain knows it's right, because my ""is this really true?"" part of me is willing to deny logic and reason to satisfy the demands and irrationality of others."

Schools: Regarding schools, don't worry, I have plenty of safety/match schools lined up. 

- Ga Tech

- Cornell

- Carnegie Mellon

- Northwestern 

- Purdue

All of these are RD, except for Purdue, which is going to be EA. 

So I think I have pretty good academics, ECs, but I'm terrible with awards. As for essays, I'll manage to write a pretty good one. 

And for Recs:

- Counselor: She likes me. I'll give it a 8-9/10. I'm pretty sure I visited her the most in my class (or close to that, second most?) to talk to her, so she knows me well.

- Science teacher: I was in her AP Bio and ES classes, and she was a coach for Science Olympiad. Probably a 6-7/10. 

- English teacher: Really, really likes my writing. He'll review my essay for me, too. We have a good relationship, I like to share lots of ideas in that class and he always has good comments about me. Probably...7.5-8/10. 

Thank you for reading, and again, I'd appreciate any advice given to me!

If so, how do I do so without burning bridges?",throwaway43123421,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jntvp/can_i_turn_down_this_internship_offer_that_i/,"I received an offer from a local software company (A) in around December and accepted the offer in January. I really liked the company, the people, and the projects, so I thought I would finish my internship search. 

However, another company (B) that is much more well known than A was holding talks at my school and I applied just for the fun of it. I really did not expect to get an offer, but that's exactly what happened. Company B is much more well known, paying more, and in my opinion has the best career building opportunities. 

The offer that I signed with company A says that I'll start in June, however, I would like to reject their offer and go with company B.

In the offer letter from company A, there's a line that states:


 ""I understand that my employment with company A is at will and may be terminated by me 
or by company A at any time for any reason."" 

Because of this, I'm fairly certain that I can legally terminate the offer, however, I would love feedback on etiquette and how to best handle this situation by leaving on a good term. Thanks!"

What can I do to make myself more appealing to employers?,arexious,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4jo2ca/graduating_in_december_what_can_i_do_to_make/,"I'm 23 and I'll be graduating in December with a bachelor of applied arts and sciences in Applied Technology and Performance Improvement from the University of North Texas(BAAS ATPI).  It is designed for students that have obtained technical credits in community college.  I was originally doing a 2-year IT program at a community college.  So the courses I took that transferred were what you would generally take for an Information Technology degree.  

&gt; Fundamentals of Networking Technologies, Personal Computer Hardware, Network Troubleshooting and Support, Database Programming, Linux Installation and Configuration, Implementing and Supporting Servers, Intermediate Web Programming, and Windows Server Management

So I have a bit of exposure to those things.  I mostly enjoyed the Linux coursework and the database management coursework, in which I used a Pi as a LAMP server, and used that for all of my PHP/MySQL projects.  I also worked for a company for about a year where I did testing and repairs on laptops, desktops, and tablets.

Now, the thing I'm unsure of is how to proceed... what exactly should I focus on to make me a more appealing candidate to employers?  I live in the Dallas area and am not sure if I should start looking for internships or aim for the network+, linux+, etc.  And what would kind of positions should I look for?  Everyone seems to recommend starting with Help Desk and expanding from there."

They extended an offer and I accepted. I had been emailing with my boss and asked him what I should brush up on before starting, and he replied with JavaScript, J-unit, and Powerbuilder.

4joboj,2,2016-05-16,How to find my next project?,Gatsbyyy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4joboj/how_to_find_my_next_project/,"Hello,

I am an intermediate programmer. I'm pretty confident in my java ability from my uni courses. I am starting an internship soon that uses python.

anyway, my point is, between school projects and work projects, I never know what to do and program in my spare time. I have learned a lot about the linux OS but thats mostly just googling. I am looking for some advice on finding new projects and the mentality behind it.

To expand, I am curious on how you, another programmer who enjoys programming in their free time, how you go from ending a project to picking a new big project to focus the next few weeks on.

I love and thrive on problem solving once I lock my focus in somewhere. And I am not complaining there are not enough resources for ""try these 10 COOL projects"" those always seem cool, but I never know how to settle, so, its not a lack of resources but instead a lack of mentality to focus on things and figure out what I would enjoy to do next, while at school and work the assignments are handed to you.

So, in short, If you all could explain your thought process on how you go from one personal project to the next and why you chose that next project.

That would be awesome! The best way I can describe this feeling I have is like finishing a netflix show and not knowing how to invest in another one, but once you do you binge watch all of it. kinda

anyway, thank you for taking the time to read and respond! Have a great day!"
4jodq0,1,2016-05-16,"23 y/o Aircraft Mechanic, ex gf is having my baby in 3 weeks and doesn't want me to contact her, and I just quit my job.",FreeTacosNBeer,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4jodq0/23_yo_aircraft_mechanic_ex_gf_is_having_my_baby/,"I just need my story to be heard. Thanks to anyone who listened. I'll just start from the beginning and lead to where I am now.

I graduated high school when I was 17, went to college to be an aircraft mechanic, got school paid for by an internship, got a degree and a license. I worked at that same repair station for a little more than 4 years. I learned a hell of a lot. Still am a great mechanic. Rented a house with a friend. Bought a brand new car and motorcycle. Life was pretty good. Work was stressful, as I was more experienced, and tasked with more important jobs and deadlines. 

I had 3 best friends and we would party a good bit on the weekends. They for the most part followed in my footsteps before branching off in different areas but still lived within 10 minutes of each other. One weekend I threw a huge crawfish boil. I bought 160 pounds of crawfish. (If you don't know, that's a metric fuckton of crawfish). Invited everyone I knew. Told them to invite everyone they knew. Family. Everyone. I would say around 50 people showed up through out the day. I cooked and slammed beers all day. Anyways. My best friends girlfriend, brought her friend, we will call her Jill. I saw Jill and I knew I was in love. Eventually we ended up dating for 2 years. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. 

We had a great relationship in the beginning. But eventually it went south, with the stress of my job, and the differences in our beliefs and with jealousy. We began to fight a hell of a lot. Just verbal arguments. A lot of the time I'd just leave. A lot of the time she'd just leave. We drank a ton. I spent all my money on going out and drinking. Which caused us to fight more. She drank a lot more than I did. And she was unemployed and wasn't in school at the time. So it wasn't the best mix for me, but I made it work. I went into work without sleeping more times than I can count. She had an ex she wanted to stay friends with, and I wasn't ok with it. And it eventually tore us apart. And we broke it off. I quit drinking. And the lease on my house was almost up for the second year. And in hopes of getting an excellent job in the near future I moved back in with my parents. 

I didn't talk to her. I was very depressed though. I just was a zombie. I just worked. And bought computer parts or car parts. I stayed to myself on the weekends and played with them and sort of annexed my friends. They aren't the type to understand what the depression was like. And I didn't want to be a loser and explain it to them just to have them not understand. Anyways. So I end up not getting the job. Sucked. But life moved on. I didn't make enough money to lease another house on my own. So I continued living with my parents. I started living there February of 15

A lot of days I'd just want to lay in bed and not go to work. And I did that often. It became kind of habitual. The more I stayed home. The harder it was to go back. I worked my ass off so that was really the only thing that kept me from getting fired. Sometimes I'd miss 3 days in a row. Just sitting in my room. Feeling bad for myself.

Well, last August some things happened and Jill ended up texting me. We made plans to hang out on my birthday at the end of August 15. Well. A month later I find out Jill is pregnant. She has always been extremely worried about not being able to have kids. And we had unprotected sex for the entire length of our relationship. So it became the norm. What are the chances of her getting pregnant in the first couple days of seeing her again for the first time. 

As soon as she took the test she started crying, talking about she can't have this baby. She's fucked up too much and she's trying to recover and she can't have this baby. (She's adopted also, this is semi important). My initial reaction was great. I thought that I could have her. And our baby. And we could be together. I just saw it all working. She did not. She wanted an abortion. We fought constantly about it. I took another job where I worked less hours for about the same pay so she could go to school at night and I could watch the baby. Our combined incomes were more than substantial. I offered to buy her a new car. I wanted a family. 

I eventually brought her to my parents and told them. They took it better than I would have ever expected. They told Jill, if she was going to have an abortion, that they will adopt it instead. She flipped out. We all started getting heated. I told her I wanted to move in together. I told her I loved her. And I told her I wanted to have this baby together. Right in front of my whole family. Her response was something I'll never forget. ""Just because I'm having this baby doesn't mean we are going to live together"".

That statement haunts me every day. My parents and her get into an argument about how it is not just her choice. Everyone cries. I take her home. I was like a stone. I had no emotions. I didn't even argue. I was destroyed and through at that moment. Maybe she was right. But that wasn't what I wanted. I didn't want to live in a broken home. I didn't want that for my baby. 

We tried working it out. She wouldn't let me go to the doctors appointments in the beginning or see the ultra sounds. She lived about an hour away so it was difficult for us to see each other. It was hard. And I felt betrayed. She worked late so the only time we could see each other was when I rented a hotel and this was getting way too expensive. Her parents didn't like me and mine didn't like her. And I started declining to see her. I wouldn't answer her phone calls a lot. I wouldn't see her on the weekends. I hated my new job. And I began getting depressed worse and worse until I finally decided I needed to see a doctor. I was missing work all the time. Pay checks sucked. I just laid around on weekends. I just quit. I felt so diminished. I stopped eating. 

I saw a therapist once a week, and there they prescribed me a lot of medications. I didn't like most of them. But they prescribed me klonopin. A small dose. .5 MG twice a day. But this made the pain stop. I could cope. I could be normal. What I thought was normal. But all it really did was make me not give a shit. I stopped giving a shit about her. About putting forth an effort for her. She wanted to do it seperately. I was going to make it seperate. 

I took a very high paying job for delta in Atlanta. Quit my job. Spent tons of money on new tools and a box that would fit into my car. Moved to atlanta on my own. And started at delta. I, along with 15 other people, got laid off the first day. They came in and asked us to leave immideiately. I was in shock. I just quietly got in my car and drove home. It wasn't until 10 minutes later that it actually hit me. 

This hurt me. I had never failed before, and even though it wasn't my fault I felt like a failure. I was failing Jill. And myself. And our child. I knew I couldn't support Jill and the baby on my wage where we lived. And I didn't want to make my parents watch the baby. So I was going to go somewhere, where I made enough money Jill didn't have to work. Sure I wouldn't see the baby as often. But I was at peace with that at the time. 

I got another high paying job soon after in Louisiana. All this time my debt slowly accumulating. Now working for a few weeks in between each job really hurt. I kept on. In Louisiana, some days they would let me work, some days they would send me home. I really didn't make anything. And I added another 800 a month payment to my debt already. I started taking more of the klonopin than I was prescribed. Then, naturally I ran out. About 2 weeks early. I didn't really think anything of it. Then I began experiencing withdrawal. This was far worse than any depression or anxiety I've ever felt. Sweating. Cramping. Constantly running to the bathroom. Randomly crying about little things. Feeling like you don't even exist. Excruciating headaches. It was terrible. I couldn't function. And I was pissed off I wasn't getting any hours there. And I quit. I stayed about another week and went home. 

I was home for about 2 weeks. I had gotten my perception refilled. I didn't see Jill one time. She asked to see me a lot. But I was cold and bitter. I didn't want to see her. Now my debt was consuming. I'm broke. Totally broke. And relying on my parents more or less now. I borrowed about 1500 from them. And took a job this time in florida. I left. I didn't tell Jill where I was going. I didn't care. 

When I got here it was ok. I was well liked. Plenty of hours. Pay wasn't as good but the hours made up for it. And I began to get depressed again. To feel like a failure again. And again I upped my dosage and ran out. Same cycle. Started missing work. Can't pay my bills. Miserable. I am literally miserable. One night I break down and ask Jill to call. She tells me that my absence shows I want no contact. And she asked me to never contact her or the child. That all I would do was show up and leave again. Originally I had started this for them. I was here for them. But I couldn't do it. I was too weak. I am too weak. This killed me. I don't know who is right or wrong. And I don't care. I'm dead inside.

I quit my job today. I'm afraid I'm going to take my own life. My parents won't understand. They will say I need to man up. But I have to get back home. I feel worthless. I feel like a dead beat father. I'm going to lose all the things I worked so hard to own. My family is going to think I'm a failure when I arrive tomorrow. And I need medication to function properly in normal society. I cannot feel any more worse about myself than I do right now. And I have no idea what to do, other than go home. 

Thanks to anyone that listened. I'm very afraid. And I needed my story to be out there. I hope it makes sense. I didn't proof read much. Thanks again.

So recently, I was offered a chance at an overseas internship and I got placed in Silicon Valley. It will be a 1 year program, where I'd work under a startup.

While I had thought that it would have been the best choice for me, I'm not too sure now - the jobs here don't interest me, mainly because they're centered around web/app dev work while my interest is in Comp.Security.

A second option has been offered to me - a 6 month stint in Israel, where I can work under a CompSec startup. I know there's a lot of prestige at stake here, and people would give up a lot to go to Silicon Valley - am I making the right choice to switch to the Israel program?

I have a decently impressive resume and would rather spend this summer learning on my own (as well as taking GE classes) but am concerned that not having an internship this summer will be detrimental. Advice?

So recently, I was offered a chance at an overseas internship and I got placed in Silicon Valley. It will be a 1 year program, where I'd work under a startup.


While I had thought that it would have been the best choice for me, I'm not too sure now - the jobs here don't interest me, mainly because they're centered around web/app dev work while my interest is in Comp.Security.


A second option has been offered to me - a 6 month stint in Israel, where I can work under a CompSec startup.

 I know there's a lot of prestige at stake here, and people would give up a lot to go to Silicon Valley - am I making the right choice to switch to the Israel program?"

I'm currently finishing up my IT program, completed my A+ certificate and currently working on my Network+ and MCSA. 

I'm finishing up my internship at a large company which consists of a small IT department. Being in a tier one position I have been exposed to a lot of different networking devices, platforms, etc.

What interests me the most is the IT infrastructure, Windows Server, Active Directory, Virtualization, networking devices (Cisco Meraki) etc. Being able to maintain and configure the things I have listed is something I'm passionate about. What really stood out during my internship is how inconsistent and disorganized our AD is, I'm the type of person that if I were to configure an infrastructure, everything has to be consistent and organize (i.e. naming scheme, users in the proper distribution lists, etc.) 

My question is, what should I specialize in? I know it's very early on in my career as I am new to the IT industry with 1 year of work experience. I like to plan ahead and open up different opportunities in the future. I was thinking of being an IT consultant or an Infrastructure Manager with years of experience. Should I be working for an MSP or for companies with IT departments? 

Any advice would be great, I don't mind constructive criticism.

So now im in a dilemma. Since most internships require that you will be returning for at least one more semester, I only have the fall semester to intern. If I am not able to land an internship for the fall, how screwed am I, and what should I do? I am taking a few courses this summer, so I cant really work on new projects.

I made a portfolio site with several projects that ive done over the years. What are the chances that recruiters will take the time to visit it (I have linked to it from my resume). I'd like to think that I have a good collection of projects, however I am worried that it is mainly C# stuff. I am going through CTCI right now solving the problems with C++ to learn the language (im loving this language so far).

And any critique to my resume and portfolio would be greatly appreciated before I initiate mass applying mode.

Although the full-time desktop gig isn't available, my boss offered me a full-time job as a POS Support technician, which works on the store POS systems.

My first semester of my Sophomore year, I scored a 1.7 GPA. *Wonderful*. The whole semester was a shit show. I wasn't sleeping, I was incredibly stressed, and I was drinking over four mugs of coffee a day, and procrastinating on everything. Halfway through the following semester, when my grades were looking as shitty as the previous one, I finally decided to go to student health. Through the multiple sessions I had with a counselor, it finally became clear that my procrastination was being enhanced by my anxiety, and this was creating a vicious feedback cycle. One of the things that helped me was creating to do lists. But since it was so late into the semester, they couldn't do much. After pulling a couple miracles, like walking into my Differential Equations final with an F, and walking out with a C (no curve, mind you), I finished off my semester with a measly 2.3. 

After escaping the most stressful year of my life, I started up my co-op in the fall. Thankfully, my Freshman year GPA was a 2.9, and I got an offer before my grades tanked. The first semester of my co-op was defined by a huge project that was dumped on my desk. It was an incredibly stressful project, having to do with a mechanical failure that caused hundred of products to be returned. No engineer had time to look at it, so my boss gave it to me. I had managers asking me for updates constantly, and I hit several roadblocks along the way. But it was through this project that I learned how to channel that anxiety of not knowing what I didn't know, back into the motivation of solving a problem. After about a month and a half of refusing to fail on this project, I fixed it. The customers got new products, and the change was implemented across the board for the product line. At the end of this semester, my boss took me out to a fancy restaurant, gave me a raise, and offered me a job post-grad.

When I came back for my Junior level classes, I tackled my first semester with ease. I'm damn near proud of the B I earned in Fluid Dynamics after seeing half the class drop out, and most of my friends scraping for a D. I slept well, and I remember being stressed about school exactly twice the whole semester. First time was when I got a C on a Philosophy test, and right before finals. Fast forward through two more co-op terms, and another semester, I had a 3.0 average for my Junior year.

My final co-op term was this Spring, which left my summer free to possibly do something else. But since I had picked up so many responsibilities and projects here, I didn't see any reason to jump over to another local company to do boring intern work, so I was really only considering internships that would really stand out on my resume. I had an internal reference at a...lets say a very big company in California, and was emailing one of my reference's contacts. I had already applied on their website for their summer internship program, and this contact said he would help me out with securing an internship, then he noticed the GPA I had listed...

*""...I encourage you to reapply when you meet the minimum requirements.""*

Unfortunately, I wouldn't be applying for an internship again once I had my degree...I responded explaining the story behind my GPA as I did above, and how it just doesn't reflect my academic abilities. He pointed me to the office that handled intern applicants, which might as well should of been a black hole, since all my emails and phone calls went unanswered. So after giving them more than enough time to respond, I took my bosses offer to extend my final co-op semester through the summer. 

I get it. Employers like to correlate GPA with your aptitude for work for a variety of reasons, and anyone over a 3.0 is going to nod their head in agreement. But does every company have to be so fucking dense? How the fuck does a GPA outweigh multiple points of job experience, a glowing recommendation *from the boss that oversaw my work as a mechanical engineer over three co-op semesters*, and a growing list of projects that I've lead and completed? I've worked with two other co-ops at my company that were both clinging to 3.0s. One was a borderline alcoholic, and the other was literally the worst human being that I ever had to work with - quite possibly worth another rant post. If I had submitted either of their transcripts and GPAs, I know they'd of quite possibly been offered the internship that I wanted so badly, and would have been nowhere near as successful as I would of been.

I'm thankful for the events that prevented me from falling onto academic probation or worse. But it's a shame that my shitty performance in academics almost three years ago prevented me from being offered a game changing opportunity this summer. *sigh*

I'm currently a rising senior in a US university and am myself a US citizen (born here). When I graduate I will have a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in German. So, native English speaker and fairly fluent in German (around C1/C2).

Job-wise I unfortunately don't have much, since it's been hard to be employed during the school year and due to my housing situation it's been difficult to find jobs over the summer. In high school I worked for the student IT department for a year, so I have miscellaneous computer skills (also from my studies). I can go into more detail if need be. A big minus is that I can't drive, but I definitely should learn anyway, so if it's imperative it's something I'm more than willing to work on. But even if I could drive, I'm not sure I would have the money for a car or license here.

Funnily enough, I have actually been in Germany for a year abroad already, and am in fact still here :) I return to the US in August but while here I've studied at a German university and had an internship at a well-known academic commission. So, thankfully, I do have some references/contacts/roots here already. I'm not sure how much that will help in the long run.

My goal IS Germany, so other countries wouldn't really make sense for my situation. A big piece of this is that my boyfriend is a native German, and we are looking to close the gap in the coming years, if possible. (The relationship is not the only reason I want to move here, but it is of course an influence nonetheless.) I'm not sure if that's a huge help, but I figure it's worth mentioning.

Finally, since my degree is in physics I'd want to try and keep my career in that field, if possible. Maybe that would mean a masters or working as a student researcher. I'm not sure how accessible these things are to an international student; I'd rather delay working on a masters and instead get job experience, but I have no concept of how ""open"" academia/research here is, whether at universities or elsewhere. Honestly though I'm open to anything to just get me on my feet.

I'd appreciate any guidance at all! And sorry for the wall of text."

BASICALLY, is it worth going to the school in the city vs the school nearby even if the city school is more expensive?

I'm still not sure exactly what to begin with, but here goes.

I was never really an outgoing person, never had many friends. A few close ones, throughout my childhood, but they were the type of people that other people flocked to, the exact opposite of me.

I had a few relationships throughout high school, most of which felt extremely codependent, using each other to fill a hole in each other that we both thought needed to be filled. The last of which lasted from my junior year of high school until my junior year of college.

That last relationship was one that I thought would last forever, was the one I thought I was meant to be with for the rest of my life, a perfect fit. It turned out to be too good to be true. This relationship ended as my Junior year ended in college. She cheated on me.

My self esteem and self confidence had never been very high. I had always been described as a decent-looking guy (in my eyes I was below average, even then), but after the relationship my self-esteem and self confidence were at a new found low.

I'm one year out of college now, almost to the day. I haven't been able to establish another relationship since then. I've put on weight, and like I said have never been the handsomest guy, who would want to be in a relationship with me?

I've moved back home with my parents since I got out of college. The few high school friends that I had around here moved on by now, and my best friend lives in an entirely different state and barely ever has time to talk. I feel alone.

I got a job off an internship near my house, it pays way less then my degree would be able to get me and is very unfulfilling. But it gives me money without having to go through the intimidating stress inducing process that is interviewing. Why would anyone want to hire me to do a worthwhile job? My skills and resume are unimpressive, lackluster, to say the least.

And she's having a baby with the guy she cheated on me with...I forgot to mention.

I just feel like I have nothing going for me, I am unimpressive, unlikable, ugly. Everyone is moving forward with theirs lives, and I'm just standing still, getting sucked down into quicksand.

I went to a doctor and she put me on Welbutrin. I felt like it was working for a while, but these last few days, anytime I think I want to cry. I try to distract myself, ignore my pain, my loneliness, with whatever I can. But I don't know how much longer I can do it."

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT.

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part VII**

I've been able to schedule my Networking exam while still waiting for the Security exam reimbursement. At this point, I'm expecting to never be reimbursed, but at least I will have something extra to throw on my resume after all is said and done. 

I've also met some other team members like Randy, our developer. He single-handedly designed a tool our security team uses (proprietary for the company) and is our support for the tool. He seems like he's far more talented for this position, but he's close friends with guys on the security team, including Jim. We both had a lot of overlap in gaming, and often would chat at lunch.

He mentioned that the security team may be taking another contract and would need staffing for it. The security team had a more staunch leader that filtered most of Dave's intervention, and I was eager to have my credentials to par for a lateral move at this point. 

Speaking of Dave, this fine late summer day starts with an all-hands on deck meeting: one of my clients, SalesClient, had shown interest in purchasing a Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), but the available systems we offered were way out of their price range. Dave had this quickly snowball into a project idea tasked to me: create an IDS using only freeware and pre-owned company assets (for this, nothing) to create a company-owned property we could manufacture and sell. 

I tried to fight for any resources I could: a set of hours from Randy, a budget for potentially purchasing assets we could use for this, anything. This fell by the wayside, but I did have no expected deadline and the time to work on this was STRICTLY 'whenever you have downtime to work on it'. Any contract support was priority number one, this was a project he was looking to have movement on my the end of the year. 

And all I had was the hardware from a 6-year old server that sat on my desk and Google to try to create this. 

Some research later brought me to SNIVEL. At the time, it was commercially-available via GPL, we could modify it as we wanted, and we would be selling the contract with support. This was the closest thing I could find that met our requirements, and the documentation was surprisingly good. I lost track of time trying to find if this was something we could use as a business, as the legality aspects were rather new to me. 

Arnold spoke to me the next day. He didn't seem all that worried about this new project, but after I inquired he said he was fairly sure this was fine and to start creating a prototype, but get formal approval from the accounting team to have this reviewed very carefully before we moved past proof of concept. Fair enough, the legalese seemed over my head but after pouring over pages of articles this seemed like the ideal solution. 

Assuming the documentation to get the initial setup and configuration done was fine, the only real issue we had was the display. I wanted to get a single-screen overview the client could glance at, and had a few tweaks in mind to make the device as self-sustaining as possible. I'd had great luck running a virtual Linux server for our internal ticketing system, so I was sold. 

About a week after announcing this project, Dave came by my desk asking me about movement on this. Arnold was in earshot, but I explained what I had found and my plan was to setup this SNIVEL software, configure and tweak it until it met our needs well, and offer a test run to a client once my team was confident this was what we wanted to present. Dave seemed caught off-guard, nodded and was off. Shortly afterwards, Arnold sends me an IM:

Arnold: ""Hey, don't put too much confidence in this. Dave presents projects all the time, and they fall apart or get ignored after a few weeks. There's a reason he wouldn't budget anything for this.""

Likely sage advice, but my feet are already in the pool of inspiration and I'm ready to dive in. Over the next couple of months I set up this server to be what I imagined it: 

* This device was intended to plug right into the network

* It ran SNIVEL, logging all packets in text files

* Redirected two specific IP addresses we'd had consistent scam emails from

* Required a local login to access (no network credentials SPECIFICALLY as everyone at SalesClient was DA again)

* I'd built a web page showing an overview of traffic, with charts and color-coded traffic based on expected threat value of the source

* A script ran monthly to export all logs to an Orangered file server in a nice encrypted folder to conserve space on the IDS

Confident I'd made something even Dave would appreciate, I presented this to Arnold and Jack. They had some minor inputs for tweaking the dashboard that I completed before offering this as a test run to SalesClient in a 90-day free trial. 

In the meantime, I also obtained my Network Certificate and **WAS** reimbursed for both certificates at the same time. A minor amendment was made to it, though. The cost would be prorated over the year after obtaining it, and if I were to leave early would have to pay a percentage of the cost. I was amazed I got anything, but Susan came through for me.

The day before my prototype's maiden voyage, and Dave sent another all-hands on deck meeting. He announced we would be pairing with another company with an IDS we could resell, and we would be freezing my project.

&gt; BUT I'M NEARLY FINISHED! TOMORROW WE PLUG IT IN, AND THE CLIENT IS EXPECTING THIS FUNCTIONALITY FOR 90 DAYS!

I'm livid. Dave continues that he's been working with a few different companies for the last month and a half to find a situation that 'made sense' for our needs. Arnold and Jack don't seem very surprised. 

My cool is lost now. I put Dave on the spot at his meeting about how the test device I created was scheduled with SalesClient tomorrow, Dave says that 'I can try out that toy for the 90 day trial as we'd negotiated, but after that we will be looking to sell them our partner-product.

**The next day**

While onsite at SalesClient, SalesManager asks me about $competitorProduct Dave had called him trying to sell him on. I have still not found my cool, and say that Dave has been considering the $competitorProduct and our internal product was of my own devising. This trial run is going to be my proof of concept. SalesManager then asks me something I had never had cross my mind:

SalesManager: ""Why didn't you just make this on your own time? This could have just been yours.""

Most_Humble: ""I.. had not even considered that.""

SalesManager: ""You put a lot of effort trying to make Orangered look good, but that fire isn't there today. I can tell, I work with people all the time. Something isn't sitting right with this on you.""

Most_Humble: ""This IDS test should be exactly what you are interested in, I've personally-""

SalesManager: ""That doesn't worry me, you always go above and beyond helping out here. Even when we don't follow your recommendations, you're patient and flexible. If you ever find yourself somewhere else, let me know. I have a lot of business connections.""

Most_Humble: ""I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.""

I spend about 30 minutes going over the login, the dashboard, the redirect (which only device admins me, Randy, and Arnold can change), and I provided him the method of unencrypting archived log files. As I am heading back to the office, SalesManager gives me a business card. I didn't notice at the time, but it did not have *his* name on it.

I've always loved computers and most facets of IT and really regret not going to school for CS or IT. So, I am taking a large jump that may, or may not, pan out well for me and my family. The way I see it, I will regret not doing something while I'm still somewhat young. 

I have decided to quit my good paying but toxic environment of a job with the Federal Government (Veterans Affairs) and go back to college where I have been accepted to a [Masters in Information Assurance](http://www.stcloudstate.edu/graduate/information-assurance/default.aspx?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=redirect) program where I can really work on specializing in network security which, is something I find fascinating. 

Money: Luckily, being a Veteran I have the G.I. Bill which not only pays for school but for housing as well. I'll have to get a p/t job (hopefully a graduate assistant job) to pay for some bills. Money will be tight but, we will not be eating rice for two years.


Employability:
Here's where I need advise and maybe a little guidance. I have 2.5 years of schooling for this masters program. .5 years for pre-reqs since I have a social science undergrad, and 2 years for the masters level courses. I do not know how I will be gauged by employers after graduation. My goal is to get back into the Federal Government. I have held security clearances with the DoD and as a Civilian Federal Employee and understand experience and professional certifications will only help my chances. I will have an internship as part of the graduate process which, can only help my cause. 

So, am I crazy, stupid, ignorant? Either way, I am doing this, I just need to know what I am getting myself into haha. Thank you for all the comments in advance! 


TL;DR - 28, quitting my job, back to school for Masters program, not sure I will be employable."

I will be graduating with a CS degree and a Math degree next spring and want to make sure to do what I can now to increase my salary expectations.


Currently I work as an intern at a medium sized company and have been there for a year so far.  I have worked on two projects, one was an Android app for the QA team written from scratch and the other was implementing a new component throughout their main product.


The internship has definitely taught me a lot but I still feel like I need to learn some new technologies and I think having some projects that I have done on my own accord would help in the interviewing process.  I don't really know if I want to stick with app development or not.  I want a job with a decent work-life balance, a good salary and room to grow.  What would you guys recommend to learn before looking for a job as a software engineer?  Are there any technologies/languages that would greatly increase my salary expectations? Anything else I should consider?

Thanks and I have listed below some of the things that I have experience with and feel comfortable to work with.

- Java
    - JavaFX
- Android
    - Crosswalk
- C++ (Haven't used in awhile)
- Source Control
- Linux Shell

[edit] I also made a small language in my software engineering course that I plan on extending further for my math seminar class.
[edit2] My professor has invited me to work with him on his research (would entail working on his language).  I would need to decide between this or keeping the internship."

I'm a junior, my UW GPA is 3.78. I took the ACT a few months back and scored a 32, however I forgot my calculator and only scored a 28 on the math section. I will be retaking it next month with a calculator and actual preparation.

Im not sure what to think of my EC's, I've been a part of 

Football
track
bowling
Spanish National Honor Society
National Honor society

These seem inadequate compared to most EC's I see here. The list is a bit limited, as I've been working since I was 15. I currently am in my second year working as a paid intern for my school's IT department. I was recently promoted to Supervisor. I work 40 hours a week during the summer and 20 during the school, right after school, right when all club/organization meetings are.

I've also been struggling with my father's health. He passed away this February, and he's been sick for a while. I'm sure I could've done better GPA wise without this stress, but I don't think that matters much.

Will that internship and possibly a 33 or 34 on the ACT after some preparation and a calculator give me a chance into more competitive schools?

I'd like to apply to UCLA, Berkeley,  and Carnegie-Mellon as my reach schools. Would it be a waste of my time to even apply to these? Am I in too deep of a hole to climb out of?

They almost never said in the job posting when the deadline was.

In addition to having a GPA, I'll also have a semester of experience TAing a basic Java class and will have a grad algorithms class finished, which should help prepare me for interviews."

So far I know about one person with a Master's degree in CS who would be responsible for back-end development and another person just finishing up their bachelor's degree who would be involved alongside me. The owner was vague about what kind of product we're developing because I haven't signed an NDA yet but apparently he wants do develop a new social platform that ""has the potential of becoming as big as Facebook etc."". To generate additional income, he would find us additional contract work. Also, to get to know us and how we work together, he proposed the following: He would take us on for a 4 week internship and then hire us in a permanent position.


Now my concerns are that there are apparently no people directly involved with multiple years of experience. There would, however be an external consultant at our service for any questions we have. Also, of course, the inherent risk that comes with such a start-up. And I'm worried that his idea sounds a little unrealistic, but I don't know the details. On the other hand, it sounds exciting to build a company together and sounds like a good opportunity to learn and grow with the challenge.


Now, I'm just out of college and need some advice if this is a bad idea to take this job. The owner wants me to give him an answer until tomorrow. So I'd be thankful for any advice I could get."

It was: 
i5 4440 @ 3.1 Ghz with stock cooler
Sapphire R9 290 
8 GB Crucial Ram 
500GB Seagate HDD 

It was all about 400€, so a lot bang for buck I would say.

A couple of months later I did a favor to my former boss and we has so happy that he gifted me a brand new MSI R9 390 - What a nice gesture and some almost high end GPU for my solid battlestation. 

I´m loving it! I love PC gaming! As I had just a PS3 and was only playing FIFA and Battlefield 3.
The last years it was so nice to get back to PC gaming and play all those ""old"" blockbuster games I missed during the time, Witcher 1+2, Fallout: NW, Battlefield 4 (with mouse and keyboard), Bioshock Trilology, Mass Effect Triology, Tomb Raider, Hotline Miami, Borderlands and so on...At the moment I´m playing a lot of R6: Siege and Dark Souls I (I hate it :D). 

So far so good. But: By the end of the summer I´m going once again abroad for studying, after that I think I´ll stay another semster abroad for doing an internship. So AT LEAST one year abroad. 

What should I do with my battlestation? 
Taking it with me is not an option, I don´t think that I will play a lot abroad. 
Should I keep it? On the one hand, it is a solid battlestation and could be still fun to play in one year with good grapics on 1080p (Don´t think I´m gonna have the money to spend for a 1440p or 4K monitor)

Or should I sell it? I paid as I mentioned about €400 for all of the stuff, I could sell all of it as single parts maybe for 500€ if I´m lucky and leave it with a €100 surplus. 
And if going to be back from the semestre abroad I start working, so I could save a couple of months and get something really high-end...? 

What do you guys think? What would be the best option? "

'Twas the first day as the new intern in IT for the media group on campus. I have a pretty good amount of networking experience working with switches, AP's, and whatnot. I was tasked with finding a Ubiquity AP and resetting it to factory (they forgot the password) while my supervisor went out to grab some food for us. After searching the whole floor of the building with a WiFi scanning app on my phone, I finally found the AP, and stuck a paper clip into the reset port for 10 seconds, hard resetting the AP.

And then, shit hit the fan. I went back to my desk to adopt the AP, and, oh look, it's not there. From around the corner, I hear ""The file server down for anyone else?"" ""Anyone having issues with Reddit? Oh wait, never mind. Issues with the entire internet?"" On Uniquity's control panel, our 4 other AP's started disappearing one by one. Oh shit. Did I bring down our entire wired network by resetting an AP?  There goes my job.

I suddenly get 10 or so people in our production group swarming my lonely desk complaining that they need the file server online and they can't watch cat videos on YouTube. Look around. Supervisor not back. I told everyone that I was going to fix it, and that everyone should remain calm [and exit the building in a single file line]. I grab the keys to the switch room and decide to go cry in there because it is isolated and no one will look for me. Enter the switch room and all the switches have hit the fan.

Turns out, the lights flickering starting right as I was resetting the AP due to a power surge or brownout. The UPS's in the switch room haven't had their battery replaced in 10 years so they did absolutely nothing to protect the switches that run the entire building's networking. Supervisor explained everything to his boss, and I did not lose my job. I now understand why ""sysadmin"" gets abbreviated to ""Sadmin."""

I don't think I can lead my own life anymore.

TL;DR I'm 24, graduated in Fall 2014 with a 2.4 GPA. I have no internships, never held a job (edit: I actually had a job for 3 years in high school but it's way too long ago), and no side projects. I've only realized a few months ago that I've drove my life down into the ground.

I'll try to keep it short but basically I was way too cocky. I had this belief that I could just land a job after graduating because I got a Computer Science degree. Didn't realize how unemployable I was. 1 year after graduating, parents were incredibly disappointed, just became depressed. I didn't want to do anything anymore. I managed to get a job last month at a restaurant as a cashier. I was pretty stoked because it's my first job. It felt great. It got me out of my depression at least and now I feel like I should get back into what I started with. The job just isn't for me.

I know I totally deserve to be working there but I don't think I can last. The commute is 2 hours, 1 hour there, 1 hour back, and it's 10-11 hours a day not including commute. Everyday has been wake up, get ready, get picked up to go to work, work for 10-11 hours, get home, shower, sleep. I don't have time to do anything except on my day off which is today. I want to quit but I simply cannot. This is the only income I have to sustain myself. It took me so long to even land a job, it will take just as long or longer to get another job that's better.

I want to get back into CS or programming at least. I enjoy programming but I don't think I'm experienced enough for the job market. I've only done console applications in school. I know enough Java and C/C++ to do them. My strongest courses were Data structures and algorithms. I really want to get back into it but I don't know what I should be doing because I need to use my time to its fullest.

I don't know what questions I should be asking unfortunately. What should I do? Do I even have a chance anymore? I just feel so lost. I can provide more details if necessary.

If I can't be helped, thanks for reading, even if nothing comes out of this, I just wanted to get it out because I made this account a week ago hoping to find some answers but felt it was better for me to just post instead.

edit: Hi thanks for all the responses! Unfortunately I just came home and will have to read them all during downtime at work. Is there anything I can do with a phone? I'm usually on my phone when there's no customers and it's kind of a bummer that I can't really do anything on it. I will respond to you guys on my free time."

Is that enough to get a job?,MEtoCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4jxkwr/bs_in_mechanical_engineering_as_in_software/,"Hi Reddit, I graduated last May (2015) with a degree in mechanical engineering. I have been working with my current employer as a mechanical engineer since June 2015. After several internships and a year working full-time in the industry, I have come to the realization that ME is not for me. A few months ago, I started learning web development and Java in my spare time, and I have been having a lot of fun with it. I am now planning to potentially go back to school, and I have a few options in mind:

1. Community college to get an associate degree in Software Development. The program I am looking at includes Java (at least 3 classes of it), Networking, Visual Basic, Systems Analysis and Design, and Database Systems.

2. Community college to get an associate degree in Computer Science. These programs seem to be more focused on students who would move on to get a B.S. in Computer Science. This is the
least expensive option though (assuming I do not go on to get the B.S.).

3. Getting a B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science.

So I guess my questions would be:

1. Would an associate degree be enough, in addition to my B.S. in ME, to get hired in this field? Or do you really need that B.S. in CS?

2. If an associate degree isn’t enough, should I go for a bachelors or a masters? Would I be behind in a masters degree because of my lack of formal programming background?

I am looking for an inexpensive option that will allow me to get a job as quick as possible. I do not think I can afford to go back to school for another 4 years.

Do I even need to go back to school? Or are companies just looking for someone with analytical skills and some programming knowledge and are willing to teach the rest on the job?

I know that this field can be very competitive, but I am not looking to (or expecting to) immediately get hired by a huge technology company. I am fine with starting small at a little company in any industry. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

Will the name of my major - ""Mathematics &amp; Applied Science"" - hurt me in my job search? Should I officially declare a minor in Computer Science?

I graduate in December with a CS bachelor's but have had no job offers yet. I've already completed internships at Lockheed Martin and IBM. Lockheed Martin was two summers ago and they told me to let them know when I graduate and they'd offer me a job - but those people have since left the company. I did the IBM internship last summer, but I had just started pain meds for my back, and so didn't do that great. They did not offer me a job.

My plan was to practice interview problems and iOS everday until fall when I can get some good offers (my GPA is a 3.90) and not to settle. IBM is not where I reaaaally wanna be, but since I have already worked there I think it may be my best chance to work at a good company. I have an interview with them tomorrow for yet another internship this summer, but I am feeling like maybe I should just stick with the plan and do interview problems this summer. But on the other hand, if I do this internship maybe IBM will extend me a full-time offer (not sure if I really wanna work there though).

I am currently an EE Major with a CS Minor. I just switched into EE this past semester having previously been a physics and Math major. I have done decently well academically so far (3.9 range including last semester with 4 EE/CS classes) and have some (not very impressive) research experience so far. I have a few questions regarding what steps I should take over the next two years to get where I want. I am very interested in AI/Machine Learning, embedded systems, control systems and biotech. My ideal career would be to work at a high technical level in medical devices or robotics. However, I just started the major so obviously this could change, but I have looked heavily into the different fields and those seem the most exciting and upcoming, and they pique my interests in math and software.

My questions are: 

1) Should I switch into computer engineering? I have the option to do so, and it would allow me to take more software classes while still taking some EE electives such as Signals Processing and possibly upper level DSP. I feel like computer engineering suits me better but idk what different career prospects there are/if CE is well respected.

2) I have an offer from a very good company for a Fall Co-op, yet it is in the Energy/Automation business, which does not exactly fit my interests. Should I be taking this internship? I have no internship experience so far. I am starting in a research lab this summer in embedded systems and it is exciting but its been slightly disappointing and has been going very slow (as I have found all research to be thus far). I feel like I should take the internship just to get experience, even if it isn't in the right field. But I don't want it to set me back.

3) I definitely want to at least get my Master's degree; I know that a lot of the exciting high level work is only offered to students with at least a Masters in Engineering (thesis-based, not professional). With that being said, should I focus more on getting good research experience? Is taking an internship a bad idea if I want to go into a research based masters program? Also, how difficult is it to get into top programs (CMU, Stanford, GTech, etc.) for Masters.

4) Should I be thinking Masters or PhD if I want to do high level research work in industry?

Sorry for the long post. Any answers/advice to any of my questions will be greatly appreciated! Thanks."

I just wanted some advice on my situation.  

I interviewed for two different companies for a summer internship this week.

I have an offer with company A for a internship.  I like the company, it looks like a good working environment, but it is not something that I see myself enjoying as much as working in Company B.  Company A isn't as engineering related as Company B, which deals more with process efficiency and has a wider scope of projects available to be worked on that are more related to the Process and Safety side of Chemical Manufacturing.  

Would it really be a horrible idea to contact Company B and explain the situation?  I am definitely extremely grateful with the opportunity Company A is offering me, however, I was definitely hoping to hear back from B first before anything.  

In the end, of course, I do feel very fortunate to even have this opportunity since I know many people have not had my type of luck.

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT.

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part VIII**

It's beginning to get very cold again, being mid-December Monday. As I'm driving into the office listening to ""Dream of the Shepherd"" from the Aion soundtrack, I can feel my fragmented, sluggish consciousness start to coalesce and realize my destination.

&gt; I could really use a coffee before getting to the office. 

Warm beverage in hand, I stride in. I've had mixed feelings of the location lately: my test IDS has worked flawlessly, but no one in Orangered seems to have batted an eye. Due to issues with $competitorProduct, my IDS has been left on SalesClient's network indefinitely. My accomplishments consistently are overlooked, while faults that have any remote connection to me get hyper-inflated and overly-criticized. Most mornings I'm either too tired to realize I'm going to work, or alert enough to dread the day. Yet, I keep trying and every now and then I get that glimmer of hope that I am on the cusp of success. 

Or something is in my eye. I've not maintained a sufficient level of caffeination to know the difference yet.

Dave, Arnold and Jack are at my desk, waiting for me. Dave seems to be explaining something to the other two, and has a document in his hand. I seem to be intruding on their meeting. 

Dave: ""-would be a real seller of our services if we could get this. Oh, I see Most_Humble *will* be joining us today.""

Most_Humble: ""I'm on late shift this week, it's update week. Was there a meeting invite for this?""

Dave: ""I expected you here already. I was just telling Arnold and Jack that we need to be getting MacroServer certifications. If we can get three certified technicians before the end of the year, we can bid for more upper-end contracts.""

Most_Humble: ""It's already December. Where are the certification tests held? Can we even book slots for those? And why wasn't this brought up over the summer, I got two certifications from Certs-R-Us already.""

Dave: ""Those don't give us the formal approval to apply for contracts for SpecificClients. That's why no one else got those certifications.""

&gt; No one else *did* get certifications.

I find no study material provided, no time to study, exam fee will be reimbursed only if passed, and as I find the only testing site in state has their site closed after this Thurday. I send an email to Dave saying that without any resources for this, time/material/etc I am not going to be able to pass an exam by the end of the week before exam booking is done for the year. His reply really resounded with me:

Dave: ""Book a slot this week. It's update week, we don't have time to give for this.""

At this point, I have gone over and above as much as I can, but with holidays around and feeling setup to fail on this task I'm ready to have this fail in Dave's face. 

I go ahead and book the last slot Thursday night to give me as much time as I can. It usually takes me a few weeks to study for something like this, but given I won't even have a weekend to go through this I know it's going to be for naught. Susan and I chat about it later that day.

Susan: ""Dave's trying to renew a contract for next year, and there's a competitor with these certifications. I'm not sure why you three were chosen, as you three don't work this contract and won't next year either.""

Most_Humble: ""This isn't going to work. I've not had enough time to study for this. I was able to get two others, and these weren't mentioned until now.""

Susan: ""Just do your best, I'll try to play damage control. Arnold and Jack haven't scheduled their slots, and said they would next week.""

ಠ_ಠ

That evening, I'm applying updates to our domain and SalesClient while researching some study material. As I'm reviewing machines on their network, I notice my little IDS still camped out and logging. 

*The next day*

First thing in the morning I have an email from Dave, asking me to stay late and look into HealthcareClient. Jack's updates weren't sent out, and he called in sick. 

&gt; Glad I'll have time to study. 

After my planned activities are completed, I take a look into HealthcareClient's issue. I've worked a few support tickets from them before, but nothing spectacular. It's a small business with a focus on pain relief and physical therapy, with a small emergency clinic. Five sites across two states, and been a client for a couple of years. 

Looked like it should be an easy one. Their equipment is onsite, so I just RDP over and...

Host unreachable. 

No worries, I'll ping and verify...

Request timed out. 

Odd. Time to just call them and see what's going on. Around here is where I start worrying: phone line is unreachable. Digging through the client info, I find a cell number for site manager, Cindy. Time to get to the bottom of this.

Cindy: ""Hello, HealthcareClient. We're experiencing some technical difficulties at the mome-""

&gt; This ... doesn't sound like an automated voice.

Most_Humble: ""Hello Cindy, this is Most_Humble from Orangered. (the cue-card reading stops) I wanted to know more about these difficulties and how I can help.""

Cindy: ""Ugh, I thought you were a CustomerName again. He's called at least a dozen times.""

Most_Humble: ""Jack was unavailable for updates yesterday, but your network isn't responding. What's going on?""

Cindy: ""Oh, our whole town is powerless.""

Most_Humble: ""That explains a lot. PowerCompany give an expected time of restoration?""

Cindy: ""Nope. Once it was back I was going to call, Jack usually calls once updates are finished for me to test out the office.""

Most_Humble: ""I seem to have PowerCompany's contact info. Let me give them a call and I will let you know when we can reschedule updates.""

Cindy: ""Would you mind doing it tonight? We've got a few nights this week with student staff we're training.""

&gt; Well, you did ask nicely.

Most_Humble: ""If you have power tonight, we can do updates tonight. But I will need someone onsite to power up several machines.""

Cindy: ""I'll be here most of this evening. We had two rooms remodeled and I'm setting up our offices again.""

Fast forward a few hours, and I'm pushing updates along. Things are going smoothly now, but I'm still peeved at the certification situation. I go ahead and print off every email regarding them, from Susan confirming the certifications I got were approved, the rules for reimbursement, everything tangentially-connected was printed off and put into a folder (safely thrown in the apartment). By the time I get finished, I have another six hours before my next shift starts.

I've done well, and have around a 4.0 in all my CS coursework, which will hopefully stay around that next year. 
The downside: I'm going to graduate with a BA instead of a BS (though the CS program is a joint program with the liberal arts college and the engineering school at my university, I'm in the college), and I'm only going to have a bachelor's degree, rather than advanced degree in the field.
Will I be competitive for the better jobs in this field, or should I consider grad school?
Edit: I worked as a research assistant writing some Python scripts for the econ department last semester and will be working at a bank this semester  writing code, though neither of these opportunities was really in machine learning. I'm a bit disadvantaged by the fact that I switched to the major a bit late in the game, so I had less coursework under my belt than people I was competing with for internships, though I generally interview well."

I've made a post earlier this week and found this subreddit very helpful, I thought I'd take a stab at another question.

Some background: I'm currently doing an entry-level intern position with an IT department. I'm planning to look for other opportunities. I also have an interview tomorrow with a very small MSP which consists of 15 employees, so this is why I ask because I've never worked with an MSP before.

I'm curious as what the major differences between working for a MSP vs an IT Department are? I'm still very new into the industry and I'm wondering if others with years of experience could give some insight.

For my senior project (doesn't start until Winter 2017) I will be needing to do an internship which is why I can't do one now. Or I suppose I can, but I don't want to do two internships. Ideally I could have started my senior project this summer term but I didn't take a pre-req to do that... 

So I have been applying for a lot of entry-level and not so entry-level positions. I don't understand why many ""entry-level"" positions require for x years of experience or a bachelor's degree because to me that doesn't seem like entry-level anymore. I just had a phone interview and I'm pretty sure I failed it.

Most of the positions I apply for work with AD. I've used AD for about a year in school but I forgot most of it. I don't have it installed on my computer anymore but I plan on using VirtualBox and installing many MS programs from Dreamspark onto it to re-familiar myself with it. During this interview I was posed a scenario on how I would do a certain task in AD (that I could not answer) and another one where I was questioning an end-user on his problem (that I could not answer beyond ""did you turn it on, activity lights, right display setting"").

I've had multiple interviews, in-person and on the phone, but I don't know how I can better prepare myself beyond looking nice because I have no idea what kind of questions they will ask me. I only had one job offer for an IT company (the position is called break-fix) but there are no benefits and I did not put myself in $20,000+ student loan debt to be paid $12 an hour ($2 above minimum wage, entry-level banktellers get paid more than this...)"

I'm about to be a sophomore this fall (about junior level class wise) at a top 30 university in the US who's doing somewhat well (straight As and Bs, got into my major, all that jazz) but *every single day* I feel othered by the fact that I grew up really poor (and my family continues to be poor). 

I lived in an apartment this past year with three other girls. One of the other girls grew up a lot like me, except slightly better off. The other two had wealthy families, both parents being engineers. While I'm certainly not the first in my family to go to college, my grandfather and my uncle are the only ones in my immediate family who have (one a pharmacist, one a scientist). My great grandparents are Eastern European immigrants and the higher education bit really started with my grandfather.. 

Anyway, for all intents and purposes, I have it really, really good education wise. I currently have an internship at a fortune 500 company, I have a full ride to my university, and I have a lot of people supporting me. But I still find myself so unshakably bitter. It seems like everyone around me has things easier, and everyone has a safety net that I don't. And I read article after article detailing how upward mobility in this country is failing, so I keep wondering when *I* personally am going to fail, because it can't be possible for me to make it to the top. I honestly feel like this low self-esteem contributes to test anxiety, as I'm so afraid of failure, which is why I get As and Bs and not just As.

 I also have a lot of trouble making friends because I can't relate with anyone. One time, I introduced myself to someone and literally the second words out of their mouth were ""My father is the CEO of ______"". I can't relate to these people. I don't want to be their friend. Despite dressing nicely, working in labs, getting pretty good grades, and being from a nice middle class area (even though my family lives in an apartment in the area), I just can't help but think that everyone thinks of me as a poor, backwards, white trash person. I have somewhat bad teeth on top of that, so I cover my mouth when I smile because I feel like I'm ""giving myself away"". I don't know. It probably seems silly to anyone who grew up well off but it's really difficult for me to deal with. How can I cope with these feelings/get rid of them?

I applied to a small startup company and after meeting up with the President of the startup, I realized that there were only 2 other workers in the company. This startup is a research company that was created recently. One worker is another student who is a mechanical engineer and the President described his role as more business oriented but would help work with me on the website. The other student is actually a developer and that student was the person who designed part of the website already. However, that student is going to be interning with another company this summer, so I will only be receiving directions/objectives/tasks/support remotely on the website. This entire website will be built on Oracle APEX.

From the current situation, it seems as if I'm going to be tasked with building the website almost entirely by myself with support from the other students. I'm nervous because I was looking for an internship where I could gain more experience working with mentors and experienced developers. Instead, I'm being tasked with building the website almost entirely myself. 

Has anyone been in the same situation? Any advice/tips on how I should approach this job? 



Is this even considered an internship anymore or is it more of an actual web development position? There was no mention of an intern role so I'm not sure how I would list this job for future purposes.

    
We are still discussing salary but I was told that it would be between $20-25 an hour. What should be a reasonable salary for this role?? I am located in Austin. 
    

Is there any material that will help me prepare for this role? I've had little experience designing a website for commercial use and I want this website to represent my ""computer science skills"" when applying to other jobs later.

TL;DR - Applied for internships, got a position as the lead developer creating a APEX website for a small startup consisting of 4 employees (including me). Any advice/tips/helpful words/bible verses so that I can excel in my position?"

The girl I loved was not giving a shit.

And so I left her. I was angry and sad at the same time. 
But I find myself fixated on thinking about us sometimes. Which turns my stomach, makes me uneasy, and seeing new pictures of her make me nervous, and queasy. Like when someone makes you eat a plate full of that food you completely hate.

And of course the sad periods. I've done the typical things, removed her from Snapchat, Instagram, deleted pictures, Skype, etc. Which was a major punch to the stomach. 

I'm so hurt, and when we last talked she seemed to try to make me feel bad, which she had done so many times in the past, and I'm aware of that, but it still hurts. 

How do I get over, or atleast, stop thinking about us, and such?

I'm already trying to go out more, I'm in a gym, try to go out with friends, ride my motorcycle, which it all helps.

We're coding in C# and using Windows Forms to put some finishing touches on a fairly simple application and using version control (which I've never worked with.)

c++:

2. Basic image processing simply using the standard library. Creating and parsing bitmap image files.

3. Basic image tracking with OpenCv in C++ using generic webcams.


C:

1. A profiler application that given an arbitrary set of parameters generates a simulated cache. It uses valgrind generated trace files to analyze cache hit or misses. It helps measure performance of memory heavy applications. And its 100% accurate.


IOS apps: 

0. Something related to a course I'd be taking soon. 

Relevant coursework:

1.  Intro to Security
2.  Data structures obviously
3.  Systems and Architecture (the class where you learn Assembly).

Courses included are programming 1 &amp; 2 (pick a language), network+/security+ prep, Windows/Linux/network security, offensive techniques and exploits, perimeter defense, basic webpage development, database designs.

I thought I might get net/security+ certs before I graduate, possibly the Associate of ISC2 or GSEC/GCIH from SANS.

4k8x6b,3,2016-05-20,25 y/o Lost College Grad with a Passion for Music at a Crossroads,ta123789456,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4k8x6b/25_yo_lost_college_grad_with_a_passion_for_music/,"I’ve got some things I need to get off my chest and just get down onto a damn page.

I’m at a place in my life where I feel lost, unsure of which path to take on the crossroads I’m currently at. I quit my last job 3 months ago because, although it paid well, it beat the hell out of my body and I’m still feeling those effects today. So I had to get the fuck out of there. I’m 25 and still living at home and I desperately want to move out and become self-sufficient. I also have a lack of real friends that I can lean on and confide in. This has made me consider going to either grad school or to community college to study/get training in something that would help me land a decent job while enabling me to meet other people roughly my same age and connect and build new relationships. A kind of two-for-one deal.

I’m not sure about much in my life at this point, but one thing I do know is that one of the most important things in my life is creating music and sharing it with other people. I’m in a band that will be playing our first shows in the next month and I’m super fucking excited about that because I feel most alive when I’m sharing music with other people. I enter this space where I’m not able to think about past regrets or get caught up in anxiety about the future, but live directly in the current moment and that is sublime.

Anyway, on to my current options:


1.) If I went to grad school, I would like to go for an MS in Environmental Science since I love learning about nature and geology. My reservations about this plan come from a few things: I have no prior science experience working or academically – my undergrad was a BA in Economics, so I fear I would have a hard time getting hired after I graduate. Hopefully I would be able to get some experience during my grad studies as an intern, but I’m unsure. This path would mean at least another year and a half of staying at home while I take the science pre-reqs I need to get into grad school (I would be willing to work some during my time doing this, but I don’t want to have to juggle full-time work and full-time school). I feel out of my element doing this because I don’t have any idea what I would write my thesis about either. But maybe that would come as I study in the program. Another downside is that there aren’t many geologist/environmental jobs in my area, so I’d likely have to move away and leave my band behind. Being in a band and making music is one of my biggest dreams, so this would blow. Financing it isn’t a huge concern because I’d only be looking at about $10k in loans – still, it’s debt and that blows.

2.) Another path I’m considering is doing a 10-month Dental Assisting program that would set me up for a decent job right out of the program. Some DA jobs don’t offer benefits like health insurance/401k/etc. and the pay is on the lower end ($35k median) so there’s the downside to that. But it would allow me to move out and have a stable job in 1 year. That’s what is really attractive about this option. Plus, I would have some option for moving up – becoming a dental hygienist for one, which makes double what a DA makes. I’d most likely be able to stay local and close enough to my band to practice and play gigs around town.

3.) Going to community college and getting an AS in computer science. My job prospects would be good, along with the social aspect of meeting others and hopefully forming new friendships. Comp sci is not something I’m particularly passionate about, but it would be a good skill that would help me land a decent job while I move out and live my passion of being in a band. Downside is this would take about 2 years to do – 2 more years of living at home and feeling like that weirdo who’s 25 still living with his parents.

Right now I’m really leaning towards the Dental Assistant option because the work sounds somewhat interesting, pay is decent enough to allow me to move out and become independent, and I’ll most likely be able to stay local, close to my band. I feel like I’m being pulled in so many different directions right now and it’s all so uncertain.

What would you do in my situation?

I am concerned I am not going to have the resume to get interviews for a programming position when I am out of school.

Is it worth majoring in something you like (which *could* be engineering or *could* be philosophy, for example)?

So after I graduated high school I went to a state college for a liberal arts degree. I didn't really want to do stem stuff for a living back then and wanted to explore life if that makes any sense. I just finished my second year at the college and took a few CS classes and FELL IN LOVE. I love coding and what you can do with it. So because I wanted to switch majors but after only taking non stem classes I realized that I would have to stay another 4 years to get my BS is computer science. The tuition is crazy high and taking on 6 years of high loans seems crazy. So I thought about it and decided to go to a lower level state school (SIUE) that is an ABET credited school so I can take on less loans and graduate a bit early. So my questions to you are a couple things:

1. Did I make a stupid decision going to a lesser known cs school? It is next to the st. Louis area so a lot of internship opportunities get offered to that school but the quality of the education is obviously a bit lower. Some people have told me that ABET doesn't matter at all and that school ranking matters a lot, while some people have said that ranking doesn't mean Shit and that after internships and showing your skills it doesn't matter much in terms of having good salary and job prospects. Just wanted to get you guys' opinion on this.

2. Will employers not like the fact that I didn't pursue cs from the start and that i went to another college for a liberal arts program? Unfortunately even though i got great grades in math,science in high school i didn't really think at the time that I wanted to do it. Will employers look at my age of entering a cs program and think I'm not passionate as people who started cs degree right away?

3. Should I be thinking about a bubble burst in the cs world? It seems like everyone is getting paid so much off the bat that I'm getting worried about the future of salaries and job outlook in cs. I heard there was a crazy burst near the 2000 era and I am worried about that happening again.

4. Because I am going to a not amazing ranked school for cs, how will it work against the supposed outsourcing to other countries for cheaper pay? I heard that companies are starting to outsource code to India for lower pay and am worried that my college not being high ranked will hurt my chances of getting a job.

5. Am I too late for a successful career? I look at people who start coding at a young age and can't help but sigh in frustration. Not only am I starting college again at the age of 20, but I'm not going to a top school but a lower level state school. I feel like i will be so behind the curve that I will end up unemployed after I graduate.

6. How does cs transition into other industries? Even though I like coding and all, as a guy who originally wanted to pursue a major in political science I still like the idea of working with people as a living. Does cs degree anchor me to a programming job or have people found transition into other industries easy and smooth?

I apologize for the long worded questions but I am in a bit of pickle in terms of choosing my direction in life and wanted to know from you guys, how is life of a cs graduate from a non top cs program? Thanks guys."

I'm hoping you may have some advice or could point me in the right direction regarding a role to pursue. I'm asking here first because I have a general direction but don't want to waste any time if someone else knows what I'm looking for.

Quick background:

I just graduated from my university with a degree in business administration and a concentration in finance. My previous work experience includes retail (cashier), intern at a medical device startup, and my current internship as a growth marketer at a fintech startup. I have the opportunity to continue working at my current internship (which I would love/plan to do) but the startup doesn't have the money yet to pay another person. I will need to start job hunting soon to support myself. I am also straying away from finance and more towards technology, i.e. I don't mind starting a job in finance (it would probably be easier with my degree) but would most likely get out at the first opportunity. The money isn't as important as how much I enjoy the role. I would say I gravitate towards quantitative topics and statistics. I also am learning programming in my spare time (python, java, sql) as I took one programming class in uni and enjoyed it. However I am not proficient enough to land a full on programming job. If there is an entry level role that I could possibly get in programming or finance with some easy programming aspect to it please comment! I also have a professional website which I will send if requested as it may help get a better picture of my experience/personality.

Thank you for reading, I truly appreciate any help you can give! :)

It was about half full-time instruction and half internship at a real company working on a team.

 The junior dev role I got offered after interviewing is geared towards bootcamp graduates. However, the pay is about 15% less than what SDE1s make in my city on average. The company justifies it for this role due to the fact that I don't have a real CS degree. most bootcamp grads get this role with no internship experience and only were in class for 3 months.  
 

many people from my program got offers at a higher wage closer to the average at the SDE1 level at other companies. my other classmates negotiated a lot for their offers and it went well because it was for an SDE1 position and there wasn't really a distinction of a lower level for a bootcamp grad unlike at my company. My role is actually ""lower"" than SDE1 on the ranking scale at the companyI want this job because of other reasons, but i want to negotiate and advocate for myself for a higher salary.  


My concern is that I feel like I am dispensable due to the amount of other bootcamp candidates for this role. There are many other less qualified bootcamp grads they interviewed who would jump at the opportunity without negotiating. and this company knows that there are a lot of desperate folks.

I don't want to walk away, but I want a higher salary since I have more experience. Am I shooting myself in the foot by doing so since there are probably like 5 or more candidates lined up after me?"

Has anyone else here tried to get internships applying later on? I’m hoping this interview rate is just due to applying too late.

4kbfv7,82,2016-05-20,summer internship cancelled because of background check,tohearstories,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4kbfv7/summer_internship_cancelled_because_of_background/,"I.m in Philly and I.m a Computer Science major, with a 3.44 gpa, starting my senior year in the fall.

In 2003, when I lived in Texas, I bounced a $30 check to a grocery store. Texas has weird naming conventions and called it ""theft by check.""  It was a class B misdemeanor, which is on par with grafiti, DWI, etc. I paid a $400 fine and that was that.

I have a summer internship with a wealth management company which was supposed to start on 6/6. I just found out that this bounced check came up on a background check and because it contains the word ""theft"", they cancelled my internship.

So, I'm very discouraged.  I interviewed and got the internship in February. By waiting until 3 weeks before my start date to run a background check on me, they effectively screwed my entire summer. I could have gotten another internship with a company that didn't care about a bounced check from 13 years ago.

My question is this: is this normal? am i going to have a hard time getting a job when I finish my degree because of this?"

4kbo3w,156,2016-05-20,The Legend of $FlatCap,waydeultima,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4kbo3w/the_legend_of_flatcap/,"[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4kas2r/not_the_greatest_computer_technician_prologue/)

I was in charge of training $FlatCap. There wasn’t really anyone else, because the only other “main” technician, $Goodman, (we didn’t have formal titles) had been relocated to single-handedly operate $Comshop2, which had soft-launched by this point. It still wasn’t fully renovated and ready for business, but $Boss decided that he was tired of losing money on it and wanted to get it up and going as soon as possible. Spoiler: opening the shop didn’t fix the “losing money” situation, but that’s neither here nor there. Well, I mean, it’s there… But anyway:

$FlatCap is a super nice dude. Good taste in music, we shared a lot of interests, great sense of humor. Quality banter was enjoyed by all. I was particularly happy because I could retell all of my bad jokes and funny stories and he actually seemed to enjoy them.


But…


Weeks passed. Things seemed to be going okay. The winter slowness began to fade, and business was picking up. $FlatCap seemed to have a pretty decent grasp on things, and my quality assurance of his work dropped off over time, because I had actual repair work to do. The dust had settled and things were returning to normalcy.


Monday morning. Several voicemails left on Sunday. A lady sitting in her car in front of the shop. 15 minutes until opening time. She hasn’t seen me yet. Ah yes, unopened box of Tully’s House Blend K-cups. House Tully. Family, duty, honor.

One coffee later, I casually exited the back room and, looking surprised, rushed to unlock the front door 2 minutes early. The “rushing” was a mannerism I picked up from $Boss over time, where you kind of look like you’re jogging but you’re not moving any faster than if you just walked briskly.

&gt; $Viruslady: I’ve been trying to get in touch with you guys all weekend! I picked my computer up Saturday afternoon, and it’s still doing the same thing! It’s not fixed!

I called up her previous work order on the computer. The technician’s notes were blank. The field for inputting the computer specs contained the text “hp dv 7 laptop”, all lowercase, with no other information. The charges section had a dollar amount with the dollar sign on the wrong side, and no description saying what she was paying for.


The “Technician’s Name” field… Was blank.


I apologized profusely and checked the laptop back into the system properly, with “RETURN” at the top of the description of the problem.

After she left, I put the computer onto my own bench and began my inspection. Windows desktop, so far so good. Nothing weird in the system tray. Lots of processes running in the task manager… Google Chrome opened. Blank white page, two obvious adware buttons next to the menu button. 10+ items in the extensions.


Years earlier, there was a period of a couple of months where it seemed like two out of every three computers we worked on would come back the next day, and it was always either a) something stupid we overlooked or b) a new problem. Since then, we’d gotten **very** thorough. We usually did somewhat more work than we should have, simply because it was more worth it to spend an extra 20 minutes or so idiot-proofing the computer than to have to waste our own time and the customer’s time when they brought it back.

At this point, I was of the mindset that she had taken the computer home, installed something dumb, and was blaming it on IT. And so appwiz.cpl.

*All of this junk was installed over a week ago.*

Honestly, the only evidence I could find that it had even been worked on was a recent scan with Malwarebytes.

Queue $FlatCap, whose schedule has him coming in an hour after opening time for some reason.

&gt; Me: $FlatCap, did you work on the computer for $Viruslady on Friday or Saturday?

&gt; $FlatCap: *looks at laptop* Yeah, that was one of mine. She had a really bad virus popup.

&gt; Me: Okay… And so you cleaned it up?

&gt; $FlatCap: Yeah! :D

&gt; Me: Okay…

Shortest explanation possible: Our virus cleanups were a set procedure, and one I’d walked $FlatCap through many times at this point. Safe mode, manually delete obvious files in appdata, programdata, temp folders, program files, etc. Then normal mode, Combofix, Adwcleaner, JRT, Hitman Pro, uninstall anything left in appwiz, browser extensions, etc. Maybe a few other things, it’s been awhile. But you can see a general idea of what goes into it. We had a $Intern whom I made a checklist for at one point. It was thorough enough that it took care of 90% of malware-related things, then actual troubleshooting would get you through 8% more, Google for the remaining 2%. Ransomware is obviously a different procedure, but you get the idea.

ANYWAY. I did the cleanup myself. I frustratedly had a few words with $FlatCap about his quality of work. He “thought he’d cleaned it up”. He didn’t do the work order because it “got super busy all of a sudden”. He didn’t run Combofix because it “said it was out of date and wouldn’t run”. Lol.


But, you know. It was a mistake. It happens. When we make mistakes like that, we learn from them. Grow. We take our negative experiences and turn them into KNAWLEDGE.


Right?

I want to be game dev (I want to be a game designer, but I'd like to be really well versed in the art of programming) and this semester I've got a programming course where I am learning sorting algorithms, linked lists and such (algorithms and data structures, basically).

I have already managed to collect enough points for a D (no pun intended), but I'm not sure I'll collect enough points for an A over my continuous assessment model (Bologna). 

I put pressure on myself to have an A because I feel that that A is going to prove that I'm good at programming. But I also want to pass everything over continuous assessment model  (no matter what the grade), so over the summer I can go home or maybe even work as an intern in one game dev company (we'll see how that goes). 

So, what do you say? Do I give it my best and leave my grade as is or do I go for an A?"

I've been working for past 1.5 months as an intern in this company. After the next 2 weeks, there will be an opportunity for me to finish my internship and getting a junior position. 
My boss will probably present me with an offer, because of fast company growth and not enough people to code.

Here's the thing: I hate working here. I did everything I could to improve my well being and some things changed for the better, but overall I am not treated too well, boss is a dickhead, company's policy is morally wrong to me and so on. Still, staying here would be a nice entry in my CV.

Now, I recently got mostly positive feedback from 3 other dev companies, and they want me to take part in final recruitment steps for them. Generally there is a high chance of getting a job and those ones are good. But they will finish their process in about 3-4 weeks, about 1-2 weeks after I am to sign my new contract.

Would it be a smart move to just plainly go and tell my boss (after 2 weeks from now) that I want to postpone my promotion a little bit, because of other job offers? 
This would be a crazy thing, sure, but it would either result in my boss wanting to give me a better offer (profit) or him developing bias to myself (so nothing changes) or him firing me (kinda profit, because I hate working here and I might grab a chance from other companies).

What would you do if you were me? Have I lost my mind somewhere in those 1.5 months here or this is legitimate move?"

But I figured the question of pay is well suited for here. Having second interviews for a CMMS start up. 

So, basiclly the job is,

- In a very low cost of living location in Canada. Rent for me is 600$. 900$ is nice 1 bedroom rent. 
- For a 12 person start up with 3 remote agents overseas. 
- About 10 years old, has several major local clients but less outside of the area.
- Duties explained as 30% remote training and teaching for the program. 
- 60% being Sales Liaison for previous clients and incoming sale leads, gathering data and getting quotes and feature listings. 
- 5% in person training and quotes. Low possibility of travel outside city. Rare possibility of US travel.
- 5% coffee running intern, receptionist, dropping mail off at post office
- Full time, permanent, salary, Mon to Fri 9-5, basic health benefits package, no RRSP matching 

Job Requirements,

- CS degree or marketing degree
- 3 years sale experience 
- Knowledge of SalesForce MeetingtoGo and some assorted programs
- Technical aptitude, good customer service skills, about 5 more soft skills

What I actually have,

- 6 semesters of Applied Computer Science
- Associates-level degree in TV and Radio 
- 10 years retail, food, call center experience 
- 6 months management 
- 3 years (freelance) paid web experience
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and WordPress. Basic knowledge of Python, Java ( and Flash ActionScript I haven't used in a few years and AppInventor )
- Several years of teaching parents and union reps how to use WordPress, QuickBooks, Excel... general computer repair knowledge. Some paid work fixing phones and computers. 
- Valid passport for US travel, car access for on site

They seem to be taking my bullshitting of well I've freelanced and therefore have experience selling my self and are calling me back for a final interview. Money will come up soon.

My friends are saying to ask for 1.50$ over minimum wage ( so 12.50$ ) but some of the CSJ / internship jobs in other fields are paying up to 14-17$ a hour. I don't want to price my self out of the market but I don't want to make minimum wage. 

My gut feeling is 30k to 40k a year is the range, and I'd love to make 32-35k. It's been hinted that there is a large possibility of a raise once I get my degree finished and I plan on staying 2-4 years depending on my ablity to finish school part time.

Anyone who's been in this kinda job want to share their salary? The company is not on GlassDoor."
4kf8h8,0,2016-05-21,"Questions from a transfer student (totally new school, totally new major)",MoWards,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4kf8h8/questions_from_a_transfer_student_totally_new/,"So after high school I went to a public state college for 2 years for a liberal arts degree. Even though i had high grades in math and science in high school with high honors I still didn't think I wanted to pursue a scientific career. I love working with people and am very involved in our government affairs so my major was political science. I just completed my second year... and although i kept up my high grades I just didn't see a path for me in poli sci. I took an introductory cs class and fell in love with coding. I wanted to switch to cs major but my current school has a crazy high tuition and I would have to go for 3 more year at least to complete the BS. Fuck that. So right now I've made a decision to go to a smaller state school and do kind of a fresh start. Unfortunately while many of the liberal arts classes can transfer, the BS program at this smaller school just doesn't require that much gen ed stuff. So with those classes transferring and some cs and math transferring it looks like I will be around a sophomore stance when i start school in august. So in conclusion even though I am a junior in terms of college experience my ""fresh"" start will put me at a sophomore level. So here are a few questions

 1. What on earth do I put on my resume as my current stance? Do I put junior but add that I'm a sophomore standing? Do I just put sophomore? There's a small chance that I will be a second semester freshman level too so then what do i put? 

 2. What do I say about my 2 years prior to changing school/major? I didn't get an associate degree. Just took classes. Do I just not mention the fact that I went 2 years to another school for a different major?

 3. Am I screwing myself from internships and opportunities? I see so many people here getting internships and research work as a freshman and if I transfer I feel like ill be behind a lot of people.

 4. Will employers look suspiciously at the difference between my high school graduation date and college graduation date? It will most likely be a 5 to 6 year difference which might give off the idea that I screwed around for 6 years in the degree.

 5. Am I at a disadvantage because I will graduate at an older age?

All in all I just want some guidance on whether I am making a responsible choice for my future. I like coding and it is honestly interesting to me on a deep level. I'm just afraid that I will miss out on opportunities that would have been given to me if I just started with cs and am feeling kinda depressed that i wasted 2 years on something I ended up not being passionate about. Thanks for reading guys I know its a bother to read these panicky Shit but you guys honestly help a lot."
4kfu9p,1,2016-05-21,"Graduating soon, no internships but some kind of work experience and worried about the future - need advice.",Sabian90,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4kfu9p/graduating_soon_no_internships_but_some_kind_of/,"Hello everyone. First of all, sorry for any grammatical mistakes - I am not a native english speaker. Ok, let's get started: I have been searching the internet for quite some time now, asking people if they know recruiters or someone working in HR who could possibly answer my question - but no luck so far. Then I stumbled onto this subreddit and thought to give it a try.

I'm a guy in his mid 20s living in Germany. I did my Bachelor's in Business Administration (specialized in Operations Management) and I am right now doing my Masters in Business Administration (Major Operations Management, Minor Finance). I have less than two semester left before I graduate, so not even a year. My grades are not perfect but definitely above average. The part about my life that keeps worrying me right now, is, that I have never done an internship. But: I have been working for over three years at the IT department of my university. We basically are the main IT help desk for students as well as employees and have a wide range of tasks regarding all kinds of IT-related things you can imagine at a university.

I have read ""you will never find a job if you haven't done any internships"" so many times. And this scares me due to the fact that I haven't done any. You are probably asking why?! One reason is my long distance relationship (we're talking 5000 miles). Schoolbreaks were the only time we really had time to see each other for a couple of weeks. So that took up half of the time of almost every break. Reason 2 is that my current IT job at the university needs me. We are always open and there is a constant demand for our assistance and due to my unique position (I'm the only person giving OSX/iOS support), I'm kinda needed. During some lectures, we had many guest speakers from large companies which also talked about career opportunities and how they won't offer internships under 3-6 months. Since our breaks aren't as long as of americans (we usually have two 6-8week breaks per year) there wasn't really much time for long internships without me quitting my job and missing a whole semester of classes. Quitting my job was never an option because it provided safe and constant income for my whole time as a student and I really like it as well (I'm kinda into technology and computers, too).

So what I'm actually wondering is if i will be able to get a job (I know it's sad wondering about that). On the one hand, yes, I have not done any internships. On the other hand, when I will be graduating, I will have 4+ years job experience at the university's IT department. I'm just having doubts about how a recruiter will think about this job since it has not directly anything to do with degree. Will I be fine and shouldn't worry or should I try to get an internship before I graduate (I would probably just do it after my master's thesis)?

Thanks for any advice in advance and for reading all that text. I will highly appreciate EVERY reply!! :-)

Update: Fixed some spelling boo-boos :).. 

TL;DR: Soon graduate. Mid 20s. B.Sc. in Business Administration (Major Operations) &amp; soon M.Sc. in Business Administration (Major Operations, Minor Finance). Never had an internship, but after graduating 4+ years of job experience at university's IT department. Will I find a job? Or should I do an internship asap?"

It'll be 10:00AM and before I know it, it's 6:00PM.
I don't think anything can help me. The last time I went to the doctor's I could barely describe any of what I was feeling before I was rushed out the door. It doesn't help that I don't have a phone, I don't have a job, I'm not in school, I don't drive, and my family doctor is in the next city. I try to talk to my father but he gives me the whole ""Be stronger, it's all in your head"" speech. I know a lot of what I feel is because I don't like the way I look, but I don't even think weight loss can help me because I think I'm hideous. 
The other part to this is that I don't care what any one else thinks, so compliments don't help me, because I'm only worried about what I think. How do I take the first step when I can't even leave my home? I hate that I had all this support in high school, but now that I'm older no one wants to help. 
I'm not even strong enough to kill myself. It's so sad.
I wanted to start cutting again, but every time I look at my arms and see my scars, especially the risen ones, I get so sick because it only makes me uglier, which intern makes me feel worse, and then more depressed. There's literally nothing I can do but lay here until my heart stops. 
I think it would be easier to take a bunch of pills.
I don't want to hate myself anymore. I don't have motivation to change, I don't have support, and I don't have the strength to stand when I step outside. 
I understand that some people can really be alive for no reason at all despite what I've learned in church, because I'm one of those people. 
I can't even be in love because I hate myself so much, I don't deserve such nice things.

One of the primary reasons I chose Berkeley was because the admissions counselor said I would be able to double major in Computer Science and Political Science while at the school. This is a problem at most other schools since most of the time colleges completely house off Computer Science from all the other students in an engineering school, which doesn't make much sense to me since knowing computer science has pretty much become helpful in any line of work. 

I've done a good amount of prior work in both political science and computer science, so hopefully that may help. If anything, I think it will ensure that I won't get bored and slack off in either field.

Anyway, do you think it would be possible to major in these two fields and still have time for social life, internships, clubs..? Also, does anyone have any advice for how to take advantage of both programs? Any advice on how to best manage double majoring in the two?

So, I've just finished all my exams and I'm about a month away from graduating from uni (hopefully) with a bachelors degree in economics. I've not received my results yet but I'm almost certain I'm going to end up with pretty bad/mediocre grades since I have very little interest in the subject and was too lazy to really work hard despite this. I made a very rash decision to drop computing science after first year and have been regretting this ever since I've realised that economics is probably even worse for me personally. 

I'm quite a shy person and live a pretty sheltered life too (think stereotypical asian nerd). For the past few years in uni, I've not really put much effort into trying to bolster my CV either - I've not had any internships and the only work experience I've had to date (if this even counts) is volunteering in a charity shop for a few months and a very short 10-week trial at Mcdonalds, after which I was told they didn't want to keep me, which I can't deny, didn't bother me too much since I really didn't enjoy my time there anyways. 

Needless to say, I'm currently in a spot of bother to say the least, and have no idea how to proceed. Throughout my teenage years I kept asking myself what I actually wanted to do when I'm older but never found an answer, I was convinced that I'm probably just too lazy to actually enjoy anything that resembles work. This led to me short-sightedly indulging on as much procrastination as humanly possible throughout my university years and here I am. 

I'm not sure what more I can say to help you guys in giving me advice. I may be 21 now, but at heart, I'm still the unmotivated teenager who wastes his time watching movies, anime, playing video games etc. which is why I really want to change now. I've even dabbled into ""video games journalism"" but quickly became disillusioned by the volatility of those types of jobs, as well as doubting my own ability - I've actually done some paid work for a certain website, but the guy in charge cut me off after about 2 months. Aside from this, I'm a chinese guy born in the UK, so I can speak (unfortunately, I've forgotten how to read and write over the years) cantonese at a decent level (sadly not mandarin which is infinitely more useful). 

Right now, I'm just a fairly straight-forward guy who doesn't really have any grand aspirations with life, so I'm open to most things that don't involve heavy manual labour, though as mentioned previously, I think economics-related jobs are out of the question for me personally. I have a feeling that I should get some proper work experience before I actually commit to a full-time career. One of my relatives who shares a similar background, moved over to Hong Kong to gain some experience doing data entry as an office clerk, perhaps I could follow in his footsteps? I think I need to become much more independant as a person as well as more sociable if I'm to have any chance of finding even an average office job. 

I'm currently exploring options such as volunteering (not sure about this), working holidays, TEFL, moving to HK etc. What should I do next?

I like my retail job quite a lot (I'm into fashion and it's a fashion forward company) but $10 an hour just isn't cutting it anymore, I feel like the amount of work I put in is worth more than that.

My GPA at my state university (Computer Engineering) kind of sucked, 3.1. So, I decided to take a step back and rebuild my foundation courses. I took two semesters and strengthened my math fundamentals and programming. During this interim, I was going to return to work but ended up picking an INTERNSHIP at a SOFTWARE company... however... the job role was in IT rather any sort of software, development, or engineering.


During this time, I become a pretty stellar student; lots of peers turned to me for assistance in our math/programming courses etc, the fundamentals really helped me leap forward.


To the point: I'll be starting my Junior year in the fall. I am performing excellently in my current ""intern"" role. I am often the fallback for our lead, and can provide answers for my team...but alas this is IT. I was thinking I could stay with this software company until the spring semester is over, then find an internship for this and next summer, before hoping to transition to the real world...


Is that waiting too long? Should I leave this role and search for a Computer Systems Engineering related internship immediately? Will this internship help with my growth even though it is of the IT disposition? After all, Software is in the company name.


Thoughts? Also, what is one to do about the confidence issues related to the very first CS/CSEinterview hunt? I am pretty good with discrete math, coding(java,javascript,C++), and general preparation (IE I often read my textbooks cover to cover....I'm reading my Fall semester textbooks now over the summer). However, I really feel so unprepared for my field in general.

OH! and almost forgot to add. I am taking about 15-18 credits an hour each semester and working between 30-50 hours at my current internship a week.

I got out of school for the summer in May and I dont start my internship until June so I've just been relaxing at home this month and I've started to notice some strange things. Really unsettling things.
First, it started with the birds at the window. In our living room, there is a large, uncovered window near the ceiling that sort of acts as a skylight during the day. Earlier this month, a bird began to peck at the window and act as if he was trying to get inside. It was kind of annoying and in a house by myself, I could pretty much hear it everywhere. The weird part is that not only did he do this all day, he's been doing it for two weeks now. Every single day. A few days ago a second bird joined in so I started throwing my dog's toy up towards the window so they would fly away. But they would always come back. I asked Reddit why they would be doing this and answers varied from ""seeing their reflection"" to ""a bad omen"". So I took this with a grain of salt. But then some other weird things started to happen.
I have never had nightmares before coming back home this month. I have no way to prove that, but it is true. But lately I've been having these absolutely bizarre dreams at night, or even when I nap during the day. They never have a central theme and honestly are just too weird and strange to make any sense at all, but I have been waking up sweating/nervous from my dreams. They range from my friend being shot in the head and me cutting someone's hand off in revenge to robbing a bank in broad daylight and having to leave my family forever. They don't sound that scary when you think about them but it has been far worse in the dreams. Almost like a feeling of dread? 

Now this is where things start to get a little more weird and I'm a little uncomfortable talking about them. 

I find that things around the house aren't where I put them or where they are supposed to be. For example, just yesterday I was walking out through the garage (after my mother got home) and picked up two plastic bags of old letters (from my grandparents house, the letters being old don't really have anything to do with this) and put them on the shelf in the garage. I thought maybe my mother had just forgotten to put them in the car. So I come back down through the garage a while later and they are on the ground again, same place I saw them before. I asked her if she had meant to leave them on the ground and she said that she must've forgotten to put them in the car. But that didn't explain why they were moved back down. I'm typically a pretty rational person so I kind of played it off as some sort of deja vu. But it has been bothering me nonetheless. 
This sort of thing has been happening for the past three days now. I'll put something down like my wallet and then I'll find it in my back pocket half and hour later. I left my computer in the charger for a few hours and came back to find it in my bookbag. It's things like this, nothing too creepy like chairs flying around the room but it sort of feels like Im losing my mind a little. 

Two nights ago I went over to my friends house to smoke a little bud. Not something I do often but when I'm back in town I'll partake with some of my old friends. I was feeling alright when I drove back home (Im an excellent driver, so lets not harp on the fact I drove back, it's only 3 minutes away) but when I got back I had some crazy out-of-body experience. It was something I never experienced or felt before in my life. It was crazy and creepy and I knew I would not be able to talk to my mother properly so I just went straight up the mancave (a room above our garage, has a tv, couch, surround sound, beer fridge, you get it). Knowing she would likely bring me a sandwich or something (my mother is a very sweet and thoughtful lady) I went into the bathroom and pretended to be on the phone. Of course, she came up and I told her I was on the phone and thanked her for the food. But while I was in the bathroom waiting on her, I could hear all these crazy voices. The bathroom fan was on and it was like everything was coming out of that. I was almost mesmerized and just stood there listening. I couldn't really make out any of the words I heard but it definitely sounded like more than one voice and didn't sound positive.  

I don't know if any of this classifies as creepy enough for this sub but living in this house for the past month has been extremely unsettling. Maybe Im just going crazy or maybe it's the birds."

I will even be doing an internship at a German library this autumn which will in order to gain more experience and also to brush up on my German.

There seem to be a fair amount of job openings in my field in Germany, so I am hopeful that I will be able to remain a librarian. But I will need to look for the right job openings, of course, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what the difference is between a Diplom-Bibliothekar and a wissenschaftlicher Bibliothekar. 

From what I can gather from the German Wikipedia entry on librarians, a Diplom-Bibliothekar is someone who has studied at a Fachhochschule while a wissenschaftlicher Bibliothekar is someone with a university degree. Is that correct? And is that the only noticeable difference between the two? Are some libraries, for example research libraries or university libraries more inclined to hire one or the other?

I hope someone here can help. Thanks in advance!"

I'm just hoping to get some advice and different perspective on my current situation. I'm 23 and moved to a new city last year after college because I got an internship in the sports industry. I've always loved sports and was stoked about the opportunity. That internship lead to another internship in the same city in the same field. After That internship was over I got a job for a sports company but in a warehouse logistics role and I hated it. I had about a hour and half commute in traffic, had a rude and un-supportive direct supervisor, and felt like I was setting myself for a career I didn't want. A part time opportunity came up at the place I last interned at and I jumped at it. I just wanted to get out of where I was and back in sports. This meant I had to find another part time job to make ends meet. Now I'm in a situation where I enjoy where I work, but I work every single day at odd hours and make a lot less than I did before and it is definitely stressful making ends meet. On top of that i never have time to do anything. I feel like I should have really thought about what two part time jobs would entail and sometimes I regret leaving. Now I am looking at a full time opportunity at a company that is still in line with what I want to do career wise and where a lot of my former co-workers work, but am worried that my short tenure at jobs will look bad. I am also worried that I will burn a bridge if I take a new job only 3 months in. It is all really stressing me out and I go back and forth on what I should do all the time.

I figured that they would be too competitive, and I could save a bit of money if I took summer classes at a community college and graduated a semester early instead. Still did not get the best grades either since I only got a GPA between 3.25 and 3.3, however, my university has a reputation for being tough.

&amp;nbsp;

I did not realize every job required multiple years of experience (usually at least 2 or 3) and skills I do not have as a math major. I got a very worthless minor, Computer Architecture, since I have a genuine interest in computer hardware. It still included basic programming skills, but programming jobs require a lot more than just a year of object oriented programming classes in Java.

&amp;nbsp;

I focused my math electives in Statistics (up to time series) and Numerical (Differential Eqs. and Linear Algebra) courses. The statistics do not help because statistician jobs primarily require a master's degree. I do not have any finance courses to back up the statistics either. I took a course in data mining as a free elective because data analysis sounded fun, but once again those jobs are primarily master's degree only. The numerical courses would help with algorithms, if only I knew any languages past the basics.

&amp;nbsp;

I do not really have anything else. I have the Java programming, half a semester of C, a lot of MATLAB, and a bit of R.

&amp;nbsp;

What I do not have: SAS (the statistical package companies actually use), SQL (pretty important for Data Analysis, Statistics and quite a few QA Testers), Excel (excludes me from 99% of jobs. It does not look hard at all with even my background in programming, but I don't feel comfortable lying and saying I know it.), every other programming language, a teaching certification, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Where do I go from here? Are there any sub-entry level jobs I should try to find that would get me skills and experience that would help me get an entry level job?

So from lurking on this sub for a few years I have noticed that the general consensus when it comes to going to grad school is that it isn't worth the time and money- but what if my undergrad degree is in something like 'game programming'?

Sure, I learn many of the fundamentals that any CS student would learn, and I learn it well- but a lot of that is applied towards graphics and game production more than anything.

I'm doing pretty well for myself. I have one internship under my belt at one of the largest interactive entertainment companies in the world, and this summer I just moved to Seattle to intern at the biggest game engine developer. I also have gotten to onsites with Microsoft, etc.

Case in point, I will be graduating with one of those 'weird' degrees but will have 2 incredible internships completed, as well as a lot of sick projects worked on.

So, grad school in this context; what do you guys think? The only reason I really consider it at the moment is because I want further specialization in graphics engineering."

I'm a computing student moving to Augsburg for 12 months for an internship at at Fujitsu. I'm moving from Preston, Lancashire in England. I'm looking for general advice regarding the town and stuff. 

Some areas of concern are:

Clothes. Should I buy clothes for winter before I leave or buy there? What basics do I need to have?

Accommodation: I am looking around for accommodation at the moment in augsburg but have no idea where to look. Its really hard to decide where I would like to live in Augsburg, especially when there isn't google street view in most of Germany. I will be earning under 1000 euro a month, and I assume I would want to have a room alone, but I feel I may get lonely, as I'm not super outgoing anymore. Also, would I be able to have guests over for a few days in the accommodation? My bf will be visiting me in Germany, so would want an accommodation that allows guests I suppose. 

Transport: I got told it was best to buy a monthly pass for approximately €45, which will allow me to travel anywhere in the city... Would anyone else recommend that? 
 
Food: Any recommendations on good places to go and eat for vegetarians?? 

Thanks in advance! :)

4knnpm,1,2016-05-23,Question about Word,Lick_A_Brick,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4knnpm/question_about_word/,"So I'm still in school and and am now doing an internship at a school. So most technical questions I get asked I can solve pretty easily but this simple one I can't. 

One of the office workers is working in a 80 page document with pictures and all kind of stuff like that. 

When she changes something and saves the document and she scrolls down she can only see like the next 20ish pages (the scroll bar remains the size as if there are 80 pages). 

At first I thought it was the 32bit office they used (because some shifty software doesn't work with 64bit), but it doesn't work on 64bit either. Word only uses like 50MB of RAM so that's not it either. 

I have the idea that I'm just dumb and there is a simple solution to this but googling it doesn't give any solutions or people with similar problems. (I might be using wrong search terms though)

Oh it's Word 2013 we are using. 



EDIT: Forgot to mention that after a restart of Word it all works again, but is of course not good enough. "

The title says the basics of my problem. I'm going into my third year of college, but I've only taken 2 intro-level programming courses, which taught me programming logic and Java basics - probably similar to everyone else's programming intro courses.  
  
I've had a couple internship interviews that didn't even result in a call back to tell me I didn't get it. But I'm not too discouraged, because I didn't think sophomores with my amount of inexperience could even get interviews... if anything, it just made me feel like there's an amazing market for CS majors - and I live in Georgia!  
  
**On to the main point.** The interviewers both asked me one question in common: are you more interested in front end or back end? And I had to tell them that I had no idea. And that I had no idea what I really wanted to do... and that isn't really what worries me - I know I'm still really early on and there's plenty of time to find out what I enjoy doing. However, I do worry about what I currently dislike doing, and that's most of this problem solving that I see people recommending here in the sidebar: subreddits like r/dailyprogrammer, websites like Codewars, etc. that give you boring ass problems that are, honestly, a bit over my head at the moment.  
Don't get me wrong - I completely understand the point of them is to build logical thinking, problem solving, and Googling skills. But... they're just so mind-numbingly boring to me.  
  
So here's what I do like.  
I love working on GUIs and connecting functionality to every piece of the GUI I've made. I've always enjoyed design and data visualization. Web development is interesting and I've learned a lot on my own about it. But that's about all the experience I've gotten so far, so who knows what I'll enjoy? I don't know if I'll enjoy working with databases, because I haven't learned how to yet.  
  
So what's a good path (career-wise) for someone who enjoys those things?  
  
Any advice is appreciated, and thanks in advance!"
4kowrn,188,2016-05-23,.NET Wizardry,rmg22893,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4kowrn/net_wizardry/,"So I currently intern for a local government's IT department. It's pretty great, all things considered, aside from not being paid (at least yet). Many of the city's departments use an IP camera monitoring software. It works well, but it has some weird quirks, specifically to do with .NET, in which case all logic flies out the window.

So far, I have seen this particular software installed three separate times. I will also mention that all three of these times have been with me taking a quiet, observational backseat to the admin I'm shadowing, so they do most of the installation process. 

The first time, it goes as expected. During installation, it pops up a dialogue saying ""Hey, you haven't installed .NET yet; install it and try again."" But, the admin, being a seasoned veteran, closes the dialogue without even looking at it, and I have to point out the dependency to him. No sweat, everyone makes mistakes. I put a note in the back of my mind to remember, remember, the 5th of .NETvember.

The second time, I am with a different admin, and we spend, no exaggeration, six hours setting up a new machine (a machine that was supposedly already configured, but was inexplicably vendor-stock) with this software, due to various issues. One of the issues is that the camera software just won't open after installation. It takes about 45 minutes before I manage to convince him that we need to install .NET, and poof, it magically opens. He thanks me profusely and we leave.

Fast forward a few weeks, and we're installing it yet again. This time, the machine was actually configured ahead of time by another admin, but somehow doesn't have the camera software that he claims to have installed. We go to install it, and the unpacking dialog does the strangest thing. The progress bar fills up, it closes, and then it opens another below it, causing a cascading dialog box effect. We have no clue what's going on, but after twenty minutes of scratching our heads, I ask him if I can take the wheel, and I quietly install .NET. No more issues, works like a charm.

**TL;DR:** Always check for prerequisites before installing a program. Don't assume a program will fail in the same way every time because of the same issue. Don't assume a third party has done the proper setup."

I feel like this is inadequate, especially because my top school is Duke. I want to eventually enter the political field and I've been searching for internships and other stuff but I'm having extreme trouble.  


I live in Gainesville, Florida, home to the University of Florida. Which *should* mean that there are plenty of internships and job opportunities, **however**, the market is saturated with 50,000+ students. Every time I apply for an internship, I'm told that they prefer to work with at least undergrads as minors are liabilities, minors end up receiving ""special care"", etc. Jobs are even worse as businesses have access to an endless and renewable source of cheap labor that doesn't require ""special treatment"" for being a minor. 



I see people on here with really awesome internships and other ECs and I wonder how the hell they got them. So, in short, what can I do to improve my extracurriculars? What ECs do you have that you're really proud of? How did you start them?

I'm beginning my second year in university in a few months and i'm looking to improve my programming skills before my co-op/internship(in approx 7 months)!

I've completed a course in python a couple months ago,  and in September I will begin my Java course.

So I just completed the python course in codecademy just for a little review, and I plan to complete the HTML/CSS/JS because I want to have more flexibility and diversity in my knowledge. I understand that its only an introductory course.

I want to make advances on my python knowledge and my goal this summer is to get familiar with pygame and start making games with it! I've looked through /r/learnprogramming and found links such as:

2: Automate the boring stuff with python/Learn python the hard way

to look at after i'm finished with the HTML/CSS/JS courses. After everything, I want to apply all the knowledge i've learned to work on a project, though i'm not really sure where to start or what kind of project to do. Once i'm confident with python, I want to learn another language such as Java or C++ and do more game dev stuff.

To be honest i'm very ""picky"" on what resources I should learn from, like I always want to pick the best way to learn. Though I know that many of the resources available here are helpful in many ways.

I'm just wondering if this is a good path to be going on throughout the next few months, to improve my programming skills and to find an internship? Thanks for any help!

They were not transparent about the expiration date to submit the form and didn't contact me earlier that the offer had been rescinded.

My problem now is that I put all my eggs in this basket and already turned down other internship offers. It's now late in the game and I'm furiously contacting earlier companies to see if they're still in the hiring process and submitting new applications.

Is there anything I can do with this current company? Something isn't adding up to me. Or are there other options I'm not seeing?"

I'm 22 y/o and for my whole life I've been extremely shy(?).

My parents told me that when I was in kindergarten for the first half year I didn't talk to ANYONE there. I only answered with yes/no when someone asked me something and that was it. I always sat alone while other kids were playing with each other, and I litterally didn't have any friends. 

My parents got called from kindergarten and got told that they should seek help (therapy) for me. I was really smart for such a young kid, but I had completely no social contact with other kids or people working there. I remember I didn't mind it at all.

Fortunately, some day I just completely changed (?) and started playing with other kids. Soon I had a lot of friends and was a 'normal' kid. My parents never thought about therapy anymore, because I finally was fine.

As I grew older it was getting a little better, but I'm still struggling with it. Everytime I come in a new surrounding (new work, new class, new friends) I'm extremely quiet. It takes really long (sometimes even a few years) for me to open up. I'm at college now and this first year (from september) I litteraly didn't even have a chat with any of my classmates except one.

My now best friend tried to be friends with me for 3 years and in those 3 years I never had a chat with him, I only sometimes answered some of his questions and that was it. After 3 years I finally opened up and we became best friends.

I've been on an internship for past 4 months and this is the hardest time for me. I'm trying my best to talk to everyone there, but it makes me so exhausted and stressed. When I was at school or work nobody really cared about that. They just found it weird. But at my internship I really get problems because of this. My boss wants to talk to me about it all the time, which brings me to another problem.

Everytime someone brings it up I literally start crying immediately. I can't control it and I feel really ashamed when I cry. It's not only with this. I cry everytime someone wants to talk about me. It doesn't matter what if it's something positive or negative, when I hear something or have to talk about myself I can't help but crying.

I remember one time in high school my teacher wanted to have a talk with me. We had a long talk about who I am and why I am like this (shy, quiet, extremely passive and all my teachers always thought I didn't care about anything), we were just talking and at some point he said ""do you love yourself?"" and I completely lost it, I mean really lost it. I started crying so bad he couldn't calm me down for good 40 minutes and we finished the talk. The next day he came to to apologize and said he had no idea I would react like this and he only wanted me to stand up for myself and say ""ofcourse I do"" when he asked it.

The thing is, I really don't know why I reacted like this. I don't know if I love myself or not. I don't know myself and I have no idea why I am like this.

In a few weeks I have an appointment with my academic advisor as I'm probably failing my class and he wants to know if there's any reason to it. Well my reason is that I'm not attending all my classes because I don't want to/ can't socialize with the people there and it's making me stressed and completely exhausted when I do, I also feel very exhausted and empty like I have no motivation to study eventhough I really want to pass.
I don't know how to talk to him about it, as I'm really bad at talking about myself without crying as I said. It's really important for me because if he finds my reasons serious enough, he could let me pass the class with some extra work. I really don't know how to approach this problem and I'm afraid I will completely fuck it up. I don't know how to start and how to explain it all to him.

I really don't know if it's just who I am or if it's some mental illness, that's why I came here. 

I'm sorry for such a long post, there's much more I'd want to tell, but I think those things are the most importnt.

Does anyone recognise this or could give me some advice?"

4kpt9i,1,2016-05-23,Relationship with grandparents is falling apart because of grandmother's dementia.,GrandKidofDementia,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4kpt9i/relationship_with_grandparents_is_falling_apart/,"This might be long and I'm sorry. Throwaway account.

I'm looking for advice on how to talk to my grandpa and what I should do to be a good grandkid to my grandmother.

TL;DR: My grandmother has always been difficult but is now intolerable due to dementia. She's incredibly angry with me. My grandfather is miserable and has given up his entire life to take care of her, and I really don't have the wisdom to know what is the best course of action.

My grandmother has dementia. She has always been a fairly insufferable person, just her personality (that's another post for another time), but she has always been a wonderful grandmother and loved her family with her whole heart. I'm not lying when I say that the only people that like her are members of her own family. 

She was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago along with some other health problems. She's deteriorated especially in the most recent years and she now has to live in a nursing home, which she hates. She is rude to staff, she refuses to socialize with other residents, and is incredibly demanding. All of the staff hates her and I don't blame them or hold anything against them because they're right; she's awful.

Her husband, my grandfather, was one of the happiest, jolliest people to ever live. I have never met a single person who had the slightest bad thing to say about him. He was active, social, hardworking, volunteered, very doting on family/grandkids, liked everyone he met no matter their lifestyle or politics or anything. For the majority of my life I had never, ever seen him in a bad mood. 

But he's very old fashioned. One of those ""you stick by your spouse no matter what as long as you physically can"" and he's doing that. He's not the grandfather I remember. He's miserable, doesn't smile, is exhausted, had to give up his volunteer work that he was passionate about, no visiting family and friends, gave trips and vacations, gave up job that he loved, and his free time. Basically, he gave up everything that he should be doing/enjoying in post-retirement life. 

He takes care of my grandmother for 12 hours a day, every day. No breaks, no day off. He sits with her at the home, carts her back to their house for 6 hours a day (every day) because she hates the nursing home. He can't be more than 10 minutes away from her or the nursing home because she calls at all hours (confused) and he has to rush there to help because she fights the staff. He's healthy for his age, but he's not a spring chicken anymore and age has taken a toll as well.

He counts the days he does this. He cooks or brings her all her meals because she won't eat the food served there. Her mind is deteriorating, but with modern medicine, she can still live for a number of years. 

The family is starting not to be able to stand my grandmother. My aunt (their daughter) hardly ever visits because she's awful and mean. My dad (their son) lives across the country and hates calling, for the same reasons. My cousins are busy or don't visit, and I live an hour away with no car. I'm a busy student so I literally get up, go to school, do homework, study, and sleep. When I am free, it's usually too late at night to call. As a result, my grandmother is pissed at me and mean when I do visit. I've tried to explain and to apologize and do the best I can, but it's not good enough for her. She's ordered all my pictures (or anything that relates to me) taken down and removed.

I handmake all my Christmas gifts, but this past Christmas I was busy with finals and an internship so I didn't get them done as quick as I would have liked. I finished my aunt's by the holiday, but my grandma's wasn't done yet. I left my aunt's gift with my mom and my mom dropped it off by aunt to be nice. My grandma flipped out and was so mad that I didn't have one for her that she disowned me. My mom and grandfather tried to explain that I did have a gift for her, it just wasn't finished yet, but she wouldn't be reasonable.

I don't even want to see her at this point. I missed my cousin's birthday/mother's day celebration because my grandpa told me that she wasn't going to be happy to see me, even though he and my family miss me. I have my own stuff going on in life (as we all do) and I couldn't bring myself to take time to go and be yelled at by her. 

For most of my life I've been a dutiful grandkid. Gracious and polite, spent more time with them than my cousins combined. Put up with my grandma's quirks, always called, visited, and did stuff with them even if it was ""old people stuff"". My dad has told me that they think I'm ""special"" since I'm the only granddaughter, and my grandma always wanted a granddaughter, but with life, growing up, and these added things, it's a lot harder to keep it up. 

I haven't seen my grandma since thanksgiving. She didn't say a word to me. 

I know dementia isn't her fault, I do love her and I know that this is much harder for her than it is for me. I don't want to be one of those young people that just ignores their aging relatives. But I'm angry. I've talked with my aunt and we're almost at the point where we want to hold an ""intervention"" of sorts because it's so hard to see my grandpa so miserable, when that's not who he is. Everyone in the family is quickly becoming resentful of the situation in general.

I want to reiterate that I love my family. I have very fond memories of both my grandparents and am grateful for them. Which is why I feel so awful. Part of me is guilty, but I just don't know how much I can take at this point. I've tried telling myself that it's not her fault and I've accepted that the ""old her"", so to speak, is gone. I don't know why I can't bring myself to tolerate it for her sake. I know it's pointless to be angry at her, but I am. 

Am I bad a person? Am I just being ""young and selfish""? Am I disappointment? I know I don't have a ton of life experience in this area. I'm in my 20s so I don't know what it's like to watch people you love age and deteriorate, powerless to stop it. I don't know what the right course of action is, and I really lack the wisdom of what to do here. Should I try to mend things even if I'm the one doing all the work? Is there anything to help my grandfather? "

4kqrlt,6,2016-05-23,"failed calc, should I retake it in the summer or fall?",al3xisnic0le,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/4kqrlt/failed_calc_should_i_retake_it_in_the_summer_or/,"Just want to thank whoever takes the time out to read this.. it really means a lot.

so I failed calc after getting a 70 on a makeup midterm when I needed a 90. Kinda unfair because I got into a car accident 2 days before the exam and still took the exam with a head and neck injury. Not sure if I could fight that and if I could, who I would even fight it with... so let's assume I have to retake it. 

My options are to now take it during the summer (Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 6:00pm to 8:40pm). In case that didn't sound awful enough, let me emphasize FRIDAY UNTIL 8:40 PM. 
My other option is to take it in the fall and partially ruin my great schedule next semester (which I'm resentfully ok with).

Here's my dilemma:
I am a pre-business (with intentions of Finance and Accounting) major, and upon contacting career services they told me the big fish (such as a J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and other ""Wall-Street guys"" start recruiting as early as September/October. I ended with a 3.2 last semester and ignoring my F in calc (which puts me at a 2.625 for this semester, and a cumulative average of 2.846), I end this semester with a 3.5.
I think I can get at least a B in Calc if I take it over the summer so my GPA would be at about a 3.31. A 3.31 (B) looks a lot better than a 2.8(C+). 
Although they will see what classes I'm currently taking, see that I had all A's/B's for my other classes spring semester, and see that I am retaking Calculus, I feel like they would immediately be turned off by the cumulative GPA to look into how it got to be that. 
I am also working for a small CPA firm this summer, for your reference.

So my options are basically ruin my summer because of that Friday class and during the week not be able to work at a CPA firm in North Jersey (too far to drive back and forth to), or risk not getting a good internship because I didn't re-take it in the summer and now my GPA sucks.

Anyone who could give me any advice on what would be the smartest thing to do, it would be greatly appreciated.

I thought I would take some time to reflect on my career path this fall Sunday, and more importantly, countless mistakes I had made with my resume.
This morning I found a file of old resumes as I was cleaning my hard drive. In fact, I was able to locate one from each year of college.


Let’s profile the progression of an undergraduate student resume to help you benchmark your current resume. Use this analysis of past resumes to identify best practices, learn when to seek help, and what mistakes to avoid.


###Freshmen Year^r^r^r^r

A lack of professional experience coupled with insufficient knowledge of resume mechanics will make it difficult to position yourself as a competitive candidate, especially for those who are seeking their first internship.


Freshmen don’t have time to worry about effective resume preparation, let alone educate themselves on tedious resume details. I was not an exception. Rather then grouping sections by experience, I chose to organize sections by competencies and use examples from various self-directed projects and organizations to support the claim. This approach resulted in some weird resume/cover letter hybrid:

[Freshman Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y11.png)
##Resume Elements include

• Objective

• Skills summary

• Skills and Experience

• Computer Skills

• Education and Training


Luckily, as an undergraduate, you’ll have many university provided resources at your disposal. I suggest reaching out to your university’s career advising center…but heed my warning, those guys are busy; really, really busy. If I remember correctly, they suggested I highlight any time I learned or used a technical skill.


###Sophomoreo Year^r^r^r^r

While freshman year should be spent integrating yourself into student organizations, exploring academic opportunities and developing technical skills (I suggest you take advantage of free university-provided software training classes. These courses will help develop a foundational technical understanding and can be included on your resume). Sophomore year is a time where the ambitious gain an advantage by applying to competitive internships or research positions. A proper resume is paramount to landing such a position…


Fall semester of my sophomore year I started an e-commerce business and was faced with a dilemma…how does this new experience fit into my existing resume? The answer: It didn’t. The resume of freshmen year had to go.


This iteration of my resume focused on proper formatting mechanics (poorly) more so than the content:

[Sophomore Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y2_Page_1.png)


##Resume Elements include:

• Objective shortened

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections. Organized by themes of freshmen achievements

• Introduced bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

If you’ve developed great experience but have little knowledge of formatting,  take a look at the [Rezi BETA Resume Template.](https://rezi.io/optimized-resume-template/) Let our knowledge of resume mechanics take care of the dirty work while your experience does the talking.

###Junior Year^r^r^r^r

Career fairs, mock interviews, networking…junior year should be your busiest yet. Hopefully by now, you are well emerged in student organizations and maybe your persistent dedication has landed you a leadership position (LPT: that’s the goal of student organizations).

Your chosen career path should be more clearly defined. Now that you’re past the halfway point, you should really think about want you want to do post-graduation. The summer following your junior year will be the launching pad of your career. Aim to use this period to excel in a position related to your vocational goals.

Keep in mind these positions are even more competitive. Your resume must be on point, master the tedious mechanics if you want to see results. Luckily, my roommate was a resume reviewer for the university business school. Here is the resume we created together:

[Junior Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y3.png

##Resume Elements include:

• Objective deleted

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections organized by accomplishments

• Introduced well thought out and actionable bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

In this iteration I focused on quantifying accomplishments and making sure my experience descriptors contained critical elements. I also made a major shift in the format. This is the resume was used to land my first “competitive” internship

If you are behind in your resume at this point check out the [Rezi Complete Resume](https://rezi.io/). It’s a safe bet.


###Senior Year^r^r^r^r

Senior year was essentially building on the experience I developed during the previous years and tailoring my resume to reflect this. It was around this time that I first heard about Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS. The first version was used to land my second “competitive” internship. The second semester version of this resume is my first attempt at optimizing it to pass ATS.  Let’s take a look:

[Senior Year 1st Semester Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y4.1.png)

##This is the final resume:

[Senior Year 2nd Semester Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y4.21.png
)

Your resume may take a similar path of continued improvement but we suggest you skip right to the punch. Take advantage of years of development and check out the Rezi BETA Resume Template.  From the students Rezi has talked with, a commonality that we are seeing with student resumes is they do a pretty poor job of pulling key skills out from education. 

Many students don't have relevant work experience to highlight those skill sets. The goal of the [Rezi BETA Resume Template](https://rezi.io/optimized-resume-template/) is twofold, to show the employer that the student has learned the skills they need to be a successful employee, and simultaneously increase employer knowledge on educational programs to increase the perceived relevance and value of education.

I need your help. I'm trying to experience the most I can out of my 20s, but I'm struggling.

My life up to this point has been irritatingly standard and relatively boring for a guy in his 20s. I spend a majority of my time doing schoolwork for my work-intensive major- Computer Science- and the little free time that I have is me dicking around not doing anything productive just because I need the mental break. I have no internship this summer so I'm taking classes (more schoolwork, yay) and applying to boring IT jobs in the area that are the best I can do to benefit my resume. I find I can't even start putting my time in the summer towards something productive I find interesting- it all has to do with coursework or my future. I feel as though my entire existence at the moment is for benefitting my future, and if I stop to enjoy myself I immediately fall behind. I even planned to find work abroad in Spain this summer, but unfortunately I found out I couldn't because then, for complicated reasons, I wouldn't be able to declare my major on time. 

Given all this, I've been trying to make my time here interesting by improving my social life, but every time I feel like I've accomplished something, I immediately regret feeling so. I continuously join new organizations to become part of new friend groups, but after a while I always end up disillusioned with the group after I realize the people in the group don't really care about me or value me as much as other members. This is generally because I'm kind of introverted and am not as loud/outgoing in big groups as are the people who catch everyone's attention. For this reason, I end up hating hanging out with certain groups and just hop to new ones, where the same thing happens. 

It's similar with girls. I feel like since I'm in my prime now is the best time for me to meet and date girls, but I have such trouble finding someone I like, and every time I do, I end up losing the girl to one of my friends who is more outgoing and sociable than I am (since I usually meet girls in my ""friend groups""). I've had my heart broken like this more times than I can count, and it makes me feel worse than anything else.

I want to travel, explore, learn about myself, make friends, meet girls, have fun, and everything else. But every time I try it just hinders a different part of my life or I get shut down because of the way I am. How do I improve myself? 

**Also, apologies if this is all over the place. I have trouble expressing myself through one text post without making it too long, so if you have clarifying questions I will answer. Thank you if you're reading this far- I'm just a bit down at the moment.

Will I even do well?,throwaway-016,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ksoh7/failed_out_of_cs_and_schoolended_up_doing/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I had a rough history with school.

Did okay with my first year of CS...second year, things started to go wrong. Classes, of course, got harder, all the people I considered friends left to different parts of the country due to different reasons, significant other dumped me, I started to hate my school.

But past those circumstances, it was really hard for me to do well in school, and past a certain point, classes just became really difficult for me. The material seemed to fly over my head, and I just...lost motivation to keep trying.

Ended up failing out of school...programmed a lot of projects in my spare time and got several offers from start-ups (I was too scared to apply to any ""well-known"" companies). The startup I joined started to go under, so I jumped ship, interviewed again, ended up getting a programming internship at a relatively well-known company. Did well in that, enjoyed my work, contributed a lot, didn't get fired on the job. After that ended, I still needed rent money, so I started interviewing again, received a few offers. Began a software engineering job at another relatively well-known company that I still work for today.

(before anyone raises any ethical concerns, background checks are mandatory of course and I'd get into serious trouble for lying, so these companies knew my situation before hiring me)

Thing is, people at this company are pretty amazing and so is the work we're doing. It almost makes me feel unworthy, but I'm still employed after a while so I guess I must be doing something right?

But as of late, I've been inspired. I really do want to learn more about this craft I'm doing. I'm done rationalizing things away as ""I don't really like academic CS"" or ""school was never really my thing"" to try to make myself feel better.

But I'm scared, honestly. I'm scared of going back to school. I'm scared of failing again. I'm scared that maybe the whole ""academic CS isn't really my thing"" excuse is really true and maybe I'm not fit to be in this field (scary because I'm not really that great at many other things).

Is it too late to go back to school? Is it actually not realistic for me to do well in CS in school anymore? Should I just cop out and study something else and choose a different field?

I'm coming towards the end of my degree but most importantly I am wanting to start working in the industry and on cool projects. I thought it would be best to hear from the people who are actually in the industry and ask what you guys would like to see if you were hiring a junior or intern.


Some facts about me: 

* Currently finishing up my degree (bachelor of information technology majoring in IT security)
* Working at one of Australia's biggest property website in their    customer care team as well the Fraud team.
* Weekly pairing with a senior DevOps engineer for around 7 months
* Competed in a capture the flags 
* Member of the uni's security club 

I have some dev experience with ruby and also few web dev projects using ROR, html, css javascript

I have a fair bit more experince with the ops side as I've used aws (for all the things), docker, new relic, security center, mod security, vagrant and a few more. Also lots of linux experience with making and breaking servers and also comfortable in the terminal.  

I've also been studying Chinese for some years now and have also studied in China.

I've also recently been going to meet ups for Ruby, Sectalks and soon to Melbourne's devops meet up.

At the devops meet coming up I'm going to spruikmyself when they have the jobs board so we will see how that goes!! haha 

I have talked to people in company about positions available which I am really keen on because I really like the work environment however I don't want to put all of my eggs into one basket and I also just want to have a look around too. 


Would love to hear what you guys want! Thanks guys really appreciate this!!"

- 3.2 GPA ( but last few semesters have been mostly As with a few Bs, making up for awful first year )
- I have my associates now, but I've only taken two intro engineering courses and nothing that was focused on Computer Hardware Engineering, I got my basics completely out of the way
- I'm transferring from a community college to a university this Fall
- I've worked my entire college career during this, I was part of a pretty small computer club at community college, and I have volunteer work under my belt.

I feel that my GPA and the fact that I haven't taken any real engineering courses really hinder my progress. Should I just wait until my Junior year to apply? Should I just go for the gold and apply anyways or not waste my time? I know companies don't expect much from interns, but I would love to avoid being the person who has no idea what they're talking about since I haven't had ANY actual classes yet. My only concern is that my window will be so small to get an internship between my junior summer and my senior summer, I'm not entirely sure how hard it is to get an internship in the first place.

[Security analyst](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=160002L)

[Linux service engineer](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=15000LU)

[Windows service engineer](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=16000DW)

I love games, so I really want to work for Blizzard. I’m also interested in relocating to California, so that’s a second plus!

Anyway, I changed a lot throughout college, but the one thing that remained consistent was my interest in computers. I will graduate in August with a bachelor's degree in multidisciplinary studies which consists of physics, philosophy and technological systems management. This major is only sort of related to the positions I am aiming for, however I think that my critical thinking and problem solving skills would be useful to this company. As for the management portion of my major, I have plenty of experience in leading projects and groups. Specifically, I was president of my school’s Physics Club for two years and I am currently an officer/moderator in an online research project related to brain-computer interfaces. In my resume, I mention how I revitalized and grew the club into the successful organization that it is today.

Since 2011, I have participated in three computer repair internships. In total, I have a little over a year’s worth of professional experience. I have been repairing computers in my own free time for about five years now and I think I am very good at it. I’ve had no unhappy customers in all these years!

I recently earned my A+ certification and I would like to earn a few more related to the positions I am applying for. I told one of my internship employers that I earned my A+ (since they said they could possibly hire me when I earned it) and they told me to give them a call in August when I graduate. This place is one of the best on Long Island because they are extremely knowledgeable and do honest work. They fix mostly Windows and Mac computers, provide web-design services and install networks for customers. I’d really like to get involved in learning about networking.

This summer, I hope to become fluent in Python by learning the language and using it to program a few hundred applications. I will also be learning about vector graphics and web design this summer at my school’s tech lab. Finally, I want to enhance my Chinese language skill.

Python is a recommended talent in the job description and I know how I would go about learning that, but I am confused about how to learn other things that they ask for.

I don’t know how to work with Microsoft IIS, Puppet, Chef, or Octopus. I don’t have an in-depth understanding of “Active Directory in a multi-site domain”, nor do I feel confident in my enterprise networking skills. I also do not have experience with AWS. I feel like for everything else, I would be a great choice for the job and the work environment at Blizzard. However, the BS in computer science recommended talent is a bit daunting, but at least I have experience and a slightly related degree! Plus, if I’m really good with Python and some other languages, then I don’t really see how I wouldn’t be valuable to the company.

So, in conclusion, how would I go about gaining practical and theoretical knowledge of the aforementioned subjects and in what timeframe would it be reasonable to learn them in? A year? Two years? 

Please let me know what else I should be focusing on to achieve my goal! Thanks!

I had to take some time off for military training which meant dropping spring semester, and education classes aren't really available summer since I need to intern, so I was out of school February until this August. 

In the mean time I got an awesome job in an early learning center.  They do such good things and I feel like if I get a good reference here it would help when I'm looking for k-12 work. They pay 9.50 to start,  11.00 after I finish some training. 

My husband has been saying I should finish college in August, which means graduating in May and hopefully making more money.  

I worry that's too soon, that getting at least a year here will be better experience before jumping into k-12.

Any advice?"

I have two questions about the feasibility of that plan.

1) I see a lot of internship postings say, ""Must be currently enrolled in a full time degree program"" or something similar, what does this mean? If I take a year off, I'm technically still ""enrolled"", even if I'm not taking any classes, but how do they quantify ""full time""?

2) Related to the above, if I wanted to intern in the US for the summer, the requirements for a J1 state that I must be, ""Currently enrolled full-time and actively pursuing studies at a ministerially-recognized degree"". Does that mean I would be ineligible if I were interning in the Spring? Would I be eligible if I studied during the Spring, even though I wouldn't have a full time course load during the entire academic year (Fall/Spring), but still technically enrolled?

4kw1b3,1,2016-05-24,Technical Sales Engineer internship?,Britito,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4kw1b3/technical_sales_engineer_internship/,"Hi all.

I'm a CS student in the UK, having just finished an industry year at a software company in the CAD/CAM business. Since the placement finished just as summer is beginning, I've been applying to various summer internships. I ended up accepting a ""Technical Sales Engineer Intern"" position at Cisco. It pays well (for the UK) and comes with awesome and paid accommodation in London.

They told us the sort of thing we'll be doing during the interview days, basically providing a technical perspective to the pure sales teams and talking to the customer companies' engineers to work out the technical side of things. While the ad described some scripting and such as part of the job, it is nonetheless mostly people-based.

Since I've already got a years worth of experience at a software company under my belt, I figured this would massively help the soft-skills side of my CV, since CS students have a reputation for lacking in this area, and Cisco being as well-known as it is can't help.

So, cscareeradvice, how do you think I can capitalise on this? Was it a good idea to take in the first place? Anyone else worked in a similar position? Hell, anyone else worked in Cisco's UK offices?"

How should I answer this question if I haven't done a full project with either of these, but I have used them before? I have learned Python by myself using Raspberry Pi, wrote a script or two when I was trying to make it as a home server. I have also worked with Django framework in a previous work term, but not on a full project (it was adding features, maintaining, fixing bugs, adding tests etc. to the company's web app), and a group project in a class for a real client. And few small things using JavaScript here and there. 

I'm currently learning AngularJS on my own as a side project to build a website for myself which will show off any projects I work on and skills, and also will be a blog style website for anything else I'm interested in like, backpacking, photography, any other DIY maybe. But this is not going to be completed until later, so is it worth it to mention this? Even though, they are asking for a project that I have done (completed and impressive)? I don't want to leave it empty, but at the same time I'm not sure if answering it by mentioning my previous work experience is a good answer too. 

Any recommendations on this?

4kwlzj,4,2016-05-24,"Mathematics - Computer Science, an analysis of the major",kenny544,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/4kwlzj/mathematics_computer_science_an_analysis_of_the/,"I've researched a lot about this major, which is the major I applied to and got accepted in, but there seems to be a lot of uncertainties about it.

I'm going to make an analysis of all the research I've done and then decide if I'm going to take this major at UCSD, or take Computer Science degree on other universities that offered it to me.

The problem with all the threads about this major is usually ridden with people with contradicting opinions, and are not helpful for students looking into this major.

So first of all by looking at both links to compare the requirements of each major
http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/node/239

https://math.ucsd.edu/programs/undergraduate/bs_math_comp_science.php

Clearly, the junior year of both courses is where the differences start to get more noticeable

CS students have GE requirements and General Sciences requirements, while Math - CS students have upper division math requirements

If you're O.K or comfortable with math then there's nothing wrong with Math - CS, for some it might be even better (I personally would prefer Math over, say, General Sciences or GE classes)

On the other hand, CS students have a CS Elective each quarter which gives them a big leverage, makes them better prepared for when leaving the university, plus they have priority in the CS classes...which is in itself a pretty big deal  

So if you're a Math - CS student and you want to focus more on the CS part, starting by your third year you can have (theoretically speaking) all of the math requirements done by the end of your junior year

Math109,170A,103AB,184A can all be done in the same year
Taking math out of the way that leaves about most of the senior year up for CSE classes, and taking many CSE electives as possible

CSE20, CSE30,CSE100,CSE105 can also be completed in your junior year

If being a 5th year senior is an option, then it may be very useful to take more CSE electives and more CSE classes to make you more prepared for the jobs you may face outside the university, but do notice that at this point you're already way beyond what your major is offering and right now you're going on your way to close whatever gap that you might have that your major did not fill. This is all assuming you can actually get in the classes and not be stuck in the waiting list.


Conclusion: Math-CS, by itself, does not fully prepare you for a career in computer science, and does not fully prepare you for a career in mathematics. It seems to be a major aimed at students who want to do Masters in computer science or phD in the area.
While it is definitely possible to head for a career or internship in IT with a Math-CS degree, how ready you will be for this career will rely on your work outside the major, the additional classes that you take that are not requirements for the major, and your work/side projects will prove essential.

But on the other hand, the biggest advantage of this major is how flexible it is with which classes you can take. So it's very much possible to work outside of the major and use this to your advantage. Overall the biggest hindrances would be 1 - Time to graduate, 2 - Priority in non-required CSE classes and 3 - How comfortable you are with math.

Whether employers will care about your degree is Math-CS or just CS will then be irrelevant given that you, not by the merits of your degree, have closed any gap between Math-CS and CS while still retaining a mathematical perspective of the major which may prove useful for problem-solving skills and algorithm implementation.

Any insight over this analysis would be really useful not just for me, but for other students who may come across this thread.

I am leaning over declining UCSD for other offers since I personally do not plan any post-grad work at the moment, but more information is always welcome."

I have a Bachelor's in an unrelated field (music) but I've managed to get accepted into three schools that I applied to. Two are Graduate CS programs, but one is a school that offers second Bachelor's degrees. I'm not sure which to take.

My goal is to be the most hire-able, especially by big companies like Google and Microsoft. I don't care what field I go into, I'm just chasing the highest salary at this point in my life (down the road, AI would be fun). I've already got a lot of college loans to pay off and I'm about to accrue even more!

My instinct says go for the second Bachelor's because it will give me a more solid foundation, whereas jumping into a Master's program assumes I know a lot already. The graduate programs are both making me take 5-6 undergraduate courses in CS though to 'catch up', so maybe I should just go for it? 

A big factor in my decision is what will open up the most doors, so I'm curious whether there are more internships available for undergrads or grads... Anyone know? Job experience just seems so important these days.

Lastly, I'm assuming Master's degree holders will earn more straight out of school. But maybe they want to hire Bachelor's degree holders instead because they can pay them less? I don't want to be stuck with a Master's and zero job experience...

I wrote a letter saying that if I get the internship my last day would be June 5 and if I don't, I would be happy to continue working there. Is this something that I should give him, or bad idea? I plan on talking to him about it on Thursday, since he's off tomorrow. 

Any advice would be appreciated."

I just finished my freshman year and started my first college internship. To be fair, I am still in my first week so that may affect my perception and I definitely am not deciding to drop CS just because a tough week.


I was just wondering if I could get some insight from other individuals who may have been in similar situations.


Long story short: I am totally overwhelmed and not really enjoying what I am doing. I enjoyed my programming assignments in my Intro CS and DataStructs+Algs class, but so far all the programming I've done for my internship is reading through seemingly obfuscated javascript with no comments and bug fixing.

Handling such a large code base (hundreds of .js files and &gt; 100k lines) and dealing with Git on a project like this is fairly annoying. 


Is this what all CS work is like? I thought I wanted to be a software dev, but this isn't exactly that enthralling..."

4kzzcd,1,2016-05-25,Am I correct to feel this way?,marmarjo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4kzzcd/am_i_correct_to_feel_this_way/,"So I'll preface this with a bit of my background. I am currently a Graduate Assistant at a Private University. I work closely with the IT department at the University providing IT support and I've been doing this for approximately a year and 4 months. I was also an intern for them during my Undergrad for about a year The only benefit I get from this job is that I provide my services and in return, they allow me to get my master's degree(currently in computer science) and a biweekly stipend. Within a few months of starting, I was roped into planning and creating a documentation wiki system for them and the services that they offer on Campus in which I naively accepted. This was put on hold because we are in the process of changing systems such as our ERP system, our payroll system, etc, etc. These changes have produced a high call volume so I always feel pressured.


I should probably couple the fact that a few months ago, we lost a Full time Help Desk employee and just recently another Graduate assistant got moved to a different Graduate position within the department but I'll explain more a bit later. So I am now doing both of their jobs until they get replaced. I have a team of student interns but they don't have nearly enough permissions to do everything that I need help with. 


Here's where it gets interesting. I was passed up the opportunity of the Full Time Help Desk position(I get pay on top of school) because of various reasons, the biggest two are that they couldn't read my intentions(basically kiss butt) and the time frame(they think I'm going to quit as soon as I'm done with school but this got brought up only once). Aside from this, the other Graduate Assistant got hired in a position I was promised I would get once it opened. Could be because of(and I quote her coworkers) her boobs(her boss has a thing for her) or because, as the second most experienced person at my department, my boss would not want to lose me. Before all of this, I passed over the opportunity for a better job at a different organization because I did not want to put my boss in a situation where he had no people.


The thing that I feel like is a slap to my face is that I will have to train the person that got the other Graduate Assistant Help Desk  position and the full time one that I was passed for. 


My boss just recently and casually stated to me that we should really meet to get this wiki rolling. I am really at a loss on what to do. I think this wiki is a great idea, but it requires a lot of work and coding. The wiki will have to be maintained by someone that knows PHP, HTML, Javascript and I do not foresee anyone with these skills applying for this job nor any job at the University in the future so I have a feeling that the wiki will stop with me. I also do not want to do this as I feel like I have been burned badly and I have enough completing my duties as is but I told them I would do it. It would be one thing my efforts were appreciated but it doesn't seem like anyone cares(the VP doesn't even call me by name). I really don't know what to do or how to go about this or even if I am allowed to feel this way. I plan on graduating in December but I don't know how much longer I can hold up or if I am up to completing my request. "

anyway my current job has legit NO IDEA this is coming. They want to hire me full time and go on and on about how I'm such an asset blah blah. They even bought be presents for my graduation and threw me a party.... I feel bad. 

I guess the main issue is however, they have an audit coming up EXACTLY what I was hired to do and my bosses are going to be gone during a conference at the time. I could hypothetically leave before and screw them over but my industry is pretty small and I don't want to burn bridges already. I like the person who would be stuck doing it to and I don't want to do that to him. 

I'm not sure really what the point of this is. But I'm sooooo nervous for some reason. I think I'm just going to email them. Hopefully they are just happy I am willing to stay and help them out.

I have around a month or so of free break outside of my non-tech internship, and want to ask if I could work on a project as a low/no cost intern for the sake of getting experience, and because I think it would help me better understand if I want to go into software engineering. 

Not really sure if this is proper etiquette though, because I don't know it would just be impossible to work on anything remotely helpful for them in the span of a month. Upperclassmen at my school who had big 4 internships told me that the material I've finished is enough to get me through the typical coding interview, so I think I would be qualified in that sense, but I know I'd be asking for something unusual and don't know if it would be negatively received?

---

I had the obvious crisis any civilized person might; for days, I agonized over whether to warn my boss that she was about to be brutally assaulted by my partners in crime. Despite numerous rationalizations, excuses, and mental playbacks of the death of Well-dressed Prick, some part of me knew something would happen this time, too. Somehow or another, she would end up dead if the attack went through. It was a premonition I couldn't shake, and I downed coffee after coffee while debating what to do.

At one time, I had liked and respected her. She'd been incredibly convincing. She was a single mom with five kids, and we'd had a drink after my first office Christmas party. In that late private hour, we'd talked like normal people, she'd told me about her struggles and stress, and I'd believed her. That conversation remained with me as an internal excuse for her behavior for the next several years.

There were constant requests for unpaid overtime, extra work, or favors. I did all of these with a sense of pride, for what man could refuse a woman in such need? It felt like we were a secret team, like I had a responsibility greater than those my coworkers held. Of course, I felt a little weird when a new intern quit because of *all the extra unpaid work.* I hadn't seen any of that, and I wondered: was she asking him for favors, too? Had it somehow been kept secret from me?

My confusion turned to bitter fury when I decided to leave at nine at night instead of staying until my extra work was done. I didn't go home—I visited a few bars she had mentioned over the years. At the fifth and final one, I found her.

I sat in my car and watched through the windows of the place. It was a high class establishment, and she stood laughing with a few girlfriends, a dainty drink in hand. Her dress was form-fitting and fantastic—this was not at all the tired and stressed single mom I'd been sold. It might have been crossing the line, but I knew her address from mail at work, and I drove by her place while she was out. The lights were on and someone was home.

I knocked.

The door swung open a minute later to reveal a haggard thirty-something man and a cluster of screaming and boisterous children. ""Can I help you?""

""Oh, I'm sorry,"" I told him. ""I was looking for Lying Bitch. She told me to bring her some documents for tomorrow's presentation.""

""She's not here,"" he replied with a sigh. ""She's at work until late again.""

I could have told him then, but I didn't think it was my place at the time. Instead I made polite small talk until the truth came out: these were his kids. He had been a single father of five after their mother had died, and Lying Bitch was a supposed *stable and hard-working new wife* that I later noted had come around right after a large life insurance settlement.

Once I knew, her lies unraveled daily. After every single claim she made, I dug a little deeper, and I found that she did literally no work in any area of her life. Her dynasty was an invisible pyramid of secret overtime and personal favors; each man was separated from the others to ensure nobody would ever put two and two together. Her home life was nonexistent; she drank, partied, and went home with strangers under the guise of working late hours to support her new family.

And she utterly despised me once I slowly stopped accepting her requests. Rumors began circulating about me at the office, a promotion passed me over, and I kept ending up in the worst projects. She never said a single word to me directly, and the old me with the wool over his eyes would have just chalked it up to bad luck, but I knew. This woman was a demon of lies that sucked the life out of everyone around her.

But did she deserve to die?

I sat at my desk drinking coffee and going over and over her supposed crimes. Nothing she'd done was illegal in the strictest sense, and I could certainly destroy her life simply by shedding light on her pyramid of lies, but there were consequences to consider. First, that she had no real skills other than manipulation. If her life was torn to shreds, how would she support herself? Would she go through the long and arduous process of self-discovery and learning to stand on her own two feet, or would she just spin a new web? Second, she could likely take me down with her. There would be no hiding my identity if I approached multiple people and clued them in. I might even come off as a strange stalker.

As the days wore on and Tom and Jake observed her and began putting together a plan, I felt the decision slowly being made for me. If I was to spare her this fate, I needed to choose. The day of the planned assault, a direct conversation felt in order.

I entered her office with a binder casually in hand. ""Hey Lying Bitch, mind if we talk?""

""Sure,"" she said with a smile that I knew to be fake, but which was otherwise perfect. ""Sit.""

I sat.

She leaned slightly forward. ""What's up?""

Approaching what was really on my mind in a roundabout way, I said, ""I noticed I've been sort of stagnating where I'm at. My performance reviews have been very good, so I've been wondering if there's anything else I can do to get back on top.""

Sighing, she leaned back against her chair. ""I didn't want to say anything, but you haven't exactly been a team player lately. People are starting to talk about it.""

Suppressing an inner rush of anger, I put on a politely confused face. ""Really? What's the problem? I've done everything officially asked of me.""

""Ah, a real workplace is a bit more than official,"" she explained. ""Official projects are just the minimum to get by. To really be part of the team, you have to take on more than just the minimum.""

I faked my best understanding nod. ""I *was* doing that my first few years here.""

""You were,"" she responded, leaning forward again. ""What changed?""

I couldn't help it. ""When I was working unpaid overtime one night, I went home to get something, and I saw your car at a bar. You were in there drinking.""

To her credit, her face didn't twitch a bit. ""What I do in my personal time is none of your business. I hope that's all you did, or I'll have no qualms about informing HR that you're harassing me.""

""Harassing you?"" My anger mixed with amusement. She was an expert predator in the ecosystem in which she had evolved, but I had a secret advantage. Real violence cut through bullshit red tape and pathetic reputation games. ""Not at all, Lying Bitch. I just happen to know what really goes on here. I've run into other guys doing unpaid overtime—which is against company policy by the way—and I even ran into your husband at the grocery store. Many things you say don't add up.""

Her mask finally fell away, and I saw pure evil there. She stood, came around her desk, and stood above me with flared eyes. ""Fine, dispense with the games. What do you want for your silence? Money? A promotion? Sex?""

I stared up in disgust. ""Seriously?"" I stood very slowly and moved toward her door, though my instincts told me leaving without making a deal was an extremely dangerous idea. The kind of person Lying Bitch truly was seemed to run on amoral manipulation and exchanges. She was rather attractive, but something about *that* option felt objectively wrong. A promotion would have been nice, but that would have just put me deeper under her thumb. ""Money.""

She lifted slightly, relieved in her own special way that I was playing ball. ""How much?""

What number seemed reasonable? ""Ten thousand dollars.""

She didn't flinch. Had my number been perfect, or should I have asked for more? Reaching down, she picked up the phone, and I watched as she faked perfect distress for her husband about a sudden financial need. I could hear his confused hurt and despair on the other side of the phone, but he did agree, and she hung up with a smile. ""You'll have your money tomorrow. I expect you'll keep your mouth shut.""

""I will,"" I said quietly, my decision made.

It was my turn to go to the bar. Inviting out a few colleagues from work, we sat, drank, and commiserated over the endless hours working with little reward under Lying Bitch. None outright revealed what she was doing to each of them; I marveled at how well our culture had trained us to be polite and loyal to the point of self-enslavement. These were decent men; good men. They deserved to be free and treated with respect.

Fancying myself their secret liberator—for, in many ways, I was—I soared high on the power of life and death. I was hilarious, compassionate, and the center of attention. I was no longer beat down, frustrated, and stressed, and they could sense it. Determined to make my positivity infectious, I grew ever more boisterous and over-the-top, and we ended the night by invading a karaoke bar and having the best office outing of all time.

We slunk back into work the next morning exhausted and haggard, for not one of us had gone home. We'd greeted the sunrise at a diner, ate waffles and pancakes, and headed into the office as a caravan of still-drunk fools intent on facing the music together.

But the music never came, and neither did Lying Bitch.

Around noon—after we'd had ample time to up coffee and down painkillers—the regional VP arrived with a grief counselor in tow. It seemed that Lying Bitch had accidentally driven herself over the corner of a nearby bridge on the way home; the VP did not mention that she had been drinking at a bar. It was a tragic accident, the company would make sure to take care of her family, and, most importantly, we all had the day off.

I drifted home and lay on the couch as the hours blurred together. Part of me was triumphant and grinning unseen, but part of me was horrified that I'd been right: the planned beating had instead ended in death a second time. I wasn't going to meet with Tom and Jake for another three weeks, but I knew I would be demanding the full story of what happened from them. How did roughing someone up turn into driving them off a bridge?

At the time, I still felt guilt. That gnawing chill compelled me to return to her husband's house, and I stood at the door and offered my condolences. He gravely accepted them, but he also seemed relieved and rested. Behind him, I saw a nanny taking care of the kids, and I understood: either the company benefits or a second life insurance payout had rescued this family from the hole their embezzling new mother figure had dug underneath them.

Free of guilt, I took my leave. Death had not been a tragedy for anyone in that woman's life. Violence had spiked in out of the wilds of human experience with surgical aim and removed a tumor that had grown on the suffocating structure of rules and customs we'd collectively built in a vain attempt to keep out the dangers of nature. Rather than protection, we had built only a framework for imprisonment and parasites.

There was something bigger in what Tom, Jake, and I were doing. I had to think on it.

The weeks rolled by as I dealt with the intense stress and let it flow out of me.

I was given her old job. After that grand night out, the guys universally threw their support behind me to replace her, and the regional VP couldn't give a shit either way. I was in—and I found it strange that twice death had been rewarded with immediately increased status. This structure we lived in was cold and impersonal to the extreme.

Without the need for the staff to secretly and constantly overwork, our office productivity and morale rose significantly. *Actually doing my job* made it easier for my men to do theirs—what a concept! By the time my meeting with Tom and Jake approached, I had nothing but contempt for the memory of Lying Bitch.

But I still wanted to know what happened.

Beers in hand, we sat at the back of a new hole-in-the-wall bar and Tom explained. ""Well, we caught her outside and alone as planned, but she managed to rip off both our ski masks. Once she saw our faces, we knew we were in trouble, and she was a vicious biter. One thing led to another, and she got knocked out pretty hard. Jake said we had to get rid of her since she'd seen our faces, and we came up with the plan to drive her off the bridge. We didn't want to do it—it just got out of hand.""

It made sense, at least in our already-twisted perspectives. Jake simply nodded along to this explanation, his expression neutral. I watched his face as Tom spoke, but not a single reaction was evident. At that point, I was beginning to suspect something darker—but I was still enamored of our new strength.

It was also our turn to assault Jake's boss. The quiet and calm threat in our companion's eyes brooked no argument. It was up to Tom and I to make it happen, and I honestly thought I would have the chance to make this third attack *not* end in murder.

I also honestly thought it would be the last.

1. I understand GPA is a big thing anywhere. And that's being fixed currently and will be above a 3.0 by next autumn. 

2. I also know companies like clubs. So I already am in one right now and will do the design team this fall. 


Ok. Now that were aquatinted. I'm from Ohio. However, due to preferences would want to work at the west coast (but am going to apply for internships and later jobs nation wide). I'm a freshman going into Sophomore year and want to cement an internship there (or anywhere for the matter) for next summer. But I don't know how these things work. So here are my questions.


1. I know that some engineering fields require the PE exam for some jobs. How does that work for Mechanical and does it differ by state? 

2. Are certain companies ok with hiring interns from different states? If they do what happens to housing? 

3. Which companies are best for these types of interns? (Any thing around the west -specifically the Seattle area- or just in general is cool). 

4. Any tips in general about co-ops/ internships you might like to add. 


*I think I did a good job fixing the mess that was the other thread. Thanks the /u/dusttheking who still replied advice to it anyway. And /u/BadChicken47 for telling me it doesn't make sense. For it did in my head and I would have just went with it.*"

4l2pzv,5,2016-05-25,What do you do with a small sinkhole?,LordLightning,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/4l2pzv/what_do_you_do_with_a_small_sinkhole/,"So in ~October, while I was at college, my mother found a sinkhole about 10-12 feet from our deck. She covered it up with a rock so no one would fall into it. She and my brother didn't think it was necessary to tell me or my father, so today while mowing the lawn, we came upon it.

The hole itself is about eight inches in diameter at the surface and a foot and a half in diameter at the final depth. It's a foot to a foot and a half deep. The hole is about forty to fifty feet away from the creek that runs around our property. My dad's insurance company doesn't care about it since it's still small after seven months.

What I thought we should do is just plug up the hole with concrete and then come back to it in a couple months in case the weight of the concrete compresses the voids left in the soil, then fill it up with some more concrete.

My dad thinks we should just fill it up with soil and then create an artificial grading with a dense grass surface, so the the groundwater travels over this new surface down to the creek, rather than going through the ground and causing more erosion.

His other (more expensive) idea is to dig up the hole or use colored water to figure where it's draining. Then he wants to plug the drain up with concrete and fill the hole with dirt.

Are any of these ideas a good solution or is there something else that we should do? I'm starting my internship in a week and a half, so he'd like to get this fixed by then."

I'm not sure how much you all care for stories, but you're gonna get one if you keep reading.  If you just want to see my potential build and don't care for the story, just skip to the end. 

So I'll start by admitting that I am a console owner, hardcore Xbox 360 mostly.  I do not however believe that I am, nor ever have been, a peasant.  I've always known that PCs are superior, it was just the knowledge, price, and social barrier that prevented me from going PC.  Price barrier because to me, $400-500 all at once seemed out of my price range, even though it really wasn't.  

Fast forward to today.  I'm now a 19 year old out of his first year of college and I even scored an internship.  I'm studying electrical engineering and I've been thinking for a while of building my own PC.  

Something I've always prided myself on is buying smartly and long-term.  So, with the help of a very techy friend and a near blank check (lets call him Gabe) I cobbled together the parts list for a super gaming PC for under $2,000

Now I see the majority of you rolling your eyes and some of you even screaming at your monitors.  Let me explain my price range.  

Here's how I see it:  I could piece together a mid-range gaming PC for $400-500 or even a pretty good one for ~$700, but I feel like such a device would only be good for ultra (graphics that is) gaming for a few years, maybe 3 or so.  My philosophy is since I have a job and can easily foot the bill, I can bite the bullet now and shell out a good chunk of cash and get an ultra system that will hold its power into the foreseeable future, my thought is at least 5-6+ years.  After that, the computer could still easily hold its own as a powerful home PC that I could use as a general desktop or even serve for my house, if the need arises.  

At the same time however, I'm very scared to spend so much money at once on a new project.  I've owned a Surface 3 for a year now and I really like PC gaming and I've been a PC gamer casually for about as long as I've been a console gamer.

-------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr: I'm confused how to get into the graphically impressive high end of PC gaming and I think my build may be too expensive, even for an ultra-high end gaming computer

4l3knk,7,2016-05-26,Several weeks ago I accepted a QA role over a dev role as my first software job. Now I'm having second thoughts. What should I do?,zen_code_monkey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4l3knk/several_weeks_ago_i_accepted_a_qa_role_over_a_dev/,"Several weeks ago, I finished my one and only internship which was at a university working on a small internal web application. I worked largely alone, as it was a project they reserved for mostly student interns. After my internship ended, I really wasn’t sure what to expect going into the job market as I had very little experience in the IT industry. I had two offers around the same time – a software dev role working on a web application and a QA position. After thinking about it for a really long time, I chose the QA position because I was told that it would be mostly writing automation scripts and building testing frameworks. Also, I really liked the team and the environment.  
Several weeks later, it honestly looks like at least 75% of my job will consist of manual black box testing. 
I’m not whining about doing grunt work. The problem is that I feel like my skills are going to deteriorate if I’m constantly doing nothing but clicking buttons and sending emails. I eventually want to be a good software engineer, architect, startup founder, etc.  
I do take part of the blame for being in this predicament, since I should have known what a QA role entails. That being said, I was under the impression I’d be doing a lot more programming. 
I’m debating between toughing it out for a year so at least I have some experience to put down on my resume, versus looking for a new job ASAP. Obviously, I’m aware of how difficult it’s going to be to explain why I'm leaving my first software role but it’s not impossible and I have the luxury of time since I’m still employed. 

**Reasons to leave:** 

* I don’t waste a year doing something I don’t enjoy as much. I could actually be programming and building my skills. This, to me, is super important. 

* I don’t get “pigeonholed” into QA roles for the rest of my career. If I leave in a few years, I might be back at square one as a junior dev

**Reasons to stay for about a year:** 

* Leaving first software job after a couple of months looks terrible. I’m going to feel like I’ve failed. 

* I’ve only been here for a few weeks, and who knows, it might get better. I might have more time to actually write automation code. 

* I actually have something to put on my resume instead, well, nothing. 
HALP. What should I do??

4l3njh,1,2016-05-26,Don't Look Behind You,fuckingunapologetic,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4l3njh/dont_look_behind_you/,"I'm going out of the state for the summer for an internship, meaning I won't see my friends at all. Mainly my best friend J. So we decided to go on a road trip the weekend after our last day of school. She recently got a car and so did I for my 18th birthday. It was a little old but I'd take whatever I can get. 

We decided to take seperate cars because, we both just got it and were pretty excited to drive. It was stupid I know but I really love being on the wheel and so does she so we figured we just take seperate cars. Looking back, I wish we just stayed in one car. 

So we start driving, I'm following J obviously because she had the gps. We were going out into the country to look for barns and stuff. We were really into horse back riding. I don't even know where were exactly going. All I know is she knows the way and I'm just following behind her. I'm just talking to her on the phone on my lap. 

It was getting dark, probably about 9:30pm. She said the gps is fucking up and it's not working. Like it's not showing her the roads and stuff anymore. I figured the gps hasn't been updated, that's what happens to my dad when we go on trips. The gps doesn't get updated so it doesnt know the certain roads or some shit, so we get lost a lot. (or maybe no signal?) That's exactly what's happening right now. 

We get on a sort of isolated road, kind of like a dirt road with trees and shit to the right and left of it. I don't know how we got from the highway to the forest. Now were actually lost. 

""Okay seriously you're not allowed to plan trips anymore look at where we are"" 

I say through the phone and she says sorry and to just keep following her. 

""This gps is dumb nothing is showing wheres the roads""

Ugh. We keep driving and we joke about the whole situation. It's actually nice driving through this area, it's quiet and were literally the only people here. We talk over the phone, its about 10 now and still no highway or anything. I notice my gas is on empty, fuck.

""Do you still have gas because mine is empty now."" I tell her on the phone, seriously this is annoying now wtf.

""That's your fault you didn't get gas before we left""

Well she didn't tell me it was going to take us hours and that we were gonna get lost. She tells me to get off and get in her car and we'll just get mine towed. I get out my car and she starts driving away. Seriously. 

""Bitch stop playing its scary out here.""

I say over the phone. She laughs and she gets out the car. She's fairly far away from me but close enough to where I can still see her. She has always been a jokester but this is not the time to play around. 

""Come on hurry!""

I start walking towards her and flash my middle finger. Seriously she plays too much. 

""Run you're taking too long.""

""No you the one who decided to drive away so you gonna have to wait I'm tired""

I say to her and I walk slower to mess with her. I'm still talking to her on the phone and also yelling out my words. We laugh and talk as I'm walking up to her and she suddenly gets quiet and froze. 

I ask her what's wrong and shit, and she just stares at me. This is getting kinda creepy now. 

""Seriously what's wrong what are you looking at?""

I say on the phone and she is just silent. Then I hear footsteps behind me, I was just about to turn around when J says to me on the phone

""Dont turn around, dont fucking turn around just keep walking. Walk normally.""

That's when I realize she wasn't looking at me, she was lookig just behind me. Somebody was following me. And the hairs on my body stood up. J tells me to keep talking and act like nothing's happening so I try my best to be all loud and shit and laughing and all that. 

""Haha yeah haha you so funny""

We basically pretend like we didn't notice whoever was following me. I'm still listening to whoever was behind me and all of a sudden I hear knives being rubbed together. You know like how chefs do when they have two knives they slice it together kinda sharpening it. (sorry I'm not good at describing things) 

We continue acting through the situation and J tells me on the phone:

""Just to let you know, there are four people behind you, about 5 steps behind with big ass knives. Two guys and two girls. I'm going to open the passenger side of the car and I will get in the car and watch on the rear view mirror. When I say go, run okay. Don't look behind you just run.""

I'm having goosebumps at this point. literally shaking with fear. I try my best to sound cheerful and all, I'm close to the car anyway. J gets in the car and opens the passenger side. I walk a little faster and I hear the steps behind me become faster too. 

I'm not the smartest cookie but I think it's safe to say that these psycho's behind me already knows that I know they're behind me. J starts counting...

""1,2, ready okay run. 3!""

I RAAAAAN. I DIDNT EVEN SCREAM OR SAY ANYTHING I JUST RAN AS FAST AS I CAN ALL I CAN THINJ ABOUT IS JUMP IN THAT FUCKING CAR AND GET THE FUUUCK OUT OF THERE. THE MURDERERS BEHIND ME (yes murderers what else can they be) RUN AFTER ME TOO AND THEY SCREAM A HIGH OITCHED SCREAM I SWEAR THEY SOUND LIKE FUCKING BATS. I MAKE IT TO THE CAR I JUMP INTO THE SEAT AND SLAM MY FACE INTO J's SHOULDER AND SHE HITS THE GAS. I look back and I see one of the four hopelessly throw the knife on the ground. 

We were both crying at this point. I thanked her for everything, if she let me turn the fuck around I'd be dead right now. She truly is the best friend ever. We drive to the gas station we see and told the guard at the store what just happened and he said he'll handle it. 

That shit is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me ever! Wtf. 

Thank you J for not leaving me! 
(seriously though she could've got in the car and bolted out of there but instead she saved me. true friend.) 
(my car got towed the following day. the cops said they never saw anyone but did see several foot prints on the side of the road that's muddy. my car has a big scratch on the side of it.)"

I will be a sophomore this upcoming fall.  Right now, I am majoring in Philosophy and minoring in Democracy and Justice Studies (sort of like PoliSci).  My initial plan was to graduate in three years, move onto law school, and after that, grad school.  Right now, I'm split between two career paths: lawyer (prosecutor) or professor (philosophy).  

The other major I'm looking at is Creative Writing.  Hear me out.  I already have 2 out of the 12 required courses under my belt.  I'm looking at the rest of the courses, and I can seriously see myself enjoying each of them and succeeding in them.  I also figure that because I need extra classes to fulfill the 120 credit graduation requirement, why not just go for another major that would also help me in my many future years of schooling?  It would also be nice to stay an extra year and make more memories and experiences with my friends or maybe studying abroad; professionally, jobs and internships that could give me recommendations.  And of course I love and am pretty talented at reading and writing (otherwise I probably shouldn't be majoring in Philosophy in the first place lol).    

Please note that money is not necessarily a problem if the extra year really helps me and my chances at law/grad school, but it would obviously be nice to save a year's tuition/housing :) 

So should I graduate early in Philosophy or graduate in four years in Philosophy and Creative Writing?

I'm beginning to study for my GRE's so I can take it this Septemeber. I'm currently a computer engineering major with internship (networking) and research experience. I'll be graduating this upcoming Dec 2016. I want to apply to apply to Cornell's MS Systems Engineering (Online) program as well as Columbia's CVN program for their Industrial Engineering (System's Engineering Concentration) degree. 

I've submitted a post already in /r/GRE about studying for the GRE, but my main questions center around my chances for acceptance. I'll have a 3.38 before entering this Fall Semester, but I'm confident after a course retake, I'll be at a 3.48 when I'm done with next semester. 

However, if I apply to Cornell or Columbia in the Fall, I'll be submitting my application with a 3.38. Columbia has rolling admissions so should I wait until after my semester finishes and my hopefully increased GPA?

I know my first concern should be doing well on the GRE and although its intimidating right now, I'm going to put the time and effort in studying and doing well. Both these programs would be amazing for me as I do attend a public state university.

So my questions are:

1. Should I wait to apply after my GPA increase
2. What are my chances to getting into these programs if I submit my application with the lower GPA. 
3. Any GRE tips? Resources you recommend?

Any feedback or insight is greatly appreciated. I'm grateful there's a Reddit community for these types of things. As I mentioned in a previous post on r/GRE, many of my friends aren't going to grad school so I don't have many people to ask for advice. "
4l3w5m,74,2016-05-26,Old printer versus flash drive.,Rockeye_,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4l3w5m/old_printer_versus_flash_drive/,"First post. I signed up to Reddit to post this because it's the first TFTS-worthy story I've experienced since I found this sub. 

In our office there's this one somewhat old and cheap multi-function printer that is clearly not sufficient for the jobs we use it for. This one poor intern has to stand over it methodically laying down page after page of what look to me like scribbles and doodles and waiting 15-20 seconds for each page to scan whenever $Manager wants one of his sets of handwritten meeting notes digitized. He always has his phone out during this 'workflow' so maybe not 'poor intern' though.

Luckily I don't get bothered about printers very often. But when the intern's ""workflow"" suddenly failed, I was the closest thing to pass for tech support available. Here we go.

&gt; $Boss: ""$Rockeye, help $Intern with the printer. It's acting up again.""    
&gt; $Intern: ""It was working yesterday, I'm doing it the same way. Don't know what's wrong.""    
&gt; $Me: $Okay, well, what's the error code?    
&gt; $Intern: ""Kay, lemme do it again."" *Plugs in flash drive. Hits scan. Printer beeps irately.* ""[Some error code].""

I find the manual, luckily available on the internet, look through and the ever so descriptive cause listed for the code is 'Bad USB device.' Simple enough.

&gt; $Me: ""That error code means the flash drive is bad, according to the manual.""    
&gt; $Intern: ""What, that's impossible, I've been using this flash drive for months and it's never given me trouble. It's still working on the computers too.""    
&gt; $Me: ""Well, let's try it on my laptop...""

Troubleshooting ensues. The flash drive works with all manner of things it's supposed to work on. The USB pins aren't bent out of shape nor corroded at all as far as I can tell. I try using a different flash drive in the printer and BEEP! Same error code.

At this point I'm thinking the printer might have finally developed another irreversible 'idiosyncrasy,' and finally one that will convince $Boss to toss it. But I know he'll be sore if I don't try a little harder. So I check for driver updates (none), try a few more borrowed flash drives (which all give the same error), do some online research that doesn't turn up anything.

I make the report to $Boss that we're just going to have to deal with it and he gets in a huff about how he needs those meeting notes darn it. I propose a new printer. He tells me to find one that has good reviews and X and Y features and order it by end of day, get expedited shipping, the company will pay me back. (I got that in writing, learned from the best.)

I do some more research, wanting to make the most of the opportunity, but I also had a sort of morbid curiosity about the old one, so I kept looking at that too. I eventually found that flash drive file systems sometimes disagree with certain older printers now that they're not necessarily all using the same file system as a decade ago.

I call $Intern and ask if he happened to click a button labelled 'format' when using that drive.

&gt; $Intern: ""Uh, no, it's brand new.""    
&gt; $Me: ""Wait, I thought you said you've been using it for months and you've never had any trouble?""    
&gt; $Intern: ""No, this one's new, the 8 gig one wasn't enough for all the files $Boss wants on here anymore.""

This flash drive has a shiny '16GB' label. I give him a look but I know he won't take the lesson that 'bought yesterday' is not 'had it for months' so I don't bother saying it.

&gt; $Me: ""Well, let me reformat it, see if that's the problem.""    
&gt; $Intern: ""What?! Isn't reformatting, like, wiping it clean?""    
&gt; $Me: ""Yeah, but I'll back everything up first, don't worry.""

So I do some other work while waiting for nine point something gigs of $Boss's ever-growing archive of miscellany to copy over, then reformat the USB drive to exFAT.

It doesn't work. So I revert the flash drive to factory settings and start copying all the junk back onto it. I order the new printer. I get the company check for it as promised. I got the task of setting it up including SMTP etc, which took maybe half an hour, and giving tutorials for basic tasks to everyone, which didn't.

$Intern comes up to me a few days later rather confused, saying the old flash drive *still works* on the old printer. I check the formatting... Factory default already. I'm about to give up and put it out of my head forever, when I notice the shiny red '8GB'...

I ask around the office for another eight gig flash drive to borrow, find one, and lo and behold *that* works with the old printer too.

I'm still confused for a while longer but eventually realize that the 8GB drive was formatted in FAT32, not exFAT, ~~since eight gigs is the maximum size allowed by FAT32~~ maybe because it was older, or some other arbitrary manufacturer decision. And the old printer was choking because it refused to recognize the exFAT format. 

I never did figure out the strange faint horizontal lines that only appeared on documents printed between 3:30 and 3:45 or so, though.


TL;DR ""Bad USB drive"" is just too big for an old printer to handle.

Edited no less than ~~four~~ ~~eight~~ eleven times for formatting, spelling, misplaced words, grammar."

4l433u,42,2016-05-26,TIFU by teasing my mentor for his Canadian terminology,coozin,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4l433u/tifu_by_teasing_my_mentor_for_his_canadian/,"This actually happened about a year ago while I was an intern at a big international IT company. 

All the interns were assigned to a different mentor and I got put with a guy from the IT department since it was my major. He was probably the most depressed mentor in the company and would constantly whine about the lack of windows and red tape (totally justified but he's been there 15 years). 

After about three weeks of working together I noticed that he referred to cupcakes as ""muffins"" for like the third time. I was feeling a little loose (as much as you can in a company that requires a 7 year background check) because it was casual Friday. In a desperate attempt to take a break from his depression and IT architecture planning I blurted out, ""Can Canadians distinguish between muffins and cupcakes?!"" His reaction was pretty neutral and it's hard to read the emotions of really analytical people in general.

Come Monday morning he sets up a meeting for 9am. Our first surprise topic of discussion: do I have a problem with people of other nationalities. 

Needless to say our working relationship was awkward after that. After my ten weeks I did not receive a letter of recommendation despite being a reliable employee and embracing the corporate culture.  

Just to clarify: I'm not some racist, nationalist who makes fun of friendly neighboring countries that more or less have the same culture. 

Edit for further clarification: I never confirmed with 100% certainty it was a cultural thing. I asked my neighbors who were from Canada shortly after this event. The husband answered very ecstatically, ""yes! my mother does the same thing."" Of course this is anecdotal evidence and does not prove my theory. I kinda rolled the dice and was hoping the good reddit community would confirm my previous theory.  "
4l4hg8,6,2016-05-26,"Hi Reddit Developers, I'm burning out (fast) in CS courses at university. What should I do to keep pace with the CS industry?",HuyTranQ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4l4hg8/hi_reddit_developers_im_burning_out_fast_in_cs/,"Don't get me wrong, I still really love CS and want to be coding every day. Every thing is still smooth (I have GPA of 3.85 / 4 and next week, I'm going to be a Google intern in London, UK).

However, I'm burning out, especially, in the university part.

I'm a senior student of a university (well-known in my country but unknown to the rest of the world). There are some big problems with courses here. I don't like them anymore:

1. Teachers only attend classes to do their jobs and talk all day that nobody would listen to him/her. They don't care about the quality of their lectures. They just google some presentation slides and change the names of the lecturers and turn them into their own. They don't nurture their English communication neither so the accent is so awful that I can barely understand (English is not our mother tongue language). Furthermore, the final exam can include a section of 40% but that section is taught by nearly up to 10% duration of the course with a fast pace. 

2. (Nearly) Everybody cheats. I'll say again: Most of the students cheat in the exams. They can go to the toilet and use their smartphones to search and then go back. Some subjects allow laptop (but not communication) but in the end, they use Google Docs to list all answers for everyone during the exams. 

I'm exhausted due to lack of motivation and competition in courses at university. I may have failed 2 courses from the last semester due to this problem. My GPA may be down fast at this point. However, I just stop caring about fairness and GPA. All I care about is that I'm 21, I'm still young, I need to learn more, I need to do fast. I cannot burn out at this stage.

What should I do? A side project that helps me learning new things? A new part-time job to involve as much as I can in the software industry? Learning a course on coursera, udemy, edx? What to do to forget about those things in university and keep moving forward?"

But I want to start working anyway.,CSDumbling,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4l4rw2/4_years_at_university_no_degree_but_i_want_to/,"Just completed my fourth year at a top 5/10 school. I will probably need another year to finish my degree, though I have only a few classes left to take, with only one or two required to be CS. 

But holy shit, has the course load been punishing. I also have a knack for biting off more than I can chew, and it's gotten me into academic trouble once already. Lately I've gotten so upset with failure that I just give up and spiral into a depression. I let my stress and anxiety get the better of me this semester, and may have put my standing in the major at jeopardy. I feel like if I can't get a handle on my anxiety I'm not going to be able to get through another year. 

So I want to take a break from school, for a year or forever, and find work instead. Of course, my gpa is low, I have had no internships, and I have never been super connected to my professors or my peers (cause I suck so bad, haha). About the only thing I have going for me are personal and class projects. 

I realize there isn't much separating my situation from typical ""low gpa, no internships, halp"" posts (and I've read them, they're super helpful), except for that fact my graduation feels drawn out and indefinite. I sometimes worry I will not ever finish my degree, and wonder if I can start a career without one. 

What are my options? What are the employment prospects for someone who almost but didn't quite get a BS? Have these four years been a waste? I've learned a lot, I love CS, but maybe taking it at this institution was at a level too high for me to really keep up with. "

4l6mb6,2,2016-05-26,Second Degree in Canada: BCS at UBC or BA at UofT?,uoftvsubc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4l6mb6/second_degree_in_canada_bcs_at_ubc_or_ba_at_uoft/,"I've just graduated with a BSc in Life Science from the University of Toronto, but I'm planning on getting a second degree in CS. My goal is to eventually work as a software engineer in the US at a medium-to-large tech company. 

I have two options available to me:

1.  **BA at the University of Toronto**. UofT won't let me do another BSc, so if I stay I have to do a BA. I can still take CS and graduate with a BA, I just have to complete what amounts to a minor in an Arts field (probably going to be economics). I would still be take all the same courses as a regular CS graduate.
2. **BCS at the University of British Columbia**. This one is a dedicated second degree program, rather than a fresh degree. I'd only have to take a few courses outside of CS/math/stats.

My main concerns are as follows:

1.  **Living at home vs away**. I'm from Toronto, I currently live at home with family. If I stay at UofT, I'd continue to live at home. I kind of long to leave home and move out... but I also realize how convenient I have it here. Food, laundry, rent - everything is taken care of for me right now. It wouldn't be exciting, but focusing on school and side projects would be so much easier were I to stay at home. Not to mention, Vancouver is very far from Toronto, and flights are expensive. I wouldn't be able to visit home very frequently.
2. **The BA instead of a BSc**. I've read all the threads on this and the consensus seems to be that it either doesn't matter or it matters very little. I'd like to think it doesn't matter for me since I already have a BSc and I'd be taking the same courses as a BSc student anyways. But I'm not keen on having to take a bunch of arts courses, enough to get an arts minor. I'm also a little concerned about how it will look to future employers if I have a bunch of arts courses on my transcript.
3. **Familiarity**. I've been at UofT for five years, I've become really familiar with how the university works. From all the administrative stuff like course management, registration, fee payment, exams etc. to more mundane things like where all the building are. Plus, all my friends and my (limited) connections are here. Leaving feels like giving up home-field advantage.
4. **Adventure**. I've been at UofT for *five years*. I've lived in Toronto all my life. And I haven't been able to travel all that much. I'd like a change of scenery, and Vancouver sounds wonderful. I've also never lived on my own, and I think I'd like to finally have that experience.
5. **Co-op**. UBC seems to have a better co-op office than UofT. Their co-op program arranges 4-month internships in the US and Canada. At UofT, we have this strange 12-16 month internship program. Internships tend to be from local or Canadian companies, as I don't think US companies will hire interns for that long. Summer internships in the US are self-arranged.
6. **Course credit**. I've taken a bunch of CS/math/stats courses at UofT during my first degree, to the point where I'm 2 courses away from finishing second-year CS. If I stay at UofT, these will all still count towards my second degree and in the fall I'd be taking 2nd and 3rd year CS courses. If I go to UBC, I think I'd get exemptions for some courses, but I'd still be starting at around a 1st/2nd year level.

There's probably more, but that's enough for now. 

Surprisingly, money is not a factor as they will end up costing the same amount (tuition at UBC is less than half of the tuition at UofT). Neither is time - with co-op, both will take around 3 years. The prestige and reputation of each University also seems to be fairly equal, both are the best in Canada after Waterloo. UofT tends to rank higher, but UBC is always second, and those rankings typically don't reflect the quality of the undergraduate program anyways.

I'd appreciate any thoughts or input, especially from CS graduates of either university working in the US. I should be glad to have two options like this, but I'm feeling more overwhelmed than happy. Writing this out has been a great exercise to get my thoughts in order."

I'm a summer intern at a state agency and my duty is to produce a catalogue of contaminated properties in several counties in my state. I am creating this catalogue in ArcGIS Desktop, but the end product needs to be published on ArcGIS Online. As a college student, I am accustomed to working in ArcGIS desktop with shapefiles in my classes. So far, I am working with shapefiles for the state counties (polygons) and shapefiles of the various types of contamination (points). I have noticed that many types of data that are available from ArcGIS Online (as well as other data websites) are in layer format, not shapefile (such as state hydrological data). Is it fine to work with feature layer files instead of shapefiles? I have looked this up and I'm not finding a clear answer about the difference. My second question is about the interaction between ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Online. How should I transition my final product from the desktop setting to the online setting? I know that ArcGIS Online uses base maps, but my project so far has been based on the geographies I downloaded from the Census Bureau (TIGER/Line).

I realize that my questions are probably rudimentary. I'm still learning the basics of GIS. Thank you for any help."

I am currently studying Finance there, and was recently accepted into a program that lets me go abroad to England and get a degree from the university over there as well. On top of that my final semester there would be an internship, in London most likely. The second degree would be in International Business. 

My other option is to transfer to a better state school, nationally ranked but very very low. There I would still get a degree in Finance, but I would minor in stats. 


So those are the options, what are your opinions, which one is better for the long term career in Finance?

GPA: 4.0 from PAC school, ok rep, STEM Management

GMAT: 690

https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4cjoy8/round_3_for_schools_2030/d1jky6h

**Offer 1: (Decision due tomorrow) Wisconsin-Madison (#27-tie US News)**

Full tuition grant for 1st year, assurances that I'll have a good shot at TA in second year which would pay for tuition + living costs.  Places well in tech, good job capture and internship rates, some interesting companies to work for.  Really cool curriculum and ranked the best ROI for MBAs by US News again.  They have been super engaging and have done a really great job getting my loyalty.

**Offer #2: (Due 06/01/2016) Washington University in St Louis - Olin (#21)**

$40k total off cost, after this I would end up about $146k in debt based on expected costs from their website (so likely larger).  I love the idea of St. Louis as its getting some startup attention/silicon prarie feel.  Just really pricey.  Job placement in tech seems similar to Wisc-Mad

**Offer #3: (Due 06/16/2016) - Vanderbilt (#22 tie)**

Offered me $30k total, puts it similar in cost to Olin as St Louis is way cheaper than Nashville from what I can see.  I'm from the south so Vandy is a household name.  Great tech placement, great specialization in corp responsibility/sustainability.  Would still be in around $140k debt after all said and done.  They offered to increase (basically double) my offer if I retake the GMAT and get a 730 or better. 


I'm really leaning towards Wisc.  They have been super cool, the program sounds great, Badgers are insanely loyal/jazzed about their school (I have several colleagues that did their undergrad there).  The reduced risk with what appears to be no real loss of job placement possibility is definitely enticing considering how little debt I might end up with.

The notion of the self-made man is a myth.

For years, I thought that if I worked hard enough I would succeed. In college, I thought that if I didn’t click with someone, it was OK to stop talking to them. I thought that if someone doubted me, it was OK to burn the bridge. I thought that if I was owed a favor, it was OK to cash in and then check out of the relationship.

After all, I was going to succeed…. no matter what.

If you think your intelligence, determination, or iron resolve will make you succeed, I empathize with you. If you believe you can make it on your own, I feel sorry for you…. because you’re taking the stairs to the penthouse when there is an elevator just behind the double doors.

Long before Dale Carnegie wrote How to Win Friends and Influence People, long before Keith Ferrazzi and Tahl Raz transformed the networking landscape with Never Eat Alone, people were leveraging relationships to get ahead.

Robert Kiyosaki once said, “If you want to go somewhere, it’s best to find someone who has already been there.”

In any field, your success largely depends on your ability to build and maintain relationships. In this article I am going to teach you how to do both. But first, let me paint a picture.

Two students are graduating college,

Student A is really smart, gifted with incredible resources, and great at making friends. However, he is also very entitled. He thinks that the world is his oyster, and because he believes he can build new relationships whenever he wants, he doesn’t bother to maintain them.

Student B is of average intelligence, doesn’t have nearly as many resources as Student A, but is just as good at making friends. The key difference between the two is that Student B, unlike Student A, would rather sever a limb than sever a connection. As a result, Student B has become a master at maintaining relationships.

Who has more resources in post grad life? Who has an easier time finding a job?

Student B.

I know this because I was Student A, and one of my best friends, James, was Student B. James was an expert at staying on good terms with people. Growing up my friends and I would make fun of him for messing with someone one day and the next day being their best friend. We laughed when he would get in scuffle with some poor kid, and then the next day stick up for them. We harassed him for never wanting to burn a bridge.

Little did I know, it was one of his greatest strengths. His ability to look for the good in everyone, to maintain relationships no matter the circumstance was an invaluable trait. You are only as strong as your network.

Many times, we see relationships as expendable. If there isn’t that instant connection, it is time to move on. It is in moments like these that we can learn from my childhood friend, James.

The aptitude for maintaining relationships is just as important as the propensity for building them.

Over the last year, I learned this by going from a state of having no mentors, zero friends with similar interests and goals, to connecting with some of the most successful people in my field and linking up with likeminded colleagues all around me.

So without further ado, let’s dive into how to become a networking guru.

Building Relationships:

The first step to building relationships is to have the willingness to reach out. It is safe to assume, that the people that you most likely wish to network and connect with have already built their own solid network. Needless to say, they aren’t going to be coming to you, so you have to reach out and connect with them. You can do that through a networking event, an email, or even a phone call, but you already know that.

What you may not know is that in order to infiltrate the network of a well-established figure within your field, you have to show up with something to offer. Growing up, one thing my older cousin would continuously stress was that you should, “always bring something to the table.”

Now it’s easy to assume that there isn’t much that you can offer to someone who is already more successful and connected than you, however, that couldn’t be further from the truth. If you are struggling to identify what you could bring to the table of someone who already has more than you, I recommend you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B7u7zF2qmo). In it, I chat with Dougie Forlano, “The Millionaire Mentee,” revealing how he built a vast network of high profile mentors out of nothing, simply by bringing value to everyone he met.

Often the best way to go about connecting to a well established figure, is finding “an in.” Ask family, friends, friends of friends, if they know anyone who might have relationship with the person you are seeking to connect or network with. It is always better to get introduced by someone than to come out of nowhere with a random proposal/introduction.

If you do find someone who knows the person you are seeking to connect or network with, when you contact them, make sure to put that person’s name in the subject of your email or at the beginning of any message that you send them. At the end, be sure to mention what you are bringing to the table. It better be more than your good looks or hard work.

One thing to remember when you are reaching out to new people is to not be afraid to be persistent. Sometimes you won’t reach your person of interest on the first go-around. If that is the case, don’t hesitate to contact them again. Sometimes emails get lost, phone calls get ignored, or people get caught up in something and forget to respond. As long as you’re coming from a place where you are offering value, your person of interest should welcome a conversation. Not to mention, successful people usually respect persistence, because it’s a characteristic they most likely have also channeled throughout previous ventures.

If they still don’t respond, don’t sweat it. Move on and don’t hold any bad blood. There is always the opportunity that you can connect down the road. However, that opportunity won’t be there if you get “too persistent.”

If you want to connect with someone on your level, which I recommend you do before you even reach for mentors, I would suggest the principle of going first. In hypnosis, going first means putting yourself in the shoes of someone experiencing an emotion or incident before you articulate it. Here I use the term to suggest you first become interested in another person, before you expect them to become interested in you. Interest breeds interest.

In my own life, I found that I often connect with people best when I am in scenario where I need to make friends. For example, when I go on a vacation, or when I first went to college, I noticed I would build relationships much more quickly. The reason why is because when you enter a new atmosphere things are unstable. The need to build a network for the purpose of familiarity and security inspires interest. You begin to emotionally invest in other people and cultivate a desire to understand how their personal qualities, goals, and desires align with your own.

When you become interested in another person, they become interested in you. By showing genuine interest, you offer others something we all value: a feeling of significance.

By connecting with people who share your interests and goals, you expedite your ability to achieve those goals. As Jim Rohn says, “You are the average of the 5 people you spend time around the most.”

Human beings are like sponges. We absorb the quality of everything from the foods we eat to the company we keep. Surround yourself with people who want accomplish what you do, and you will learn from each other’s successes and failures. Sooner or later, you will all be closer to your goals by working together than you would be separately. Create a mastermind group if you must.

One bonus tip I would offer is to adapt. Don’t treat everyone the same, and don’t behave in the same way with everyone you meet. Endless research shows that your ability to connect with other people depends on your ability to relate to them. If you are speaking with someone who uses very proper language and mannerisms, make sure you follow that etiquette. Conversely, if you are speaking with someone who swears and speaks much more casually, feel free to do that as well.

There are loads of unconscious techniques you can use to better connect with other people. If you are interested in exploring these techniques further, I recommend you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kpl_MEoWLg) on the three psychological tips that help you connect with anyone.

Now that you have learned how to build relationships, it is time to learn how to maintain them. This is much easier because many of the principles essential to maintaining relationships have been previously expressed above. However, there are some key things you need to pick up

Maintaining Relationships:

Relationship maintenance is an art form.

Contrary to popular belief, it is not simply a matter of checking in on people now and again. In fact, persistent contact in a relationship can get annoying if it isn’t going anywhere. If you hound people with messages out of fear of losing a connection you might actually make people feel like you are using them. The last thing you want is for them to feel like you are just maintaining the relationship so you can cash in a favor when you need it.

Instead, it is best to communicate only when there is something worthwhile to say. This can be anything from recommending a book or a movie, to saying congratulations on an achievement, or to getting feedback on idea. As long as you show the person that you value their time and have something meaningful to share or discuss, the relationship will only grow stronger.

Ultimately, relationship maintenance is founded on one principle: reciprocity.

If you give, you shall receive. Oddly enough, this principle has been around since the dawn of time. It is found in countless religious texts, pieces of self-help literature, and entrepreneurship manifestos. However, it is probably one of the techniques least often employed by business enthusiasts. Many of us have a tendency to mark tit for tat. We fear being the first one to lend a helping hand, because what if the recipient doesn’t return the favor? Instead of worrying about the return, do as Keith Ferrazzi says, “lead with generosity.”

In Never Eat Alone (which is an essential read BTW), Ferrazzi likens relationship maintenance to a muscle. Unlike many are led to believe, a relationship and its resources are not finite, “like a pie that can only be cut into so many pieces.” Instead, they grow stronger the more you interact and exchange ideas and services. The more you nurture the relationship with your own contributions the more you can harvest from it. The more you harvest from it, the more space there is for new resources to grow.

One way you can consistently nurture a relationship is by connecting people with others who might share their ideas or philosophies. Remember earlier I said that you share the characteristics of the five people you spend time around the most? (Well, Jim Rohn said it first) Well, if you connect people with others who share parallels, you might help them polish their approach and expedite their progress.

Even if you connect someone to another person below them, for instance by recommending a young kid for an internship, you are actually doing more good than harm. People want to be surrounded by likeminded people, from tenderfoot interns to potential business partners. If you can help them to do that, your relationship is only going to get stronger. Keeping that in mind, it’s always best to ensure the other person, again, brings something valuable to the table.

There is nothing more satisfying than having a huge network of people whose backs you have scratched. Not everyone will scratch your back in return, but many will. The more you offer to others, the more resources you will have. Eventually, you might realize, as many do, that you actually enjoy helping others just for the sake of it.

If you are independent entrepreneur, a corporate employee, or undergraduate student it is essential you master the art of relationship building and maintenance. When you learn to cultivate strong relationships, you can then leverage this network of connections to find jobs, embark on new business ventures, find resourceful associates, produce new customer bases and audiences, develop partnerships, and/or make spectacular deals.

No matter your field, a robust interpersonal network is the key to optimizing your personal and professional enterprise. You know what you need to do. Now it’s time to step off the stairs, and hop on the elevator.

I pretty much just image computers put them back in a box and get them ready to ship. I am basically working full time hours during the summer and I am the go to person if there are no full time employees working. 

Currently I am going to be a junior in college majoring in Computer Science. I am going to be looking for internships/jobs for next summer and I would like to stay at this company because it is close to home and also the only IT/CS place in/near my hometown. 

I am making this post because I need some advice on asking if I should talk to my boss in my ""department"" at the end of the summer if they would offer me an internship and do something more technical at my job than what I am doing now. Currently they don't offer internships that I know of.  Another reason is that they are constantly hiring IT people throughout the company and I want to be part of the team eventually. 

How would you go about asking them to try open an internship for me next summer? 

Side Question: How much programming is there in IT because its something that I would still like to do in my career?"

This is a bit long so bear with me. Im with a girl now but she isnt my Girlfriend but we love eachother and we are exclusive. IT all started when I met her through a friend at his college. They kinda had a thing going on a FWB sorta deal I guess. Well she was hot so I started talking to her knowing that she wasnt ""with my friend"" oh she also had a boyfriend back home. So anyway talking turned to flirting flirting turned to FWB. We kept it secret from my friend to avoid awkwardness but she kinda was stopping with him regardless. So after the first time we were in love and the subsequent times just strengthened it. So shortly after we admitted we loved eachother her BF dumped her. I was there to comfort her etc. This was over Christmas break. So she came back and I needed a place to stay so I moved up there and stayed with her temporarily. So then I found out she was still flirting with my friend and such on messenger and I was like ok this has to stop if you want me I cant do this now that we are in love. She agreed and stopped but stayed his friend after we ssat him down and told him and he cried and confessed his love it was bad but it was done. The tension was there when we were together but he was normal if it was just me and him or him and her and him hanging out. Side note he was my bestfriend for like 7 years. Time passed and I eventually told him and her they couldnt be going to movies and stuff together bc he is in a way an ex. So time passed on and now its summer. Both I and my girlthing agreed to drop him as a friend bc its better for us all. She still hasnt and today I found out she skyped him and played some game with her friends while I was at work. Am i wrong to be upset? Also to clarify why we arent dating we arent bc she isnt ready to move to another but this is basically one but if not using the title helps whatever also she was waiting for me to get a place of my own and a job here which I now have. She is gon on an internship for the summer and when she gets back we can talk about offically dating. So if you made it this far feel free to answer the question and/or leave advice. Feels good to get this out and now in retrospect my life is a damn soap opera."

They want to interview and hire immediately. Problem is, I've never used PHP before. Any tips?

I'm familiar with / used in school C, C++, JavaScript, Scala, Python, but have never looked at PHP. They have seen my resume, which I list these languages (and did not mention PHP), and they seemingly liked my introductory e-mail (they asked for it instead of a cover letter), where I mentioned school and my previous degree (accounting - this is a startup that is making web based software for companies to work with the legal and business side of looking for funding. They're moving in house after using previously 3rd party contractors, so they're also looking to hire full time positions, so I'm worried they may see me as needing more training than they might be able to provide). 

I feel confident that I can explain to them that with my school work (I just finished my JR year of a B.S. in comp sci) I understand programming, and learning a new language isn't a major stumbling block, but any tips in case they ask me a technical question? I'm posting this at night right before bed, and are planning on trying to cram for about 3 hours before the interview. I'm thinking about bringing up the website I helped build in a team recently during a hackathon, and on my personal skills. But if they ask anything about the language I might be hosed. I know it's server side instead of local like JavaScript, but other than that I haven't had a whole lot to look over. I plan on getting a good night's sleep so I can be focused, then looking over what I can in the morning. 

What would you do in my shoes?"

(&lt;75 people). I mainly carrying out routine stuff, learning Excel, pivot tables, backing up emails and fixing crashed computers (Why do all office computers use stone age versions of Windows?!)

However the factory has an IT contractor that sometimes comes in. The office team have issues with data and want to carry out analytics for projections. 

We had a short meeting and I casually asked him could I get login/admin details for the work laptop so I could install Google Chrome/Mozilla and maybe install Visual Studio. In fact  I was told by my mentor to not mention the server or the fact I was backing up emails to the contractor , which I didn't. 

He went on about how they pose vulnerabilities and could ""bring down the server and network"" which made no sense to me. I kinda lost my cool and said why not run all the office computers on Linux with VPN's and a ubikey if he was that paranoid. 

He then proceeded to grill me about why I wanted to know Linux (which I never mentioned) or why code in general (wtf) and asked me why would I need VS or to know Visual Basic. (for spreadsheets obviously?!) 

And I try code a little on my downtime anyways... So he brought me down to the manager and I pretty much received a dressing down and the manager sided with him.

 I'm not mad, the guy is crucial to operations. My mentor even said she was disappointed in me and I need to be a better culture fit ... I'm kinda experiencing cognitive dissonance in which I what I asked wasn't that substantial but everyone acts like I committed a massive crime. Would love advice, fresh grad out of college...

Edit. Final bit, he said I should never write Macros on a Excel sheet as they were too ""dangerous"", like I said I have very little experience is this really the case?
And I have very little experience with Linux or servers"

When NO **ONE BELIEVES** what you're SAYING and find **EVERY** EXCUSE to prove you WRONG?

They tried to lock me away. They called me *crazy*. 

""Mr. Knutson, there's no evidence that suggests anything in your [story](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4klwpd/look_to_the_sky/)  occurred."" 

""It's possible you had a small carbon monoxide leak in your home."" 

""You might have a cognitive brain disfunction. You're going to be put under 48 hour watch while we administer a few tests. Once we have the results you are free to leave, sir."" 

""You're a LIAR.""

I left. Who the fuck do they think they are? Police can't find a trace of blood and *I'm* the one that has to be tested for competence?! No. I don't care about those results. They won't tell me a **thing**. 

But enough about my frustrations with law enforcement! I was kidnapped. I escaped!! I'm alive and well. Apparently I imagined the whole thing, too..

It was shortly after 4 a.m.

The obnoxiously loud sound of ""Too Many Cooks"" pierced the air and awoke me from my much-needed beauty sleep. It was the detective telling me I needed to leave the hotel immediately...that I was going under his direct protection until further notice.

From the details he *was* willing to give me, there was a suspicious person at my house. A neighbor called the police to report it, fearing someone may try to break into my home. The patrolman in the area arrived slightly too late but saw a car driving away from my home that he hadn't seen there earlier in the night. Suspicious, he decided to follow to the car (on what I can only assume was a gut feeling) to its destination -- my hotel. 

The detective, Michael, informed that the person walked straight into the hotel and to a room...suggesting that he had already checked in before I had arrived there. 

This wasn't a prank anymore.

He took me to an old office building in a Cleveland neighborhood called Old Brooklyn. The Cleveland Police Department have rooms there specifically for protection of people in high-profile cases (Jimmy Dimora, Ariel Castro, etc.).

We pulled up to the building as the sunlight just began to penetrate the sky. I would love to tell you this was either some creepy, abandoned building that had an oddly nice office setup inside or a normal, functioning building with a sweet, secret room but this was neither. This was an average looking building that clearly hadn't seen use in years but was still well-maintained. It was odd, but not the weirdest thing I've seen in my life. 

As Michael took me inside he let me know that the room I was going to be in was wired from ceiling to floor, and that every single inch of that room was observable by not-so-hidden hidden cameras. A strange gesture of comfort, I'm sure. He wasn't wrong though. 

If you saw this room you would think you were going to be in the next Saw movie. 

There was a small IKEA desk in the corner of the room, a cot with fresh linens next to it, and a small partition that divided the toilet and sink from the rest of the room. Bare, white walls did a great job to hide the cameras in each corner, too. He wasn't lying about the cameras recording everything. I stared at one the entire time I was using the facilities. 

Michael left, but not before he made made a point to tell me that he would be in the adjacent room the entire day and night monitoring the camera feeds so no one could get in...or out without him knowing.

I hit the toilet and went to sleep. There was nothing I could do to entertain myself there and I wasn't exactly too alert after my wake up call. I almost wish I didn't.

I woke up to a person sitting on the floor next to the head of my cot, gun in hand, but not pointing at me. It was just there, oddly. As soon as the person noticed that I was awake (he...she...it?) sprung up and began pacing the room at an unnaturally high speed. I was concerned the damn person would smack into the wall due to not being able to stop. That wasn't the thing that scared me...no, no no no...it was the speaking. This person was *preaching* to me as if I was in his clergy. Not in a coherent, well-formed speech either. They were the same statements over and over again in varying forms of emphasis and tone:

""Find the Sky before you die!"" 

""Find THE Sky before *you* die!"" 

""PASS the torch, pass the torch pass the tooooooorrrrrrrrrcccchhhhhh."" 

""I Urge you!"" 

""I URGE YOU."" 

""YOUWILLKNOWyouwillknowweallknow""

I had no clue what in the literal fuck this person was going on about and at that point I didn't care. I was terrified. I screamed, I yelled, I shrieked, I made every noise humanly possible to get the attention of Michael. 

He never came.

As this person kept pacing and preaching around the room it became increasingly frantic and appeared to almost be...nervous. The arms began flailing with each emphasis of the words. The person was losing control of itself! This was my chance! With all of the strength in my body I pounced on the person while its back was turned to me as it walked to the wall, slamming it's skull into solid, white brick. Blood splattered everywhere like a water balloon full of paint. 

Silence. There was no final breath, exchange of words, or struggle to move. This was cold, instant death. 

I ran. I didn't care who this person was, what they looked like, or where I was. I killed someone. Ended a life. I needed Michael...who was nowhere to be found. The adjacent room was empty, his car was missing, and so was my stuff that I had left with him. I was fucked. 

I went to the police and, not surprisingly, they arrested me and held me in a cell until the officers they sent to investigate reported back. In the meantime I retold my story to two people who were complete dicks -- a detective and a shrink.

We sat there, across the table from each other, for an eternity. No clocks. No windows. Just fluorescent lights and the smell of sanitizing chemicals. We might have been in there for days for all I knew. Then a young man, an intern, probably, came in to the room an handed the detective a manilla folder. As he and the shrink were looking it over, they kept giving me these...looks. Looks of confusion mixed with sympathy. Then they told me what was in the folder -- the message that would send my soul into my shoes....the officers found nothing in the building I claimed to be held at.

Well, I didn't take that lightly. I demanded to speak with Michael. He was *there* and he could at least validate that I was in the building. Anything to get them to believe me!

Michael came in some minutes after my request and sat down on the other side of the shrink. He told them he was, in fact, the detective overseeing my case. I had a very brief sigh of relief until he muttered his next sentence:

""I've never met you, Mr. Knutson.""

""WHO THE FUCK WAS I IN THE CAR WITH?!"" I roared as I leapt at Michael, meeting with the tickling of a electric jolt throughout my body. Goodnight.

----

When I woke up in the hospital, I was told I needed to be kept under a 48-hour watch while they administered a few tests to verify my mental stability and competence. I complied for the duration of the tests, not for the results. Did you know you can check yourself out of a mental hospital? That's not just a joke or rumor. Either that or Metro Hospital is terrible at security. I don't care.

I'm back home. I'm safe. My puppy is okay, albeit very, very hungry. It's a gorgeous day today, low 80s. The sky is clear and picture perfect. I might take my dog for a long walk.

I don't know what to do about the person I killed. I'm not under arrest. What evidence do they have? If there's no body then there's not a single thing I can be guilty of.

I however cannot figure out if this would be acceptable. I am needing a database for the project I'm working on. It for my internship and basically various tables would store log in information as well as projects and their statuses. This would be internally facing so it wouldn't get more than 10k uses even if everyone logged in at the same time. 

So I'm just curious about security, usage, and ability of SQLite? Will is suffice my needs? Or is this not a good library to use with Python? "

At the university I'm at, I was placed in a satellite campus my freshman year and I wasn't given proper advising on mandatory courses and had no range of CSE courses that I could take to advance my major. Because of this and a mixture of my grades not doing so hot, I've completed my third year as still undeclared and have reached a dilemma. 

It seems like the best options are either switch to a new major called Data Analytics or transfer to a different university which doesn't have any gpa requirements for cs and complete the degree.

I've had internships at JP Morgan Chase and this summer I'll be at Amazon working as a SDE intern and I've won hackathons with a lot of outside projects under my belt. So, I want to go into CS for my career. I just don't know where the best place would be to go.
Any advice?

3 months ago I started my first internship on a cargo vessel and I have been hating every single day of it (except the one where I had to use a chainsaw). So after 2,5 years of this 4 year program I decided to quit. I cannot live at the sea. I value my personal life too much and not to mention I get seasick very easily, while the rest is doing just fine. Also this study is worthless if you want a shore-based job, who would have thought? (sarcasm)

So after some thinking I decided to apply for a bachelor mechanical engineering study, which seems like one of the best choices I can make right now. 

What I am good at and want in a career:

* Analytical thinking
* Logic
* Problem solving
* Calculations

I feel like mechanical engineering can give me these, and there are a lot of career possibilities with this study. 

However I have also been thinking about a programming related study. Programming can also be linked to my strong points, which depends of course in what you specialize aswell. However I have heard plenty about self-taught programmers and freelancers who make a decent buck, so I feel like pursuing a study in that field might not be the best choice.

Furthermore I want to quit my internship, but I am not sure yet whether finishing this will give me dispensation for the internship at that study. 

So here I am... Programming a little every night. Are 3 months of hardcore programming enough to find out whether to pursue that instead?"

I've been job hunting and applying during my free time, but have had no success (100's of applications, 6 on-sites (only maybe half for software engineering roles, others were application/release engineer, api evangelist, test designer). I've recently been offered an internship for the summer that is much more technical than my current role. My current role pays very low for the area. Should I take this internship in hopes of landing a full time offer after? Worse case scenario is I am back on the job hunt and still not receiving offers after this internship.

There were also graphics programming classes with OpenGL and some more esoteric stuff like using the Yggdrasil scripting language for making virtual environments.

4lcjae,4,2016-05-27,Great internship- Worth getting A+ for general knowledge or go for something else?,CWA_IT,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4lcjae/great_internship_worth_getting_a_for_general/,"[WARNING: Long post but it would help me out SOOO much please read]


I am currently a sophomore in college (20 y/o) majoring in Computer Information Systems. I have not taken any major classes yet, but this upcoming semester I will be getting into more computer based classes. I am fairly new to the IT field and am very interested and eager to learn more, but do not have anything specific I want to go in to yet. I've done some very basic Beta Testing and Desktop Hardware Support.

I recently landed an awesome IT Intern opportunity with a rapidly growing and successful company because their other intern left to pursue other interests. I am basically the ""inhouse IT guy"" here at the office now and it's a bit overwhelming but I am using this experience to learn a lot and grow in the field. They told me they wanted to hire someone to learn and grow with the company rather than hiring a more experienced person that’s sort of a “know it all already”… that’s not what they wanted. The company is also serviced by a good outsourced IT company that overlooks all our servers/switches and what not, so all the pressure is not on me all the time and I can always ask them questions over the phone and they can remote in and show me how to do things (this is how I Learn A LOT). This opportunity is an excellent way to expose me to a variety of things. I am learning how to use the Active Directory, Server Permissions, managing a Domain, how the phone system works basic to advance troubleshooting, business related IT… A whole bunch of things.

Here is what draws me in so much.. this company is small but VERY successful and we are rapidly growing. We are in a wealthy retirement part of Florida, and being a Wealth Management company, there’s a ton of high roller clients that come in to the office. I meet a ton of great people and it is really teaching me how to act and be a professional in the business world. Learning new things everyday gets me excited to work and eager to do my best and excel in my role. Our office has about 15 people in it and it’s honestly very enjoyable to work with everyone here, it’s like family. What I am trying to get at is I see potential in this company and can see myself sticking around for a while, or at least as long as I can throughout college. I have really impressed them in the short amount of time I’ve been there so far, so much that I am getting my own brand new office in our new space we are moving in to soon. The new space is twice as big as our office now and I get to work with the professional IT team setting up our server room, learning about setting up networks, how the cabling works, setting up work stations, etc. Another amazing opportunity to learn and grow.

My main concern is that I feel as if I don’t know as much as I am supposed to. My job here is very Help Desk role. In most cases to obtain a help desk job you need your CompTia A+ certification, and I feel as if I am missing a lot of that information. DON’T GET ME WRONG, I personally believe I am doing a great job helping people out in the office and everyone is very happy with me, but still feel as if I am sort of missing the nitty gritty tech stuff about computers. Granted, I haven’t really taken any computer related classes which I will probably learn about the general knowledge things on the A+. I don’t know if I am just thinking prematurely or just being hard on myself (I am fairly new to IT but have been using computers my whole life).

I wanted to ask you more experience guys, what would you do in my situation? Would it be beneficial for me to study and obtain the A+ even if I don’t plan on leaving for another “entry-level” job, and just for the information? From what I read, it seems like your A+ is good for entry level than anything beyond that it is kind of pointless. I landed a dream entry level position without the A+ (at least I think) and was wondering what I should do? Should I go for the A+ to learn the basic stuff, or just study that on my own and maybe go for other certifications? My main goal is to get a jump start into something that will help me out in the future. I feel as if the more I know and the more I can prove myself to this company, the higher up (and more pay) I can receive. EVEN IF I leave after all, they would be an absolute amazing reference to have and would help me out finding a new position elsewhere (lets say for example when I graduate). What would be the most beneficial for me right now?

So guys, what do you think?

Career goal is to get into a FO role at a BB/EB in London, recognise lack of experience as my weakness application wise.

I'm wanting to apply to pre-experience MFin programs to give me the opportunity of another year to get experience, wondering which programs to apply for, or to hedge my bets on getting an off-cycle internship next year and then applying for a MFin the following year.

Currently debating between LSE MFin, Imperial MFin or european programs such as HEC or IE.

Also, what are peoples opinion on the new pre-experience LBS finance course, Masters in Financial Analysis? I know LBS brand carries weight in London, but this program is in it's infancy and the first class starts September this year.

While in college, pursuing a degree in Information Systems, I got a job at a now defunct airline. It was basically a paid internship to do all sorts of computer related stuff. They were a small airline based in Colorado Springs, CO, and then later in Denver. They attempted to take over another airline and went bankrupt in 1998.

One day before I left work, my boss gives me several long Ethernet cables and tells me ""Go patch in the new modems into the computer network."" So I head down to the data room.

Now, I think it is important that you know that I had only been in a real data room twice before, and I had never worked in one. For those that don't know, they have raised floors so you can run cables under the floor tiles, lots and lots of racks of computer equipment, tons of AC to keep it all cool, etc.

Anyway, I walk in, find the modem bank, find several modems that have no cables attached. I look at the ones that are wired in, follow the cables, figure out where they are plugged into, and wire up the new modems just like those. Then I replace the floor tiles I pulled up and head home for the day.

The next day I come in to work after class is out and my badge doesn't work. The guard tells me to wait. A minute later my boss and two security guards show up and escort me to the CEO's office. Inside the office, besides the CEO, are the CIO, CFO, my boss and the two bosses above him. They start questioning me.

What did I do yesterday at the end of the day? Did I get the modems working? Did I remove floor tiles? Did I notice anything out of the ordinary? Long story short, I had somehow kicked loose the power cable for the main pyramid server that ran the airline. So for 45 minutes, the airline could do nothing. They couldn't sell tickets, make reservations, board planes, take off, etc. Nothing. I was told I cost the airline somewhere near $200,000. I don't know if that is accurate or not. Eventually someone noticed that the server had no power and plugged it back in.

I didn't lose my job over that. They all had a good laugh, and admonished me to be more careful in the future. I suggested that they find a way to lock the cable down, but they rejected that idea.

I am in a dilemma right now.  I found that after countless interviews and failing them all it is probably best that I go back to school.

I just suck at interviewing. I do in fact get phone interviews, but recently the phone interviews seem to be getting harder (at least for the Big 4 type of companies) and I sometimes struggle to do the easier phone screen or onsite interviews for medium or small companies.  Still I received 0 offers. I thought by going back to school it would give me more time to learn about CS and give me yet another chance at finding an internship (cannot do it now since I am out of school a few years) and plus I feel like companies love hiring interns/new grads. Is it a bad idea to go back to school? It is hard to say if I need the education or not, but seeing as I am not hireable maybe I am answering my own question here..."

I started to look for engineering internships and I quickly secured an internship after I was offered the position during January. An Alumni worked at the office and he basically got me the position. Well during that time, I took classes outside of my major and started to volunteer at hospitals and talked to different people of different professions. I realized that I wanted to become a doctor and I will be going back to school in the Fall to take my pre med classes.

Well the internship lasts until mid-August and is a Monday-Friday 8-5 job. I need to get hours to shadow doctors. I have found an Alumni that is willing to let me shadow him, but he doesn't work on weekends of course. 

Do you guys think it is unreasonable to explain my situation to my boss and ask to leave one day out of the week after 12 so I can go shadow the doctor?

If not, what should I do at this point?"

Here's my unsolicited, managerial advice rant.",CouthDecay,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4lh54e/hey_grads_i_graduated_11_years_ago_im_old_now/,"(I was an Army Officer (Captain) for eight years. I have now been in the Environmental Management industry for three years. I have a Master's Degree in Environmental Management and am a Certified Hazardous Materials Manager.)

If you've just graduated and haven't squared away an entry-level grad job with whatever logical career progression applies to your major, then you've messed up. If you're going home to work for Mommy and Daddy then this doesn't really apply to you.

If you're starting your Junior year of your Bachelor's you're going to need to get with your college advisors to start looking for career placement. They should be able to direct you where to go. **Raise your GPA**. It is so stupidly important, you have no idea. If you're in your Senior year and have it good to go, then good for you. If you don't, then get on that ish right now. Also, raise your GPA some more. If it applies, do an internship. Make contacts. Keep those contacts.

If you want to go straight to Grad School, then cool. Keep in mind that you are incurring extra debt and not getting any workforce experience. If you are able to work on your Master's while starting your job, it's usually a better option as your company will typically pay for school and you're getting contacts and experience at the same time. You've heard it before, but **the most important aspect of employment is who you know and what they think of you.**

So, you secured an entry-level position with your stellar GPA, dress shirt, Toyota Corolla, and robotic interview responses. Good job. First thing's first:

1) **Shut the f#$% up.** No one cares what you think or what you think you know. I'm not telling you this as someone that hates snot-nosed millennials. I'm technically a millennial myself. I'm telling you this for your own good. Unless someone asks your opinion, don't say a damn thing for about a year. And even if you are asked, be as simple with your response as possible and don't dare start your response off with, ""Based on my experience at..."" You have no experience. **You know nothing**, Millennial Snow.

2) **Learn everything you didn't learn at school.** It will be a lot. The chances are high that you'll be put on some sort of junior management track. Go talk to the grumpy curmudgeon who's swung a hammer in that industry for thirty years. Trust me, he/she wants to be heard. Find out the mundane #$% about your industry. Memorize these things. As long as you don't sharp-shoot people in some sort of ego trip, you will get a lot of respect very quickly from the veterans in your field if you learn the things that have defined their careers.

3) **As a manager, BE GOOD TO PEOPLE.** If you know you have to make a decision that is going to piss some people off, make that decision and be up front with everyone. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE.** You will never, ever, ever be able to make everyone happy. If you're up front about bad news, people will respect you more for it and you'll be less likely to be given all the blame for whatever goes down. Also, there will always be some people with a consistently antagonistic attitude toward leadership. That's just something you're going to have to deal with. Instead of being spiteful of those people, try developing a relationship with them. Meet them on common ground. Ask them to train YOU in something. Listen to them. Be proactive and never reactive.

4) **Never completely trust anyone.** This is hugely important when people's livelihoods are on the line. When it comes down to you or them and saving their own ass (AND MONEY / LIVELIHOOD), chances are you're going to be f---ed. Do not put yourself in a situation that you can be compromised. Don't be a 100% by the book a$$#%&amp;, but also don't do anything illegal or sketchy where you put your trust in the hands of someone you basically barely know.

5) **Continue your professional education.** Get your boss's resume and use it as guidance for your future, or if you don't like him/her, find a different mentor and follow their lead. Get your Master's Degree before 30 and start working on professional certifications as soon as you can. Professional certifications are a necessary evil. They open so many doors and so many callbacks for interviews.

6) **Be upfront but not disrespectful with your boss.** If he or she is neglecting a responsibility that is affecting the team, call them out on it. Close the door, be direct, and be ready to defend yourself against someone who may be rather irrational. A good supervisor will respect your ability to provide constructive criticism in a confrontational manner. A good supervisor also recognizes that a confrontation is not the same thing as an argument. You will have good and bad supervisors. Keep your ear to the ground and make calculated decisions with your future.

7) **If you have problems with confidence, you're going to have problems with everything you do**, especially if it involves people. Assess yourself and do what you need to do to fix it.

8) **Be adaptive, resilient, and comfortable with change.** Be what your company needs you to be but not at the cost of your financial security or career progression. There's a balance to being an asset vs being abused. Many positions within a field are closely related but vastly different in practice. Be able to adapt to these. Also, 2008 showed us that shit can go wrong very quickly. Have a back up plan. **START SAVING YOUR MONEY IMMEDIATELY. LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS.** You are likely going to live until you are 90 years old. You really don't want to have to work past 60. You better save your money in the event of the next recession in addition to being able to retire comfortably.

Everyone is going to get old and die. So, plan for it starting now.

Not sure what to do now.",CS_Throwaway23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lhh7v/i_could_really_use_some_advice_recently_graduated/,"Hi, I created a throwaway account for anonymous reasons. I recently graduated in July with a Bachelors in CS in 2015 and was able to land an internship that was Helpdesk over summer 2015 for a decent company. I absolutely hated that job however, I had never been so miserable in my life. I strongly disliked my coworkers (for reasons which I won't get into) but I faked a smile all the way through the internship until it ended on decently good terms. It was such a degrading experience that it put me off to working helpdesk entirely (and almost all IT work in its entirety).

After all that ended, it took a serious toll on me and I fell into really bad depression and anxiety where I couldn't leave the house without feeling like having a panic attack. I lost complete contact with everyone I knew except for my girlfriend. I'm feeling a bit better now after getting prescribed medication for it though. 

I've been working crappy temp jobs in the mean time but have been out of work for about 3 months now and I'm starting to feel like I wasted my time getting a CS Degree. I've always loved being on Computers and learning about them, but I have never enjoyed Programming at all. I completed my classes with very average grades (C's, B's, occasional A's) and felt so relieved to be done working on a programming assignment.

I had an interview for an ASP.NET/C# job in a very busy city in Texas recently, and after they asked me to create something to display my skills that took me about a week to finish, I presented it to him. I've never been so embarrassed in my life. He told me it looked thrown together and asked me questions relating to the lines of code and all the terms that each and everything represents, but I just couldn't remember or flat out didn't know. His advice for me was to buy a huge C# book and write about 50 programs and then get back to him... After that experience, I knew that programming definitely wasn't something I would ever consider doing for a career.

I had another interview for a simple security job the other day, and it went pretty well but they told me it was a job for the long term and I got the impression they felt like I was going to leave them right away after another opportunity presented itself because of my education. Classic ""we'll keep in touch"" AKA you didn't get the job.

So now I'm here not sure what the hell to do. I suck at interacting with the public but I'm okay with talking with co-workers. I'm in a lot of debt with no job and I'm about to have to work fast food or something in order to simply survive. I'm overqualified for basic jobs but not good enough for a decent job is what it feels like. Any advice would be appreciated, maybe alternative career paths regarding IT that don't do very much interacting with the public but also doesn't require programming? I'm not sure if that even exists.

Another sidenote-- I've always lived in smaller cities, so traveling to a really busy city in Texas almost had me have a panic attack. I just can't handle the commute like that at all... SO MUCH traffic"

I'm a low-level Johnny Helpdesk at the organization I just started working for.  One of the things I have been tasked with doing is increasing network security. Part of the problem is that all of the users - all 400 of them - have local admin credentials on their workstations.  There's nothing stopping them from installing whatever they want.  I brought up the idea of restricting admin credentials to the person who allegedly functions as our Network Administrator and he said, ""Why would you want to do that?"" 
""Because users with admin credentials are a primary vector for viruses and ransomware."" 
""We've got an anti-virus, we don't need to worry about that."" 

And that's when I started screaming. 

Just last week, we got hit with ransomware.  Fortunately, the intern and I managed to stop it before it did any serious damage but this just underscores the point that, from a network security standpoint, we are wide open. 

If I can come up with a plan that demonstrates how I am going to accomplish this and how it won't negatively impact the network admin's Candy Crush playing it will go a long way to getting this done and I'll sleep much better. 

I was thinking of doing it through Group Policy.  I have some experience with Group Policy, but it's mostly limited to distributing software and minor changes but never anything of this scale.  If you wanted to do what I'm trying to do, how would you do it? Some of the stuff I looked at online indicates that there are about a billion things that have to be changed but I have to think that there's a simpler way to do it. 

Any help or guidance on this issue would be greatly appreciated."
4lhtur,4,2016-05-28,Flight risk,floridianreader,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/4lhtur/flight_risk/,"hello.  For the Bot, I am in FL, if it matters.

I am a home healthcare social worker (SW).   I left my job at a large hospice chain in one city because of a bad case of homesick-ness and also because my husband got a way better job back in our hometown.  I spoke to hospice management about transferring to the hospice (same company)  in our hometown and while they said that they didn't have a SW position at the moment, they would be glad to have me in the future if and when something opened up. 

So I quit my job and we moved back to our hometown.  I waited and waited for a hospice job to open up.  I did find a part time job working in the home healthcare field, but it's very sporadic.... I get only about 4 or 5 hours per pay period.  I have asked for more hours but haven't really gotten anywhere.  So I have begun looking for other jobs. 

I have checked in with the hospice company that I used to work for, but the very same people at the hospice that I talked to when I was still an employee suddenly forgot that I existed.  I applied to openings, I sent a very nice cover letter reminding them that I was a former employee and knew all their computer systems and other policies and procedures. They told me that suddenly they require 3 or more years experience and a license, even when I told them I worked for the company not even 6 months ago. They won't even give me an interview or the time of day.  

I've gotten other job interviews, and at least one interviewer told me that I was the favorite candidate for the position, but I never got ""THE CALL"" for the job offer.  I have checked and rechecked and had other people look at my resume and cover letter, and it's spotless... no misspelled words, everything is as it should be, no weird stuff about my cat or whatever.

The last job interview I had, the interviewer said that everything looked great but he couldn't help but notice that I was a flight risk. And then it all made sense, that I can't get a job because now I'm a flight risk.  I wasn't prepared for that question, so that pretty much threw the interview. 

This is what my employment history looks like:

nonprofit internship 9 months

hospice internship 9 months

hospice employee 15 months

home healthcare 3 months

So, how long do I have to stay at my current sporadic job before I am no longer considered a flight risk? I know I should address it in future interviews now, but I'm not even getting called for interviews lately. "

I'm literally crying right now and feeling hopeless about my future. 

Some facts about me:
I'm 23. I'm majoring in American Studies at a good school with two semesters left. I have a 2.9 gpa. My only work experiences were from fast food jobs 4 years ago. I'm a single mother to a preschooler. 

During the spring and fall semesters, my son is with me but he is with my parents right now because I'm taking a summer class. Because I only have one class, I have a lot of free time which allows me to think about my future. I realize that I'm really really fucked. This is the summer before I graduate and I have basically nothing under my belt. Compared to my peers, I have no relevant work or internship experiences. I have been spending my undergrad years just going to class and taking care of my son. I thought about looking for campus jobs but even those jobs require skills, which I have none of. I wanted to spend this summer being productive and taking advantage of the fact that my parents offered to watch my son while I'm going to school. But after a week of watching movies and lounging around at home when I'm not in class, I feel pathetic and useless. 

Another thing is that I think I have social anxiety. I don't have a single friend in life and even with classmates, I can't get along with them. I feel awkward wherever I am and can't contribute to conversations beyond the introduction. I don't have confidence when I speak because I don't have life experience since I'm so sheltered and because my grades are so bad. I go to a good school where everyone is really smart and are always up to something in terms of internships and projects. I haven't joined any clubs because I can't leave my son at night. 

I'm only feeling this now because this summer is my last chance to do something. Once the fall and spring semesters come, I'll be focused on my classes. Then I'll graduate with nothing but a degree in American Studies. I'll have just that on my resume and no skills. 

I have thought about teaching myself how to code this summer from Khan Academy, but I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into or if it's even the right start. I read some conflicting comments from previous threads about these online tutorials being insufficient, and that's discouraging. 

Basically, I have about 2 months to be productive. Can anyone give me advice about my situation? about coding? about other skills to teach myself?"

So looking at my degree plan, I am curious to know when is an appropriate time to start looking for an internship? I feel as a sophomore it is way to early obvious. I am just starting my program.

I started an internship in insurance underwriting about two weeks ago. I'm a computer science major with little to no background in finance, so forgive me if I say something stupid. 



I still don't have a clear idea about what my department does and what insurance underwriting involves. I did a few google searches, and roughly understand underwriting involves assessing risks of clients, putting a batch of services together for them, and then deciding how much they should pay for it. 



I need to send my resume to a few companies soon for CS related internships. I want to list this summers internship as experience, but I have no confidence that I can speak about it intelligently. I am not trying to learn EXACTLY what my department does. All I really want is something convincing to write on my resume.

Here's what I got so far:



*Really Big Insurance Company, My Underwriting Department*


*Underwriting Internship (5/2016 - present)*


•	Risk assessment of potential clients


•	Reviewing historical data to gauge what coverage clients should have and what clients should pay


•	Regularly working and querying in MS Excel and Access databases

4lm5ep,1,2016-05-29,Discouraged from several interviews w/o getting internships,AnEffinCookie,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4lm5ep/discouraged_from_several_interviews_wo_getting/,"So here is where I am at. I am feeling really discouraged and under motivated to continue my job search. 



A little background is that I am an EE with a 3.5 overall GPA (my major coursework is like a 3.2). Once I went to university, I was working in semi-related fields throughout my schooling. One thing to note I did not do very much on campus projects or organizations because I was working and trying to get through my classes. (not much support from parents except for housing). One job was retail selling electronic parts, and the other was sort of a technician/engineering job at a very small firm. 

I work at a company now where I am an electronic technician working in maintenance. When anything electronic breaks, or they have questions relating to new devices, I am there to provide solutions. I also have an opportunity there to redesign some of their rectifiers (true Engineering work), however it's a task that i don't know if I can realistically do over a summer.

I did receive a job offer for after my graduation this fall, but it was kinda on the low side as far as pay. I will go there if nothing else, but I still want to try for other places to see if I can get anything better.

The thing is, not to put my previous employers down, but they are not anything like Fortune 500 companies. And I'm getting a little discouraged because no other places made me an offer, and I have applied to many. Places like Boeing, Northrup, Harris, Raytheon, Edison, and many more. Got an interview for some, ignored by the rest.

It is summer now, and I don't have an ""internship"". I really don't know what to do. A lot of my fellow students have gotten jobs or internships at some of the good private companies that I applied to also. I'm left here still in kinda the same jobs as I have always been. Bottom of the barrel, very low benefit jobs/opportunity jobs. And I'm really discouraged. I honestly don't think I'll be able to improve anymore to where other companies will like me.

I am honestly tired of this job search. I feel there is so much ego, greed, and shallowness in the corporate world. I've been told by countless recruiters that ""resume looks good, I'll pass it on"" to hear nothing back. I'm at the point where I won't even let them keep my resume unless they tell me they want to have an interview with me.  

I worked my ass off in college. I didn't screw around. I'm respectable and I work very very hard at my school and jobs. I really don't know what to do anymore. I already use my free time to do more studying and learning. 

What the hell is wrong with me? What am I doing wrong? Do I lack the necessary skills? Do I lack social skills? What?

A little bit about my situation: I have an internship away from home for the summer, so my plan is to build a pc to help pass the insane amount of free time I have.  I recently purchased an ultra-wide monitor for a decent price, and it just happened to have freesync.  My question is: is freesync worth buying a ""last gen"" amd card? Because I really want a 1070, maybe even 1080.  I know that polaris cards will be revealed soon, but there is little to no chance of me waiting for them to ship to build this pc, as I'm super eager to get it put together.

Anyway take a look at the build, let me know if I can trim any fat/make better purchasing decisions, as well as weigh in on my gpu situation.  Thanks!

I am a former Computer Science undergrad who has recently changed her tune about majoring in CS during an internship in the Silicon Valley. Ironically, I applied for a computer engineering internship with a security company, but my language skills got me an internship in marketing (I can speak French and am learning Chinese). I've slowly come to the realization that everything I want to do in life involves mathematics. I find finance fascinating as well as data science and I've been learning more about cryptography. Math is hard and it always has been because I never knew how to study for it, but when I am not taking math classes, I find that I have little challenge in my life. 

I would love to get into a really good grad school if I can kick my own ass into shape (my GPA is a 3.29 right now) and maybe go for a masters in analytics. I am going into my junior year now, so changing majors will mean a lot more work or even an extra semester of school. Here's what my new plan may be:

Majors: Mathematics, French
Minor: Chinese (Maybe also Geology, I'm two classes away from it bc of AP credits)
GPA: 3.29 now, want to get to a 3.6

If I weren't to go to grad school, what could I possibly do as a job? Rather, if I were to delay grad school, what could I do as a job in the meantime? Do you have any consolation for someone in my situation?

Turned out the MD3200i had a drive that was showing as failed due to some sort of firmware glitch.  The drive itself was fine.  Had to work with an engineer from Dell and kick off a script that killed and revived the drives that were getting false flagged.  From there had to hop into vSphere and boot the VM's back up.  Holy cow.  Thanks for your help everyone.  That's been my most stressful experience thus far.

The last thing I'd do is ask you guys to read my previous posts. However, a lot of them revolve around my struggle to find a job after college.

I finished a four year degree (in five years) last spring. I'm currently doing an internship and applying for jobs on the side. Once the internship is over, I'm going to start taking the job hunt more seriously, not that I haven't been doing so already. 

Long story short, I finished a political science degree and immediately followed it with an internship with a non-profit which works with the local judiciary to help advocate for abused/neglected children. I don't want to necessary remain in this field for my career, but I'd love to work for the government. Public administration, human resources and non-profit work in general interest me.

I'm mainly posting here for some motivation. I'm very motivated and persistent in finding a new job. I work in retail 30 hours a week right now and I have no chance in moving up at my job. Trust me, I've tried. I've interviewed for a few other jobs with little success.

I've been out of college for only a few months and I feel defeated. Determined, but defeated. My girlfriend, who has been out of college for a year, can't find a job either. She told me that the first year out of school is very hard. I'm trying hard to remain optimistic, but every bad interview and rejection letter breaks my heart a little more...

I'm just looking for some success stories, maybe even some advice and motivation. Some words confirming that my five years weren't spent in vain. After all, I've been out of school for a few months. A job isn't going to fall into my lap. I'm doing everything that I should be, basically just waiting for my big break.

I plan on getting a master's degree, but not until I can support myself. Does anyone have anything good to share? "

So I want to become a teacher, well ... I am highly considering becoming a teacher. 

I have been subbing in a large district in Southern California for around 8 months now (so I have first-hand experience in a classroom). They make us choose between K-5 and 6-12th grade. So, I chose K-5 because I heard too many horror stories about working with students in 6-12th grade. 

Now, I have chance to enter a intern program where I can start teaching right away but as I reflect on these last 8 months I am wondering about the differences between each type of school. 

I enjoy teaching elementary school kids because they are nice, funny, and more ""manageable"" than older kids. I feel like teaching elementary school kids would work well with my personality because I am quiet, relaxed and wouldn't want to deal with teenagers who want to rebel. At the same time, I feel like I might not be the type of nurturing person that is required when being an elementary school teacher. I feel that I would be very strict and direct and I don't want to be seen as a ""mean"" teacher. Although, are elementary school teachers always ""mean""?

On the other hand, I feel like teaching middle/high school kids will better because they are more ""mature"" and I would not have to ""baby"" them as much but I am scared about classroom management. 

I have dealt with elementary school kids who have behavior issues but for the most part they were manageable. I am just afraid of dealing with students that don't care and being that one teacher whose class is out of control. 

Any advice or clearing up misconceptions would help! Thanks!"

Help!,titansfan777,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4lox90/recent_bba_in_marketing_gradcannot_find_entry/,"I just graduated from UT San Antonio with a marketing degree with a 4.0 in the major, and a 3.53 overall GPA. I went to another school for 2 years (spring 2010 - spring 2012) before dropping out since I had no clue what I wanted to do, and moving to Texas to start back up at UTSA after a year break. After the year break, I attended UTSA from fall '13 until this past May.

I took classes during my two summers at UTSA to essentially squeeze a 4 year degree into less than 3 years (I was determined to graduate as fast as possible, and they didn't accept many of my transfer credits), so I had no time really for internships because of this.

Now, here I am, after applying to almost one hundred companies and I cannot find a single respectable marketing job (marketing analyst, marketing assistant etc). They all require experience directly in the field of at least 2-3 years, and the only ones that will take me are $10-$12 marketing/sales positions at obscure/door to door marketing companies. I have 5.5 years of customer service/sales experience, but without any internships directly in the field of marketing, I feel like I have royally fucked myself. I look at my school's career center website and the job postings there, but they are all direct marketing door to door stuff, or positions at places like Target/Wal-Mart as a cashier - really.

I have 5 months until my 35k student loans kick in and I am looking for something that will allow me to pay them off over the next few years while still having money left over for all of life's other expenses. After doing some number crunching, I need roughly $40k/year, but I cannot find anything even close to that. 

What can I do? My resume is decent, I send cover letters with every application, and I can't seem to find anything. I am trying not to be discouraged, but the rejections are starting to eat away at me."

&amp;nbsp;

Just a quick question about taking an exchange semester, and the pros/cons of doing so. I’m on route to graduate with a 4 year CS degree in April 2017. I will have one 8 month Software Dev internship with the largest ERP company under my belt (currently ongoing), and I’ll be starting a part time internship with my university in September as a full stack web developer.

&amp;nbsp;

My question to you guys would be extending my graduation to December 2017 in order to take an exchange semester in the fall from Sept. 2017 - Dec. 2017.

&amp;nbsp;

My plan would be to:

&amp;nbsp;Practice &amp; bust my ass off to get another internship next summer, Big 4 or Unicorn tier

&amp;nbsp;Spend another semester abroad

&amp;nbsp;Hopefully start full time with the company I intern for next summer / Attempt to look for Software Dev jobs in Europe, which is my ultimate goal

&amp;nbsp;

With experience and continous practice, I think I’d be okay to get another internship next summer, I do consider myself highly motivated in that aspect. My overall GPA isn’t so hot as I transferred into CS from another program, but my CS grades are pretty good. I’m thankful enough to have my parents cover my tuition but I’m sure I’ll be covering my the final semester myself. Won’t be too bad though, as I’ll be paying my school’s tuition which covers tuition abroad.  Any thoughts on doing this from you guys/gals out there? 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for any help!"
4lpol9,108,2016-05-30,It might take you longer than a few months to get your first job. Let's talk about the success stories here.,RIPdig,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4lpol9/it_might_take_you_longer_than_a_few_months_to_get/,"First off I just want to say this sub reddit has been an awesome asset. More often than not people here have been really kind and super helpful to me even though I am a complete stranger to them. And I love reading about people’s success stories. But I think it would be beneficial to have a discussion about the impact that some success stories might have on the people of this sub.

When I first started studying coding in  March of 2015 I found that the success stories of people landing dev jobs making 60k+ and only studying for about three to six months to be awesome and super motivating. I made it my personal goal to self-study and land an internship position in 12 months.

Before the 12 month mark it was easy to put in hours and hours of study. Seeing what other people had achieved mainly on this sub was like my jet fuel. I just kept pushing myself to learn more and bigger things. 

But then came the time for me to start applying. So I started attending meet ups, put up my resume on all of the major job sites, looked deeply at the projects that I was most proud, and made a personal website. And things started off well I got a few recruiters who were interested in talking with me and after only a few weeks of looking I had my very first phone interview for an internship at a local company. I was so stoked but also so very nervous.

The day came for the phone interview and the conversation started off great! They started talking about compensation, the duties of the position, what kind of technologies I would be working with, and the next steps in the interview process. But then, something went terribly wrong… I am not sure if they had not thoroughly read my resume before calling me but they seemed disappointed that I was not enrolled in a four year Computer Science degree program, I could hear the change in tone of their voice. So I tried to emphasize my stronger points and asked for the opportunity to be sent the coding challenge (the next step in the interview process) but I was shut down. They kept repeating the same thing “I know this is an entry level position but the learning curve will be too great for you.” What?! After a year of study I am still not ready for even an entry level position?! I felt like I had been punched in the gut. The next few days were super hard for me. I reconsidering everything, I thought about boot camps, an undergraduate CS degree, joining a master’s program, and of course even giving up.

I eventually decided to keep trying but it was not as easy as before to study the entire day. I kept applying to jobs both internships and full time gigs. (Internships often want people who are enrolled in CS degree programs and do not favor bootcamp grads nor self learners) and fulltime gigs even for entry level positions can have crazy requirements, like 2-5 years experience in specific technologies.

Another side note. If you don’t know already the interview process for dev jobs can be very different than other industries they often involve multiple stages (sometimes several) and involve taking timed tests on practical and theoretical CS ideas, math, reasoning, writing code on a white board and more. It can be a long process and even if you make it the final rounds of interviews you can still fail which can make it quite a challenge to perceiver. 

Long story short last week I got a call back from a recent interview for an internship, telling me they were happy to extend an offer. I am still a little bit in shock and I hesitate to even post this without actually signing the contract just in case something falls through. For me it took about 17 months just to get this far. I am not sure how long it will take you so don’t feel discouraged when you see people ending up with jobs after studying for just two months while you have been at it for longer.

TLDR: The coding path could be longer for you than others and many times you might feel like will want to give up. But as with many things the main thing that will determine your success is if you decide to keep going.

If you have any questions I will be happy answer them.

I have one year left in order to complete my bachelors. Total GPA is 3.3, past year GPA is about 3.5. I have no work experience, no volunteering. I have a website with some personal projects relevant to my field of study, but that doesn't make much difference for employers.

I do not want to stay in academia, I want to work in the industry. Getting a job in the industry depends more on past work experience rather than GPA. In this sense, I feel like I'm lagging behind and I need to get some work experience quick.

My original plan was to enter a terminal masters program, get one or two internships while I am doing my masters and then start working afterwards. 

However, I just got an offer for an entry job with the government for one year (July 2016 to July 2017). This means I will have to quit school for one year, which I am not stoked about. 

Having in mind the fact that industry employers put so much value into past work experience and not so much on academia, is it a good idea to take the job for one year in order to get experience and enrich my CV? Or am I better off just finishing my undergraduate degree and getting internships during my master studies?

I would normally decline the offer, but seeing as I have no work experience and work experience is highly valued in the industry, I feel like it would be wise for me to take this opportunity."

On the old Win 7 i had horrid stutters and fps drops, now i have no stutters just bigger fps drops. Skyrim is 20 fps, Grim Dawn 20, about all games would drop their fps for about 60%. I would get solid 30 fps in the Witcher 3, everything on High now it won't even get to 10 lol. I have an R7 370 2GB, i downloaded the latest driver for Win 10 and nothing, i downloaded the latter one but still no results.

4lrj12,1,2016-05-30,This is my favorite pet project; what area of CS is similar?,yesennes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lrj12/this_is_my_favorite_pet_project_what_area_of_cs/,"I am currently interning and developing Android apps for a smallish company. I enjoy the work, but am not having as much fun with it as my favorite pet project. I am wondering what areas of CS share the qualities I have enjoyed in my pet project.

My project is a symbolic algebra processor; it reads text input, interprets it as an equation, factors it and solves it using algebra i.e. no guess and check. This is what I have liked about it:

- Complicated logic and control flow.
- Minimal library wrangling. Much of my internship has been spent trying to get third party libraries running and playing nicely with each other. I don't hate that, but it's not my favorite thing to do.
-  Little UI design.  Again, I don't hate it, but not what I prefer.
- Designing a complicated system. I liked creating the architecture, designing all the relationships and what should have responsibility for do what.
-  Dealing with absolutes. I could say that, for any test case, it either work or didn't work. I imagine with some programs, such as those used to pick a song based on others you like, you can never be sure its working perfectly, just that it is doing better or worse.

I understand that a couple of companies exist that have products very similar, but better, to my project, and I would love to work on one of them. However, I would like to know what other areas of CS are similar."
4lrsq6,0,2016-05-30,Thinking of a second masters... Wanted to know if it's a good idea.,spetnamu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lrsq6/thinking_of_a_second_masters_wanted_to_know_if/,"I am a MS CS student here at Rutgers, and my GPA is very bad. It's not because, I am bad at programming but it's because most of the CS classes that I am interested in taking are very mathematical/theoretical. I feel like I need to take a few maths/statistics classes to be able to better understand these classes.

This summer I will be interning at a bank and people who interned there last year told me that they mostly will give FT jobs to everyone who interns there. Some 6 or 7 people interned there last year and everyone got a FT offer. 

Now I am happy with the bank, it's a good company, people are friendly, I get to work on Scala, there are some teams that are doing cutting edge work and I might get to work with them too, but it's not a technology oriented firm and I feel to be truly be good at it, I need to know a little bit about finance/economics/commerce or something. I feel it will limit my options in the future.

This year, when I was applying for internships,  apart from this lousy internship I did in India I had 0 work experience and also had a bad GPA, so I got very few interview calls. But now I have this internship and I will also be TA'ing an intro level course which can give me some leverage I believe. Besides, now I know which companies will definitely call people from my college for an interview so I will make sure to apply to them(I missed a lot of companies cause I didn't even knew they existed, like Blackrock, Cray. I was also too late in applying to Amazon, so I can try my luck again this year).

So to further my job prospects, I am thinking of staying back another semester in college and doing a masters in stats. My reasons are as follows.
(1) My college's stats department is similarly ranked as CS, but it is relatively easy to get good GPA in stats, so atleast one of my two degrees will have a good gpa(Could some one tell me if this would give me any advantage?) Also two of stats courses count towards CS so I will have a chance to improve my CS gpa too..
(2) I am extremely interested in machine learning, but I am terribly sucking at it cause I don't have a firm foundation in maths, I am hoping that a stats degree could serve as a bridge course to make me proficient in maths and help me get better at ML.
(3) With a stats degree, I can target way more jobs then I am currently able to(Can someone confirm this?).
(4) With two internships(including next year's internship, if I get one) I will be in a better position when I start applying for full time jobs.

What do you guys think? Also wanted to ask any recruiter out there. If you see someone with a shitty CS gpa but a goodish Stats gpa, would you call him for an interview?"

I'm a subscriber and occasional commenter to /r/gradschool on my main account, but now I would like some advice on a difficult situation.

I'm going to be a fifth year PhD student in an engineering field and I was originally hoping to finish by the end of April 2017. But unfortunately, there's only enough money in our grant to carry me through December 2016. So now my advisor wants me to get out by then. I really do not think that is enough time and I really want to have that extra semester to make sure that I do a good job on my project and my dissertation.

The only reason that I'm in this situation is because of a lack of money. If we had a way to pay for another semester, I'd bet my advisor would be cool with it. But he's not going to help me look for anything and I do not want to have to take out any loans. So now I'm asking you guys to help me figure out some other options.

Before anyone suggests me doing a TA, unfortunately I don't think that is possible. I was a TA last semester in our department for a class dealing with a subject in which I had very little experience. And well, I didn't do a very good job. So now the department thinks that I'm not fit to be a TA and they won't let me be one again. I could look outside the department, but that is not a guarantee since they give preference to their own students and whatever spots are left are very competitive. And it's too early to tell if there will even be anything, so I'd rather not put all my eggs in that basket just yet.

One thing that I would really enjoy doing is work in industry or research in my field, like for a company or scientific organization. Not only will I have more time to make a better dissertation, but I can also get some valuable work experience. But I wonder, is that something that is commonly done? Essentially being an intern or something during a non-summer semester? Or is that all just wishful thinking?

If anybody has any other suggestions, I would be glad to hear them. Thank you.

**TL;DR:** Not enough money, advisor wants me to finish my PhD by the end of the year, I just want one more semester."

4lst3i,6,2016-05-30,TIFU by vacuuming,georgenutmeg,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4lst3i/tifu_by_vacuuming/,"So this was actually a week ago but whatever.  


I have this weird job/internship/volunteer thing I do once every week where I go down to this cool old boatyard/museum and basically do all the boring jobs the people who actually work there don't want to do. (Painting, vacuuming, cleaning, etc.) 

I don't get paid for this, because I'm just a freshman in high school and it's only once a week and the place is non-profit, but my parents give me an allowance for it. And hey, at least it's some experience I use for college essays and future jobs and such. 

Anyways, there were some transportation issues after school that day, so my mom had to drive me over with my bike in the car (I don't remember why) and I locked it up outside the dock. I'm pretty flustered because I'm 15 minutes late for the first time, and I'm not really paying attention to anything. 


I walk inside and and see the guy who usually helps me out and tells me what to do (let's call him Scott) and I see he's actually building a small canoe. I ask him what he's doing, and he replies, ""Filming a commercial for (company)."" I laugh and say, ""Ok, but why are you building the boat?"" I finally decide to look up and see that I'm surrounded with tons of lights and a couple of cameras on some crazy rig, and I immediately nope out of the shot while frantically apologizing to everyone. They didn't really care because it was just a time lapse and I probably didn't get in any of the frames. He was filming a commercial where he builds a boat in 24 hours and that somehow promotes a water bottle that stays cold for 24 hours and they were filming him building it and drinking water from the bottle and stuff. 


Anyways, I talk to another guy who works at the boatyard, and he tells me to prime these wooden covers for an antique drill press, (random, I know) and that when I'm done, if I have time I should clean up some areas with shit tons of sawdust. I start to work away and although these filming guys are a little bit intrusive, I'm not going over there anyways so it doesn't affect me that much. Also it was pretty fun to listen to their conversations because they were so stereotypical for a film crew. The director/boss man had this total superiority complex, but the sort of complainy kind where nothing's ever good enough and everyone is there to serve him, and the interns were trying really hard to work their way into conversations and see what was going on and so on. 


I have 15 minutes left on my ""shift"" and I decide I'm going to be a nice guy and not leave early and instead clean the sawdust up. All the filming guys are outside messing with a drone or getting dinner, so it's just me and Scott, who's busy building a boat in 24 hours. I walk over and grab the vacuum, and start to look for outlets to plug into. My logic was as long as I don't plug into the same sockets and power extensions as them then I'll be fine. I find an empty power extension and plug in, and turn on the vacuum. It seems really weak, so I keep turning it on and off again, when suddenly it's completely out. 


I go to Scott to ask him why it's not working, and see all of their camera equipment is off, along with all their high powered lights. ""Did we just blow a fuse?"" Scott asks. Oh shitshitshitshit is all I can think. God damn it thats like 5 hours of footage and all this equipment that just got unplugged. I know nothing about this stuff, so of course the conclusion I immediately jump to is that they just lost all their footage and will have to redo it and I just wasted a shit ton of money. So Scott goes and resets the fuse or whatever and the powers back on, but they're all out getting lunch, except for the director guy who is outdoors flying a drone. 


Scott says he will talk to them, so I just get on my bike and leave. I'm not dealing with that shit (even though it's my bad). I still don't know what happened. I'm guessing it's not too bad but I thought I would share it because it's sort of unique. I'll find out tomorrow if anything bad happened.  Who knows, maybe they'll get really pissed at me or maybe I'll be let off scott free. 

Big sorry for any grammar/misspellings because mobile. I know it was a lot of words for a pretty small fuck up but I'm a wordy person.

Tldr tried to vacuum ended up breaking a fuse and abruptly turning off a ton of filming equipment that had been going for over 5 hours. Oops"

HVAC and solar heating.

I don't want to excuse myself or anything, just explaining what happened: my mother had a car accident and was hospitalized during the internship, I had to take responsibility for the house and my two siblings (never had any responsibility regarding this, tbh), I was working 50 hours/week, I had just broken up with my 5year girlfriend, and to top things off, my grandmother died in the last week of the internship.

I exploded. Couldn't handle it. I called in sick two days throughout the internship and when the final day came, my boss told me I had to recover those days. I couldn't. I didn't show up. I didn't respond to mails or calls...

One month after, I needed documentation to present at my college... damn... so I had to courage up and go there, and he gave me a lengthy talk about how we all have problems but if I want to be an adult I should learn to deal with them without my work suffering, how he was really disappointed and didn't expect someone from my college (respectable one in my country, top 1 maybe) to do something like I did, that my work was really good but attitudes like mine could really hurt my career, etc. He gave me the papers I needed but it was *really* awkward.

So... what does this mean for me in the future? I still need to do one internship more, and I'm afraid to mention this company because I won't be able to get a recommendation or even appraisal. I'm also afraid to not mention my previous experience because it makes for a weaker CV...

Should I mention the previous experience and explain my situation there if needs be? Or should I just avoid mentioning I worked there for other internships and/or job hunting?

Starting my 2nd week as an intern. I've been assigned to some tickets/bugfixes.

I've been doing my best to learn about the language and I have a *pretty* good idea about what's going on, but to put it clearly, I have no idea why X feature is not working. Some of these I've been spending 1-2 hours on individually.

I've been asking my mentor/other teammates for help and we usually debug these bugs together; however, it often takes a long time (the other day I used 2 hours of another engineer's day helping me debug this one nasty issue.) Is this a bad sign? How many questions would the average intern ask in his/her first few weeks? Am I spending too much/too little time on my own trying to figure out before asking for assistance?

To better this situation, I spent time this weekend reading about the frameworks and debugging further (to no avail.)

so I've decided that I want to get involved in the netsec field

I regularly do VulnHub VMs for fun. My programming skills are quiet poor honestly But I'm working on that. 

I've decided to sit the SATs test in November to get into a BA of computer science with a major in cyber security. 

But I'm curious if there any short courses or such I can do that would help me get a internship or some form to get more into the amazing field. 

I'm currently located in Melbourne, Australia. And I'm not really sure of how the field is in this area."

Picture of my grades: Fall semester, winter semester, spring semester
http://imgur.com/a/PLz0d

The first semester here was absolutely brutal and everyday I thought I didn't have it in me to go through engineering even though I know what I loved doing. I was so conflicted that my brain couldn't keep up with my passion for it. I remember getting an 85 on my statics test (ENES102) without studying and thought this really isn't that bad. I got a 20% and a 25% on the next 2 and failed the class with an F. I was proud to get the minimum C- in chemistry and i couldn't even get above a C+ in a gen ed, Criminal Justice. I was put on academic probation and thought it really is all coming down. I was doubting why I was admitted directly into the engineering school in the first place.

Over the winter I decided to take Statics again so I didn't fall behind. I got a B+ and missed an A- by 2 points (even got my final re-graded but couldn't get the points back). 

At the start of the spring semester I really decided to change stuff up. Between classes I didn't go back to my room, spent time out and about studying. I had joined a engineering club first semester and we won our regional competition in April and now we are on to nationals. Everything seemed to be improving and it really was all in my control. The last week of school I also found out that I have an internship lined up for the summer as well. Obviously I couldn't bring my GPA to a 3.0 but I'm proud of that 2.983 and that I worked my ass off to get that close.

I know this is a long post about my personal year but I just wanted to say even if it's all going to shit, know that you can make it better. Obviously I know it all gets harder from here but as of right now, I feel like I hit that rock bottom after transitioning from high school. Once you decide to grasp the situation, you can move things in your favor. Good luck to everyone !"

What I'm learning in school is software development, and that's what I want to do. But at work all I do is fix computers all day, which means that all I do is basically make a back-up and doing a clean Windows install. They told me that eventually we'll be asked to go to people's homes and try to sell computers and services.

It's only for 5 weeks (now 4 and a half), so what can I do to make the most of my time there? When no one is watching, I go online and study PHP, but that's maybe 1/2 an hour a day."

4lwesl,1,2016-05-31,Unsure About My Future,_TapiocaMan_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lwesl/unsure_about_my_future/,"As a forewarning, this will be a long post, so grab the popcorn. 

First things first, I go to a small school. It's technically a university, but there's a population of maybe 2,500 students. My program (Computer Science) had 5 graduate last year. There's 4 instructors for the entire department. I like to plan ahead, so being me, I'm already planning for my future career even though I still have 1.5 years left. I have most of my upper 300 and 400 classes remaining, but am done with the basics. 

I applied to over 30 internships this summer, and didn't get notified by most of them. I heard back saying I didn't get it from around 5 of them. So currently, I am working a position in PC repair and a position in general IT with two different companies back in my hometown. Not my ideal situation for this summer, but it's working out. However, I constantly stress about where I will end up in the future. It's what's on my mind probably 75% of the day when I'm not occupied with other things. 

My school has no career fair, no large organizations for my field, and definitely no speakers that I could learn from and network with. I've attempted to talk to instructors about possibly helping me find people to talk to about my career, and I mostly either get dead ends or turned away due to their time constraints. It's incredibly frustrating, as that's my only network at this point.

I've worked on one website and custom CMS for a local business, and I've worked on side projects for the IT department at the university, but other than that, I have no significant projects or experience in either software development or web development (however I do have minors in both web development and GIS).

I'm worried and extremely nervous that once I graduate, my degree will be useless. The school I am graduating from will most likely not be recognized by employers, my project base is very small (I have a hard time getting into larger Github projects as I have little experience with large project management), I have very little on paper to set me apart from anyone else, and algorithms/math aren't exactly my strong point. I'm good with analytical and practical thinking, but the logic and theory behind everything is normally still difficult for me to grasp.

If anyone else had similar problems to me, what did you do? How did you end up and are you content with what you currently do? How can I make sure I obtain an internship next summer? I definitely don't want to work in IT Helpdesk positions for the rest of my life. I love web development, I love iOS development, I really enjoy practical applications of what I've learned. I'm just not sure that I will be employable by the time I graduate. 

Edit: For reference, I'm at Lake Superior State University in Michigan, and I'm a senior in Computer Science with minors in Web Development and GIS."

She then mentions an IT internship that she has available but it is only 6 weeks and its 8/hr. ( i make more at my current job). I tell her that I am interested but could she see if I could get paid a lil more She says no. So I decide to just go with it and she ask I send over updated resume and 3 references.

I have kind of a strange situation so I thought I would seek out some advice. 

I am a senior in college and my degree requires an internship for credit. I had an internship lined up this summer however after my first week, the company informed me they didn't budget for an intern and I had to quit the internship. 

I have until June 7th to either find a replacement internship or withdraw from the internship credit and take it at another time. 

I have found the perfect replacement internship at a startup in my industry. I applied yesterday and have not heard anything back yet. As I mentioned above, I need to get hired before June 7th in order to apply this internship to my degree. 

My question is should I email the company and follow up? If so, what should I say? If not, what should I do? I don't have a lot of time to wait around for them to get back to me. 

For clarification: The company is a small (10-12 employees) tech start up in a large city. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!! "

Currently in my GIS Internship, I'm nearing the end of my assigned project.

If given significant time to create, perfect, and finalize a portfolio, what would employers (or yourselves, I'm more interested in what impresses my peers) ideally like to see?

There is multiple months left, and I'm looking to broaden my skills to ensure employment within the company.

I understand that comprehending programming language is necessary, but how can I also showcase all talents using QGIS and ArcGIS Pro?


This is something I'd like to do in my down time or personal time, so I will not be committing time theft (in case there was some professional concern).

I look forward to hearing back from you all.
