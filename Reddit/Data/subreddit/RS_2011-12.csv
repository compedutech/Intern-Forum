mvn5i,3,2011-11-30,Question from soon-to-graduate CS Student,squirrel1337,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mvn5i/question_from_soontograduate_cs_student/,"I am the equivalent of a junior(credit-wise) in the CS program at my college, but am in my fourth year of college because of transferring etc. My question is that by this time next year, I will be completely done with college, save for the second half of a year-long software designing class that I need to complete for my degree. Will any job accept me as a full time worker, even without a degree? I'm really just trying to get into the job market as quickly as possible. 


That being said, my real interest is cyber security. I've had two internships in IT, one working with helpdesk and one that was a little more broad but just working with server installation and helpdesk. 

Now I haven't had any formal teaching in anything like that (being a CS major) but I would really like my first job to have something to do with that. Should I use the fact that I will have basically half a semester free to try and get an internship of some type in that field? Do they even have internships having to deal with cyber security?

Will a CS degree help at all with getting that field, or are the two way different? Is there anything I should study up on before even considering finding a job or internship in the field?

Thanks for your time guys I really appreciate it."

It was my first one and I was quite surprised that I landed it, given my academic performance. I enjoyed working with the team, the other interns, and the recruiters there. I got a job offer and accepted it without pursuing other companies during the period leading up to when I accepted. The pay is really good but I feel like I wouldn't be interested in the work, compared to other companies. 

It's been weeks since I accepted it and I am having second thoughts. I regret that I hadn't reached out to other companies. But then again, I enjoyed everyone at the company I interned for. They gave me the opportunity to work for them when no other company accepted me. The only thing is that I feel like I would enjoy the problems that the other companies are facing.

Some of the other tech companies have reached out to me but I have told them I have commitments already. So what do I do? I want to know if I were to secretly interview with another company and land a position, how would that reflect on me? Would this ruin my image among recruiters in Silicon Valley? How much news is shared between recruiters among popular tech companies in the area? How much does loyalty matter in Silicon Valley, especially for new graduates who were to do something like this?"

Some time ago it struck me that at some point I will have my degree and I have to acually choose how to go on. Now I have a hard time deciding, and i'd like to get some input.

- the bachelor's degree gave me some insight into research methods, statistics and data analysis, basic knowledge of psychology and the vocational education system of my country. Also good analytical and wirting skills.
- although without any formal training, i'm fairly computer literate and can program in various languages and contexts. Being a bit of a nerd I had that as a hobby during highschool years and took some small programming jobs during uni.
- while at uni I had a job at it's research management department, organizing and editing an internal magazine reporting about research projects and findings.

Currently I'm a research intern at the Department of Education of an Australian university for the rest of the year (I'm from Europe), after that I'll have to finish my bachelor's thesis and after that there's nothing but a big black hole. I have the urge to do someting meaningful and finally be motivated to work hard for a goal. I'm posting this in a desperate attempt to get some random advice and ideas which may inspire or motivate me. 
I'm now 24 and i feel that if I want to achieve anything meaningful in my life, the time for deciding for a direction is running out. Acutally I'm constantly fighting the thought that it may be too late..."

* my course is Electronic and Electrical Engineering, 4 years sandwich (industrial placement in year 3)
* so far I'm enjoying it and got firsts (&gt;70%) on all my assignments
* my ideal workplace would be in the aero-space industry, ideally NASA or ESA or a company developing space-faring technology.
* I would like to move to Australia or the US after completing my degree (BEng or IEng depending on how well I do in the following years.)

with that in mind, 


* how likely is it that I will find a job in engineering after completing my degree? 
* what would I need to do to get a job in aero-space?
* is it ~~naive~~ overly optimistic for me to have this goal considering the current economic climate, and the budgets cuts for all space agencies?
* where should I look for a summer internship?
* should I get part-time employment or focus on getting better marks? which one is more important for a future employer?
* what would be the must have books for my course in your opinion?
* how's the current immigration climate in the US? Is it feasible to look for employment over the pond?

n0bfm,2,2011-12-04,Need help with roommate problem,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n0bfm/need_help_with_roommate_problem/,"Background story between myself and my roommate.  I just secured a position of unpaid full year internship and was looking for a place to live near my workplace.  I searched through Craigslist for cheap rental option.  I came across one ad and seems legit.  I have never met him in person and had to rely on emails to get to know each other.  I drove to see the apartment and met my landlord who was very nice to open the door for me to check it out before I sign the lease.  Everything seems to be good.  He sounds pretty cool and nice and the apartment is very nice for a very cheap rent.  He's a graduate student for a college near our apartment.

Since we have lived with each other, I have never had a problem with him and we seemed to live with harmony though we never tried to forage a personal relationship as a roommate. We were just there as roommate, nothing more, nothing less.  The only place that we share is the living room and kitchen as well as laundry room.  Knowing that the three areas are the one that we have to share, I knew that I would need to clean after I used the stuff whether if it's mine or his stuff.  Even if I left the dishes or kitchen items on the sink, I always make sure to clean it at either the same day or the day after.

He brought in slow cooker and George Foreman grill for us to use in the kitchen.  I have used it several time with no complaint from him.  A couple of weeks ago, I've made soup with the slow cooker right before Thanksgiving Break.  I was going to clean it up but my friends(or interns) dragged me to go out the night before I had to fly back home for Thanksgiving.  I brought the pot and filled it with water so it would be easy for me to clean up.  I figured that I would be home before him since I have an early flight back home on Saturday.  I came home only to see the pot are cleaned.  My roommate was kind of harsh with the fact that I left it uncleaned and it smelled so he had to clean.  I apologized to him and said I had intended to wash the pot but my friend came by and dragged me to go out to the bar.  I simply didn't have enough time to clean it up since I had an early morning flight with a bad hangover.

That brings it to last night. I worked all day last night and was tired and hungry.  I made grilled chicken, using the George Foreman grill.  After eating dinner, I put dishes away and simply put wet paper towel over the grill to make it easier for me to clean.  I had intended to clean it up later that night.  I was in my room, sleeping on my own bed.  My roommate woke me up with a text saying ""I came home and noticed that the grill was not clean.  I must re-inteirate(sp?) that you do not use my things.""  I replied back, ""I'm sorry but I worked all day today and was tired.  I meant to clean it up tonight"".  He said ""Please do not my things.  You have lost the right to use it"".  I woke up this morning only to see the slow cooker and George Foreman grill not at the kitchen.  He took it to his room.  The funny thing is he always emphasizes cleaning after yourself, but he would always forget to his clothes in washer/dryer, and leave dishes at the sink for a long period of time.  He did it with any warning of some sort.  That left me pissed and I knew that by coming to him with any sort of emotion would not yield a positive result.

I always get along with pretty much everybody and never had anger problem.  Even in college, I have never had a problem with roommates.  This is the first time that I have a problem with a roommate and am angry at him for his action. 

So reddit, how do I resolve the problem in a calm, peaceful manner.

**TL;DR: Lived with a roommate that I met through Craigslist.  Had no problem with him.  Used George Foreman grill and forgot to clean it after myself after working all day.  He said I lost the rights to use his things and took it away from me.**"

mzny8,0,2011-12-04,In Need Of A Course Correction:  Can YOU Point The Way?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mzny8/in_need_of_a_course_correction_can_you_point_the/,"When I graduated from high school, my resume was flawless:

- Perfect score on my SAT
- Straight A's in mostly honors courses
- Valedictorian; elected to speak at graduation

Opportunity abounded. After mulling several scholarship alternatives, I chose one of the very top public universities. Off to start my life.

When I replay my memories like an old VCR tape, I think back to the way day one of college should have gone. I walk into a room and meet with a counselor. I am seated in a really comfortable chair. We spend hours talking, exploring my talents, interests, strengths and weaknesses. What drives me. What gives me focus. How I want my life to look in 10 years. We identify three or four fields that might be the best fit for me. I emerge from the meeting with a sense of excitement for the opportunity to sample classes in each of these fields, and get a better sense of which one I should focus on. The counselor and I continue to meet regularly throughout my first year, and by June, I've selected a major. Over the next three years, I develop a real passion for what I'm studying. I meet with professors, read the latest journals, network, establish a better sense of my career path. By graduation day, I'm a top student again, as expected, and I have a summer internship lined up. Life is wonderful. Yay me.

That's when the VCR tape starts melting and burning at the same time. This is possible, mainly because video cassettes are a composite technology with a few different materials. Trust me, this can happen.

Anyway, we're getting sidetracked here, because the point is, my fantasy hits a wall when I compare it with the reality of my real first day of college. My parents dropped me off, helped me move into my new room, lingered nervously for a few hours, and finally, thankfully, left. I was living on my own independent for the first time. Able to make my own choices, without structure or supervision. Free at last!

College was a disaster. I had no sense of myself; no clue what I was here on Earth to do. I studied a wide range of classes, based mostly on which ones allowed me to maintain a T Th 1PM-5PM schedule. Occasionally, I was grudgingly forced to embrace a Friday morning class. And believe me, I resented it.

It didn't matter, though, because I rarely went to class anyway. I was brutally depressed. I had no purpose in living, and it was obvious now. Nothing I was doing was intentional anymore - I was only reacting to circumstance and plodding through my day without a motive force. I barely graduated at all, and when I did, I searched high and low for a job that I thought would make me money. It didn't.

It has been eight and a half years since I finished school. I have a relatively good job as an analyst at a large company. I am well respected in the context of what I do. Not simply a subject matter expert on particular things, I am seen as a generally ""smart"" person who is capable of solving problems, executing, and delivering on objectives. I am paid very well - at least by general standards - and my job security, while it can never be iron-clad in this environment of the constantly whirling lay-off wood chipper, is pretty solid.

Did I mention that I hate my life? That I am completely miserable? Well, that's the point of this post, so it would behoove me to do so.

I hate my life. I am completely miserable.

I always believed I was destined for great things, and I still believe that in a dark corner of my soul that rarely sees light and seldom gets fed or nourished. I want to embrace the possibilities of life and take actions I can be proud of. One of the areas I've been working on is trying to create a vision of what I'd like my life to look like - and one important element is my career.

What I am asking for, in this thread, is for guidance on how I can go about brainstorming, exploring, evaluating, and ultimately, narrowing down some career options that would meet the following objectives:

- Opportunity for creativity to shine
- The feeling of flow - being so immersed in something I excel at, to the extent that hours pass in the grasp of optimal creativity and productivity
- Being admired or honored for my accomplishments
- A career where pure, raw intelligence is a critical asset
- The chance for both competition and collaboration

Skills That I Bring:

- Pure, Raw Intelligence
- Ability to appreciate the big picture and the detail level simultaneously; depth of field/scope
- Extremely effective communication skills, particularly in writing
- Mastery of tone; the ability to carefully attend to the subtleties involved in dealing with people at different levels
- Analytical ability - someone who identifies key questions, understands how to investigate them, and delivers/messages useful results
- Modesty (just kidding - put that in for a laugh)

The ideal result for me, through this thread, would be to connect with someone who has professional experience in facilitating these kinds of dialogues. Helping someone identify their most important objectives, greatest assets, and brainstorm all of the possibilities that might appeal to them.

For example: assume we discussed law. I'd want to consider all aspects of the pathway to a legal career. My likelihood of being accepted to a good law school. The value of one tier of law school versus another. What kind of job prospects would exist upon graduating? Which field of law would be the most appealing and/or accessible and why? What steps would I need to take to get myself where I want to be in that career?

So, it involves consideration of all of the important gauges; satisfaction, opportunity, income, cost, chance of success. I need to think through these things with someone who is a subject matter expert in this area. I need someone to help me create a framework for success in determining direction in my career.

Can you help?

(tl;dr - I need someone to help me choose a career)

They came to my math 125 class a month or so back and asked us to fill out a little piece of paper with some information on it if we were interested. I filled it out, and didnt think much of it until weeks later, when I got a call from them asking if I was still interested. As I was looking into jobs at the time, I said yes, and a meeting was scheduled.


The first meeting was at a Tully's near campus, and it was basically an info session. It went alright, and the interviewer told me to expect a call later on in the evening, which I got. It was a kind of phone interview where they asked if i was positive about it and stuff, of which I said yes. They then scheduled me for a final meeting the week after, which was to be a formal business interview.


I went, and they told me I got a job, again asking me to affirm that I am 100% with them. Throughout this whole process, it seemed pretty official and I dont have much experience with the process anyways so I can't really judge for myself. 


However, the internship seemed too good to be true- I was told I'd make thousands and thousands of dollars, up to $20,000 during the job. I kind of wondered why it wasn't well known but chalked it up to being a new company. I talked to some friends about it and it was then that I started to hear some stuff about Collegeworks being a scam, with interns not being paid and stuff like that.


I went to the first orientation of the company today, and it seemed alright. I saw a few friends of mine from highschool there and we went to lunch- there we all found out that we'd heard from various sources bad stuff about Collegeworks. When I got home, I looked it up, and it seems Collegeworks has a pretty controversial reputation. I'd looked it up before I committed, but didn't do a very thorough job and chalked up the dissatisfaction of a few bad reviews to be just that- disgruntled employees and customers.


A more thorough research showed lots of bad reviews, by both past interns and customers. However there were also a good amount of good reviews. Since its the internet I can't be sure what to trust- the majority of the reviews might just be one or a few person making many posts to give a bad name to Collegeworks. 


The cmopany doesnt seem to be a scam in the sense of stealing money. It is legit enough, but it seems its the way it operates that is seen as a scam. Bad reviews tell of interns being lied to about profit- instead of tens thousands, some claimed to only make a few thousand working hours that would pay more even on a minimum wage job. Note that pay is based on both commission from locking down paint jobs as well as a base pay of minimum wage.


Reviews vary a lot so I'll leave it to the redditors to check- google ""Collegeworks Painting Scam"" or something like that will garner you a bunch of results. 

If anyone has any advice or anything on what to do please comment or pm me. Thanks reddit!"

I am a 20 year old American female in my second year at college (in the southeast). I'm the oldest child and the only girl of 3 children (two younger brothers, 19 and 14). I am an English major, an A student, have been published in the New York Times, and have worked as an editing intern for several major publishing companies. I have glowing recommendation letters from professors and past employers. I have never been arrested, and I have had only one traffic ticket (for failing to turn my brights down within 1500 feet of an oncoming vehicle). I vacuum my room regularly, do laundry once a week, and call my parents every day. 

I do drink, moderately, being in college. My parents don't know this--or didn't, until this past weekend. They were going through my room and found some beer bottles I had stashed behind some books on my bookshelf (bad move, I realize, but I was home for the summer, took a few beers from the fridge to drink while I read a book, and didn't know how to throw them out without them realizing I'd taken them). Now they think I'm a deceptive alcoholic and am on my way to certain death. 

In high school I had some trouble with eating disorders and depression, but some medication helped tremendously, and now I'm an obviously fully functional and healthy person. My parents are flipping their shit. They've told me that they are going to make my Christmas break miserable, and I'm so scared to go home for Christmas in a week and a half that I am literally sick with dread. I spent all weekend crying and throwing up--because my dad told me that he should have given up on me a long time ago, as ""it's one thing after another with you"". 

What can I do to make them realize that this is insane? I am so tired of being the problem child, and I wish they could see that I am not as bad as they think. 

tl;dr: Parents found beer bottles and are freaking out, despite the fact that I am not that horrible. "

I work in kind of rotating Internship program. I intern in the Fall and Winter, and others intern in the Spring and Summer. During your internship, you always have a chance of rehire if your current employer likes you enough.  
  
Because of the rotations, and the goal of the internship being to give you real-world experience, I help interview the next group of interns. I just got the list of interviewees and happen to know one of them from a past internship. I helped interview him, the company hired him.  
  
I was talking to one of my friends who worked with him after he got hired (I was gone when he started) and he said the dude was just horrible. He was very lazy, had an attitude and just recently got fired (part-time, after the standard internship) because he didnt show up for 4 weeks. (Don't worry, he is alive considering he just sent us his resume)  
  
So the question here is, do I talk him up after the interview and get him hired, or do I tell my boss the truth? If he gets the job and is just horrible, I would look like a saint thus severely improving my odds of being hired permanently.

I checked out a copy of [Computer Graphics Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Graphics-Programming-Allen-Sherrod/dp/1584505168/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323266089&amp;sr=1-1) from my university's library yesterday, but the reviews on Amazon don't look too promising.

Eventually I would like to start working on graphics demos in hopes of getting an internship for next summer."
n3leg,6,2011-12-07,Question for Computer Engineers: Is life after college just programming?,efletch,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/n3leg/question_for_computer_engineers_is_life_after/,I am currently a Junior studying Computer Engineering. I am looking for summer internships and all the companies that have called me for interviews are looking for software developer interns. I don't particularly mind because I'm a compsci minor but I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever use any of the circuits/signals knowledge that I've learned. I've found most of my CompE friends are in the same situation. Do actual CompE jobs exist? Do CompEs just become glorified programmers?
n3dyd,4,2011-12-06,Machine Learning jobs with a BS? ,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n3dyd/machine_learning_jobs_with_a_bs/,"Hey all - CS Junior here, getting my BS and thinking about job prospects.

I'm looking for something Machine Learning related - I'm taking a class on the subject and plan to take more, I've read a lot about the subject, and I'm hoping to do my undergrad thesis on something ML related. I've had Software Engineering internships, but nothing specifically ML-based.

My question is, will I be able to get a Machine Learning/Data Mining Job straight off my BS? Most of the jobs I see posted for such positions are for Masters/PhD people; while I expect to get a Masters at some point, I wasn't really counting on a PhD since I'm not looking to go into Academia. Will I absolutely need a Masters right off the bat? Will I need a PhD at all? Is there anything else I should be doing to improve my chances?"
n382u,8,2011-12-06,Just Another Random Dude,Dunnowhyimabadperson,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n382u/just_another_random_dude/,"Hey all, I doubt anyone will read this, as it's gonna be wall of text to the max. this is more of a confession/rant than anything else. It's not that important, nor is it anything new. There's some personal information here, but not enough for people who don't know me to find me. Also, not many people I know Reddit, and even fewer browse SW haha.

 I have an amazing life. I have a family who loves me, I was raised as a Christian (not as a religious person, but as a Christian. My family always taught me to basically imitate Christ and not buy into any organized religion bullshit. If I don't agree with the bible, my parents encouraged us to find what makes us happy. My brother's a gay Agnostic, for example.) I'm constantly reading self-improvement books, (picked up Failing Forward Recently, it's really good) and I read and reread them, trying to make me a better person. My parents never put pressure on me to do anything with my life, they've always told me to do what makes me happy.

I've tried to be a good person all my life. I come from an eight person family, and my best friends are my siblings. I have no home problems, I  enjoy a moderate amount of drinking, smoking, video games, exercise, etc. I'm a textbook balanced individual with a good home life.

I have an amazing girlfriend who makes me happy when I'm with her. She's so incredibly in love with me that she would do anything for me, and has proven this fact on occasion.

I went to high school in the Midwest, was popular and well-liked, and somehow I ended up at an Ivy League College. I'm 21, and I have a decent GPA, a solid friend group, and 2 close guy friends who I can tell almost anything. I have a great job for a college kid, I have an amazing internship lined up for the Summer, and my resume is a boss. I've interned in law offices, under senators, and I'm currently running a small non-profit program. My parents can't afford to support me in any way, so I pay my own way through college. I had to take out some loans, but I've been on r/frugal and I've been reading books on how to make sure I'm not to far when I get out.

I've always been told that I'm the happiest, funniest, friendliest guy people know. I've always been told that it's weird how much everyone likes me. Personally, I've always seen myself as a manipulator who can get people to do whatever he wants. 

If you're still reading, then here's the problem. I don't care any more. I don't care about my college, I don't care about my friends, I don't care  about anything. The only time I really care is when I'm with my girlfriend or my two guys. Then, and only then, do I care about them. After I say goodbye, I can't help but thinking about how much better things would be if they didn't know me/ I didn't know them. When I'm with my girlfriend, it is the only time I am truly happy. When I'm not with her, I can't stand the thought of us being stuck together. Before we dated, we were best friends for 3 years. We've been dating for 9 months now, and I can honestly say I want to spend the rest of my life with her. But I can't stand the thought. I can honestly say the only thing I can think of that is wrong with her is that she's not good at board games or many video games. But she is always willing and is always a good sport. We made plans to start playing DnD next weekend as a study break. She's fun, beautiful, smart, willing, cute....she is my dream girl. And I love her.

I've been in a slump for a while. I don't know why. And when I say a while, I mean for the past 2 years or so. I...I always think about suicide. Not in a really serious way, but like whenever I see a knife I think ""Man that would end it really quickly."" Or I'll just be in bed and think about jumping out the window, or hanging myself. I've been doing this since high school, and I'm only just now realizing how unnatural this is. The only time I've really seriously thought about attempting it was when I had to quit ROTC, I just wanted an excuse not to go for just one day so I cut myself really, really deep along one arm. while I was doing it I thought about just moving the knife over one inch to sever the artery...I wasn't scared or anything, I just couldn't do it to my family. I dropped out of ROTC the next week and cried for the first time in years. not because I almost killed myself, but because I was such a huge colossal failure.

Anyway, two nights ago I was hanging with one of my friends who I knew liked me. Neither  of us had ever acted on it, because I'm in love with my girlfriend and because she's a good person. Plus, there's no physical attraction there for me at all. We've been friends  since freshman year, and we've been good friends at that. But two nights ago we kissed. I don't know why I did it. I told her that it felt right, and it did, to an extent, but not for emotional or physical purposes. It felt right because I finally found a way to feel like I not everything was perfect. That I would have a reason to...I dunno...finally get what I deserved. To hurt people? To hurt myself? To destroy the only good thing I have going for me? I want to say that I was just horny, that I was just doing it because there was a warm body, but there was nothign like that. There was not physical attraction. There was no emotional bond other than friendship. I don't know why I did it, I don't know why I did it and I just keep playing it over and over in my head but there was no reason for it. 

I told my girlfriend what I did immediately after. She took a day to cool off, and then asked me sincerely if I wanted to be with her. I do. I do I do I do. But I don't. I can't make her stay by me when I do this sort of thing. But in this case it was just my baser selfish self saying that yes I do want to be with her. I can't tell her that I'm going to hurt her because I can convince myself when i'm with her that I wont. But when I'm by myself, I know I will, because that's who I am and that's what I do. I'm going to hurt her, I'm going to hurt my family, my friends, and my love. It's who I am. I'm going to fail at life, I'm incredibly fake and I just want to end it. I want to do it in a way that makes it look like an accident so no one blames them self. I'm tired of letting people down and failing in my life. I'm tired of people thinking that I'm a good person when I'm a bad one. My girlfriend told me that it was a mistake. That she's furious, but that she knows that it'll only happen once. and that she is already forgiving me for it because she knows how much it hurt me. 

What the fuck Reddit?! I cheated on her! How can she say that? I always thought that I wouldnt be capable of cheating. And this wasn't for anything tangible that I can think of. it's just because I guess on some level I like things to fall apart. I don't know. But right now, all of a sudden I don't want to die. Not really. I just want to not be born. that would be so much better. I wish that I wasn't here. I might just disappear. It would be better for everyone. The suicide thoughts are gone right now. I'm still gonna post this though, because they'll be back tomorrow. And the next night. And the next. Is it sad I'm more excited than anything else for when I finally get the balls to follow through with it? I mean, I've wasted everyone's time here because I have thoughts I don't have enough willpower and motivation to seriously consider for more than five minutes or so. It's pathetic. Anyway, asides from that, I have no motivation to do anything at all. At all. AT ALL. At all. At all... whatever. Here's hoping I get some motivation/willpower soon right?

TL:DR: I'm a stupid asshole who wasted your time. Sorry."
n4v1v,2,2011-12-08,"I have an ethical, work-related question",Its_What_I_Do,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n4v1v/i_have_an_ethical_workrelated_question/,"Ok, so here is the backgroud:  
 
I work in kind of rotating Internship program. I intern in the Fall and Winter, and others intern in the Spring and Summer. During your internship, you always have a chance of rehire if your current employer likes you enough.  
  
Because of the rotations, and the goal of the internship being to give you real-world experience, I help interview the next group of interns. I just got the list of interviewees and happen to know one of them from a past internship. I helped interview him, the company hired him.  
  
I was talking to one of my friends who worked with him after he got hired (I was gone when he started) and he said the dude was just horrible. He was very lazy, had an attitude and just recently got fired (part-time, after the standard internship) because he didnt show up for 4 weeks. (Don't worry, he is alive considering he just sent us his resume)  
  
So the question here is, do I talk him up after the interview and get him hired, or do I tell my boss the truth? If he gets the job and is just horrible, I would look like a saint thus severely improving my odds of being hired permanently.  
  
So Reddit, what should I do?"

I have graduated with a Civil &amp; Materials engineering B.S. (Or will this week), and the job hunt has been brutal. With my mediocre grades (3.1 gpa) and lack of internship experience, not to mention the atrocious job market for Civils, I am in between a rock and a hard place.

With this in mind I have always been quick to learn and pick up new programs and concepts easily, and as the CS/IT job market seems to be much better I am considering learning the material and picking up the various certs in order to make myself employable. Thus far (with my very limited CS knowledge) it seems that IT is the way to go, and that the CCNA cert is the primary one needed to be employable. Is this the case? And if not what other certs are 'required' to be employable. Does anyone have any suggestions about study materials etc. and the viability of this plan?

Thank you for any responses."

n5upf,96,2011-12-08,The Fourth Floor Hall,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/n5upf/the_fourth_floor_hall/,"I switched from fry cook manager to certified nursing assistant about a year ago. My fiancee convinced me that he had the income to support us while I went to school to change careers. I'm glad he did, because I think I would have strangled the next idiot to come through the drive-thru. We shared a small apartment on the east side together, and my fiancee paid for my schooling and put a roof over my head doing IT work for the school district.

Shortly after ""graduating"" the CNA courses and doing my internship at a local hospital, I picked up a job at a nursing home about twenty miles from town. It was a private institution, but I quickly learned that its standards of care weren't as high as I expected, and people were left with call lights on a little too long. Most of the people were late-state hospice or Alzheimer's patients, and could be a little strange themselves. After a few weeks of work I began getting used to the job, because it paid well, and no one else was really hiring in the area. I tried to make things better, but I was mostly swimming upstream. AM girls didn't give a shit about the patients, and spent most of their time smoking or blabbing in the halls about vapid topics. PMs were a little better, but I ended up on the midnight shift, when patients were usually asleep by, but one disturbance could get a whole hall up in arms.

Goddamn, the midnight shift. Nursing homes are creepy enough during the day, even well-run ones, but this ancient building was positively terrifying at night. Old people would wheel out from some random room and beg me to help them--with what? Nothing in particular--they just got agitated sometimes. I got used to the vibe of the place and the way things were done, but there was one hall where the call lights took almost a half hour or more to answer sometimes. I quickly learned that no one, even the male nurses, wanted to go up there at night. I thought this was ridiculous, we still have living patients up there, and they needed tending to.

A call light came on on the fourth floor one night, and since I was the new girl, I had to answer it. I shook my head and took the elevator to the fourth floor. No nurses were up here at all, which I thought was odd, as I got off. I found the patient easily enough--he had just woken up and needed to go to the bathroom. No big deal, I thought. I took him through his paces and laid him back into bed. Maybe this whole thing was just some sort of stupid prank, I thought.

That is, until I looked behind me and a black robed shadow was standing behind me. I froze, not wanting to scare the man I had just put to sleep, but he woke up, and even in his Alzheimer's gutted brain I could see the fear in his eyes. The room got excessively cold, then it disappeared. The patient got all agitated again, and I snapped out of it and put him back to bed.

I went back out into the hallway and looked around. There was nothing out there. I heard footsteps coming up behind me, and thought maybe another nurse came up to check on me. I turned around, and nothing was there.

After answering that call light I asked the other nurses about that hall. ""Oh, it's haunted,"" they said as-a-matter-of-factly. ""Most nursing homes have one, seeing as people die in them all the time. Ours is just a bit more haunted than others.""

More curious than scared, I started regularly answering call lights on that hall. Sometimes it was little things, like a pen would go missing, or I'd hear footsteps and nothing would be there. Sometimes it was more pronounced, like shadowy figures stalking the hallways, a cold spot, or even a column of light. I'd eventually see half-apparitions of people, sort of gray in color, appear at the end of the hallway, or wheelchairs roll themselves from one room to another with no one in them. I started getting used to it, but none of the other nurses would usually answer those call lights, deferring to me since I was the ""brave one.""

Strangely, the effects only seemed to happen when a nurse was alone on the floor. If another one came up there, almost nothing happened, but no one ever thought going up to that floor as a pair was a good idea. Management at those places can be thick, sometimes.

I can only imagine what that floor is like for the patients. They say people close to death can see more than the living, and I'm not up there every night all night, so I can only figure what they see is worse than anything I've experienced, and they have no way out--except to die. I learned that the fourth floor patients don't sleep very well, and now I know why."

- I'm in junior/senior level CS courses at my university. A year ago I transferred from another school. My GPA at my old school was good but the one at my school is a bit low (although still above 2.0). I'll likely end up failing one or two classes this semester because of some depression issues that i'm starting to get care for.

- Not too long ago, I had an unpaid IT internship. I feel I got some valuable experience (ran the helpdesk myself sometimes, plus PHP, Active Directory, etc), although i don't know how i'd feel about putting the employer as an actual 'reference' on there. Aside from that, the last actual paying job I had was about a year and a half ago (customer service, tutoring jobs).

- I know some Java, PHP/MySQL, C, plus knowledge of Windows/Linux/OSX, networking concepts, etc. Presently i'm learning Rails. However, I don't have much to show for this aside from some PHP projects that i don't really feel are worthy of being put online.

I might be taking a semester off from school or go part-time, and need a way to pay the bills during this time. Of course I could go for a typical customer service job, but if possible i'd like to do IT work. All this said, might it be feasible for me to look for a paid IT job or internship at this point?

I live in a big metro with lots of IT jobs and a relatively good job market. I feel that i'm plenty capable of doing helpdesk work, and could do 'entry-level' web coding work after a week or two of getting acclimated to their framework, practices, etc. However, i'm not sure how reasonable it would be for me to go applying for jobs with these issues (no degree/certifications, lowish GPA, no portfolio to show). 

What would be the best way to go about this? I've poked around on Craigslist/Dice/etc, but of course most postings want experience/credentials greater than what I have.  Should I go ahead and apply for 'entry-level' ones that I have most of the prerequisite skills for? Might I get some responses if I posted my resume? Maybe spend a week or two working my ass off to throw together a web app or two to put on my resume? Plus I've heard decent things about some IT staffing agencies; do they typically hire people with a resume like mine?

Thanks all!"

1. Find a job
2. Find someone 
3. Become fit (I was normal/skinny)

If I failed I decided I would kill myself to stop being a burden on my family/society (they have enough burdens as it is)

A year has passed, I finished college and my internship, but I've been unemployed for 6 months (I've lost count of how many jobs I've applied to in many different fields). I'm about to run out of money and I'm 18k in debt (thanks school). 

I have a family but I can't return back home, mainly because of my deadbeat alcoholic father who doesn't do anything, and tells everyone else in my family that they're not doing shit (can't say anything about it to him, he's extremely mentally unstable, will snap and take it out on my mother). It makes me physically ill to be around him (hes put my mother and my sister through hell). Every time he talks to me or even touches me a killing intent rises in my body.

I'm more alone now than ever, I've actually lost the bulk of my friends (they moved, found jobs, etc), and I'm nowhere close to being mentally stable enough to sustain a relationship with someone. I have self-esteem and confidence issues even though I've been told by several people that I'm physically attractive (even other guys tell me I'm attractive). I am more muscular than I was last year, but I'm not fit, In fact I feel like shit most of time and I was actually more fit last year (cardiovascular wise). 

I'm 23 now, I'm socially retarded, unemployed (seemingly unemployable), in debt, all the standard depressed reasons. I don't really want to kill myself, but I know exactly how and when I'm going to do it. I just don't know what to do anymore, and I know its my fault. I didn't work hard enough in school, I didn't do anything to change my family, and I didn't develop my social skills. I failed. "

This was mostly a feat done by my brother, and although I made this an evident point, he still asked if I was interested in an internship. Although being far from a computer expert (but knowing my way around a computer and hardware), I agreed.

He gave me his business card and wants me to e-mail him. How does this fourteen-year-old make this internship work? Tips and recommendations are greatly appreciated.

Eric often invites Molly to join him in threeways and most of their conversations involve discussing sex in some fashion. I have no doubt the Marine has no idea his girlfriend is sharing details of their sex life for some other guy to get hard to, nor does this Marine know she's slept with someone else.

Am kind of depressed and thinking negatively, so some fresh advice would be appreciated please.   

*Background:* I have 10 years of office and retail experience; I am a published writer with experience in the music industry. I live in Los Angeles. 
I was fired in July from my last job (office admin type of work) due to an undiagnosed sleep problem I've had forever. I have been diagnosed with delayed sleep phase disorder. My desired career of choice is working with Asian artists here in LA, and I have gone through nearly all the options (and been ripped off by so many people). I applied to an Asian record company, my last bet.   
  
I got an immediate interview, but instead of a job, I was offered a 3 month unpaid internship (parking &amp; lunch paid) instead of the usual 6 month internship.  
The company is really small - Pres, VP, three office workers, and two freelancers on call. Everyone is Japanese but the VP, who is American. When hired, I'm told that they ""don't know what to do with me"" and I am to create my own internship. My writing background proves to be very useful as they badly need help writing bios and editing badly translated English. I'm not fluent in Japanese but I've taken a couple years of it. VP openly states that he has no talent for writing, and I get lots of praise for my work.  
   
The two office workers are S and H, and we get along well. The VP and I work well together. The Pres is in his office and sort of oblivious to what's going on with his employees. The music industry is tanking, so he's busy thinking of new ventures - music schools, energy drinks, festivals, etc.  
Internship ends early November. Pres tells me in a vague, Japanese way that I would be useful but the budget is low and so he can't hire me right now, but maybe in the beginning of December.... basically he didn't say no or yes. I leave when the end date comes.  
  
In the three months I was there, I tried very hard to find a part time job around the two-day-a-week internship without success. I have basically no income since my last job (minus an occasional freelance job). I am in serious debt, and am very depressed. Because my circadian rhythm is basically borked, I am on a very strict sleep schedule to try to regulate it. My lack of morning availability, in an employers market, means I do not get hired out of 10 or so interviews for retail work or office jobs.  
  
I follow up with the record label in December. I was told to come into the office on Friday to meet with Pres, VP, and H. Turns out, office worker S's visa got denied when she reapplied. She is leaving in late December. They want me to fill her job. I don't know what she does all day, and they don't really tell me. All her work is in Japanese so over the months, I've never been able to read her screen or paperwork. I know her work has nothing to do with writing.   
They want me to work three days a week, and maybe five when it gets busy, 7 hours a day ish. However, they can only pay $9/hr. The minimum wage in California is $8/hr. When I worked at CVS for two years in 2007, they started me at $9.30. I had to leave CVS because I wasn't able to save money. 
  
*Conclusion:* Internship wants to hire me to replace employee who is leaving for terrible pay and unstable availability. Considering I haven't been able to find work since July, I am highly doubting that I can find another job on top of this. I also suspect that they want me in this job because they can't attract anyone at that pay range. I feel that they're taking advantage of me, not hiring me due to skills. I highly doubt of any opportunity in moving up in the company. I'm 25, and I need to start investing in a career.       
  
Thus, I don't feel like I can take it even though I'm piss poor and still fighting unemployment. Am I right or wrong? "

This semester i took Digital Logic, and in my own sparetime over the last 6 years i have learned a few languages and become familiar with several others. Languages include C, Verilog, C++, BASIC, VB, Java, LabView, Perl, JavaScript and Python. I also work on small projects using AVR's and BASIC Stamps. Finally, next semester i will be taking Object Oriented Programming and Data Abstraction. I am also proficient in handling windows well beyond the task manager (sysinternals=love), i have played with various linux distros and i have tried my hand at the terminal and programming/scripting from within terminals on both linux and windows.

The point is, I am obviously well versed for a college freshman but i have no idea how to express that in a resume. Furthermore, my OOPDA class will probably be the most powerful force in my resume but i wont even be taking that until next semester. This is an issue because i would like to get this whole application process done during the break, not in june when i will finally get my grades and i would like to be starting.

Essentially my question is how do i make all of my own personal education and highschool/first-college-semester education look better to prospective employers?

This Christmas season, I've set out to build a PC. All my life, I've been ""that kid"" who is using an old office computer to game. I've had a few ""nicer"" office computers, but nothing designed for gaming. For a very long time, all I ever knew was low settings and 20 FPS. Even today, on my laptop, I get maybe 40FPS on Source games and by making the resolution 800x600.

That all is about to change. No more will I be held down by the restraints of a poor rig! I shall finally be able to experience games as they were meant to be played!

Except I don't know shit from shinola. The last time I ""built"" a computer, I was in 8th grade and we merely installed hard drives and RAM. I can ask for help with the physical part of building the rig from a fellow at the company I intern at. But besides that, I'm flying blind. I've read most of the beginner guides, and even then I'm overwhelmed. I read post here, and it seems like every day something newer and better is coming out, and I don't know what to get.

So I come to you, begging for advice. For the most part, I understand dealing with computers once they are up and running. Dealing with the parts is a whole need field to me. Plus, I always fear that I'll break something, a fear giving to me by father (To this day, the words ""Luke! You break everything"" still echo in my years.)

Budget-wise, I'm running at about 800 dollars, though it can go over slightly if it must. I don't need a keyboard and mouse, seeing as I can upgrade those later. Monitor wise, I should be able to get one or two for very cheap, if not free, thanks to my father. Case wise, I don't care. It can look like an old monochrome box for all I care. I just want it to run well.

tl;dr - Newbie to building, and scared shitless. Has about 800/850 dollars to spend. No need for monitors/mouse/keyboard."

I'm working my first tech support job as an intern.  Our area in the building is in the basement (I know, SHOCKER!) right next to the raised floor with the old IBM ES390 mainframe.  The intern area is right inside the doors off the loading ramp for the raised floor.  Leaving the raised floor to the ""customer"" area, perpendicular to the door leading to the area I'm working in are these double doors with a big red mushroom button next to them that shuts off power to the whole raised floor.  Right below that red button is a green one, same shape and size, that deactivated the maglock to open the door....  My best friend works there also, he's a tape monkey for the backups on the ES390.  One Saturday, I'm building/imaging PCs for my ""customers"" (we were each assigned a department to work with our mentors..) and talking to my friend and the electrician the company has in to replace the mushroom switch for one with a cover that you have to flip up to press it.  The electrician says ""Hey guys, want to come over and smack this mushroom switch before I take it down?  It's completely disconnected and won't turn off a thing, it'll be fun!"".  Clearly, this guy got his electricians license from the cracker jack box.  Neither one of us budge, there is no way in HELL I'm touching that thing, no matter what he says.  We tell him that, and just to be a smartass, he turns and punches the button.  .


Ever hear a 3000 square foot raised floor lose power to everything at the same time?  All the inverters, AC units, tape drives, RAID cabinets, ES390 cabinets, server and switch racks, EVERYTHING spun down.  My friend and I register what just happened (of course, we looked toward the raised floor when all this went down) and we turn to say something (what, I'm just not sure) to the electrician and we literally see one heel and one elbow as he BURSTS through the double doors and runs out of the building.  Gone.  Totally.

within seconds, our beepers start going off (yes, I said 18 years ago!) and we start making phone calls.  Withing 20 minutes, all the IT staff and infrastructure staff is onsite, with the electrical companies owner.  he's taking a ton of shit.  the guy he had onsite called him, told him what happened and quit over the phone.  It took us 28 hours to IPL the ES390 (boot it, from a dirty file system state, it took a LONG time) and we lost about 25 hard drives.  We suspect that the drives simply mechanically wouldn't spin anymore since they were stopped.


Anyway, the new switch was installed and we all got everything going again, restored from backups, etc by Monday AM.  The electrical company had to pay everyone's OT, and cover any costs IBM through our way (we were a complete IBM shop, EVEYRTHING what IBM).  

TLDR; electrician did his best Usain Bolt impression after screwing up what should have been a simple job (although at the time Carl Lewis would have been a better analogy) "

I've got a 2.5 year old MacBook Pro (2.8 Core 2 Duo/4 GB DDR3/NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT 512 MB/500 GB @ 5400 RPM) that I am in love with. I don't know what everyone here thinks about the whole Mac vs. PC thing, but this computer works flawlessly almost all the time, and everything I throw at it runs smoothly. Plus, its less than an inch thick and made of metal - I've never felt a computer with a better build quality. However, I am a college student and recently switched to an Engineering program for which a Intel X64 based system running windows is absolutely required. I tried a virtual machine this semester, but continually ran into compatibility problems. So, I've gotta buy a Windows laptop.

Option One: spend $400-$600 on a machine that can get me through 2.5 more years of engineering school, and hang on to my MacBook Pro as 'my computer.' It needs to be relatively fast (in my head I've got a requirement of at least an i5, but please correct me if this is overkill). Some of the programs we run are sort of resource intensive, and I don't want it to be constantly struggling. Multitasking is a necessity, so minimum 4GB of RAM but more is better. I'd love to have dedicated graphics in there as well, but I realize that is definitely rare in this price range. 

Option Two: Sell my MacBook Pro ($1000-1200) and get a Windows machine for $1000-1400 that will far outspec the Pro I have now. Can I get a laptop for that price that will run Windows 7 as smoothly as mine runs OS X? I've been shopping around, but there are so many options it is hard to quantify everything. If I take this option, it needs to be able to handle music, photo, and video editing easily, as well as be up for occasional light gaming (aka I play Portal every now and then). I'd also want something with superior build quality that doesn't flex or bend everytime I pick it up. 

EDIT: I've been eyeing the Lenovo ThinkPad T line for the second option, because there is something catchy about their understated business looks to me. Also, I used an old T60 in an internship over the summer, and that thing was built like a tank! Holding me back is the seemingly underperforming specs for the price.

I appreciate your help, r/SuggestALaptop!"

My advisor has treated me with scorn, indifference, and disdain since my first semester, when I was going through a traumatic life event and failed Statistics by one point (made a 69% - you're not allowed to make anything less than a C).

Despite the fact that I retook the course the following year and made an A, he has continued to make my life terrible. Here's a short list off the top of my head:

-When I failed Statistics at the end of my first Fall semester, he told me I had until Spring to make straight As, increase my class participation, and write a paper for publication, even though a) no other first year students were required to write a paper for publication and b) at least 1-2 students fail this course EVERY YEAR (the prof is a beast), and every single other student had the opportunity to take it the following year. Or, in other words, I was the only one who was threatened with being kicked out of the program and not automatically given the chance to take it the following year - I had to earn the chance.

-He regularly damages my reputation. For instance, we went to a conference and ended up going out to dinner with some very big names in my research field. I was sitting right next to this big name guy, and my advisor said, to the entire table of 12 people, that I had failed statistics, even though at that point I had already gone back and was making an A in the course. He said this in front of four prominent researchers and three of the other grad students in my lab. 

-He also trashtalks me in the Psychology building. For instance, we were interviewing potential graduate students last year and one of them admitted she wasn't good at stats. I was walking down the hall when I (and others) heard him discussing this with our lab manager, and he said ""I don't want to have another ""PhDinCruelty"" situation.""

-In terms of opportunities, he often does things that are unfair. For instance, he regularly writes book chapters and allows various grad students to collaborate with him. I have expressed interest in co-writing a chapter, but he's given three chapters to other students ""because I know they'll do it right.""

-One other grad student and I went to a conference last spring, and I'm more financially strained than the other students due to family circumstances. I asked him if he could cover any or part of my costs to the conference, and he said no. Then he fully funded the one other grad student who went.

-He also does small slights - for example, a job candidate recently came to interview for a position in the department. My advisor introduced the candidate to three of his other graduate students and didn't introduce her to me, even though I was in the room. There are other things, like the fact that he barely says hello to me in the hallway, barely makes eye contact, NEVER converses with me but converses with the other grad students, etc. These things sound small, but they contribute to the overall sensation of being pretty orphaned in my research.

-He HATES my papers, but refuses to give specific feedback as to how to improve them. For instance, he refuses to send my most recent paper off for publication because he hates the Lit Review, but either will not or cannot give specific feedback as to why, so I have to send it to other professors in the department to get more specific or concrete feedback.

-He did not read my master's thesis before my defense

-He kept one of my papers for six months without giving me feedback on it

-For the most recent conference, three other grad students were funded for 100% of their travel costs; I was funded for 50%

-One of my papers was rejected, and he immediately said, ""We need to bring in ______"", with ""_______"" being another member of my lab) - he asked her to help ""revamp"" it, even though two other members of my lab also recently got rejections and he didn't feel the need to add additional authors to ""revamp.""

-He allowed me to write an entire paper on gender, which took more than a year, then decided he didn't want gender in the paper.

-He insults my writing regularly, using phrases like ""this reads like a term paper,"" or, my favorite, ""Meh.""

I have spoken with the Director of Graduate Studies about this multiple times, and he is friendly enough, but not helpful. I have asked another professor if I could switch to her (her research interests are congruent with mine), but she has too many students.

This advisor of mine is in a high-powered position in my department and is the one who writes our letters of recommendation when we go to internship. I am afraid to cross him and make him dislike me more than he already does. I have no idea why I displease him so - I only know that I have quite a span of time left in the program and I could really use an advisor that allows me harvest the potential I have, as it is certainly not happening in this professional relationship.

What do I do, Reddit?
P.S. This is a throwaway, as my main account has some identifying info in my posts/comments.

**tl;dr My advisor treats me horribly, to the point that it's affecting my experience in the graduate program and also my future career. Nothing has helped so far. What do I do?**

ndwkw,0,2011-12-15,"Post-high school Redditors, what would you say about your favorite/most hated high school teachers?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ndwkw/posthigh_school_redditors_what_would_you_say/,"I stumbled across the RateMyTeachers page for my high school and felt it important to impart some wisdom to the younger generation.  Also, I thought it necessary to equalize the high and low ratings I didn't agree with a bit (Up Voting and Down Voting has taught me so much).  I tried to give as much detail as I could about why I did or did not like some of my teachers and found the process somewhat cathartic: It felt good to say how truly awesome some of my teachers were as well as how lame some of the others were.  In fact, here's what I wrote (characters were limited, so...):

German Teacher:  If you never take German from this man, just go shoot yourself.  I took German I with Mrs. Trulson, followed by German II with Mr. Telford, and what a difference.  He actually lived in Germany for a time and taught English, so he has a keen understanding of the language and culture.  He doesn't just teach the words and syntax, there's focus on correct pronunciation (so important) as well as German culture.  After taking his class, Germany has become one of the countries I most desire to visit.

English Teacher:  He instilled in me a love for literature and writing I hadn't known before. His class definitely prepares you for college. I'm working on my Master's in Electrical Engineering and still have a deep appreciation and affection for the knowledge and experience I gained from his class. I still regret that I didn't take AP with him, just honors. I had been in a slump my junior year, but his class renewed my vigor and thirst for knowledge. It made me enjoy literature classes in college. Take him!

Drafting Teacher:  I had two years of drafting with Mr. Parke, and it's amazing how much he taught us.  Hand-drawing as a ""baby drafter"" was fun, but is really more to help you appreciate drafting software.  Once you tackle the crane hook you can handle anything!  My little brother took Drafting I, II, III, and IV eventually getting to work on special projects.  He's studying Electrical Engineering at UTC and just landed an internship with TVA because his drafting skills were seen as a huge plus for some projects.

Math Teacher:  Mrs. Todd is a wonderful woman. I had her for Pre-Algebra and Algebra I in junior high (Unity), then Trig in high school. Her lessons were always straight-forward and easy to follow. I regret not taking Calculus with her in high school. I'm now working on a Master's in Electrical Engineering and still have a fondness for the tricks and mnemonic devices she taught us. She was also one of the few teachers who gave students a break occasionally and let us have free days (chess and checkers!)

English/Latin Teacher:  Mr. Ham will always be one of the greats in my mind. He's been around the world and did so much that it's hard to believe he's content to teach in a small community. I was lucky to have him for English and Latin in junior high (Unity). He's extremely knowledgable and downright interesting. He taught me the beauty and power of etymology. Aside from that, he sparked my interest in Greek mythology. Fayetteville is lucky to have him and his epic beard.

Drama Teacher:  A pretentious jerk, his class and performances are nothing more than platforms for him to showboat. Professional actor Frank Runyeon spoke to our class and pointed out that everything we had learned about acting from Bob was WRONG. No matter what script we read, he always did the same Disney-esque character for any elderly character: ""Pupupup! I beg yaw pahdon?"" So annoying. I didn't buy into his bullshit and refused to bring my bass to class to jam and he would chew me out as if I was required.

History Teacher:  I never had her as a teacher but ran into her a few times in the hall.  She was never pleasant and needed to know every detail of your journey to the bathroom like some kind of Hall Nazi.  Despite being an obvious butch dike, she was quite bitchy.  She was nice to my sister, but I think it's obvious why.  I recall her angrily telling another male student in her husky voice, ""Man, I'll fight you for some red-eye gravy"", and thinking how much that phrase described her belligerent personality.

English Teacher:  Mrs. Chapman was boring and could be a real bitch.  I felt like I could never please her no matter what and that she simply did not like me (I have no idea why).  A little personal, but she came to my grandfather's funeral recently and, despite the warm smile I gave, said nothing to me and ignored me, even though she greeted everyone else in the receiving line.  Years after having her as a teacher and wondering if she really was a bitch was confirmed on that day.

TL;DR: Rated some of my highschool teachers.  What would you say about yours?"

ndb0g,1,2011-12-14,Ready to Give Up,thowzawayz,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ndb0g/ready_to_give_up/,"Honestly, I don't believe I have been that much of a happy person, but over the last few months I've had an extremely hard time. I had my first relationship with a girl who i had been pursuing for 8 months last month and after about a week she started becoming extremely withdrawn. Eventually, she started making plans with me and blowing them off at the last minute to hang out with my roommates. We eventually broke up and now she is basically dating one of them. My situation is even more difficult because I'm at an internship 10+ hours away from home and have maybe one or two friends here who are nice but i don't know them well enough to talk to them.

 My history with girls has always been difficult. I have pursued two girls before this and each led me on for two years.They seemed to be interested in me but they never really were, and it was extremely painful to watch as they would pick piece of shit guys over me. It seems as if this is just going to be some continuous pattern where i try extremely hard to build a relationship with someone and they write me off when the next closest guy approaches them. 

I honestly have tried to make myself feel better but my efforts have been fruitless. My roommates continued to invite her over to our apartment for 2 weeks straight and they would just ignore my vomiting and crying that I was doing in my room. I have sought out a therapist but she frustrates me wanting to blame this on the fact that my parents would leave to go to their vacation home for 4 days a week and that I never had anyone around when i was over the age of 15.

I think about this situation constantly and it has completely consumed me. I relive every situation i have ever had with her trying to figure out what I have done wrong. Every girl loves to tell me that Im the nicest guy they've ever met but they then continue to lead me on and ultimately destroy me. I think about the 21 years I have lived so far and if I had to live them over again I would not. I honestly just want this to be over. I feel that if someone is to be happy they can't just go along with life learning to cope with problems, but eventually they must have something good happen to them. I feel like this will never happen for me. I'm extremely tired and ready to give up.

Thanks for reading. I'm trying to express the way I'm feeling and any comments, advice, and opinions will be extremely appreciated. Sorry for the terrible grammar, I'm not in a great state of mind.

 I will be finishing up University by april with a BBA. The thing I'm worried about is my employment history. Every summer I've tried getting internships or at least a regular office type job with no luck. 

Throughout the academic season I'm working part-time at a grocery store. I've been able to find some good paying full time jobs in the summer but they don't do much to add to my resume business wise. 

Last 3 summers :

1) Assistant cook on a kid's camp then I was promoted to head cook for the last month of the summer

2) Tree planter, planted thousands of trees.

3) Brush saw operator, cut down thousands of trees.

All these jobs paid waaay more than minimum wage which is nice, but they're all hard labour grunt jobs, mostly the last two. 

Will this negatively affect my chances of getting a ""real"" job after I graduate?"

nevdc,5,2011-12-16,Seeking general career and education advice,cwd68,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nevdc/seeking_general_career_and_education_advice/,"Hi Reddit.  This will be long, so bear with me.  I'm currently working as a software engineer for a company that mostly does government contracting, and I've been doing it for about 2 years now.  The work I'm doing is ok, but it's not the most exciting stuff in the world - mostly low traffic, DB driven web applications.   I've recently been trying to figure out what the best way forward would be to break into something more interesting - my ideal job would probably be something at a blue chip tech company like Google or Microsoft, or potentially at a startup that is doing something cool.

I went to a top university, but I didn't major in CS in undergrad.  I've enjoyed programming since a young age, but I was kind of scared off from majoring in it as a result of going to high school right after the first dot com bust, and hearing a lot of talk about outsourcing and such.  I've since wised up.  I did a different engineering major instead, but I still took several CS classes in undergrad because I enjoyed them.  I had enough of a background to be accepted into a part time CS masters program at a reasonably well known school in my area, which my company is mostly paying for.  At first I was pretty excited about the program, as I was hoping it would help me make up the deficiencies in the upper level CS classes that I didn't have in undergrad, but I'm about halfway done with the degree now, and I'm kind of disappointed by it so far.  The classes have been pretty easy, which I think is a direct result of the fact that the program is designed for people who also work full time - the classes &amp; professors aren't the same as what the full time masters students at the school take.  For instance, I just took my program's Operating Systems class, and I spent some time comparing the projects I had to do with the projects in a couple of undergrad OS courses at my old school and others.  It seems pretty clear that the undergrad courses were way more hands on and in-depth than what I had to do.  It's gotten to the point where I'm actually considering stopping my program, and applying for a full time masters at a program that is more rigorous instead, since I know some masters programs let you count some upper level undergrad courses towards the degree.  The pros and cons I see are:

-If I stay in my program, I can be finished in about a year.  It won't really cost me any money, and I'll be getting more work experience.  That said, I don't know if I'll be learning enough to get the chops I need to stack up against people with CS degrees from good schools without really teaching myself.  I also don't know if this degree will really even open any doors for me that I couldn't get already.

-If I leave, I think I have a decent shot at getting into a good school for a full time masters based on my undergrad credentials.  It's probably too late to apply for this upcoming fall, which means I would have to apply in the winter to start in the fall of 2013.  When you tack on another 1-2 years to finish the masters, I'm looking at around another 3 years or so just to finish the degree, plus about $50 grand in debt, plus having to explain to everyone I know why I'm leaving a free masters program for one I have to pay for.  On the flip side, I'd probably learn a lot more, and it might get my foot in the door at a company like Google if I can get a good internship or via on-campus recruiting.  I might also be able to transfer in a couple of credits from my current program.

So, what do you think Reddit?  If you were in my shoes, what would you do?  Thanks!

neqbr,16,2011-12-15,College feels like a waste of time and money -- is dropping out feasible?,ParaGrass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/neqbr/college_feels_like_a_waste_of_time_and_money_is/,"I'm in school for Computer Science at a public college which is not extremely prestigious or anything. I also work part time during the semester and full time during the summer and breaks as an intern for a Financial Services company developing web software in Java, Javascript, CSS, HTML, etc. I have a self-taught background in C++ as well, from attempting to develop a game engine with friends during High School.

I've been finding more and more that I learn almost nothing in my CS classes. I'm not sure if it's me or the school I attend or the nature of programming, but I feel more and more like I'm wasting my time and money attending college. I get a lot of real-world experience at my work, and I feel like I learn more there through exercise than I do through theory at school. But also, it seems like I could pull off the duties of most of the developers I work with already (save for maybe the lead, although he's extremely bright in the first place). During the semester, I spend a lot of my day working and learning, a lot of my day sitting bored in class and not learning much, and very little of my day working on personal projects and such.

Anyway, my question really is: Is anyone here self-taught and doing well? Is anyone a drop-out and doing well? Would it be extremely stupid to drop out of school now and just freelance/look for work? Although I'm sure it looks much better to be in school, would many companies be willing to hire (even as an intern to get work experience) a drop-out who can show that he is a skilled programmer?

EDIT: By the way, don't be scared to answer because this is a life decision or something. I'm obviously not going to solely base my decision on Reddit, as much as I love this place.

tl;dr If I drop out of school so I can spend that time doing something productive, will I be un-hireable? "

I've been looking into this for a while as a way to make my resume look better for career fairs because my GPA is only 2.9X and I was told 3.0 is often used as a minimum requirement. The reason it is so low is because when I first started college I was not ready for it and did not try hard. I was actually in business school and got C's quite frequently and my GPA dropped to a 2.7 but after my second year I transferred into engineering and am doing much better but it is still hard to raise my GPA with so many SH already under my belt.  Hopefully after this semester it will either be a 3.0 or 2.99. So far what I plan to do is learn C++ as I heard C/C++ are the most used languages and I already learned C in one of my classes and as far as I am aware C++ is not taught directly in another required EE class.. The other thing is that I ordered an Arduino starter kit that included different sensors to start playing around with that so I can say I have various experience using a microcontroller. Does anyone else have suggestions for what I can do that would help me procure an internship?

My goal is to end up in an administrative job dealing with computers.

I just got my Network+ certification, and have completed most of the other general classes. Math, Public Speaking, Sciences, Intro to computers... Those kind of classes.

As most of the computer literate will understand, helping the family, friends, work associates is where I end up figuring stuff out. I took the computer classes in high school, but nothing really program specific. I know my way around Windows, as well as Mac. I enjoy customization of Android, and have done some work with Blackberry and other smartphones. I will be starting an internship with a school near me, but that has yet to come to light. On the job side of things, I have worked at (insert major fast food chain here) for almost 6 years now. I started as a crew member, and have worked my way into management. I have my job listed under the management position with most of my duties.

nkbkg,0,2011-12-20,About to take a career leap to be a start-up CTO...need advice!,throwaway_safety,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nkbkg/about_to_take_a_career_leap_to_be_a_startup/,"Context:

I graduated from a good college last year and have been working at a cushy software engineering job in the Bay area.  This job is easy, it has security, it pays well, the management is nice and supportive, and there are nice benefits.  The work/life balance is low-stress and low-pressure.  The company is pre-IPO but looking good (and I'm generally skeptical about these things), and I have been given some options which have not yet vested.

Despite being a relatively large startup company, they do listen to me and do occasionally let me make architectural decisions that would be out-of-reach for a new grad at a larger company.  I already have a reasonable level of ownership on a small part of the core system.  My manager looks at me favorably and has told me that he will be pushing for a promotion soon.

At the end of the day though, I am bored.  I feel like no matter how well I do, I'll always be a small part of a big team.  I feel like there is too much down-time due to low expectations about how much I can produce.  They give me too much time to work on things, and so I spend as much time as they expect to actually do it, with a lot of reddit and freelance programming in the middle.

Cue timely opportunity.  I was contacted a couple of months ago by somebody I used to work with who was developing the beta for a start-up that was looking for a full-time CTO.  I get a lot of inquiries like this, and I usually just ignore them, but the person who contacted me wasn't an idiot, so I engaged them further.  I've met with the founders who both have a background in venture capital and have had one moderately successful acquisition that is allowing them to bootstrap this startup.  They intend to close a funding round once they have a full team together, the CTO being the missing component.

I've always wanted to do a startup of my own, but imagined it several years off the horizon.  After having spoken with the founders, I've realized that there is so much more to a technology startup than the technology.  My real passion has always been the technology and that's what I'm good at.  It seems like if I want to do a startup, this is the best way to go, and at the very worst I will learn a lot about what does go into the early stages of a startup.

After a couple months of discussion, they've made me an offer.  Until they close a round, I'll be making less than I make now.  Obviously, I'll be working significantly more and it will be a lot higher stress, but I have worked at smaller companies where this was the norm and definitely prefer hard work that I can fully engage in.  I'm assuming that if we consider growth and raises within my current company, I'll be making less consistently throughout my time at the startup.  That being said, it is still a comfortable salary.

The equity offer they've made is obviously a lot greater than my current company, though that equity is substantially higher risk than my current company.  I am aware that the odds are against this equity, but I believe in the startup's value and our ability as a team to succeed.

After closing a round, I will be able to hire a couple new developers. I have a network of friends where the new startup is located that I think I can leverage for talent, as well as connections with my school.  I will be managing an intern when I join.

My primary motivation for joining the startup are:

- Personal reasons for wanting to move
- Pipe-dreams of success and highly valuable equity
- Faster-pace of development, greater willingness to take technology risks
- Wider scope to keep me interested in projects
- Architectural decision-making; this is something I'm passionate about
- My youth (Now is the time to take risks, I think. I don't have any kids so nobody depends on me.  My skills are still valuable and there are a lot of companies hiring from my segment.)
- Learning about more diverse technology faster, due to necessity
- Learning about the startup world

At this point, I am very confident I want to take it.  I am planning on continuing at my current position until the end of the current release, so that I can minimize any bad feelings.  In the meantime, I am working part-time with the startup--refactoring the code-base so that when I get started, it will be where I want it philosophically.

----

Why I'm asking reddit/what I'm looking for:

- General advice from people who have taken this leap or also people who have decided not to take this leap
- Resources regarding this topic, which I imagine has been covered by many before me
- Support/Disapproval
- Advice regarding how to leave current position without hard feelings
- What to expect on the other side of this, whether or not the company is a success
- Financial advice, due-diligence related recommendations, etc
- Sarcastic retorts and XKCD comics welcomed

TL;DR: I'm quitting my secure job to be a startup CTO, in what ways is this a terrible/great decision?"

Dear Ms. XXXXX,

I was excited to hear of the Assistant Director of Career Services and Internships position, as I believe my past experiences combined with my personality and connection to the THE COLLEGE community set me apart in what I have to offer. My experience developing and nurturing relationships with clients, preparing and conducting training workshops, and my strong computer skills make me an ideal candidate for this position. 

As my enclosed resume indicates, my educational and professional experiences meet your needs. I think you will agree that my background in survey development and implementation, management of large databases, delivery of professional development and training presentations, and established relationships with THE COLLEGE’s faculty, staff and students would allow me to immediately contribute to your Career Services program development. My assessment and survey development background at THE COLLEGE coupled with being an THE COLLEGE alumnus provides me with a unique perspective as to the needs and concerns of our students. Additionally, my Psychology curriculum and research experience has provided me with a strong foundation of testing and assessment. 

I assure you that my skills will reveal that I am far more than a data manager, but rather am a vibrant, energetic professional who relates well with faculty and students alike and excels in building and nurturing relationships.  Also, in my previous work experience, utilizing my strong Internet research skills and outstanding interpersonal communication abilities, I was able to identify and establish partnerships with wholesale clients for the distribution and promotion of my company’s products. My personality and skill set are well suited for serving as a liaison both internally to campus departments and externally to local employers on behalf of Career Services.

Finally, my understanding of and commitment to promoting the mission and vision of THE COLLEGE as well as my experience as a student here at the THE COLLEGE prove invaluable in assisting students with understanding how to transfer a liberal arts education to the future work or graduate study. I would welcome an opportunity to speak to you further about how I might fit the needs of your office. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

I'm a Computer Science student, and I'm in a bit of a pickle. I currently have an offer for a summer internship with Microsoft and Zynga, and I don't know which one to choose. Something to keep in mind is that I'm interested in getting into the video game industry. I'd appreciate any advice! By the way, this will be my last internship before I graduate, and in the past, I've interned at Apple and Microsoft.


**Microsoft:**

**+**Slightly better compensation (+700/month)

**+**Fairly interesting project (MIGHT get to work on technology that game developers will use for mobile)

**+**It's Microsoft (GOOD, STABLE, and BIG company)

**-**Away from home (I'll be lonely because all of my friends that will start working at Microsoft will start as full time employees towards the last 2-3 weeks of my internship)

**-**I've interned at Microsoft before (different team), so it won't be a new experience (I'm interested in startups)


**Zynga:**

**+**I get to work on games (however, I'm not a fan of their games)

**+**Get experience in the game industry

**+**The internship will be in my hometown (I'll be close to my friends and family)

**+**Still a fairly small, startup-like company, so I'll get a new experience

**+**Free lunch and dinner

**-**Slightly smaller compensation (-700/month)

**-**It's ZYNGA (I'm not a fan of the company, they just went public, and I've haven't heard or read good things from the employees)

**EDIT:** The reason I mention being away from friends and family is because two summers ago I interned at Apple, where I didn't know many people, and last summer I interned at Microsoft, where 3 of my close friends also interned. As a result, I enjoyed my summer at Microsoft much more than my summer at Apple because I wasn't lonely."

It's been a year since, but about 8 months ago, I was been assigned to a specific client, working with MS Exchange 2010, AD, BES, MS Project + Visio, and other things like managing projects, having interns assigned to me (from the client), and creating policies with departments such as HR and Accounting. It's a mix of Tech Support, SysAdmin, and maybe analyst.

I've had friends recently give me job offers elsewhere that pay around 35K, just for Helpdesk and a similar one for Tier 1 support. They both laughed at the amount of work I said I did when I told them my salary.

About me and the company:
I'm the hiring manager for a web development team, working at PayPal.


The team spends a good chunk of their team innovating new products and possibilities. We build tools and JS libraries for the rest of the company, prototype new products, build production versions of some of the main PayPal products, and think of our own products that we build and sell to the business.


I'm looking to build out my team significantly and develop great products. Nothing is off limits to the team; want to build for mobile? consoles? tablets? - I encourage you learning how and we'll put that knowledge to use.


I'm willing to relocate individuals from other states and countries, but please note that if you're in another country, you are going to have be a star.


Lead and Senior Web Developer Requirements:
I'm looking for multiple senior and lead web/front end/UI developers. As a senior developer, you should have a deep understanding of applications, MVC, OO programming, etc. The application language itself is not very important to me, as long as you have experience working in medium to large sized applications that use MVC, templating, scripting language (jsp/asp/etc).


What I'm ultimately looking for is a very well rounded developer with a strong emphasis and passion on the presentation tier. You should have very strong knowledge and experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - and you take into consideration aspects such as site speed, accessibility, mobile users, user experience, security, product value, etc. I would assume you have a deep understanding of how the browser works.

In terms of personality, I'm hoping that I can place you on projects or initiatives and not have to worry about it. I don't want to micro manage. You should be able to not just develop the project (and make sure it's on time), but bring great business value in other ways depending on your skills (that might be improving code tools, security, user experience, product, or anything else you're passionate about).


Responsibilities for the position include, making good architectural decisions, mentor/train our more junior developers, do code reviews, be responsible for the project you're on.


College Grad Requirements:
I'm also hiring computer science college grads, and the requirements are simple. Be passionate and show me that your passionate by sending me links to applications you have built outside of school and internship

I've applied to several places, and get the interview, but don't get the job.  I don't have any internship experience, even though I have applied for 2 summers, I still didn't get them.  

Now I am a graduate with no experience.  I find postings with qualifications along the lines of: Sophmore pursuing Computer Science or related degree.

Can I apply for these internships as a graduate to simply get some experience?

Sadly, I remember reading a post about a graduate who got a degree and doesn't feel like they know how to program properly.  This is how I feel now, even though when I am given questions during my interview, I feel like I answered the questions correct.  The parts I feel I tend to fail lie in inexperience and software design (in particular, OO).

I NEED ADVICE REDDIT!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nm1fz/not_one_for_asking_advice_ive_always_been_one_to/,"apologize but this might be a bit to read. 

Here goes:

About a year and 4 months ago my Fiancé and I had our first child. Things were very stressful as I was on route to finish college and she had just finished but had no job. I don't regret my daughter one bit because she molded and made me be where I am today. Anyway getting back to things, our daughter was born 25 weeks and we were just in a dark place with neither of us having steady good paying jobs, me having to finish college and the fact that everything became weight on my shoulders to figure out a gameplan. Once I started motivating myself to leave my shitty Radioshack job, which no way in hell would be able to provide money to support my newborn daughter and ideally my fiancé, I began with paid internships in NYC of which I began saving up. I saved up to pay my school bills for the semester and saved some money on the side for any emergencies that my daughter, fiancé and I would need. Anywho after saving up I came to a conclusion that I wouldn't be able to afford paying rent for an apartment, paying to continue to go to school and affording to pay for expenses my daughter fiancé and I needed. Cue my wonderful parents. They had no problem letting us stay over their house, which at the time was small, on the one condition that once the fiancé and baby came in we would help around and clean up after ourselves. THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME TO PAY FOR FOOD OR RENT. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. Ok being a first time parent is indeed one of the most difficult tasks ever. No sleep, waking up early to catch the train to NYC, coming home at 7-8 pm exhausted was not pretty. Well the first half year I would make it a routine to always be clean, help with the baby as much as I could and just be a good father/spouse. The fiancé didn't do much besides watch the baby and that was it. Now I love her to death and I know she is a great mother, but I should have began to find it a bit concerning that she had become used to me doing all the cleaning up after her while she used the excuse that the baby was full time work.. Now I'm not stupid. When babies are newborn all they do is eat sleep and shit. I know because all I would do on weekends was help her with the baby, which was not much except the fact when she would wake up in the middle of the night to be fed, changed, or her stomach was upsetting her. Well at first my parents got a bit pissed off when they noticed all we would do was spend time in the room they gave up for us and we wouldn't do anything regarding helping out around the house they were letting us live in practically for free. The arguments began and my mother and father began talking to us as adults, that we are, to begin smartening up or get out if we were going to continue living like slobs and not help out. So only I at the moment smartened up. The fiancé kept using the baby as an excuse to not do anything which left me with everything. So I began waking up early to clean up, make the bed on weekends after the fiancé woke up, keep the room organized and even cook breakfast/lunch/dinner for us while she watched the baby. Well my dad is pretty old fashioned and he pulled me to the side and said ""son.. You wake up at 6am everyday, go to work, come home at 7-8 pm, you then have to clean up and on top of that after her? Come on you and I know the baby sleeps practically all day.. She has time to do some chores and more time left over to make you something to eat when you get home. As a woman, she should be at least responsible to clean and cook and take care of the baby if your going to work preparing yourself for a future and saving up for a place for your family. Talk to her and have her help out."" Dads, smart motherfuckers. Anyway I don't tell her that my dad told me this, but bring it up to her that it was killing me to practically be doing everything on top of working. She gets offended, gives me the bs excuse that watching the baby is hard and gets extremely mad and upset. I start getting a bit depressed because I feel like everything is on me. Well cue 1 yr later and the same BS with me still doing everything. Parents end up making a huge extension of the house and give us our own room and the baby her own room. I become a consultant in the medical IT field and things begin to look promising financially. Less stress as work is closer to home and going to school PT. However same BS with her not helping until we get in a huge argument. She leaves, threatens to never let me see my daughter again, and has her stepfather threaten me. All in all I'm made out to look like a bad guy. Now I'll be honest, yeah when we argued I called her some names that I wish I could take back but I couldn't handle my stress of having to hold this huge weight on my shoulders anymore. She leaves to go back to her parents house the same weekend it's fathers day. Didn't even spend my first fathers day with my daughter which made me, a grown man cry. She comes fathers day, gives me a fathers day picture she had of the baby done for me(didn't even bring the baby with her) and leaves. Feel like my heart has been ripped out of my body. At this point I tell her never to text me or talk to me. All I wanted was to K.I.T with my daughter and see her as much as I could. Well not even 2 weeks go by and whatayaknow she says that she wants to meet up. Says she's gonna bring the baby and wants to talk. I was still pissed at her but if that meant I get to see my daughter well fuck it I'll meet with her. We meet up for dinner I give my daughter a kiss and hug after not seeing her for 2 weeks and we talk. She says she wants to come back and live with me and my family because things weren't going well at home. There were constant arguments regarding the baby making noise and not letting anyone sleep. I tell her I'll think about it. Go home talk to the parents, they're not happy but they know that I'm happy as long as they know I get to see my daughter and they get to see their grandchild. They agree but say that if it happens again to seek counseling or split up for my sanity. We agree that if she comes back to the house that she will need to find a job and behind helping around the house and not use the baby as am excuse. She comes back and I tell her my parents rules. She gets annoyed but I enforce it and she obliges. She begins working part time like myself but continues to be a complete mess. Always wants to go out and shop on weekends and not keep our room tidy. I begin getting fed up cleaning up after her and working part time and going to school part time and coming home to a messy room. Parents intervene and talk to her and tell her that if she expects so much she should at least have the decency to help as she doesn't work full time and doesn't collaborate at all in the house. I then tell her no way in hell I'm going to save up my hard earned money and waste it all on an apartment that she's not gonna help keep clean and organized AND always using our daughter as an excuse to not do anything. I've began losing feelings for her but don't want our daughter growing up with separated parents. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I offered her to go to couples counseling and she wants nothing of it because according to her she's not crazy.. Please if anyone has gone through something like this any input would be greatly appreciated.

Edit 1:
TL;DR fiancé doesn't help out expects me to do everything and uses excuse that our 1 yr old daughter is hard work.

Edit 2: typed all of this from an iPhone sorry.

I spent a lot of time in community college and pretty much got all my gen eds done and all my computer science classes done as well. I then decided I was going to transfer to get my bachelors degree. Well my first choice in schooling got shot down and this school was my back up option, but looking at the course list a bit more, I am kinda saddened.

 ACIS stands for Applied Computer science and Information systems. There are three tracks to take in it and I'm taking the Mobile and game development track atm. When I look at the degree courses I need to take though I don't see any courses in compiler's or Operating systems and this really bothers me as I've always been curious about the real low level operations in computers. I didn't notice this before as the school just recently changed their degree offerings and in the course catalog it still has these courses up even though I don't think they are doing them any more. 

Any way Reddit I feel stuck in a bad decision and am not sure how to move forward on it. I am thinking of spamming internships as fast as possible to try to get my foot in the door and network with people so that when I get out I have more experience to show that I am actively willing to learn and work. Also I am thinking of doing a project on the side just for myself if I have the time for it. Do you guys have any other suggestions?

A lot of older engineers grew up in the heydays of the space age and were inspired to work on aircraft and spacecraft. Others are gearheads and love automotive stuff. That's all well and good, but it's not for me. I grew up in the computer age, starting with a classic Macintosh, progressing to building my own computers, and now being fascinated by the capabilities of smart phones. Stuff like this is exciting to me because it's still constantly breaking new ground, not stuff that has been ""figured out"" over many decades.


Whether it's software, hardware, networking, or something else, I find myself asking inquisitive questions: ""How do Google routers handle such massive traffic?"", for example. I don't find myself asking questions like that about many ""traditional"" mechanical topics, like turbomachinery, cars, aircraft and spacecraft, etc. 


I think that sort of curiosity is essential to be a good/fulfilled engineer, and I don't appear to have that sort of interest in mechanical topics (or maybe my courseload has simply crushed any extra inquisitiveness beyond that which is required).

So where do I go from here? I have been applying to a couple of ME grad programs to keep my options open, but ultimately I want to go to industry and make cool stuff.

Need some advice.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/np4s8/decided_to_not_spend_christmas_with_my_family/,"I have a bunch of things I need to get off my chest and I would like to ask for advice from fellow redditors who have had similar experiences.  It involves my decision to not spend Christmas with my family this year.  I want to know if I made the right decision and what I should consider doing now.  

Last Christmas my dad had a stroke.  On Christmas Eve, I drove him to the hospital while my mom struggled to figure out what to do.  It was quite a scare but thankfully it wasn't as severe as it could have been.  We decided to wait until he got home to open our presents, so they sat under the tree unopened for three weeks while Dad went from one hospital to another and from there to physical therapy.  When the time came for him to come home I was doing some internship work further downstate.  A few days later when the internship ended I practically flew back to see him only to find my family had already opened their presents without me.  No one apologized or asked how I felt.  In fact no one really seemed to care.  Since then I’ve been on edge with them.  

When I was growing up my mom was hard on me.  She was always bossy and hard to deal with and spent a good part of my childhood and teenage years putting me down and trying to make me feel inferior.  Even though I’m an adult now living on my own she still tries to dominate my life and make my decisions for me.  She tends to try to bully me and my dad and has been abusive to him in the past.  My sister meanwhile has become very much like my mother.  She’s selfish and obsessed with being the center of attention.  She sees other people as means to her end; as long as they’re useful to her she’ll pretend to be nice to them but if she doesn’t need them then she doesn’t care, and over the years she seems to me to be completely without empathy for anyone but herself.  When talking to either of them it is impossible to make them see when they are in the wrong and both maintain a constant aura of moral superiority that makes it impossible to tell them anything.  My dad meanwhile is quiet and passive and tends to just do what my mother and sister tell him.

Over the course of the year my relationship with my family has worsened.  My sister brings up dad’s condition when it is convenient for her but doesn’t seem to really care how he’s doing.  All the while she lives in my parents’ house, outright refusing to pay rent even though she has a well-paying job.  Over the course of the year we have had several instances of her trying to put me down and when I tell her I’m not going to put up with her crap I just get cursed out.  Lately every time I come home to visit I have to get an earful from her, and while my parents see and hear this they never do anything about it.  I am an adult and can fight my own battles but it is hard to see that I get no support even from my family.  Things got worse when I brought my girlfriend over and my sister tried to have it out with her.  Needless to say we left.  

Since then things have gotten increasingly rocky.  My mother has taken to blaming my girlfriend for what happened.  As a result I have felt less of a need to go home.  When I’m away my parents never call and when I do visit my mom tries to make me feel guilty for not coming to visit more.  To make matters worse, she has taken to lobbing backhanded comments about my girlfriend (“I guess I’m not getting her a present for Christmas”, etc.)  

Lately I have felt like my family has been gradually pushing me away.  Whenever I do come over my mother has taken to lobbing backhanded comments about my girlfriend and complaining I'm never around anymore.  When my father's birthday came around my mom told me we weren't doing anything on the day so she had me come the following weekend.  I got there only to find his presents had already been opened (he had opened them the day of his birthday).  Just last week I called to learn they had already got a Christmas tree and decorated it without me, and I only found out because I happened to call my dad; it really seemed that had I not called I would have only found out when I got there for Christmas.

I decided I had finally had enough and I called my mother yesterday to tell her I wouldn't be coming home for Christmas, that I was tired of feeling like a stranger in my parents' home, and that I was sick of how they were treating me and my girlfriend.  My mom responded by offering excuses for not including me in those events and trying to guilt me into coming.  The real kicker was when she put my dad on the phone, who seemed indifferent about the whole matter.  A few minutes into talking to him he paused and I heard my mom say something to him and out of the blue he told me he was going into the hospital for tests in two days.  If I hadn't called I likely wouldn't have found out until I got there for Christmas.  I ended the conversation saying I would rather spend Christmas by myself.  

Immediately after I got off the phone my sister started phone spamming me and sent me a profanity-laden Facebook message basically ordering me to come home.  I responded by turning off my phone.  Neither her comments nor my mother’s seem to give me any indication that they cared about my feelings or understanding why it came to this.  They just told me that I’m making my mother sad and to come home right away.  

I ask for those who have had similar situations what kind of advice they could give me.  I don’t want to cut them out of my life but I feel like I’m reaching a point where they are never going to change and the only way to save my sanity is to get out of the situation.  I’m really not sure what I should do next, or if I should just back down for the sake of the holiday (damn watching Christmas specials).

Sorry about the long bulk of text but thank you for reading if you’ve reached this far.

nqk63,10,2011-12-25,"After decades of depression and suicidal thoughts, I finally have a plan",abrokentoy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nqk63/after_decades_of_depression_and_suicidal_thoughts/,"Some background; I apologize in advance for being graphic, profane, TMI and tl;dr:

First, some demographics. I’m a forty year old white male. I’m unemployed (and probably unemployable), living on just under $900 a month, disability for my back and psychological issues. I previously worked in offices and lower level acting and performing (corporate shows, character work, some plays and musicals). I have a (largely useless) two year IT degree from an online university. I’m divorced, no kids. I live in Chicago; I’m currently renting a room from a friend, but I can’t stay here long term. I also can’t afford to move anywhere, so I’m kind of trapped. I have thousands of dollars of student loan debt (that I’m trying to get forgiven via my disability), and I have horrible credit.


My above mentioned psychological issues: the official diagnosis for my disability is Bi-Polar II, with anger/rage issues, social anxiety, panic attacks, reactive attachment disorder, OCD, PTSD, and mild ADD. I also have addiction issues, primarily with sex, porn, internet usage, and video games. 


My physical/medical issues: I suffered a spinal injury back in 2003 when I fell on my coccyx; I have intermittent pain from pretty much any activity involving my core or sitting, and the nerves in my rectum are starting to fail, resulting in me shitting myself about once a week. This is made worse by my gallbladder being removed last year, and general bowel/gastrointestinal distress from anxiety. Sometimes I shart when I sneeze, which is just awesome. In addition, I’m obese (5’10”, 320 pounds), have thyroid issues that seem to be keeping my weight on, despite changes in diet and exercise, sleep apnea (I use a CPAP when I sleep), and insomnia.


In addition to the above, or maybe because of it; I’m a cynical misanthrope. I’ve described myself in the past as a polite asshole, someone who keeps his mouth shut until faced with such utter stupidity that I have to say something; I feel more and more surrounded by stupidity every day. 

I don’t leave the house unless I absolutely have to, and I have only a few people who love me enough that I can call them friends. I’ve driven away everyone else, both family and friends, with my anger, intolerance for what I perceive to be stupidity, and my general impatience with humans. I prefer the company of animals, but my cat died on Thanksgiving, and I can’t really afford a new pet. 


I remember having my first suicidal thought at age seven. I suffered from night terrors as a child, and never felt like I fit into any social situation, even my own family. My parents were divorced, and I lived with my father, who worked constantly, so I didn’t feel close to him. My mother was in the picture, but was majorly alcoholic, and wasn’t the best alternative; my PTSD actually stems from being sexually abused by my mother’s drunk friends between the ages of 8 and 15. 

My father does not believe I was sexually abused, probably because if he admitted to believing that, he’d have to face up to not being a very present father; he actually told my ex-wife that I was lying about that for attention. Seeing as I didn’t even identify it as abuse until I was in my mid-20s (I just thought that’s how you learned about sex), and I don’t really like to talk about it, I fail to see how I’m getting attention for it. That’s pretty par for the course for my father, unfortunately. 


I've been in some form of therapy since age five. I’ve been on every cocktail of depression and bi-polar meds available at one time or another.  I’ve been in and out of psychiatric facilities in recent years; I’ve been to the ER five times in the last seven years with suicidal ideations. Nothing seems to help for very long. The one thing I haven't tried is ECT; I was told a couple of years ago that I wasn't a good candidate. I'm going to try to see that doctor again soon, but I don't have much hope that he'll change his mind. 


I've never held a job longer than two years. My last job longer than a few months was driving a cab; I lasted five months. My physical problems, in combination with my psychological issues, make it hard for me to get, much less keep a job; as well, I don’t have good references, or a good work history. The bad credit doesn’t help, as some employers check that now. I don’t have any romantic/sexual relationships for many of the same reasons I can’t get/keep a job.


I've gotten to where I am today, I suppose, because I came to the realization that, with all my problems, it’s ***never*** actually going to get any better. I’ll be poor, in physical pain, and shitting myself the rest of my life; with the pain and shitting getting worse by the year. I'll probably end up in a wheelchair if my spinal injury continues to get worse; and it's inoperable because of its location. 


Like my title says, I have a plan. That worries me, because in the past, I’ve **thought** about suicide, a lot. But now I know exactly how I would do it. I even have backup plans. Scary.


One of the things that kept me from committing suicide in recent years is that my brother hung himself back in 2007. My first, very selfish thought when I heard about it was, “he beat me to it, he escaped”. My mom had died earlier that year, and he had a lot of financial and legal problems; but if I compare our situations, I’m actually worse off than he was. I try not to think about that.


I really, really don’t want to go back to a hospital. I’m on Medicare, so the best they do is watch you for a few days, but they don’t hold you if they don’t see you as an immediate threat to yourself or others; they just don't have the beds. You’re lucky to see the same doctor twice, and it’s usually a psych intern who just takes your history, again. The last time I committed myself, I think I told five different interns my life story. It seems like the only way to get real psychiatric help, if you don’t have money or good insurance, is to be criminally insane, which I’m not, as yet. Maybe I should dress up like the Joker and rob some banks.


I don’t know what my next move is. My plan requires money that I don’t currently have; but I’ll probably be getting some money back from the IRS from my cab driving work this year. I worry that when I do have the money, I’ll implement the plan. I can't stay where I am much longer. I've lived in three cities in the last year, and I have nowhere else to go. I am an expert bridge burner.


I would love to hear any thoughts or ideas about my situation. Thanks for reading."

None of my ""friends"" really care too much, and nobody is around right now anyway.  Nobody wants to talk to me, and my family isn't too supportive. So here's what I would like to share with anyone who is kind enough to listen.

My freshman year in college, there was a girl who I passed quite a bit in the engineering building.  She was tall, a bit nerdy looking, but very fashionable and just gorgeous.  I figured she was completely out of my league, so I didn't even think about making a move.  Fast forward a few months later, she popped up on my ""People You May Know"" on Facebook.  I reluctantly added her, thinking whatever.

She didn't accept my friend request for a couple months actually.  When she finally did, I tried to be bold and I messaged her.  I introduced myself, told her that I had seen at quite a bit of times outside of class, and I also told her that I thought she was really interesting and I'd like to get to know her.  We spoke on and off for a few weeks.  I finally grew the nuts to ask her out on a date.  She accepted.  I thought she was the most amazing person I'd ever met.  She was smart, sophisticated, beautiful, great sense of humor, etc. etc.  However, the date ended and we did not kiss.  I felt it was not going anywhere, but I continued pursuing her.  One week later we had our second date, and this time we kissed for hours afterwards.

We hit it off.  She was older than me.  It was the second semester of my sophomore year, and she was a senior.  She was graduating.  Now here's something I left out...  She was a foreign student on a government ""scholarship"".  She had to leave.  She couldn't stay after graduation.  Her student visa would expire just a month after graduation.  I hardly had any money.  On top of that, I come from a conservative Muslim background.  They refuse to accept this.  But whatever, I was so much in love with her that we kept it going.

After she left, I was completely heart broken.  For the first time in my life, I knew what depression was.  It really hurts.  It hurts like a fucking bitch.  There was nothing I could do though.  She had to leave.  I had massive depression.  I'm a 4.0 student who only cared about his school work, getting workouts at the gym, and watching his favorite TV show every week.  She changed me in a way.  Suddenly, I couldn't live without this woman who I had lived the majority of my life without.

Anyway, because of her student visa and U.S. law, anyone that comes to this country and is sponsored by a foreign government must go home and live for two years.  This two year home residency requirement can't be lifted.  There's nothing I can do, even though I'm a U.S. citizen.

Anyway, regardless of the situation, I dealt with it.  We talked everyday via Skype.  The person I was with every hour - I could now only be with her on a video stream, for just an hour in the morning and an hour at night (12 hour time difference).  We loved each other though, so we made this loooong distance work.  That summer, I interned at a company to build my resume and get my mind off this.  I still couldn't deal with it.  The day my internship ended in August, I had money now to buy a $2500 plane ticket to go see her in her country.  I went.  My parents tried to do everything to stop me.  They even tried to hide my passport.  I wouldn't let them.  I went anyway.  For two weeks, it was like a dream.  I finally got to touch her and see her again.  We both cried when we saw each other at the airport.  But eventually, I had to leave after the two weeks.  Classes had started, and I had to return to school.  I'm on a scholarship, so no room to mess up and destroy it.

Anyway, so my junior year started.  Everyday we talked on Skype.  Every morning, every night.  Then junior year ended.  I was used to being without her by this point.  It was okay more or less.  I still loved her, and she was so important to me.  But anyway, summer after junior year (last summer) my father passed away.  I began to panic.  I have an older sister that was to start med school in August and a younger 13 year old sister.  With my family being conservative Muslim, my mom had never worked a day in her life.  Regardless, my internship last year paid very handsomely.  The hard work began paying off.  I earned in one paycheck the amount I earned over the entire internship over the past year.  Money was not a huge problem, despite needing to help the family.  I figured a way to deal with dad passing.  And now, I asked her to go apply for a visitor visa to come visit me.

She applied, and to our joy they gave her the visa.  We were both so excited.  And so she came.  This is where my current situation arises.  She only stayed for 5 months.  I took 18 hours this semester while she was here and worked 20 hours a week to support us.  It's my senior year.  I even pulled through all A's.

A few hours ago, I dropped her off at the airport.  We both cried like little children.  We didn't want to let go.  Not again. God not this stupid crap again.  Why can't we be together?  We haven't committed a crime.  She's educated.  She has an engineering degree, one of the highest paid in the U.S.  She wouldn't be a burden on the tax payer.  Why do these fucking laws exist?  Why does it have to be this way?  I know we can't change this, but how do I cope with this?  The woman I care about so much is not with me.  We've lived together the past 5 months.  I'm so used to being with her all the time.  We even married.  Last month, we went to the county court and made it a done deal.

What can I do?  How do I cope with this?  This depression hurts.  Depression, anxiety, I don't even know wtf to call it.  I feel broken.  Physically and mentally.  I can't even sit on my bed or look around without thinking of her, seeing her face.  Is anyone else going through this?  What do you do?  My family isn't supportive at all.
I love this woman so much I'd give up everything I own for her.  My grades, the degree, everything feels so fucking useless about now.  I feel pathetic."

My academics are sufficient for most schools as I am a national-merit scholar with a 4.0 unweighted GPA.  I feel I am a competent programmer and have spent time reading college lectures online and familiarizing myself with the computer science field.  These were the colleges my mom made me apply to and I procrastination and put in very little effort into the applications.  I realize now, right before other applications are due, why that was incredibly stupid of me.  I do not need that part reiterated to me.  **What I would like is your opinion on what the ramifications of going to each of the three following colleges would be and what other schools I should apply for before the week is done.**



Where I have currently applied:

University of Central Florida - They are a lesser school but they are close to home and want to pay for most of my education and put me on a track for a masters in 5 years after which I would asses further options.  Talking to friends there is discouraging though as the only class they say is hard freshmen year I can exempt due to an AP course.

MIT - I was deferred from the early application but i did not put my full effort into the application.  If I can edit the application before the regular decision I should get in.  I think the prestige of MIT stands alone.

Georgia Institute of Technology - They accepted my early application though affording tuition there will be tough.  They are ranked very high though I know little of the school besides their high prices.

I've been looking at the Transformer Prime with a dock, as that seems to basically be what I'm looking for. Nevertheless, with the recent crop of ultrabooks that have come onto the market, I now have a harebrained scheme in the back of my head to pick one up too. I guess I could dock my X220 and use it as a home machine while carrying around a Lenovo U300s, for example.

Now, the idea sort of sounds good in my head, but I also know that it's more than likely a ridiculous waste of money, especially since I could pick up a tablet for approximately half of what an ultrabook costs. I guess I'm looking for some sort of affirmation that I'm either a complete idiot or if this could be a decent idea."

Now what?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ntdba/got_a_pm_program_manager_internship_now_what/,"Next summer I will be interning as a PM at Microsoft.  I'm very excited about this, but I also have a couple of doubts:

* **What will a typical workday be like for me? ** 

I asked a couple of interviewers about this, and their responses were very varied; some of them definitely did their share of coding, while others did none; the job description also says that PMs consult with clients, meet with devs and testers, etc.  I just want a better idea of what being a PM is like from current or former Microsoft employees, or PMs from other companies... which brings me to my second question:


* **What is the future outlook for a PM?**

I believe this is the kind of job I'll want to stick with once I graduate; I'm really happy with both the company and the job description, (and hopefully I won't have to find out the answer to this question on my own) but how will this experience translate across to other companies?  A friend told me that other companies do have PMs, but they just don't recruit interns because they want people who already have experience.  How much truth is there to that statement?  Does it apply to both big and small companies?  Are there other similar jobs?

As far as my background is concerned, I will be graduating within a year with a BS in Computer Science from a fantastic school.  I have had a previous internship as a software engineer, although my project was very heavy on the UI design element.  My ideal job would involve my CS knowledge without being confined to a cubicle and writing code all day; my main interests are HCI, UX, UI design.

I am a former sonar technician of 5 years. I've been trying to find a job for a year and a half, and now my resources are exhausted deeply.

In my 24 years of life, I've taught myself countless programming languages as a hobby, including C/C++/C#, Java, Python, Lua, GameMonkeyScript, etc., mainly working on Windows and Linux platforms, taking great discipline on their respective console scripting languages and pipeline creating. I've also programmed using various graphics and audio libraries, more notably OpenGL/AL.

In my military career, I was taught more of the hardware side of things, from learning how to use basic electronic testing tools to troubleshooting advanced equipment using schematics. I'm also qualified as a quality assurance worker. 

As of this moment, I am going for my associates degree in computer science, so I will be happy for a non paying internship in software just to get my foot in the door, but I am more inclined to go for the electronics field in component-level troubleshooting, maintenance, and repair.

If you would like to know more, or would like to see my resume, please feel free to PM me, or email me at bmmgreen@gmail.com.

Need Advice.",Robin_Hood_Jr,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/nujx4/im_a_bme_undergrad_w_horrible_grades/,"I'm a student majoring in Biomedical Engineering at Boston University which is a top 10 undergrad school for that major according to various rankings. However as of now I have a 3.0 GPA and the chemistry and biology courses are a lot harder for me than I bargained for, and don't interest me AT ALL.

I should mention that I'm a 2nd semester sophomore at the moment.
My fear is that I don't see the classes getting easier any time soon, and so I will graduate with something around a 3.0. First this makes it almost impossible to get internships over the summer due to more competitive applicants being out there. Second, in a negative feedback loop with a shitty GPA and lack of resume experience, I won't get into a good grad school, thus dooming me to a life of shit...

I've been contemplating switching to Computer Science or Computer Science Engineering. Almost none of my credits transfer over so I would need an additional 4 years to graduate on top of the 3 semesters I've already done. I've done a little bit of programming in my free time and enjoy it but can't be certain my grades would be any better than I'm currently getting in BME.

So I guess what I'm asking: between 2.9-3.0 GPA from top 10 program in BME or assuming slightly better grades in CS/CSE, which is the more career-oriented decision?"

How to spin this?",OfficeBadBlood,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nu8xe/by_far_my_most_impressive_internship_ended_fairly/,"So I'm about to graduate from a very well respected university with a computer science major/ business minor.

In preparation for starting my full time job search, there's one thing that's kind of concerning me.

My grades are good but not phenomenal (Dean's list most terms and overall).  I also have some very good work experience from internships at well known large companies.

However, my most recent internship for a very prominent company where I did some really cool work ended with my worst performance review.  It was also the only internship where I didn't get a full time job offer.

I truly believe that, at least from a technical perspective, my work there was good given the circumstances.  I also worked harder than ever before (and harder than is healthy or reasonable, i.e. 80 hours some week) because I was really interested in my project.

However, my supervisor and I got off on the wrong foot and had a terrible relationship the whole time, which I believe is almost entirely to blame for my poor evaluation and lack of offer.  There was nothing unprofessional about it like overt discrimination or arguing, but we disagreed about the right way to do pretty much everything (even if both our ways were perfectly reasonable solutions), and it seemed to me like even when I would bend to his view, he would change it so I am still wrong.  Maybe I was not able to properly adjust to his style and that is partly my fault, but it was also not my first or even fifth job in the field, and it's the only time I've ever had any issues like this.

Due to the prominence of the company in my field and the fact that it's my most recent job, it's almost certain to be a focus in my upcoming full time job search.

I think dumping on your past boss in an interview looks bad, but so does 'poor' performance without an actual explanation.

How do I spin this to not look bad without saying we just hated each other."

I could use your advice before spending $75-$100 dollars or so on a new hard drive. I got my MacBook around August 2007. It's one of the plain white ones that were recently discontinued, not a pro. Anyways, a few months ago my computer froze and told me to do a hard reboot and when it came back on a folder with a question mark in it popped up and that's all that's happened ever since. 

I brought it to the Apple Store and I believe they said it was a failed hard drive. Now I've been waiting to hopefully buy a new one but it's become apparent to me that won't be happening until my internship ends in the summer (I get paid really poorly) so the only way I can have a Mac experience instead of using the dumpy laptop my work gives me I'd rather shell out the $100 for a new hard drive. 

So has this happened to anyone else? And was it as simple as replacing the hard drive? I have my Snow Leapord and Microsoft Office install discs still available also so that won't be a problem. "

Moving from one family member to another, till eventually she moved in with me and my family.  We got her a well paying job that she could use to support herself, but she hated working in an office, as she has only worked retail, which showed in her work and attitude which eventually got her fired. Slowly over time she gave up in our relationship, even though I did everything I could to help us and her. Including constantly searching for jobs and defending her from my family who was getting annoyed by her not doing anything to really help. She slowly started to resent me until one day it erupted into a hate she only reserved for her father and possibly Hitler. Over night I had become the worst scum alive and had done something that made me ""a manipulative and lying bastard"" and ""I was never a good person"" that she refused to reveal and yet would never tell anyone about. She then packed up and called my best friend to pick her up and take her away. She then moved in with him.

Last year, I was supposed to meet up with some friends, one of whom lived in a building with a hot tub on the roof and a pool and sauna in the basement. We, along with some others, were going to go party hopping and then hot tub to end the night. I bought a bottle of champagne for each of us to drink, as one does on New Year's Eve. Unfortunately, his phone died or something, so we lost contact. Me and the friend I was with were stuck with two bottles of champagne, two (preban) Four Lokos, and two tallboys of beer. Drank the beers, popped the first bottle on the L train at midnight, popped the second bottle on the dance floor at the second party. By 1:30, I had finished both bottles of champagne (mostly by myself) and started on the Four Loko. Gave the rest of it away.

Got calls from a couple of my niggas who were out in Williamsburg at a couple of loft parties that were apparently poppin' off. So my friend and I said our goodbyes and went to the L. I don't remember anything after I turned onto Myrtle Ave. except for a few brief flashes. Apparently, I said I was going to be sick, she bought me tacos from one of the best trucks in the area to settle my stomach, we got on the train, I started puking everywhere, I collapsed into a puddle of my own vomit and continued to puke, my nose started bleeding, and I was dragged onto the platform at the next stop. There were already cops there and they called for an ambulance when I couldn't stand up.

I woke up the next morning propped up in a bed in Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan with a plastic bag tied around my neck in case I puked (which I had) and no wristband. There was dried blood and vomit all over my face. My cash and MetroCard had been stolen from my wallet when the paramedics took it out of my pocket to figure out who I was in the ambulance. It was a brand new two-week unlimited I had just bought the day before and fifty dollars my grandparents had just given me for Christmas. A doctor was leading interns to my room. I heard him say, ""Now we'll see how to treat a patient who has overdosed on cocaine."" He came around the corner into my room, saw that I was awake, went, ""Oh,"" and led them elsewhere.

Apparently, before my friend left, they asked her repeatedly if I had done coke (I hadn't) and just continued to assume I had OD'd after she told them I hadn't touched it. And the younger of the two paramedics flirted with her in the ambulance while the older one went through my wallet. That's when we think they took the money and MetroCard.

I still went to work that day.

**tl;dr:** Got alcohol poisoning, collapsed into own vomit and blood, got robbed by paramedics, hospital left me alone without treating me for several hours so they could demonstrate how to treat the coke overdose they incorrectly assumed I had, still went to work."
nxprp,0,2011-12-31,"Dear Reddit, should I break-up with my girlfriend?",SYRIO_FOREaL,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nxprp/dear_reddit_should_i_breakup_with_my_girlfriend/,"We’ve been dating for almost 2 years now, and things have started getting complicated. Here is a little background:

We’re both university students making our way through our bachelors. I am studying as an “insert business related degree” and her, an ”insert science related degree”. My goal is to go to graduate school and receive my “insert professional title”. Her goal is not yet clear. But that doesn’t matter… where things are complicated is when you take into our parents and our culture.

We’re both “brown”. She’s from country “A” and I’m “B”. We’re both born into the same religion, so there is no religious tension. However, her parents are both highly educated (PhD and university professors), quite wealthy and very socially “connected”. In contrast, my parents aren’t as educated, they don’t have a complete grasp of the English language nor the “A” language (which are the languages my GF’s parents speak fluently), and are not wealthy at all (you might say poor, but I wouldn’t). 

My parents came here and, as the story goes for most immigrants who had young kids to raise, went straight to work. My parents worked in a factory and gave everything to my brother and I. My dad’s biggest regret was to never have been able to provide us with a house. We still live in an apartment. My brother (26) and I (21) share a room together. You might be wondering: “Why is your brother still living with your parents?” Well culturally we don’t leave our parents until after our marriage, but even then it’s not rare to see kids keep their parents company. My brother is such person; he will never leave our parents alone and will always be by their side whenever they need him to be. Another reason for my brother living with us is that he is the breadwinner now. My mom was laid off 2 years ago, and my dad barely kept his job, working for almost minimum wage. My brother works for a bank, and makes a good salary for a “bachelor”, but the combined salary of his and my dad’s is barely enough to support a family of 4. 

Through all this, my parents raised me to be an educated man, and I have a good future ahead of me. I estimate that upon my graduation, I’ll be starting off at 35k CAD (I am currently finishing up an internship with a multinational, and am expecting a contract). If I do get my title, I should be starting off closer to the 80k-100k mark, and it will only go higher. Why am I mentioning all this? It is because I want to be able to buy a house for my parents, for my dad, for my brother. For the people that have given so much to me.

What is the issue now? Well you might think it’s funny that a 21 year old would think about this, but that is the nature of our brown culture. My girlfriend and I have been talking about wedding and such, and when to tell our parents. I keep telling her to push it back till when I’m ready, but she feels guilty about hiding our “relationship” from her parents. She intends on telling them about us when we graduate. 

The problem? I don’t know how I’ll get my parents and her parents to ever get along. My parents are very reserved, rarely talk, and are not familiar to “high society”. I don’t want this to seem like a Disney love story, but in our brown culture, this whole issue about social/class status is a big deal. I’m afraid her parents will never allow her to marry me. Another thing that leads me to believe this is her mother who keeps telling her and her sister that it is important to find a partner who will be able to make sure that they are financially stable. Her sister is a “medical progressional” and will only marry someone of her “level”. She’s a very nice person, and I can understand her, I would do the same. I guess it’s just how we were raised, to always look for someone who is your equal. She met a new man and is getting serious about settling down. Whenever she mentions her boyfriend (who is also a professional in the medical field), she mentions how his family is rich and full of doctors/dentists/educated people. These conversations make my girlfriend uncomfortable; she’s like “fuck”. Not “fuck” as in “I chose the wrong guy”, but “fuck” as in “Why do we care about all that, it’s the guy who matters!” 

Up until this point, you would probably think it’s all a cultural issue. But sadly it isn’t. I think deep down, I’m not ready to commit. I’ve been having recurrent thoughts and dreams about… being single again. It’s gotten to the point where I question myself: 

-	Am I being honest to myself? 
-	This girl, who is probably the best friend I ever had, who would make a great mother, is she the one?
-	Am I actually committed to her, even if it’s been 2 years we’ve been together? 
-	Can I ignore all our family issues and still act like nothing bothers me?

I don’t know what to do. This might be the best thing, or the worst thing in my life. I feel like I’m in so deep with her (2 years is a big deal for me), that I feel like I owe it to us to make it work… But then again, I don’t know if I’m ready… ready for what? I don’t even know.

**TL;DR: Trying to keep everything in check, but self-questioning about culture, family and my own happiness leading to a strained inner conscious (relating to my relationship with girlfriend).**
