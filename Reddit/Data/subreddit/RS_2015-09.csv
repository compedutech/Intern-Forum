Background info:
I graduated high school at 16, got my diploma for that (average-high diploma in my country) 

Then I went to follow a Higher degree high school, but I couldn't be bothered and quit it. I thought it wasn't worth it.

After that I went to follow an Programming education, didn't work out, thought it was too easy, quit.

Then I followed the higher-highschool education again - but again I couldn't be bothered and just quit.

Then I started a new IT education(the one I'm following right now) I really like it, but I'm just a person that procrastinates. I passed the first year, but only barely, having to finish my work in the vacation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now in the 2nd year, I'm doing an internship at a company.
Long story short, I called in sick 3 times total. Stayed home for a week, 3 times. Spread over 13 weeks.

Now I've already blew another internship because those people treated me like shit, and according to school rules you're getting kicked off of the education if you quit 2 internships.

Now the boss of the company just called me, he said that I called in sick too often and they can't use anybody like that. So he told me to come by to his office tomorrow and there probably wont be a chance of me staying there.

SO that would mean I'd have to quit my education, which for the first time in 4 years I've actually passed the year for. Things we're finally going my way, and now this.

If I get kicked off of this education, I'll have 8k debt, I'll be 20, I wont have a job, and no clue on what to do.

Should I do another education? Should I find a job and pay the debt? If I switch educations, and the level of the education is lower than the one I have now, I'll have to pay the debt back aswell. If I pass however, the debt will be nulled. (that's how it works here) But the degree has to be the same level or higher.

I really just hate school, like I'm utterly disgusted by their faulty system and them providing zero useful information. I have no motivation towards it whatsoever, and that probably wont ever change.

TL;DR: Gonna get kicked off of my 4th education even though things we're finally looking my way for a change, leaving me with 8k debt, no job and no clue on what to do. What the fuck do I do ?

I'm currently 24 years old working on my Bachelors in Business Administration. 
I've always had a passion for computers my whole life.
Aside from working on my degree I am studying data center operations and JavaScript.

During my break away from school, I had nailed a very successful IT internship for a major broadcasting corporation. I was hired as an associate project manager for a data center migration which was a very exciting experience as well as an eye opener to the IT world on an enterprise level of perspective. 
I've also gained hands on experience with monitoring, application testing, vSphere, and some storage. 

I really enjoyed project management but I don't feel too strongly about pursuing it as a longtime career.
What interested me more was the engineering aspects of the project. (VMware specifically) The engineers that I worked with were really cool and showed me a few things here and there on vSphere and from there I was hooked. While virtualization is widely used, some might say the cloud is on the rise to being the next big thing. 

What I'm trying to get at here is that I am feeling very indecisive in choosing an area of focus to develop skills and hopefully pursue once I'm out of college. I would really appreciate it if any IT mentors can give me some feedback or advice on what type of framework I should build so that I am ready to start contracting/get hired out of college, Thanks."

I'm currently a PhD student planning to finish in ~2yrs. I have two offers for part-time jobs while I work on my PhD. Neither of them have any bennies.

I had an internship this past summer which resulted in an offer for $40/hr for general dev work under a great supervisor. However, they're extremely flexible in hours (I said I'd work around half-time), which means I could spend the remaining hours on my research, and the work is much less tiring. I also could remote if and when I needed to.

I also gave a talk at a top-tier conference this past summer, which resulted in a second offer: a data scientist position at a startup for $50/hr. However, they're a lot less flexible in work-hours (they want me to do 6/6/8 every week). My PhD is in data science, but not *exactly* in the area that they want me to work in, and since they're a startup, I'm expecting the work to be a lot more intense (so I probably wouldn't be able to do my own research on the 6 hour days).

I'm currently waiting to see what the first offer can do about the pay discrepancy, but that honestly won't influence my decision too much (I'll be making much more after I finish my PhD). There's some minor perks on both sides, as well as detriments- they seem to balance out as well. Commute is the same for both. It really seems like a choice between flexibility and being-closer-to-my-field.

If you were in my position, what would you do?"

I am a first year student in Computer Science at a university in Chicago. Now that I'm in college, I am extremely interested in landing an internship this summer.

As of now, I know Java in the sense that I've worked with all of the topics taught in normal coursework. From the fundamentals to more of the OOP concepts/other concepts (ie: inheritance, encapsulation, using interfaces, abstract classes). However, **I have no real experience**. I've only worked with Java's API, and no other. So, here are my questions:

1. What should I do to garner some experience on my own? (ie: Develop an Android Application, work on an open-source project). Please be specific if you an actual example

2. What's the best way I can maximize my chances of landing an internship at one of the larger companies?

3. I take my data structures and algorithms class next semester. If I really want the internship badly, should I start hustling right now and buy a book on D&amp;S and learn what I can? Or, should I wait for the class next semester?

4. How can I get better at Java? Note: I know the typical stuff taught in a first course, but **I dont know what to start working on to get better at Java**

5. I am somewhat ahead, if you will, at the university. I'm taking a Computer Architecture class taught in C and relearning in another class about File I/O, Inheritance, Interfaces, etc. Is it a good idea to focus a lot on C, or something else? (ie: should I invest my time more to that class to learn C, or pick up something like Javascript?

I'm looking for advice on how to plan my next few years in order to land the best possible job as a financial analyst. 


To start, here are some details about me: 

	
• I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Economics (with as much Econometrics work as possible) as well as minors in Business and Mathematics (taking primarily Statistics classes).


• I currently have a 3.78 GPA and I predict I will graduate with a GPA in the range of 3.7-3.85.


• I am currently not involved in any clubs, teams, or  fraternities.


• I don't know any programming languages and I only know the basics of excel. I started learning SQL a week ago though.


• The only experience on my resume is working in a movie theater in high school, but I just got a job this week as a front desk receptionist at a daycare for 10 hrs/week.


• I have no valuable connections.


My current plans:


1.  To get more involved, I am going to join the Finance club, Economics club, and Entrepreneur club in the fall. Also, my university has a fairly exclusive club called the Investment Group, which manages over a million dollars. I'm trying to boost my resume as much as possible over the next year so I can join as an analyst in fall 2016.


2. I will continue learning SQL and I will start improving my Excel skills.


3. I will meet with every advisor that I can on campus and see who can help me the most with becoming a financial analyst. 
	

Here are my main questions:


1. What programming languages and software should I be teaching myself?


2. How do I go about networking? I've heard about things like setting up informational interviews, but I don't know who to go to for those.


3. Probably the best thing I can do for myself is score a quality internship for the summer of 2016. I would love any tips on how to do this. 


4. What certifications do I need? Is there anything I can do to get those while I'm in college? And are there any additional certifications I should try to get?


5. I can tell now that it's too late for me to become something like an investment banker in NY. I don't go to the right kind of school, I don't know anyone, and my resume is just too weak. But I am curious, what are some of the best jobs I can aim for? I'm looking for goals and extra motivation


6. And my final, all-encompassing question: **what are the best things for me to do right now to prepare myself for a career as a financial analyst?**

3ja6br,2,2015-09-01,Is a social life important for an engineering student?,donsigler,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3ja6br/is_a_social_life_important_for_an_engineering/,"Warning, this is a long post with some heavy context. If this sort of thing isn't allowed here please (kindly) let me know.

I just started college as a freshman. I've been told that college is a time to start with a clean slate and do some real changes in your life. One of my biggest problems in high school was that I was socially awkward. For one, I expected to be spoken to and not to speak first (not out of some parental raising but on the flawed reasoning that unless someone spoke to me they didn't want anything to do with me). The only exception were people who I perceived as those who expect me to speak to them directly (e.g. a teacher who knows students will ask questions, or a serviceman/woman who knows I will approach them for help/take my order). I had no trouble to talking to my family and my few friends. This made it difficult for me to make new friends, as you might imagine. I didn't like meeting new people because I knew that I would be too scared to talk to them because I felt like I was invading their presence. Because of this, I didn't do things like saying hi to people except for my few friends, among other social skills. I realized that this could leave me in the dust in terms of career development because I learned how important connections are as an adult, so I hoped maybe I'd have a second chance.

Fast forward to college. I must note that my major isn't the typical engineering degree but certainly has the science/math focus of one. In addition, I go to a relatively small school with around 45 freshman and around 180-200 undergraduates. This school is focused entirely on an interdisciplinary field of science, meaning almost everyone here has one of two majors relating to this field of science. (I'm sure some of you can figure out what this school is just for this data). Unique housing circumstances put us in temporary housing out of campus, in which I was assigned a single suite. 

It's been a little more than a week since I've been with my 45ish classmates, but yet I don't socialize much with them save for lunch/breakfast/dinner where I may speak a little bit. Anytime else, I'm not talking to anyone. If I'm not attending class or doing homework, I'm just in my room playing video games alone. I did make one friend though, who shares many of my interests. But as the year(s) or even semester goes on I'm not sure if we will stay that way. He's a transfer student coming in as a junior so he will undoubtedly get very busy soon. 

I don't have anything against my classmates. I actually think they are very nice and helpful people, and don't (seem to) think I'm any sort of hindrance or annoyance. I can freely talk to them about academics (as I did with my high school classmates). But at the same time, I feel estranged from them. We may be a small freshman class, attending mostly the same classes, and even have the same general academic interest, but I don't seem to be associating closely with them the way they do with each other. They hang out in each others' rooms and go places together. They *talk* more frequently among themselves than I do to most others, save for my one friend who I talk freely with. Many of these people do play video games like me, but mostly MOBAs (e.g. LoL,Dota 2) among some other games I do not play at all. I play games that everyone seemed to play years ago (e.g. Minecraft. Yes I know it's still alive but I guess many people moved on). Combined with a startling lack of common ground knowledge (like pop culture) it's hard to establish new connections.

Maybe I'm overreacting and jumping to some conclusion that I'll lead the same socially isolated life I did in high school. After all, it hasn't even been a month yet, and the classes haven't gone on warp speed. Maybe I'm overlooking the fact that I spoke to people in the first place and made a friend. Clubs haven't even had their first meeting yet, and I did sign up for a few. But the current situation stresses me because it seems very concerning that I struggle to socialize in a *small* group of *like-minded* people. One of my high school friends assured me that I would find new friendships in such an environment, but I'm not sure if that will be the reality. In addition, my parents called one day, and when I told them I really wasn't hanging out with anyone and being part of a friend group, they seemed a bit startled. They reminded me of how I stressed the importance of making connections in college, and that locking yourself in your single suite will only impede making them.

I post this because perhaps some input from students will calm my nerves. Maybe the way college friendships start is not instantaneously but over time, or later in the semester. Maybe they are forged in ways I am not aware of. Maybe I shouldn't even worry about whether I socialize with my classmates but whether I succeed in my courses and get internships. Maybe I am worrying too much and should just do what comes natural. 

Again, apologies if this is not suited here and for the post's length.

I was wondering, however, how the market looks for part-time back-end devs (if there's such a thing).  I've looked online and I see a lot of part-time positions for front-end devs, but I haven't seen much in the market for back-end devs.  Does anyone know of a good place to look for part-time, back-end positions?  Craigslist maybe?  I do know some front-end, as I have used quite a bit in the past, but back-end is where I usually gravitate.  Or would it be better to get another position somewhere else with a higher paycheck?"

I ended up being dismissed, reinstated, then ended up leaving halfway through May because I just couldn't handle it due to health and mental issues.

Since then I've been going to various doctors to help me and I feel that I have gotten a lot better since then. I started going to a gym and I'm just happier in general.

My issue now is that I now have a few months before I go back to college (currently planned for January) and don't really know what to do with my time. My parents are starting to get on my case, and rightfully so I suppose, about not having a job yet. I don't have my license yet (currently retaking drivers ed to try for that again), so it's not that easy to get around to potential jobs, and honestly I don't know where to look or how to even go and get one. My internships that I've done previously were both kinda just given to me through my parents and my college, so I've never had to go off on my own and find anything.

I'm a computer science major, so I've been trying to at least study new languages and work on side projects in my spare time so that I have something to show for my time, but I don't think that's enough. I was thinking that maybe I could volunteer at a local church or something, in addition to working on programming projects, but I wanted to see if anyone else had some other opinions or ideas on what I should do.

I'm honestly up for anything at this point. My parents don't even care so much about me getting a job as much as just getting out of the house and going to do something. The gym isn't enough. I need something more to do.

So any help/ideas would be appreciated!"

3jfy5u,9,2015-09-02,"Got a generous offer that would pay for school and give me a full time job after graduation, but I'm conflicted...",Jakanzi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3jfy5u/got_a_generous_offer_that_would_pay_for_school/,"**Background**: I just finished an undergrad in math, and am about to start a masters 
in computer science at a top 15 university. I'm doing an internship for a
government lab in New Mexico this summer and they've offered me a special
fellowship program while I'm in school in exchange for working for them after
graduation. It's an amazing offer, but I'm conflicted about it.

**The offer**: They would cover my tuition (~$15,000 a year) and give me a monthly
stipend while in school (~$3000/month and I don't have to work for them while I'm taking classes). I would work for them in the summer and 
after I graduate and then I'd be obligated to work for them for at least 2 months
for every month that I'm in school (so if I take 1.5 years for my masters, I'd work for them
for 3 years). After I graduate, my expected starting salary would be somewhere around $90K

Pros and cons that matter to me:

**Pros**:

* Work life balance is really great. They're a government contractor so it's relatively low stress. I'd have 3 day weekends every other week. I'd have time to do outdoor stuff, work on side projects, read books, etc. I have no desire to work in a high paced startup or somethign like that so this suits me.
* The work can be super interesting, the organization I'd be joining works a lot with satellites and space systems 
* Basically free money while in school. I don't need the money (I'm debt free and with my savings and family support could get through graduate school debt free as well) but it'd be nice to have positive cash flow.
* I find applying for jobs to be a fairly stressful and time consuming process, so I don't have to worry about that while in school.
* New Mexico has extremely low cost of living compared to SF / LA / NY / other tech hubs. 
* Would be surrounded by a lot of smart people (pretty much everyone has graduate degrees in engineering)

**Cons**:

* I haven't had the chance to work for a big 4 or other well known tech companies and I'd still like to do so eventually. In some ways it's superficial but my dream is still to work for a place like Google some day that has brilliant engineers and is doing work I care about
* The work is interesting but the mission of the company primarily deals with national security and nuclear weapons, which makes me feel a bit uneasy
* The offer requires that I do a thesis, which wiill be a lot of work
* Company has really smart researchers but lacks good software engineering, so I'm not sure I'd have as many people to learn from in terms of writing good, robust code (kinda scary when you think about what the company works with)
* I'm from southern California so I'd be moving away from friends, family, and a big city and starting over. I don't have a lot of social needs and I'm pretty good about making new friends so this is manageable but I could imagine getting lonely as well.
* New Mexico doesn't have much of a tech community

I recognize this is a pretty good position to be in and either way I should be okay but it's still nerve wracking to be making a decision that essentially determines the next 5-6 years of my life. Anybody have any advice on whether I should accept the offer?"

We both like things the other doesn't, which im happy about because there is a gray area which I can call my private space, therefore we have an agreement to have 2 hours of privacy each day.    

Now that you know a little about me and gained some insight lets get straight to the Point, yesterday morning i got a call from my coworker (a pretty good friend and anime lover as well) saying we had the day off due to some intern problems that had to be sorted out properly, so i thought well ok nice, time for Anime! So i sat down and browsed our beloved interwebs for a new Anime i'd be able to enjoy, about 20 minutes into my research my coworker called me again asking to come over to my place to show me a new anime he is thrilled to watch, saying ""its about cute animal-girls, bla bla"". Half an hour later after i had aggreed to watching this so called cute anime with my coworker, he arrived at our appartment and starts watching the Anime ""Monster Musume"" with me. Yes, this is indeed an Ecchi (pervy) anime and after a discussion wether or not i'd watch the show i aggreed. Now Keep in mind, my girlfriend does NOT like anime, and im in a healthy relationship with her. After watching the first 4 episodes (currenty there are 8 or 9 in total aired) I had to take a break because it got waaaay too weird (watch the first episode for yourself to judge..) Thats when things got weird. After the break i got back into my room, to witness my girlfriend looking at the screen with wide open eyes and being all flustered at the scenery that embraced in front of her. After that she just stared at me with frightened eyes, peeked a last time at the screen and vanished into her room. After that I told my friend to quit here for today and not watch this show again (this was at 5 p.m). The next day (today) i woke up at 6 a.m (EST) to get ready for work, and was going into my girlfriends room to wake her up, but i was too late to do so. What i have witnessed at that moment was my girlfriend sitting in front of her Computer and watching the anime that my friend had seen with me yesterday. To be exact, she binge watched that anime, and two others that were pervy as well.    

What have I done.    


**tl;dr 1** Had the day off at work and decided to watch Anime with my coworker who's also my friend, showing me a pervy Show. Girlfriend usually is not into Anime and fell in love with the idea of a pervy Anime, now watching pervy Animes since probably 14 hours straight with a locked door, now wants to start watching normal stuff with me^^yay!    
    
**tl;dr 2** Im such a f***ing moron/genius?    
    
Edit 1: To clarify, we both have a room together and each of us has his own room for activities equipped with a bed for guests, she sleeps there occasionally if i snore too loud^^sorry    
    
Edit 2: **THE DOOR HAS OPENED!** Surprise Surprise, she locked the door, watched 3 more hours of pervy stuff (apperently she watched a Show called To Love Ru) and **just passed out in front of her Computer**, so thats that... Apperently she wants me to show her some normal Anime and, in my glorious Moment (thanks brain u fucking retard), i told her i'd be happy to watch pervy stuff with her ^^yay...    

Edit 3: After she finally opened the door my girlfriend now seems to be in uber anime mode, she told me that she wants me to bingewatch Brotherhood with her now, i seriously hope this won't turn out to be a huge mess. (on a sidenote, she hasnt really passed out, she just fell asleep, sorry for the wrong wording!)    

Final Edit: Girlfriend saw first 3 episodes of Orignial FMA, loves it, Bayo Doppler still in my inventory as my friend said no, ~~praying that thats all thats going to happen.~~ **FUCK.** Just received an email that *my order* has been sent. Girlfriend straight up purchased FMA:B bluerays and a **Suu hugging pillow**.. RIP wallet"

Said media company is going nowhere and if they do start paying her it'll be 7,000 a year.

Anyway she's had 2 interviews so far. One for a professional media company in London and the 2nd in the same city as my job.

She's emailed back saying thanks for the opportunity and asking for further information on the freelance work.

1) How do I help this not get to her? She's upset, doesn't want to work at her current internship anymore and she's tired of living in her home city as all of her friends have moved on. We want to live together but obviously that's financially impossible at the moment.

3jifb0,11,2015-09-03,Hi /r/india! Need advice from you guys regarding MS. Please help!,MSinUSthrowaway,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3jifb0/hi_rindia_need_advice_from_you_guys_regarding_ms/,"I want to do MS in US next year. However, I am really worried about paying off the loans. Things like these have been worrying me for past few days:

* What if I don’t get a job after graduation?

* What if I don’t get an OPT extension?

* What if I don’t get an H1B visa?

I’m from a middle class family and have been working for over 2 years. However, I want to get a degree in ~~Computer Science~~ Software Engineering (I’m an Electronics engineer) and don’t want to study for GATE (which is like quite difficult to be honest and the returns are really not that great).

What do you guys suggest? I’m looking for universities that are inexpensive as well as good enough for computer science so that if the worst happens, i.e. getting kicked out of the US without any job, I am able to pay off loans in somewhat less number of years. Also, what do you guys think about doing MS in Europe (especially Germany), Australia or even Japan? Will I be able to secure jobs in these countries to at least pay off my loan (this being the most important concern for me)? Please help! Thanks! 

EDIT: Here's my profile: I've graduated from a premier institute two years back with a CGPA of 7.7x and have been working with a renowned MNC as a software developer. I can get good recos from my manager and my advisor during my internship and could get decent recos from my profs as well. I have pretty good GitHub profile with a lot of different projects in languages such as JavaScript, Python and Java and some of them have been well received as well. 

*Please note that I'm not aiming for top 10 or any top university which are too expensive. I just want to get admit into a good university where I can get jobs or internships easily (or at least should not be too difficult).*

PS: Please also suggest some other subreddits where I could get some help with this regard. Thanks!"

It comes with an great salary, great benefits, and paid overtime. The problem is, I accepted the internship because they were the first company to offer me one and I was scared that I wouldn’t get another offer. Now I need to accept the job offer by next week and I haven’t even started looking for other jobs. I got back from the internship less than a month ago and my school’s career fair isn’t until October. It’s a good offer, but it seems foolish to accept it without even applying to any other place. I have a 3.6 GPA in computer engineering, but that and now the internship are the only notable things on my resume. I graduate in May, so I would still have a lot of time to job hunt, but there is not even close to a guarantee that I will find a better offer than this.

I enjoyed my internship and I would be happy working for them, but the job is a little of the easy side. It’s more of an implementation job and I would like to get into something more engineering related.

In the job offer it states that it is employment at will and that there is not an employment contract between me and the company.

What do you guys think?

3jj9s5,1,2015-09-03,Home Office: Boston vs New York,cuitb,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/3jj9s5/home_office_boston_vs_new_york/,"Hey,

I'm fixing on signing my offer at a Big 4 and am trying to decide between residing in Boston or New York. I was wondering if starting off in one or the other has any advantages?  

This summer, I interned at the firm (in Boston) and the one thing that people kept on stressing is the fact that an office location is more than just a ""city preference"".   

Apparently, there are a few things that kind of decide your career path based on what office you're based out of?  
  - Types of Clients (FSI, Healthcare, TMT)  
  - Size of the office (Ability to network - important when considering GSAP)  
  - Available Initiatives

Personally, I have **0** ties to either city. I have friends in both cities and all of my family resides out west. However, it's starting to become apparent that Boston may be the smarter choice due to it being a much smaller office (still the 4th biggest). Also, since I've already started my ""network"" there as an intern, it could possibly be easier to maneuver my way around to get what certain projects that I want to be on.  

On the other hand, this is going to be my 4th year in Boston. It's a great city and all but I feel as if it's kind of holding me down on a personal level. Being there all of last summer made me realize how small the city is and how quick you can run out of things to do. In hopes that I will be traveling, I can always make those weekend trips to NYC, but it still wont be the same. I'm up for losing half my paycheck to rent and taxes just to experience NYC, but it's also a lot to take on at once given the fact that I've only been there once for a week.  

My question is, from a professional standpoint, is it worth residing in Boston for a few years to get started and then try to move on? My gut tells me to go to NYC but I just don't want it to mess things up for me in the future. If you guys could offer any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. I've been thinking about this for weeks now and still have no clue.

**TLDR; Two cities: Boston vs New York. Prefer New York, but feel as if Boston will be better for my career as a consultant in terms of firm involvement and project availability **

3jjnkz,1,2015-09-03,Can't decide if I should accept an undergraduate research position,screaming_nugget,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3jjnkz/cant_decide_if_i_should_accept_an_undergraduate/,"Hello, I was looking for some advice about a situation I'm in. 

Background about myself: I am starting my sophomore year at a state university with a pretty decent CS program. This past summer I was an instructor at a tech summer camp teaching programming to kids. Before college I had an IT support job for a few years. Classes I've taken so far are the intro CS course, data structures and algorithms (pretty basic though, basically CS II), and discrete math. This semester I'll be taking machine architecture, linear algebra, and 'advanced programming principles' (not sure what it entails, it's part of our core curriculum). 

So anyway, I saw an opening for a research assistant position and sent in my resume. I had an interview and they've offered me the job. The only issue is that while I would be working 10-15 hours a week during the school year, which is perfect for me, they expect to get most of their work done in the summer, and use the school year to also sort of train me in and prepare me for the summer. It's part of a data mining research group, and they're doing really cool stuff.

My problem is that this would then be my summer job, working 40 hours a week, and I cannot decide if it is worth it if it means I won't have an opportunity for an internship doing software development or something else at a company, which I would feel is better for my resume as well as more lucrative (I'm pretty sure the research job pays an hourly wage, my guess is somewhere from $8-12). 

Any thoughts? I know I could accept the job for now and leave them later, but I would feel like a huge dick since this is basically all preparation for the summer. 

Thanks!"
3jjoho,1,2015-09-03,MIS Student - Full Time Job Offer,jonniearr,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3jjoho/mis_student_full_time_job_offer/,"Hi everyone. I received a full time job offer from an oil company I've interned with previously and would like some additional input.

Background: Two internships with the company. One at their IT headquarters in a functional role. The second was at their Alaska BU office (considered 'prestigious' among IT) in a more technical role.

I loved my first internship and would have gone with them in a heartbeat after that summer. My second summer, I was really happy with the work I did and the development throughout the summer, but I didn't think I fit in with the company.

Now, they've extended me an offer and I'm unsure. The starting salary is $71k, with a 1.5k signing bonus, and $9k to move to a small town (30,000 people). If I ask for an extension, I lose the signing bonus but that is all.

The program has three years of IT rotations with exposure to upper management, technical and functional development. Because I'm graduating early, I'd start before the summer development program in early Spring. This means, I'd be placed in whatever role they'd like, and very likely stay in it after my first rotation (that's what historically happens).

What I really value in a company is the culture and people, as well as the opportunity to advance technical skills. Here are some of the pros and cons:

Pros -

1. Large network because of previous internships

2. Great reputation

3. Amazing pay and benefits (401k is great)
4. Younger friend from very first internship likely to be there with me
5. Living in a small town I'd save a lot of $
6. Development and mentoring are pretty good
7. Previous internship time (6 months total) counts towards vacation time
8. When oil is good, they take amazing care of you

Cons-

1. Small conservative town (I'm young and gay)
2. Placed in a role I have no information about
3. Low morale, constant talk of layoffs and oil problems due to current economy
4. Doesn't support a masters/MBA (I want to pursue it eventually)
5. Not many other companies in the town to network with/look into
6. Would like to leave the south
7. Haven't actively looked anywhere else since August 2013 - What if there's something else that fits what I'd like?
8. Company isn't extremely gay friendly
9. Fear of being in a group that is laid off (other employees have already expressed their own concern that their entire group could be let go)

Any thoughts or opinions? I have been looking at other places, and I have a few leads with consulting firms, but my university just started back this week - It's still very early into recruitment. "

I wanna know what are my real chances at this programs, please help if you can provide some advice on that :)

**Background**:

I'm from Brazil, graduating at the end of the year in Information Systems.

**Programs I am (mainly) interested in applying for (all PhD in Computer Science)**:

- CMU (either the Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization program or the Pure and Applied Logic one)
- Harvard
- Berkeley
- MIT (Area II: Systems, Theory and AI)

**Academics/etc**

Haven't taken GRE yet. Doesn't have SAT/etc (because not from the US :( ).

GPA: 90 out of 100 (we use 100 point absolute grades at my uni).

First of my class.

Have good grades on the relevant courses for the areas I intend to apply (mainly Algorithms or Theory). Like, got 100 in Algorithms &amp; Data Structures 1 and 2, Discrete Maths, Logic. (My 'bad' grades are usually in the management/business courses required for my degree).

Studied in the US as a visiting student because I got a government sponsored scholarship due to good acadamic standing.

**Research Experience**

Virtually none (which is the tough part :( ).

Have my undergrad thesis on Distributed Systems, but hasn't generated any papers anywhere from it yet.

Did a summer internship at CMU that involved a little bit of research as well, but was more programming oriented (did a poster presentation of the research part, but that was it).

I mainly didn't do it because I was working full time + doing university during all my graduation (live by myself, need to pay for my bills, so couldn't not work) and therefore didn't have enough time to dedicate to it. Idk if mentioning that helps me.


**Extracurriculars**

National finalist at ACM ICPC (programming contest) twice, bronze medal in one of those (with good chances of getting there 3rd time this year and hopefully doing better). First team from my university to ever get a medal at the national finals.

Teaching assistant for two years in Algorithms &amp; Data Structures 1, Functional Programming and Logic (twice). 

Gave courses in Game Development for some University events and some classes in Algorithms for people new in programming competitions.

Have worked full time as programmer for 5 years (some of it as lead developer of a team).

Have started a company for developing games with some friends, we have a mobile game out and did several advergames for other companies.

Participated in Algorithm Summer Schools here as well.

**Other Stuff**

I think I have professors that would give me very strong recommendations. Also people at CMU (from the internship) said they would be glad to give me recommendations for grad programs for my work there.

To me that seems like shooting yourself in the foot (although I could just be ignorant on the matter). The industry placement years don't seem any different considering that you can do internships anyway and the one and only different between an MSc degree and a BSc degree is the lack of a 4th year in the latter and higher grade requirements for the former, although you could switch to the MSc halfway through essentially eliminating any difference. So in conclusion, is there any reason to choose anything else apart from pure CS (unless you are trying to enter a niche market)?"
3jntyp,3,2015-09-04,I quit my job today and now have 6 weeks of spare time. How should I use the time to improve my skills?,ehochx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3jntyp/i_quit_my_job_today_and_now_have_6_weeks_of_spare/,"I have 6 weeks left until grad school begins and today was my last day at work. I've just graduated with a BSc in CS and have worked as software engineer at a multinational company during that time.

My job for the last few months was about (real-time) operating systems for embedded systems which required understanding of low-level mechanics such as context switching and interrupts. My entire team was absolutely satisfied with my performance (I surpassed the team's expectations) and my supervisor offered me a summer internship for 2016.

All in all I think I can say I've proven myself to be a pretty solid software engineer with some good experience and a nice skill-set with an emphasis on lower-level programming. 

My Master's won't be closely related to CS / software engineering (it's called IT Security although the IT is misleading, the degree heavily involves cryptography and system security and doesn't have anything to do with what Americans would define as IT).

I'm not sure in which direction I want my career to go in the future but as of yet I could see myself doing malware analysis, cryptography or even low-level security-related programming but I'd like to retain and improve my CS / SE skills. Thus I'm looking for some suggestions that would supplement my acquired knowledge. I've been looking into Clean Code, The Algorithm Design Manual (I've read the first ~170 pages so far), Programming Windows and Effective Modern C++ but I'm open for suggestions. I'd be even interested in some new technologies that would broaden my skills.

Thanks a lot in advance!"

Honestly I don't know what to say, though I am grateful for the opportunity it feels really weird. I graduate at the earliest next Spring. I don't know what the role would be like but I'm kind of intimidated by it since I haven't done anything like it before. Is this normal?

I started to begin learning Java and coding with java in the beginning of of my freshman year of college. It is my first and only language that I know of.

The first course I took first semester was quite easy. I could finish coding assignments within a day or two. The second course I took second semester got exponentially harder. It introduced stacks, queues, and trees. The projects got exponentially harder each time. Not only did it took more time, but I also required help from someone that is better than me at coding. I completed that course with high grades, but I felt like I couldn't do anything without help...

The projects were quite enjoyable for me, but I didn't like the time limit I had on it...

After the semester ended, I wanted to find something to improve my coding abilities and hone my skills. I couldn't find anything that is not intimidating (TopCoder, etc.). I got really afraid and didn't know what to do...

I am starting this year with intro to computations and system principles. I am really afraid of having that feeling of being inferior than everyone else and require help with everything... It makes me feel like I am incapable of doing well in that course.

What should I do this year to boost my confidence and skills?
Should I look for internships? Is there a website I can practice on with the skills I have so far?"

I’m a student at a pretty good school with a good GPA. I get that I'm inexperienced and employers need a way to see how I think and solve problems, hence they use these painful interviews but I just don't interview well.
I’ve failed all of my technical interviews so far, and I'm trying to figure out what I can do about it.
The thing is that I feel pretty strong at the job but freeze on interviews. I just get nervous under pressure and can’t think straight. It's frustrating, because I'm able to solve most of the problems if I work on them by myself without somebody watching and testing me all the time. 

I'm entering my third college year. As the recruiting season is about to start, this next internship (summer 2016) is a big part of my resume for full time employment.

I couldn’t get a CS job for my first summer. Then on the second year I was able to get quite a few interviews (including a phone screening to Google) but didn’t get pass any of them. As a last resort to ‘save’ my resume and have relevant internship experience I volunteered to work at a nonprofit for free. That place was nice but I worked for free and ended up feeling lousy. I feel like this is the money time and I have to step it up.
I read and solved most questions on Cracking the Coding Interview and solved a whole bunch of HackerRank Challenges. This was good but it doesn't help me to pass my interviews. I was even considering to take some paid mock interviews at CareerCup or Evisors or any of these sites. They charge a hell lot of money (over $100 an hour, some even more) and I’ll probably need a lot of these mock interviews. I can’t afford and don’t want to pay so much.

Can anyone offer any advice? Have you experienced something like this? What hacks helped you to overcome interviewing difficulties?

Whether you are in under or grad school I do not think that matters TOO much.  Overall I feel that you have a much better chance at getting into these top tech companies as you are still a students on the verge of graduating in a few months.  I feel that is the the best chance for companies to grab rockstar programmers while the pickin' is hot as they usually get first dibs.  Maybe about the top 1% of applicants actually get into these companies.  The cycle repeats itself next summer.  In most cases you get accepted to these companies either as a summer intern or if you have interned in a previous summer a chance at getting hired full-time.  People say that it is easier to get into a Big 5 if you intern first, prove yourself during your stay and try to beat out the other interns to secure a spot as a regular employee.  Based on the type of questions asked for an internship role I believe this is true.  The questions seem more fundamental than if you were to apply to the company and go through the hiring process.  Furthermore, their internal recruiters pretty much calls everyone they can no matter what school you came from because the best programmers do not necessarily come from the best schools.  Hard to believe, huh?  Not really considering you have people who can hack their way through the Internet and shut down government websites in the Dark Web.  I've had companies like Google, Amazon, and LinkedIn chasing after me (I didn't apply to Apple, MS or FB at the time) and now that I am chasing after them I do not even get a phone screen from them, but their dreaded email notifying you that you were not what they were looking for at this time and they would keep your resume on file.  What gives?  Is it because I have been out of school too long already and they would rather spend their $100K base, $100K sign-on and $150K RSUs on a 21 year old without any industry experience?  It doesn't make sense to me.  Someone please school me on their logic."

However: I also have been invited for interviews at Google, and two quant trading firms in New York. All three of these have notoriously difficult interview processes, so I don't want to bank on getting any offer from them.

Basically my question is: should I just cancel my other interviews and accept what's a sure deal, or try to delay acceptance of my current offer? What's a reasonable time frame to delay accepting an offer? Should I even mention that I'm interviewing at other places? I feel like it would be a huge mistake if I accepted the current place, kept interviewing, then ditched if I got a better offer.

Only complaint was I didn't really talk much I guess.  I'm extremely shy and have always suffered from social anxiety ever since I was young.  I don't know how to talk to people unless it's 100% technical it kind of takes the pressure off me if there is an objective truth to the topic being discussed not personal opinions or how the weather is.  I kind of have only like one friend (my gf who I initially met online) and I don't know how to make others

I mean I don't know if that's why I didn't get an offer but there was really no negative critique of anything technical I got done except me not talking and asking enough questions but I didn't really have many, I could find out all the answers via Google/SO.  I thought this was a good thing...  I thought I had an offer locked down but I get a call and nope...

This has really been a hard blow for me and I've taken it really personally, put me right back down into intense imposter syndrome.  This was the only good internship offer I got so I feel like I got lucky and it was a fluke and I'll never get anything this high paying again (was equiv. to like $95k yearly salary, more with the overtime I did)

How big of a deal is no return offer?

I don't know what to think or how to explain it when asked in future interviews

What do I do regarding this lack of a return offer...  I think it's because of how awkward/shy I am but I don't feel it affects my work much...

Transferred to UIUC Computer Engineering after 3 semesters of CC. Finished winter, summer semester so far and took basic programming course and data-structure/algorithm course.

Currently taking a Computer Systems Engineering (Embedded C, Assembly, and writing operating system), and Communication Network (socket programming). 

My GPA is poor (around 3.1, major GPA worse) and personal project is practically non existent. ( I don't even have github but most difficult personal project was making a simple web storage using WAMP/AWS cause I wanted try out PHP/mySQL )

I've been working as IT as part-time for past 8 months to support myself ( family thing zero allowance or college support ) since I've came to UIUC but nothing more than a simple tech support with no required programming. But taking data structure and algorithm during summer while doing practically full-time IT work was a big hit on my grade. My excuse would be that it was a tough semester with more than 50% of the students dropping (~150) but recruiter will not give a shit and I can't prove that I actually understand the material better than what my grade represent unless I get asked a question or have a chance at interview.

Honestly I'm writing this article with career fair coming around and I really want to sell myself to grab myself an internship but, I'm feeling really behind compare to my peers from transferring, deciding on my major late, and just never having the motivation to start on projects (flat out lazy).

My resume will be way stronger after the current semester (ending this dec.) with competitions I'll be participating while making operating system, hackathons I'll be attending, and projects I'll be starting with socket programming. But, It seems like including the coursework on resume is generally discouraged and most of the companies finish their recruiting by dec. from what I've heard. 

I've done enough bashing myhead on ""What have I been doing with my life"" now its more like ""I'll use any resources I can to help remedy the situation and try to work with what I have.""

TL;DR: Junior in CE with a very weak resume, need help on selling myself at Career fair for chance at interview and furthermore internship.

The other option is to get a second degree at a local state uni (GMU), but this could take a significant amount more time (~1.5 years). The advantages to GMU would be better networking, more internship opportunities, more time to build projects, and thus better overall career opportunities. The disadvantages are the longer time and the mess of prereqs I have to jump through just to get into the program at GMU. 

The advantage to the OSU program is I could just power through it, maybe get an internship if the opportunity arises, and be on the job market 2 years from now instead of looking at 2-3 more semesters to go. I might even be able to hold down a full time job while doing it.

Anyhow, to be able to intern and take upper div next year, I need to finish my lower div as soon as possible.  

I know for sure I will be taking 61B and CS70 since that's the pre req for every upper div. However, I'm stuck on what my third class should be.. my choices are either 16b(I'm in 16a right now, that's the new ee20/40), 61C, or a upper div humanity.

here is a good layout:
My current schedule is ee16a, 61a, psych167AC
Spring: 61B (Joshua Hug), CS70(Venkat Anantharam; Anant Sahai), CS61C(Randy H. Katz; Vladimir Stojanovic)

OR: Spring: 61B (Joshua Hug), CS70(Venkat Anantharam; Anant Sahai), ee16b(Michel Maharbiz)

the 61b teacher looks good, cs70 is going to suck either way, but which is the better teacher between 16b and 61c?

3juoom,16,2015-09-06,Joining a team with no senior developers?,zzypluralzalpha,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3juoom/joining_a_team_with_no_senior_developers/,"About me: I have about 3 years of experience outside of college + internships.

I'm considering joining a startup with no real senior developers on their technical team. The team of 5 is an insanely intelligent group of high performers, but out of them I will have the most experience at 3 years.

I think I still have a lot to learn. In the past I have always looked to my team lead for the mentoring/teaching moments, but their CTO (not a technical person, but has a decent understanding of programming and is essentially leading the team at the moment) thinks that I will find that I don't really need that senior level person.

They are a rapidly growing team that is open to hiring a senior level person if I can come up with a reason that it's necessary, but this time it is explicitly their plan not to hire someone more senior.

Is it a good idea to join this team? It's an otherwise awesome company, but I'm kind of afraid that not having the mentor/direction that comes with a senior developer will hurt my growth."

I am looking for some advice. I have heard many people say you should start as early as the summer before your senior year searching for a job and some say a couple months before you graduate. 

I wanted to ask your advice as to when, and where I should start looking for jobs.

As of right now, I am an intern with a large insurance company(10,000+ employees over 3 locations). The team I work with administers the windows and VM environments. I have had great experiances building servers, vm clusters, powershell scripting, some web programming, working with SQL databases, my team also administers our citrix environment in which our main buisness application is run on.

So, if there are any pointers you all have I would greatly appreciate them.

As a final note, I currently live in New York(not the city, or anywhere close) and I really want to leave this crappy state when I graduate and go to North Carolina. If anyone has any pointers in particular for finding my first job out of state, that would be amazing.

Thank You!"
3jv81d,11,2015-09-06,TIFU when I finally had to pay for porn,coozin,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3jv81d/tifu_when_i_finally_had_to_pay_for_porn/,"So my girlfriend and I have a joint cell phone plan. We live in Italy now and laws are a little different. Not just any schmo can open an account apparently, so since I arrived and I didn’t speak the language super well I said, “sure, let’s get on the same plan.”

Fast forward months later and we start to notice that our bill is raising at an alarming rate and based off of how many video games I play on the metro while using data, I assumed it was that. We both agree this is getting a bit ridiculous and we should switch to a better phone plan as soon as possible (that way we don’t incur data overages (under the previous assumption)). So we’re heading down to the local mall to appear in front of the store to request a new plan and to understand exactly what happened with the overages. When we arrive the clerk is breaking down the bill with us and says here it is 500€ charge on videogame and extra services. He asks if you really want to know what occurred I can look at the phone. An enormous red flag appears and is waving in my mind, something about handing over the phone to the other gentleman told me I was in for trouble. He downloads some custom mobile app onto the phone created by their company to see which “additional services” I was using. 

Then it happens, the longest most undeniable list of porn applications pops up on my phone for the entire store to see in big grandma-sized-font. These apps have somehow attached themselves to my phone. I’ve been receiving mysterious SMS texts but I assumed they were just spam. Growing up pampered in the United States I’m used to the cellular service company actually protecting us when the mobile porn industry tries to bankrupt you. Among the enormous list of conspicuous porn applications were SEXY4YOU, SpankDatAss, KissMeBaby, etc etc. This is where I was frozen in place, I attempted to laugh but it was immediately suffocated by overwhelming embarrassment. Do you ever cringe or have your stomach lurch when you think back on an embarrassing moment? Well I was CREATING that moment in real time. I could feel it pulsing through me. 

When I regained consciousness, I was finally able to look at my girlfriend’s face, her expression was a mix of laughing at my excruciating embarrassment to do-you-not-get-enough? Felt like ten hours before the clerk was finally done explaining the SMS’s sent to my phone signed me up for stuff and even though I had never agreed to anything there wasn’t anything they could do about it. I’m not unaccustomed to this level of customer service. I would have paid a thousand euros just to have 2 less minutes of that conversation.

Afterwards we went to get an espresso. I was shaking so bad I could barely control that tiny cup. The ironic thing was she wasn’t very mad at all just concerned that my reaction was so poor. I couldn’t help it, the embarrassment juices were flowing through my blood and I thought I was going to keel over. I don’t know what’s worse losing nearly a month’s worth of wage (interns are paid less than minimum wage) or having to live through that.

On the bright side, that was probably the last sliver of privacy I was hiding from my girlfriend of 3 years. It’s kind of freeing.
TL;DR: SMS's sent to my phone signed me up for pornographic services that amounted to 500€, I was informed in front of my girlfriend and the staff of the mobile phone company.

3jvzr0,7,2015-09-06,Creating a mobile game within five months with three interns. Is it possible?,[deleted],gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/3jvzr0/creating_a_mobile_game_within_five_months_with/,"Hey there r/GameDev!

I've got an issue going on and I'm not sure where to ask this, but Reddit's always been helpful so here I am!

I'm a college student at the moment and I'm doing an internship at a local indie game company (which is seriously one of the biggest and most amazing opportunities I've ever had in my life!)

Me and two of my friends at college are going to do an internship at the company. They took in all three of us because we built a prototype survival game for them in Unity. (By making use of a huge ton of free and paid assets). Problem is, though. They expect us to build a ""Complete mobile game that features a rich storyline and fun gameplay mechanics.""

For an intern, this is a huge dream come true! Especially since we're all three passionate gamers and creators. And this would give our portfolio a huge boost! Problem is, though. We don't get much support out of the company. Why you may ask? Because they're way too busy with their own game (which is incredibly bad) and we have to make appointments with people in the office to get some help.

For example, I am the designated programmer because I put everything together. Problem is, though. I can't code. I used stuff like PlayMaker, UFPS and the like to make the prototype working properly without coding all too much. And if I need help I have to make an appointment for a Skype call with some outsourced part of their company in South America. I learn pretty fast but I'm expected to code in C# which to my knowledge is a huge pain in the butt!

Adding to that is that our designers aren't skilled enough to create some great assets or anything along those lines. And they need help, too. Which they can't get because yet again, appointments.

And adding to that AGAIN is that there's no place for us in the building they're situated because the office is too small. So we're expected to work at home or at our college. Which is SUPER inconvenient.

Thoughts? Honestly, given the current situation it feels like this is a task that is doomed to fail. But perhaps you guys could give us some tips?"

I'm an American student dating an English guy. We want to move in together (for as long as possible before one of us makes a more permanent move), but we're having trouble figuring out who should go where. Some of it comes down to preference and then the other but comes down to capability. So, I'm here to get some insight on what to do. Here's some bullet points!

* I wouldn't mind going to university in England. The only problem is the money I would have to pay. Staying here, I get military dependant benefits that greatly subsidise the costs. 

* I would absolutely love to do a study (like AFS Abroad) or internship abroad program. Problems with this would once again be money and the level of autonomy I would have (in the case of study with an educational institution). Obviously living together wouldn't be an option if I had to share a place with a roomate or the institution had rules regarding curfew, etc. 

* Majoring in Marketing and Computer Science (common, I know). Undergrad, obviously. 

* I don't know his full job history, but he's done entrance level positions in places involved with charity and public works. He hasn't been to University. I'm not sure about the rest of his schooling because I don't fully understand the British schooling system. What should I ask him?

* In general, what should I look into, and what should I be concerned about?

My dads a big computer guy and I really wanted to build something fun with him. The last time we build a pc together was 15+ years ago when I thought the blinking lights were monsters after watching ET and wanted it taken out of my room. When I told him I wanted to build a new PC with the money I got from my internship bonus he went out and pick parts to build a [dream machine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-JqrFV4JkPjdE5uYW5VT3JWdmM3R0QwTkhjajdyVEZINW9Z/view?usp=sharing). Now $1950 is pretty much the high end of my budget so I wanted some advice about the parts I picked out. 

* Is DDR4 worth the investment of $200+? I was told it wasn't really utilized baring physic sims, or at least I wouldn't notice any different for what I do. 

* I7 4690K vs I5 4690K is the I7 worth the extra $100?

* Video card, Im kind of getting suckered in by the free copy of MGSV, Im pretty sure I want the Nivida card I saw the other thread about the AMD's r9's being better and cheaper so now im doubting that. Do I want to get a 970 now and wait it out a year or two and SLI 2 970's? Do I want to just go hard for the 980? I have an MSI mobo so I just picked the MSI card, but the guy at Fry's told me that the EVGA card was slightly better. 

* I kind of picked a random case and got a warning about blocked bay drives. Im kind of picky on the color being either white/blue or black/red(orange) any recommendations?  I also think the power supply goal is to power house not my PC. 

* Does mismatching monitors matter in terms of any performance? I have a 24"" LG monitor with an 5-8ms response time and wanted something with a lower response but what to continue to use it as a 2nd monitor. 

* Any deals I should look out for?

3jyey3,0,2015-09-07,My Bowl Of Ramen Might Save Your Startup,lgooding,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/3jyey3/my_bowl_of_ramen_might_save_your_startup/,"**Original Link:** http://blog.trak.io/my-bowl-of-ramen-might-save-your-company/

**TL;DR;** Dried ramen comes with a fork - not chopsticks. Ramen makers know that their product isn't bought by people looking for a gourmet authentic Japanese meal - they're college students and busy people who just want quick carbs. Look at your product: are you lying to yourself about who your customer is?

**Post Text:**

I’m walking out of the supermarket with a dumb grin on my face. I’ve just bought 2 cups of dried Ramen. I’m skipping caña’s &amp; tapas tonight because I’m going to eat these salty €1 noodles and write this blog post about staying frugal.

All week we’ve been speaking with VC’s and investors. A new product launch gets people excited. And true to the Silicon valley cliche, every investor eventually asks us:

*“And how much of a pay rise will the founders take?”*

Easy – we’re going to eat ramen, because we’re frugal founders, and actually reduce our salaries! It’s impressed the hell out of everyone all week.

But 5 minutes ago, excited about penning this blog post, I opened my bowl of ramen.

And found a fork.

And it blew my mind.

I immediately knew this blog post had to be about something else. Something much more important than frugality. Finding that fork summarised the last 8 months of mine and Matt’s education in selling, marketing and building our startup. I knew this fork could have turned our startup around sooner.

Let me tell you how my bowl of ramen, and the fork inside, is going to save your startup:


**Have you ever really looked at a $1 cup of ramen?**

I’m going to assume everyone reading this has an idea of what dried, store-bought ramen is. But I doubt that many people have ever really looked at a cup of ramen, for half an hour, and decided how it made them feel.

I did.

At first, I thought it was a dumb idea, and I thought about throwing this post away. But I kept at it. And after about 15 minutes, weird things started to flow. After 30 minutes, I knew that products really do affect us in more ways than we realise!

When you first look at a product, in this case ramen, you get instant reactions such as:

* Its cheap
* It’s fast food
* It’s efficient

But after half an hour (or longer), you start to peel away at your subconscious, and start uncovering more emotional thoughts and personal feelings.

In particular, the main feeling that stood out to me was one of comfort and convenience. The convenience made me feel relaxed – I don’t need to stress over preparing food, ensuring the kitchen is cleaned and tidied before and after. I don’t even need to stress about making a choice in flavour, because all ramen basically tastes the same (salt).

Have your ever gone to your “storefront”, purchased your product (software, online course, service etc.), consumed the product, and then really just thought about how it makes you feel?

In my opinion, when you can connect to the deeper emotional needs and desires of your customers, you’ll be able to hone in on making sure the product really fits that need.

And in this case, that emotional solution comes from a simple fork.


**Ramen comes with a fork and not chopsticks**

Once I’d written down all of the ways I felt about Ramen, I started to reverse-engineer everything about why it’s so successful (100 Billion units of Ramen were sold last year).

I knew there were lessons here that product managers, marketers and sales people could take into their own company. Particularly if you’re still pre-product-market-fit and in a position where you can make rapid changes about your product and positioning.

There are 3 key lessons in particular that stoodout for me. And if you think I’m crazy and I’ve lost my mind, please bear with me until after these 3 lessons and I hope you’ll see that maybe there’s more to this metaphor than just an eccentric ramen-eating CEO!

**1. Be honest about who your customer is and their needs**

Ramen is a traditional Japanese dish – a dish that for most Japanese restaurants, carries as much national pride as sushi. A culture as proud as Japanese would imply that dried ramen would be sold to be consumed in the traditional sense – slowly, with chopsticks, as a family around the table.

But that’s not who buys dried ramen from the store. Ramen is about investing as little time as possible to get a pile of cheap carbs into your body, so you can forget about eating for a few hours.

Dried ramen is for the lazy. The busy. Students, coders, bachelors. No one craves $1 ramen. No one warmly sits around the family dining table and enjoys a sociable meal of dried ramen.

Ramen comes with a fork so that I can eat it as fast as possible, and get back to my day.

Who’s your customer? You might want them to be the CFO at a fortune 500, but are they actually the part-time office manager for 6 small businesses? Are you lying to yourselves by putting all of your emphasis on enterprise language, account managers and SAP data integrations, when really your customer wants to be spoken to in a friendly and informal way, with a self-service tool that integrates to Xero and Quickbooks?

Having an aspirational target customer can be heathy, but not if it’s at the expense of your customers right now. Sometimes this can be to the extreme of shifting the whole company to focus on just one particular customer type. In Lean Startup terminology, this is known as a “customer zoom in pivot”.

When Justin Kan was trying to gain traction for Justin.tv, his self-titled reality TV show and later, a live streaming service, he just couldn’t unlock the elusive “hockey stick” growth – despite huge media attention and YCombinator backing.

However, he identified one extremely engaged group of users, online gamers, were live streaming their online gaming sessions and getting huge audiences. Justin spun out a side service, Twitch.tv, to focus only on the needs of gamers. Amazon later acquired Twitch.tv for $970m.

**2. Branding &amp; packaging can separate commodities**

Ramen is pretty simple stuff. Dried noodles with some seasoning, served in hot water. Believe it or not, the €1 (1 euro is about $1.10) ramen I bought today wasn’t the cheapest in the store. In fact, it was the most expensive, at 10x the price of the cheapest.

Yes – there were €0.10 ramen noodles in the store. There were maybe 7 different varieties in increasing price, until we got to mine.

I honestly didn’t look at the prices first (people rarely do). But I know don’t think I even think for one second before I picked up my ramen cup.

Because it was in a big awesome bowl, the type I know I can eat from straight away, with awesome big Japanese writing down the front. And sitting right next to it was a can of energy drink.

I already knew the combo deal I’d be buying. I’d already started to subconsciously play out the experience in my head. And none of these inferior noodles, in their plan plastic square packaging, with no proximity to energy drinks, can deliver that same experience.

Because my ramen gives me an efficient, hunger-busting, energy refuelling and fully authentic Japanese experience.

(Side note: the outer picture actually shows the ramen been eaten by chopsticks. As I’ve said earlier, I might fantasize about the authentic romance of twiddling my noodles past my lips with chopsticks, but in reality and if I was being honest with myself, I really just want to shovel the food into my belly as quickly as possible and using the fewest brain cells to oversee the process. So they’ve double nailed this one: allowing me to feel authentic but giving me what I actually want)

The right packaging separated my ramen from it’s much cheaper competition. And the intentional placement of a few of the stores energy drinks on the shelf next to it also convinced me to cross-sell myself a $2 can of caffeine, for a fuller experience.

Where can branding and packaging set your commoditised product apart? If it can turn $0.10 noodles into a $3.10 noodle + drink combo meal, what can it do for your $99 /mo SaaS product? How can it make transform your $400 /mo social media management service into a $1,000 comms. &amp; PR solution?

**3. When things go wrong, add salt**

Ramen tastes like crap. And at some point in your startup or company, whether you like it or not, there will come a time when you do something pretty crappy too.

It might be a really early feature that ships out too buggy. Or you could hugely oversell a new customer, leaving the onboarding team fighting a futile battle with a customer who expected features that simply aren’t there. Or you get out only 3 blog posts that month, missing your target of 10.

There comes a time when you need to know your limits. Accept your limits. Accept that your tiny team of 2 engineers are already overworked. Accept that you just don’t have the feature set of your more expensive competitor. Accept that your single intern marketing employee just isn’t as experienced or skilled a writer as the CEO that she took blogging duties over from.

You need to learn when to just say:

*“OK, the noodles are flavourless. We used dried spices. That beef flavouring never went within 100 miles of a cow. But we added salt.“*

Because salt makes everything taste great! You probably can’t find a food that doesn’t become tastier when you put salt on it.

Adding salt isn’t giving up. It isn’t accepting your have a low quality product. It isn’t about tricking your customers, and it isn’t about under-delivering.

Adding sale is about picking your battles. Knowing how many things you can realistically focus on improving each month, with the budget and headcount available, and remembering that one thing that people really love about your product or company.

What’s the salt in your company?

Second problem, the old PSU had no 6 and/or 8 pin connectors to power the graphics card, so a new one was ordered.

Third problem, the new PSU did not have to right connectors to power the motherboard...

I'm an international student doing my Master's in Computer Science in an US public ivy. This is my very first semester and I just started classes around two weeks back. I see a lot of summer internship positions opening up, and I want to be early in the application queue.

But my question is, I don't have a GPA yet, seeing as I've just started my Master's. Is this an issue? I'm confident about applying though - I have work experience, open source contributions, and a bunch of my own open source projects as well. Will the lack of GPA be a factor? Should I wait until my first semester ends, get a GPA going, and then apply? That would be sometime in January, I guess.

I am a senior CS major, pretty much right at a 3.0 GPA, graduating in May and looking to move out of Missouri. I have been interning with a large software company based out of KC (yeah, that one) at their location in Columbia, MO. The internship runs year round and we start talks of transitioning to full time positions starting in KC this week or next.

I feel torn. On one hand, transitioning to full time with this company and working in KC would be a great place to start my career and get some experience, but I want to move out of Missouri. I would be elated to have a position in Denver or Seattle. I have been applying casually the last few weeks and have heard back from a few, but all have been no.

The company is likely to make me an offer sometime this month and I'd have to take it before it expires (probably November timeline). 

So my questions:

* What would the best approach be? Keep applying and hope I get an offer from another company before I get one from my current employer?
* Would I be dumb to not stay with this company for at least a little while? My start date would backdate 2 years, giving me tuition reimbursement starting as soon as I begin work.
* Should I be worried if I haven't had a positive response from the ~10 employers I've sent resumes to? There is a job fair coming up at my school in a few weeks which I hope will be helpful. 
* Is there a place I can submit my resume to for review? I have ran it through our campus engineering career center and followed guides on here. I think it's good, but I would like a software recruiter to tell me honestly.

Thanks for the help. This subreddit has been a great asset!

The main reason is that I am going to start developing for the company I work for. I am a 3rd year college student and I am on my internship right now, and they offered me a part-time job for when school starts. Right now I am QA but the head of dev. asked me what my goals are and offered to allow me to get some coding experience. I really want to do this and learn as much as possible. 

This is not required but a resource about how C# compares with Java would be great. Also anything else would be great to, I am willing to purchase books if they cant be found for free online, so include those too!

Can I land a entry-level job as a developer with my degree?,TARS1986,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3k1pvi/senior_mis_student_wanting_to_focus_on_being/,"Hi all,

I am entering my senior year as an MIS major. I just interned this past summer at one of the largest banks in the world as a business systems analyst, and it really gave me a taste of what I don't want to do. I only recently picked up the MIS degree track (Fall '14) because I was transitioning from the military and MIS drew me in due to its focus on both business (practical and safe) and technology (what I really like). 

Anyway, like I said, this summer I got a taste of the life of a systems analyst working on a PM team. I really did not like it. I had this idea going into it because I had taken a business analyst course in my MIS-track in the Spring that basically was a segue into my summer internship. It was far too much business, and the only technology I got to utilize were severely bloated internal company systems and Excel spreadsheets. 

However, I've been chipping away at Code Academy studying Python and PhP because it has piqued my interest a lot. I find the challenge both exciting and rewarding. To add to it, I am in one of my final courses in the MIS track this semester which focuses heavily on PhP and MySQL. I feel like I've finally found something that is really interesting and not focused on project management and ""this is how you will fast-track to CIO"" kind of classes. 

So, I believe I would like to find an entry-level job that isn't a BSA or PM role but rather a developer or something along those lines. I know this is a stretch for an MIS major, but what can I do to bolster my chances of a company taking a chance on someone who is currently self-teaching and eager to learn/be challenged?

Thanks all in advance! "

That was a few years ago – I was year and a half out of college with a dead end internship and no job prospects despite a damn good academic run in college run. There was a breakup too, of course. Somehow, I changed things for the better, or at least was able to make them better in the short-term. I started studying for the GMAT. I went to grad school the following summer. I earned a Masters degree in a one-year program... 

Yet, here I am again festering in the stale air of unemployment and ennui.

I feel like I'm back in that car on that bitterly cold Thanksgiving Eve with a homemade suicide kit. It doesn't matter if sitting in a crowded park in the middle of my city or sitting in around a table with friends, I feel like I'm back in the car and everything is starting to unravel again. I feel that inferiority to my friends who are excelling in their careers. I feel my hopes decaying a little more everyday as my resume becomes less appealing to employers.

About 2 years ago I graduated from college with a degree in Biology. I took up a position in a Biology lab as a research assistant, hoping to gain some more valuable experience before heading off to graduate school. However, I realized that a research career in Biology simply was not for me. Over the course of this painful realization, a friend introduced me to Computer Science. I've taken a great liking to it. So much so that I'm pursuing a second Bachelor's in it. I know that you can be self taught in that field, but if I'm being honest I simply am not the best self-teacher in the world. I'm not bad, but I know myself and I know I can't teach myself better than the college I'm attending would. 

With that being said, I'm getting worried. I still work full time as a research assistant. I cannot afford to quit my job. So I'm doing school while working full time. This leaves me with very little (if any) time to work on an ambitious personal project. From what I gather, an ambitious personal project is needed in order to obtain an internship, which is in turn required to land a job in the field. Would it somehow be possible to obtain an internship even with only class projects as experience? Actually that's a bit of a lie. I do have a few ""personal projects"". Mostly from when I was teaching myself how to code before deciding to pursue a second Bachelor's. I have some answers to project euler (not many though), codingbat, and my solutions to a few of the problem sets given by the MIT opencourseware introductory CS class. However none of that stuff is really impressive at all, so I feel like I shouldn't even bother listing it as a personal project. 

And when applying for internships should I mention my current job at all? I do work with other people consistently, and I think having had a stable job might showcase that I have some soft skills that would be useful for any workplace.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

University B is the same price with a top 15 program. I've heard great things from a few friends that go there about their CS program.

Question 1: is it viewed negatively by employers if I transfer?

Somewhat related, I had one professor here last semester that failed the large majority of her class, then got fired for doing so. Unfortunately I had to retake the class and my GPA sunk quite low (2.6). I'm planning on applying to a lot of internships for this summer. Should I wait until after I finish the course (December) and my grade is replaced? It will then be above a 3.0 which is what companies that require GPA's look for. 

Question 2: when do I apply for internships, and do I include my GPA if I apply now?

My problem is that I don't want to teach any more. In my last internship, I had a pretty terrible thing happen. I'm sure you can find it if you want to creep through my post history, but it's a long story and I don't want to post it here. In any case, I need a break from teaching, and I need a job that will help get me out of debt.

Honestly I would be 10x happier working a retail position than a teaching position, because all I want is a job that stays at work (aka, I don't have to work 9-10 hours at school and then bring home 3 hours of grading).

Unfortunately, I have 0 retail experience. My current resume includes:

1.  A customer service position at a local ten-day fair I held for three summers (ushering)

2. A customer service position I held at an insurance company for the next three consecutive summers as a student (technically I was a ""summer student"")

3. My most recent teaching internship, that was 13 weeks at a high school student teaching, and

4. My most recent job experience, when I filled in for a kindergarten teacher who got fired at the end of the year. I list it as ""educational assistant"" (long story, but I never really got the chance to fully teach and was considered more an assistant because I don't have a kindergarten background). I held the job less than two months because I was just filling in for this teacher, then I moved across the country.

The question is: if you were me, how would you spin this experience into a resume that will get me a retail position? Should I take off my teaching experience and only leave customer service positions? Should I take off my degrees altogether? I've applied for about 20 jobs with this resume and it clearly isn't working out."

3k572r,1,2015-09-08,HDMI to DVI-D problems with HP L2045w Monitor (Windows 10),tpow28,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3k572r/hdmi_to_dvid_problems_with_hp_l2045w_monitor/,"Over the summer I had an internship at an office that upgraded all of their monitors so I was able to take two of the older model for use at school. The model of both of the monitors is HP L2045w. I am trying to use them with my laptop, which is a Dell XPS L702X.

The monitors each have a DVI-D and a VGA connection. I am trying to use the DVI connection on each of them to avoid any issues with HDCP and for the simplicity of not having to convert to analog. The laptop has a mini display port and an HDMI port.

Either monitor works with this mini display port to DVI-D cable (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJCB83O?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00), and neither monitor works with either of these two HDMI to DVI-D cables that I have tried (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K7HECTQ?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00 or http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L3KNZZ8?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00).

The computer can obviously handle multiple displays, because it is working with the mini display port cable. I previoulsy checked to make sure it should be able to drive both monitors and its own display all at once and it should, but that should be besides the point since it isn't working even when only one monitor is connected via HDMI to DVI-D. These cables (HDMI to DVI-D) work with a projector I have that also has a DVI-D port and no HDMI input (the projector model is Epson EMP-810UG). It doesn't seem that the monitors are broken, because they are behaving consistently and it seems unlikely that they are both broken identically and the same port on the monitor works when connected to a different port on the computer.

The monitors do seem to respond when the cable is connected, but they display a ""NO INPUT SIGNAL"" message followed quickly by a ""MONITOR GOING TO SLEEP"" message then they become unresponsive until they are powered off and back on again.

I have tried everything I can think of to figure out why this is not working and I have not been able to find a solution. I cannot identify an exact component that is malfunctioning, and I have multiples of every component except the laptop and everything is behaving consistently so it doesn't seem like any one part is broken.

Thank you for any insight you can provide and sorry for such a long winded explanation; this issue has become increasingly frustrating over the past several weeks.

TL;DR:
Two HP L2045w monitors working with mini displayport to DVI-D cable, but not working with HDMI to DVI-D cables from Dell XPS L702X Laptop running Windows 10.
Multiple (identical) monitors and cables have been tested with consistent results and the ports on the laptop work properly with the same cables connected to other devices."

1) Harder to network / meet up with people that can lead to opportunities
2) Harder to find internships (can't do the coop program (MECOP?))

3k5gvs,6,2015-09-08,4 friends want to move to Denmark within 1-2 years from now. We need a few answers please!,Tsuchimiru,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/3k5gvs/4_friends_want_to_move_to_denmark_within_12_years/,"Hello, good morning/afternoon/evening dear reader/s!

We are 4 guys who want to move to Denmark from Portugal and I myself have looked for a lot of information and have checked out as many details for it as I could.

**Character details:** 

* Me - I'm 21 years old male with a professional degree in Public Relations (Level 4), I also have a high school diploma. I have been unemployed ever since I graduated and I don't have internship but I will most likely get some job experience during this year.

* Friend 1 - 21 years old male with a professional degree in bar-tending (Level 4) and has high school diploma. Has job experience of around 2 years as bartender and bar assistant.

* Friend 2 - 21 years old male with a professional degree in kitchen assistance (Level 4) and has high school diploma. Has job experience of around 2 years as kitchen assistance/cook.

* Friend 3 - 19 years old is finishing high school to obtain diploma and intends to study abroad to Denmark upon obtaining it (next year most likely). Has 4 years of experience in caffè service/table service from family caffè and other caffès in the heart of our city Tavira.

**Situation:** Me and the 19 year old held the plan for a while about going to Denmark and try to establish ourselves there a bit with the biggest intention to study and work, the other two want to tag along because they want to work outside of Portugal. We checked our EU/EEA privileges and are aware that we may reside and work there without much fuss since Portugal still is member of the union, however a lot of the information I found was mostly about US citizens trying to reach out to Denmark and such so my information does not entirely apply to us.

**The questions:** 

* 1 - For a fellow European citizen we are aware that we can become citizens after obtaining work (however according to the new possible upcoming law changes it won't be that easy), however **HOW DIFFICULT** could it be for any/all of us? If you can answer this please try to answer in detail for each person or at least in a general stroke. (thanks in advance &lt;3 )

* 2 - Is this extremely risky or alright to do (moving abroad) knowing that we might have some money saved? (we most likely will have around 6,000€ minimum to bring, but I believe by the time we move we'll have around 12,000€ or more all together)

* 3 - In case any of the 21 year old individuals decides to study for a bachelor of some kind (like myself, I wish to study animation), do you believe it is possible to do so here in Denmark? Or should it be done in our home country? After possibly having obtained work? (only the 19 year old will have family support from overseas)

**Optional information -** We all speak and write english in a very fluent level (A1-A2). We're long term friends who just want a higher quality of life (and some nice health care) for ourselves to enjoy, me and the 19 year old so far have the ambition of getting a bachelor degree in our favored areas while the other two just want to work and enjoy their stay as much as possible. The reason as to why we wish to study abroad is due to the quality of learning and greater reward from being taught in Denmark as most teachers in Portugal (or at least from all the stories we heard and have experienced, sorry to say) are not that much interested in higher ambition or at least have more interest in making the students spread the wings wide enough for them to develop further and maybe even contribute in a very positive light their to industry. I also wish to transition in Denmark because racism over transgenders in Portugal is still quite present and easily experienced in any area that isn't Lisbon and my ex told me while we dated that trans people have it alright over in Denmark and it most likely wouldn't hinder or hurt them psychologically in a possibly extensive level."

I felt like I was on the shortlist to feeling like I'm 1 of 10.

Basically, I'm an engineer and I've done a lot of internships, different ones too. Unfortunately the market here is under a little bit of a recession and entry level jobs are hard to come by.

So I was very nervous for my interview but I did very well but the last bit about my competition made me feel uneasy. I have a meeting with a teacher tomorrow for a potential partnership for a MSc in engineering starting Winter 2016 but I did not bring it up in the interview because I was only meeting my teacher the following day.

I want to write a thank you letter and sneak in that I will also be continuing my studies part time so my skills and knowledge will increase but I don't know if it's proper etiquette to just throw in new information in a thank you letter.

Furthermore, I have no idea if employers see a part time Masters as a burden for someone that is entering the company(vs someone who has a proven track record within the company).

I really want the job and I want to sell myself but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot either. What should I do?"

3k6h9f,1,2015-09-08,Prospective CS Major looking at top schools,commentlessCoder,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/3k6h9f/prospective_cs_major_looking_at_top_schools/,"Thanks for looking at my post.

I know that my stats are good and that there isn't much to do there, but I am interested in seeing how my whole package looks to people who have gone through the process before.

So to get right into it, I'm a white upper middle class kid from an urban town just north of Boston. I come from a pretty large public high school - not great but it provides me with what I need - which sends a couple of kids every year to top schools, and most to small LAC's in the northeast or the MA heavy hitters [read: UMass schools]. I'm not quite sure about any hook; my dad never went to college and now works at a large internet company in Cambridge, my mom finished her undergrad after a big break and is now a stay at home mom, so I'm thinking that qualifies to some extent.

I'm absolutely majoring in CS in school, and I'm considering doubling up with Math or CE. This has been the real root of my college search process.

In terms of qualitative stuff:

* SAT: 2360 (M:800/CR:800/WR:760)
* Math II SAT - 800
* Physics SAT - 740
* US History SAT - 730 
* Class Rank: Messed up right now, but I'm definitely top 10, probably top 3.
* UW/W GPA: 3.84/4.64


Classes:

* 3 Years of FL
* Mostly AP classes and community college classes
* Computer networking, Computer Hardware, Linear Algebra, and Calculus 3 at community college
* Super strong CS program at my school; classes from Visual Basic intro past APCS and into Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms, which I helped to pioneer this year

Current Schedule:

- AP Physics C: Mech

- AP Physics C: E&amp;M

- AP Stats

- AP Seminar

- AP World

- School Newspaper (Online Manager and manager of technology)

- Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms

AP Scores:

- US History: 5 (Sophomore)

- AP Lang: 5 (Sophomore)

- AP Calc BC &amp; AB subscore: 5 (Junior)

- AP CS: 5 (Junior)

- AP Physics 1: 5 (Junior)

- AP Physics 2: 4 (Junior - self study)

- AP US Gov: 4 (Junior)

- AP Lit: 4 (Junior)

Awards:

- National AP Scholar Junior year

- Dartmouth Alumni Book Club Award

- National Merit Commendation

- 6th Place in MA for group discussion (Speech and Debate)

- 2nd place in alliance component of New England Botball competition

Extracurriculars:

- Robotics Team (Captain): I am the lead programmer for the team, and I help to plan the robots and coordinate all of the work during the season

- Computer Club (Co-founder and President): We work a lot on community outreach for CS, and we attempt to bring people in who otherwise wouldn't be interested through interactive activities such as Hour of Code or Build a Computer Day. We also help the IT department in our city with deploying computers, and most recently, with preparing all of the chromebooks we received through our 1:1 initiative grant for the high school students. I also used the club to help pilot material for the CS classes my teacher was planning, and together we developed our Algs and DS course.

- Speech and Debate (Captain): My least involved activity; due to low interest, we only really go to competitions and have a few practice meetings before them. However, as president, I am responsible for planning these meetings and their content.

- Research Internship at Northeastern University: I was one of 28 people who participated in the Young Scholars Program this summer. I worked with my partner in one of the CS labs at Northeastern, and I focused on developing a machine learning program that could develop blackjack playing strategies, and then use those strategies to maximize its winnings.

Schools, by my interest:

1. MIT - EA
2. CMU SCS - RD
3. Stanford - RD
4. Caltech - EA
4. Northeastern - EA
6. UC Berkeley - EA
7. UMass Amherst - EA

Again thanks for reading and commenting.

I did just have few questions aside from the ones I interspersed in the body of my post.

First of all, do you think that it is worth it to apply ED to a school if you are in a precarious financial situation? My parents don't plan on giving me anything for school, yet I will not qualify for full financial aid due to their combined income.

Also, Do you think that I should include more safety schools even though I am quite happy with what I have now?"

I have no internships and while I would gladly take one at this point it seems they all want current students.

1. I am currently enrolled in Physics 1, as there is a prerequisite for any other physics class and I want to be well-rounded. Unfortunately, with my current teacher, I am less than confident in my ability to get above a C. Contrastly, I know for a fact I can get an A if I was to switch to Calculus. I want to do this soon but I've heard from some people that it would be beneficial to stick with physics for the sake of looking well-rounded. I know for a fact that everything I want to study in College does not rely on Physics (Looking towards Economics and Political Science majors) so in this case, what do you recommend? Being well-rounded or having a higher grade?

2. With my current stats, could you perhaps name some good match schools which would be affordable? I can't get merit-based aid and am still looking for scholarships, so I would definitely like the names of any places of which I have a reasonable chance of getting in which don't cost more than $45k a year. One thing worth noting, due to some family stigmatization (rooted in some rather troubled cousins of mine) there's a significant chance I'd be better off just not going to college than going to community/junior college, lest I wanna be left out of the will.

* My GPA is 2.33 UW and 2.5 W. I'm soon gonna be tested for ADD but even if that shows positive and I get medicated I don't rely on that as a crutch for college admissions. I do however look forward to a much better senior year GPA, both due to potential medication and a much more engaging courseload for myself this year (I was peer pressured into taking some really unfitting classes)
* 2160 SAT, took it a total of one time and do not intend to take it again lest I look like I focus too much on SAT with negligible gain in score.
* 4 on APUSH, 3 on AP Biology, 3 on AP Computer Science
* Extracurriculars involve internships at both City Hall and State House as well as with smaller government-involved organizations since 9th grade. Also music but who cares?"

A little background about myself - I graduated my undergrad degree in 2013 with a major in economics and finance. Immediately afterwards I completed a Masters degree in economics graduating in April 2014.

Fresh out of school, I took a job as a lease analyst at a major Real estate firm. I quickly realized that this was not what I wanted to do and that it had absolutely nothing to do with finance or economics. I knew it wasn't going to help me get anywhere.

Quit in Feb. 2015 and spent a few months studying for CFA Level 1. Failed (Band 10) like a fucking idiot. 

At the end of June I took an unpaid internship at a hedge fund as an associate where I do 30% analytical work and 70% on the operation side. Today is actually my last day.

I have accepted another position starting tomorrow again as an unpaid intern but this time at a Private Equity search fund. Mostly sourcing out deals and doing research on prospective companies. I don't believe it is going to be much analytical work to be honest. As well, it's only for 4 months.

Am I making the right decision by taking this next internship? My goal is to be a buy-side equity analyst and I know this coming experience doesn't directly relate to that. That being said, I know that role isn't exactly an entry level position and that I'm going to have to grind it out for a few years before I get what I want. 

I'm struggling right now and don't know whether starting at this place tomorrow is a good idea. Am I better off spending the next 2.5 months studying for the CFA and writing in December? I'll be doing that anyways, but I really don't want to fail again. I also have a few potential things in the works at some Investment banks but these are mostly just a function of networking and people telling me I'm first on the list when there is a job opening. I don't want to be a putz to these PE guys and end up leaving after a month. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions regarding my situation as I would really appreciate some insight. "

What I decided upon learning myself is:

* A buttload of HTML (there's more than just markup tags)
* A good chunk of CSS (I can style a website without googling)
* But my pride and joy is that I taught myself a hell of a lot of PHP in a year, and I am now up to the point where I could make an OOP site (MVC) without googling or tutorials. 

So all cool. I am capable of making a very functional, secure, effective and generally rather good CMS. I can make almost every basic web thing I could ever want to make. I am far ahead of most of my classmates. 

But what do I do with this knowledge while still in school? Until internships are a thing for me, full time employment isn't a thing. I just have a few spare hours occasionally. What can I do to make something useful, and preferably something I can sell?

This statement may seem contradictory, considering those narratives we label as myths and legends are widely supposed to be fictitious, having little to no basis in reality. When you’ve seen what I’ve seen however, you find yourself believing that not all those whispered stories between school mates, or those tales told around the camp fire are untruths. Go ahead and scoff at this notion, many of you will, but one day you too might observe something that challenges your very notion of reality. 



It all started with a former boss named Gabe. We worked at a law firm together; he was a hotshot lawyer, and I was one of the lowly paralegals. Despite the fact that Gabe was higher up the corporate ladder, I worked directly with him on a number of occasions, and so got to know him pretty well. Gabe was a workaholic, and at times he could be a hard-ass. He certainly wasn’t one for gossip or bullshit, being about as straight-laced and uptight as they come. 



Our firm was located in the Northeastern United States, nestled in a community that was steeped in traditions and lore leftover from the Native American inhabitants of centuries past. Many of the local children grew up on stories of Thunderbirds, or Skinwalkers, and while the community as a whole wasn’t overly superstitious, there was a certain amount of respect and reverence paid to these legends.
It happened one day that a few coworkers and I were shooting the breeze around the water cooler. To try and creep each other out we took turns recounting local urban legends we had heard. It was my coworker Dave who brought up the Snowy Owl. Being a native of the area, I was vaguely familiar with the story, but as Dave recounted the tale, I made note of a few details of the legend that I had been previously lacking.



Per Dave the legend is as follows: 



A long time ago three brothers were out hunting in the woods. It was the middle of winter and the trio had been camped in the forest for several days. Food was scarce, and the brothers were desperate to bring a meal back to their family. On the fourth day it was decided that the three would split up in order to increase their chances of finding a deer or rabbit, or some other source of meat. They agreed to meet back up at their campsite at dusk, and each of the three men headed off in a different direction. At dusk the three met back up, and shared their findings. The two eldest brothers had managed to catch a couple of squirrels, but the youngest brother had come up empty handed. When questioned about his lack of success the brother replied, rather defensively, that he had spotted a Snowy Owl resting in a tree, and that he had managed to wound the bird. Unfortunately, before he could let fly another arrow the owl flew off. The next morning the youngest brother was determined to make up for his failure the previous day, and so set out with a renewed determination. The brothers’ plan was the same as the day before, with the three splitting up and then reconvening at dusk. 



In late afternoon a scream rent the relative silence of the forest, startling both the eldest and second eldest brothers. The men, who were each in a separate area of the woods, ran in the direction of the scream’s source, bursting into a small clearing at roughly the same time. Upon reaching the open space, they saw to their horror the crumpled body of their little brother. The youngest brother’s neck was splayed at an unnatural angle, while blood pooled behind his head. The large branch half splayed on top of his legs seemed to indicate that the young man had fallen from the tree, which stood just to the right of him. Approaching the body, the men noticed a single white speckled feather, slightly bloodied, just beside their brother’s head. Sadness and despair quickly turned into anger, as the brothers realized that in pursuing the damned bird from the day before, their brother had met with his untimely demise. Thirsty for revenge on the white demon which had led, if indirectly, to their brother’s death, the two men decided they would finish the quest their brother had set out on. 



The next day was spent tracking the owl. It took till late afternoon to find the bird’s nest – a slight indentation in the ground, littered with white feathers and speckled with blood. There they waited, patiently brooding, seething, and eager to fulfill their bloodlust. Dusk came and went, but still they waited, crouched in the dark, the only source of light coming from the waning Gibbous Moon. Finally, a slight whooshing could be heard, stirring up the silent darkness. The snow white form of the owl materialized, and alit on the ground. One brother struck, swinging a large branch at the bird; the limb hit the creature with a resounding “thwack”, sending it sprawling a few feet away. Dazed, the owl tried to get its bearing, tried to take flight and flee, but it moved too slowly, for the second brother fell upon it with his hunting knife. In one slashing arc of the blade, the owl’s neck was cut and its life extinguished. 



The victory was short lived, for the brothers realized that while they would be bringing back some source of nourishment for their family, they would be leaving their little brother behind. As soon as the sun arose, the men began to make their way out of the thick woods. The journey became more arduous, as a thick snow started to fall. Soon the two were trapped within a world of white, unable to see more than a few feet in front of them. Deciding it best to make camp for the evening, the two huddled together under a blanket of thick skins. The snow had waned to just a few flurries by the time the last few rays of light disappeared over the horizon. A fire provided a little comfort for the travel wearied men, and soon the two were lulled into a light doze. What seemed like only moments later, a loud rustling of tree branches jerked them from their slumber. The air was deathly still, almost as if the forest were afraid to breath, but then the woods began to fill with a cacophony of sounds. The groaning of branches, the crunching of leaves, and a whishing sound grew increasingly louder, increasingly closer. The brothers, now fully awake, clutched at each other, their terror growing with every beat of their heart. The sounds coalesced into one loud racket, a mighty roar, which had the men scrambling to cover their ears. Then, all at once the noises stopped; just as fast as the climax of sound had come, so to its denouement came. The only sound that filled the clearing then was the harsh breaths of the brothers, marked by little puffs of steam in the cold night’s air. 



Gathering what little courage he had left, the eldest brother yanked a burning branch from the fire, and brandished it as if it could ward off all the evils of the world. Turning slowly in a circle, the brother sought to pierce the darkness with what little light he had, tried to peer into every shadow to give the source of their disturbance a face. Holding his breath, the brother strained to see something, anything. Then he noticed it - the complete lack of sound. No night creatures, no rustling leaves, no creaking branches, but most shockingly no harsh breathing. Whipping around to where he left his brother, the man was nearly brought to his knees by the sight that met him. His brother, who just moments before had been clinging to him, lay slumped over on his side. His eyes wide and unblinking reflected the firelight, but no warmth remained in them, nor as it happened in the rest of his body. Dead. His brother was dead. And upon the brother’s unmoving upturned palm lay a single white speckled bloodied feather. Terror the likes he had never know overcame the last surviving member of the trio, and so he ran. And ran. And ran. 



According to the local lore the brother finally made it home the second morning after he had fled the forest. His feet were rubbed raw from the non-stop return journey, and the man could do little more than mumble incoherently. Eventually his family was able to extract the story from him, and it soon spread to the rest of the village, for it began to be told and retold by locals. Not two months later, the eldest brother succumbed to some unknown aliment. His death too was said to be tied to some unnatural force, for it is said he claimed to have spotted the snowy owl once again the day before his passing. Henceforth the Snowy Owl became known as an omen of death. Those that do not seek it, but rather encounter it unexpectedly are doomed to die within 24 hours.



By the time Dave finished his recounting of the legend, I had chills up and down my arms. Gabe on the other hand wasn’t impressed. Having eavesdropped on the conversation, he had no qualms adding his two cents. “If you think that that fluffy white bird from Harry Potter is the harbinger of death, you have a screw loose,” he scoffed. Effectively succeeding in ruining the revelry with his condescending attitude, Gabe strode off, and the group of coworkers disbanded, more than a few of us mumbling some not so kind words in the lawyer’s direction. 



I went about work the rest of the day, giving no thought to the snowy owl legend. However, the next day it was made clear that the story had stuck more soundly with Gabe. That morning I entered the break room to find a pale Gabe sitting at a table, nursing a cup of coffee. There were bags under his eyes, and he had a distant look in his eyes. Being the decent human being that I am, I inquired to see if anything was the matter. 



“It was that damned bird, it kept me up all last night,” was his answer. Curious, I asked what he was talking about. He described his night saying, “I was woken up last night around 3 a.m., to a light tapping on my window. I thought it was a branch blowing in the wind at first, but the damned noise didn’t stop. It was just a constant TAP – TAP – TAP – TAP. I looked out the window, and there was an owl of all things, pecking at the glass. The stupid bird probably confused its reflection for another bird. And then, if that wasn’t bad, some idiot driver nearly ran me over as I was crossing the street near my house; I had to dive out of the way to avoid being squished.” I grimaced in empathy, and then thought of something that might make him chuckle. “Maybe that owl was the omen of your impending demise, just like that legend says,” I joked. He didn’t laugh, just gave me a scowl. 



Gabe’s day didn’t get any better, as each time I saw him, he looked more and more haggard. The last time I spoke with him was just after lunch, when I went to drop off some paperwork in his office. As soon as I entered, Gabe grabbed my arm and dragged me into the room, closing his office door. “I think someone is trying to kill me!” He all but yelled in my face. His eyes were large and bloodshot, his hair disheveled from countless mussing; his whole countenance read paranoid. 



“What are you talking about?” I enquired. He recounted his day after our talk that morning. Apparently, in addition to that near hit and run, he had had several other near death experiences. That day he had tripped over a nail that was sticking up and had fallen down the stairs, nearly breaking his neck in the process. He had also gotten off the elevator just before it malfunctioned and fell twenty stories, and had discovered a small gas leak just before lighting the cigarette he was sneaking in his office. 



“I think you were right, that owl was an omen,” he said, looking genuinely terrified. Now, Gabe wasn’t the nicest guy in the world, he worked his interns to the bone, and rarely had anything nice to say about anyone, but I really was starting to feel bad for the guy. Clearly he had been putting in too much time at work, and had finally reached a breaking point. That or he was having some sort of midlife crisis. “Gabe,” I said calmly, “I’m sure those things were all just coincidences. You’re just having a bad day. Maybe you should take the rest of the day off.” 


He didn’t look all that convinced in the face of my reassurances, but he eventually nodded in agreement. “Maybe you’re right,” he said, “I think I’ll head out just as soon as I finish this last letter for my client.” Thinking that was the end of things, I made an excuse and left, closing the door to his office behind me. 


About an hour later, I was startled from my work by a distant crash, followed shortly by a collective of screams. Rushing with a few coworkers to the source of the commotion, we reached the end of the hallway to see that someone had opened Gabe’s office door. His window, which looked out over the busy streets twenty-two stories below, was smashed. The glass debris littering the small stone ledge just outside the window, seemed to indicate that it had been smashed from the inside. A few of my coworkers were positioned at the window, and were staring in disbelief at the street below. As I made my way over to the window, I had a sinking feeling I knew what sight would greet me. All those stories below, on the now red concrete of the sidewalk lay a sprawled and lifeless Gabe. The newspapers over the next few days would rule Gabe’s death as a suicide, but all remarked how odd one piece of evidence from the scene was; a soft, downy white feather clutched in Gabe’s right hand. 



For some reason, I was put in charge of cleaning out Gabe’s office. As I was packing away the personal items from his desk, I came across a well-used note pad. Upon seeing the writing on the pad, my heart leapt into my throat. Over and over were hastily written these words: “The only real myth we tell is when we tell ourselves that we are safe”. 



I’m afraid that the Snowy Owl legend is true. I’m afraid to look out my window.

3kb4p1,3,2015-09-09,Picking up some C++,excursionist,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3kb4p1/picking_up_some_c/,"I managed to get a recruiter for a tech org to critique my resume for the purposes of getting internships. He said my academics/GPA (3.8), skills like solidworks/matlab, and past internships were good, but he recommended getting some kind of project going. He also said it wouldn't hurt to be able to put C++ proficiency on my resume (I'm an ME, but even so I can see it's good for anyone to know a little programming).

So -- any suggestions on a good way to learn enough to be able to honestly put it on my resume? At this point in the year I can't take it as a class at my school. Would it be worth doing an online course somewhere that gives you a certificate if you pay? I'm got a pretty full workload this semester, so anything that will make it simpler will be good.

3kb56o,7,2015-09-09,Been in IT 12 years - debating a move,x-Mowens-x,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3kb56o/been_in_it_12_years_debating_a_move/,"So here is the deal.

I started in IT while I was in college as an intern. I moved from the internship to a half billion dollar company and learned a lot of technologies, stayed there for 2 years then went to consult. I consulted for 2 years, then grew tired of traveling and found a job at a very large bank. 

Stayed at that bank for 5 or so years until I got poached by an old boss to go to a smaller regional bank.

My specializations are Windows Server OS, Virtualization, (namely Citrix and hyper-v) and SCCM. 

My problem - I am bored to tears.

I have been for years, but there has been a recent corporate directive to disallow Monday-Friday Work from home ability.

I am good at my job, and I am smart. When I started this job, the workload was mostly 80+ hour weeks. After about a year of that I finally got everything to a point where I had everything automated. 

I can get my entire job done in about 30 minutes,  run a few scripts and I am good.

I am level 4 support, I have trained and documented all of my service offerings very well and rarely get tickets escalated to me anymore. But when they are, I solve them relitively quickly. 

We are upgrading our SCCM infrastructure and that is actually pretty easy. 

My problem - 

Now that I am forced to go into the office all the time I realize that if I have to go in to the office to ""pretend"" to work I might go crazy. That is a fact. I am not against working hard. As a matter of fact, I prefer it. I loved the 80 hour weeks, always something to work on, and the time went by super fast. 

But the longer I am in a job, the easier it gets. The easier it gets, the more bored I become.

When I complain to my boss, I get absolute shit work.

I now own the rightfax environment for our bank. I LOVE learning and playing with new technology. I excel at troubleshooting, and I enjoy it. But once you fix the initial issues at a place, they don't come back and you find yourself inventing things to do you make your life even easier.


Today, I figured out how to add a context menu to 800 servers while right clicking on a .log file. It worked in dev, and I will implement it next week.
I am running out of ways to improve our environments and I am simply bored.

What should I do?
Should I find a job that is work from home only
Should I try to go into management?


I even considered quitting all together and taking up something like plumbing. 
One of the problems (not complaining at all) is that I make a lot of money - I can't think of a career I could switch to that would be able to support my lifestyle... which I do enjoy. How can I transfer into something that pays the same or more?

I also feel like even though my pay scale has gone up, I have had the same job the entire time I have been in IT. I want something new. I don't think there is anything I can do to move up to the next level. Considering I am 32, that is concerning. Is this the job I am going to retire from?

This is in no way a complaint - when IT gets tough I absolutely love it. It just rarely is anymore. "

Tips on finding postings for cities I don't live in?",accountforcsquestion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3kbg3u/a_few_questions_1_what_are_the_mustincludes_for/,"I'm going into my FINAL year of Computer Engineering undergrad right now. Classes haven't started yet but I'm already making my *""job application spreadsheet""* for this year. 

My plan is to apply to at least 10 jobs per week this year, because I **DESPERATELY** want something lined up ASAP for when I graduate... and another reason I'm starting this early is because I have NO professional experience with internships or anything like that so I feel like I need to get out of the gate right away. 


There are just a few questions I have before fully committing on my applications:

---

**QUESTION 1**

I'm just a little hesitant on sending in my applications right away because I want them to be as good as possible. 

What are things that are *""must-haves""* with applications these days?

(i.e. GitHub? LinkedIn? A blog? Twitter? A personal website? etc.) 

There are so many gizmos out there now that you can use I just want to know which ones I should be including in my job applications.

---

**QUESTION 2**

if I do get something like GitHub, what do I include on it? I wouldn't say CS is something I spend my free time on... so I don't really have any non school-related coding stuff (is that bad? :( )


and I feel like that's a little.... too ""juvenile"" to include in a GitHub account... like... *""Oh here's an algorithm!"" ""Oh look here's a linked list I coded for class!"" ""Look at my ugly HTML website I did for an assignment""* like do they actually want that stuff? 

It comes to a point where I'm worried that I would be HURTING my chances with a GitHub instead of helping them... like won't the employers look at my mediocre-at-best basic algorithm and be like: *""Oh that person is BAD! Let's not hire them!""* ...at least that's what I'm worried about... because to be honest I've never been *that* good at coding compared to my classmates... of course I've put the work in to bring myself up to their level (hopefully) but I'm still no coding whiz by any sense of the term.  

---

**QUESTION 3:**

One of the main things I'm looking at for my job is LOCATION. I've lived in the same spot my entire life and really want to go somewhere far away and new. 

The obvious issues with that are...

1. I feel like if I apply to the more ""intriguing"" western states like California (LA, San Francisco, etc.), Washington (Seattle), Colorado (great weather and scenery), etc. that's where EVERYONE is going to be looking so my chances feel slimmer. 

2. I don't live there so HOW am I going to find out what companies are hiring aside from using.... generic job search websites that, again, EVERYONE uses.


What I'm trying to say is that I want to apply to positions far away from me (I'm on the east coast), but to do that I first need to FIND those postings... you know what I mean?


Any tips?

--- 

Thank you for putting up with my questions... hopefully they're not things that have been asked 500 times but I didn't see them in the FAQ.

I've done a software engineering internship this past summer, and although it was a cool experience, the work that I did is not something I'm totally interested in or see myself pursuing. I want to work on theory (although I'm not sure how deep I want to go into it and still maintain a paycheck, which is part of the reason I'm so shaky on what I want), but most internships for all the tech companies I've heard of deal with software or application.

I am just starting year 3 out of 4 for my computer science degree in the UK, I'm very good at it academically and I love the subject but I feel like I definitely could not pursue the subject matter when it comes to starting my career. I could not imagine sitting in an office programming/engineering software for the rest of my life, mainly because I feel like I am not making an impact on the world.


I think that is my main issue, I want to leave a mark on the world, no matter how big or how small.
I only really have three passions in life; Music, Computer Science and Helping people. With the latter of the three the main route I would like to go down for the rest of my life.

I'm not so much interested in helping people as say a nurse or a care worker would (even though I believe they do fantastic work and I have nothing but respect for them!), but I would love to be in a position where I could improve a persons standard of living for the better from a hands on perspective (as opposed to sitting in an office attending meetings). Meeting and helping people is a key aspect to my dream job.


I have just started an internship with a company who are very disorganised and the project is looking bleak (although if I stay I will have to complete it - and I am not the sort of person who would want to put their name to something they are not proud of) but I am not so much bothered about this job as CS is not a career interest of mine and the only thing I would lose out on is a nice paycheck as a student and the two months I have been working there for.


In the UK you have a year in industry that closely relates to your subject of study and it counts towards your final grade if you choose to participate in the year. If I was to choose not to continue this internship I would not lose anything significant towards my degree as my second year would just have a heavier weighting, If I chose to work in another area it would not count as anything academic but it could provide me with relevant experience and connections to an industry that better suits me?


I'm not the most social person you will ever meet, but I can guarantee I am very likeable and genuinely enjoy helping people where it is possible. I want to put that passion and skill to good use!
So my main two issues are:


**Where in the hell should I look into starting a career?**


and


**Should I stick with the internship?**


Thank you!"
3kcmpf,4,2015-09-10,Might have ADHD. Don’t know what to do exactly.,MrUH,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3kcmpf/might_have_adhd_dont_know_what_to_do_exactly/,"I’ve always felt as if I had ADHD, but I honestly don’t know if I do. I understand that this sub isn’t here to diagnose if I do or do not have ADHD, but I’d like some advice on what route to go. I have read through the diagnosis link in the sidebar, but still have questions. I think it might be helpful to describe why I think I have ADHD. Maybe?


Anyways from reading the side bar I think that I have ADHD-PI…


Forgetfulness – I always forget stuff. I forget that I needed to call that company that I needed any update from. I forget that I needed to do a specific step for whatever task that I’m doing at work. I forget what my boss was told me to do as soon as the conversation ends. Kind of like the saying where it goes in one ear and out the other. Sometimes I kind of remember what I was told, but have to ask my boss again what I was told not 5 minutes ago. It’s very frustrating. 


Disorganization – I know that I am extremely disorganized. At work I always say that I will be organized but it never seems to happen. A very good example as to how I’m disorganized is with the current project that just started at work. I needed to get startup documentation from multiple companies by a set deadline, but when the deadline came I didn’t know what was sent to me and what was still missing. I setup a spreadsheet checklist to help organize myself and see what I had and still needed, but I didn’t keep up with that spreadsheet. I tried to update it multiple times, but I could never really get it fully updated. I actually got most of it updated today about a week after the deadline. I have paperwork all over my desk. My computer desktop is a mess. It’s cluttered with a lot of files. I feel like I’m a file hoarder since I probably don’t need half the files, and the other half could probably be stored in the project shared drive.


Inattentive to conversation – I think that I kind of explained this in the forgetfulness paragraph, but I can’t pay attention to my boss, I can’t pay attention in class, I can’t pay attention to what friends are saying sometimes. The most irritating thing is the boss and class thing since it visibly shows on my boss’s expression that they get irritated/annoyed at me and the class thing is basically I can’t pay attention or study well enough to get high grades. Somehow I’ve managed to pass all of my classes though and only have two classes left.


Fails to give attention to details – I am always forgetting little important details at work that blow up in my face. Last notable example was when I was setting up a couple of contracts, but did not add a comma here or there or missed a word. The verbiage for the contracts all were similar. When I send out emails I sometimes miss a word. One time I sent an email to a person’s boss instead of who it was intended for. Their first names were the same, but I should have noticed that I was sending it to the wrong person.

Constant fidgeting – This is more related to ADHD-PH, I’m constantly moving my leg/legs up and down. It’s not all the time, but more often than not. Last notable time that it happened was when I was watching a movie at the theater that I was really enjoying. Just thought it was worth noting.


Not sure if that information is helpful, but I really want to get diagnosed and be treated if I do indeed have ADHD. It affects my life at work and school and I’m tired of it. School is not such a big deal since I somehow managed to get through most of it. I really worried about my job though because I’m always making mistakes. I’m currently interning for a company that will most likely hire me as soon as I graduate and I want to improve my standing with my boss before I’m actually hired. My career path is basically management, but on the low end of the spectrum where I’m at, I’m basically doing coordination. I basically set-up everything for my project manager while he does the important stuff. My boss is fairly good at catching mistakes so I’m grateful that I haven’t made such a fool of myself with anyone other than my boss. He’s a pretty stern but nice guy. I feel lucky to have him as my boss since the other project managers might not really like me much in all honest. Heck I don’t think that my project manager doesn’t like me much, but I feel like he’s a bit more tolerant. I’m really greatfull to be working with him.


Since I’m technically still an intern, I do not get benefits and have no insurance. My dad is self-employed and doesn’t have insurance either. I’ve tried to get him to get insurance for the family, but he’s stubborn and doesn’t want to. I come from a Hispanic family where you’re ok without going to the doctor most of the time. I literally stepped on a nail that went through about half of my food, but I never went to the doctor to get a tetanus shot. Family said that I’d be fine which thankfully I was.


What are my options for finding someone to take a look at me? Are there any programs that can help me out? I was thinking about signing up for insurance through healthcare.gov since I’m fairly certain that I apply for specially enrollment since I lost my school insurance this past summer. I’m not very familiar with insurance and what to get. If I get hired on by the time the end of this year I think that I’ll be able to get their insurance, but in the meantime what are my options.

Also where can I find a good doctor since I think that I wasn’t having good luck with the results given to me in the info on the sidebar. Also I understand that my potential ADHD isn’t has bad as it is for others since I’ve been able to pass most of my classes the first go through and have had my internship for quite some time, but I’d still like help.

3kcrqa,0,2015-09-10,Pursue ME Master's degree or continue with career experience to become Engineer? Advice please.,whereisthedust,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3kcrqa/pursue_me_masters_degree_or_continue_with_career/,"Hello r/EngineeringStudents! I am looking for advice and insight from those currently working in the field regarding the need to pursue a Master's degree or to continue with pure on the job training experience. 

Background: I have a BA in Astrophysics. The courses from my BA aren't relevant enough to apply to a Master's program directly and I need to take a total of 14 Engineering/ME courses to catch up academically with those who have a BS already. All the universities within driving distance require similar lists of classes. I have completed basic Materials of Eng, Mechanical Drawing/AutoCAD, and Circuits. I am currently enrolled in Statics and programming. I want to pursue ME as it is the most interesting to me. In the spring, I will begin taking upper division courses full-time and will be able to apply in Fall 2016 to the ME Master's programs to start in Fall 2017.

I have been working at an aerospace supply company as an engineering intern for the last 4 months and am loving it! I will be staying on with a permanent position once the internship term ends, title to be determined but there is potential to be an engineer. They have openly said degree does not matter as they teach everything that is needed to be successful there. They look for students with interest and drive to learn rather than the perfect background. 

This is where I am questioning what to do and would like to hear from those in the field, especially if you are in a hiring position. My question is - do I need the master's degree to work as an Engineer at a future company? 

If I end up with X number of years experience at my current company as an engineer, will other companies see my lack of an engineering degree as a problem and pass on my application? 

I realize more education is typically better but that's not what I am asking. I am asking what is typical of industry and if they would see no degree as a huge red flag.  I don't know how long I will stay with my current company but I don't want to get stuck here without options due to no degree in Engineering.

My current plan will take me another 4 years to complete which will land me at 31 years old hence my questions and slight urgency in completing school. Work hours will be reduced in the spring due to full-time school or if I choose not to continue with school, work will stay full-time.

Has any one else been in this position or a similar situation? What did you do and what was the outcome?

FYI- in the US. 

Thanks in advance for your time!"

I want to make sure that this build is future proof for at the least 5 years to up to around 10 years before I upgrade it again. I am a student that moves around a lot for internships and the wifi card really helps with the possibility of not having wired access to the internet. I've changed this build numerous times but I was wondering if there was any room to save some money without a loss in performance. Worst comes to worse, I could potentially wait to make this build in December when the prices of parts are hopefully significantly lower. Any help would be appreciated!

So I'm a 22 years old portuguese and I came to Germany (Hamburg) about 3 months ago.
I've been doing a german course and i'm currently in the beginning of level B1.

I have a bachelor degree in management or business or whatever you want to call it (did it in Portugal). But I hated it! I hated studying at the university and I hated my subject of studies (although i studied in the best portuguese university).

Now I have no idea what to do with my life! 
My boyfriend suggested that I do an Ausbildung.
What do you think?!

I'm interested in the hospitality industry and I also love event planning, I have done 2-3 months internship in both this areas back in Portugal.

But I don't know what I should do now.. I know that i still need to learn more german but and then what?

I could really use some advice and first-hand experience from someone!

Thank you all for your attention!

I look forward to read what you have to say about this!

3kfi33,1,2015-09-10,Just started on a team at first job. Did I pick the right team?,Caof,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3kfi33/just_started_on_a_team_at_first_job_did_i_pick/,"I just started (~2 weeks ago) at a large company as a new grad on a mobile dev team. However most of my experience from previous internships and passion lies in web dev. Only 1 (out of 3) of my previous internships was also doing mobile dev (at a smaller company) and I've never done mobile dev outside of work. I am passionate about the product, but I don't feel like this translates into passion for developing on Android. 

I also interned at this company last summer on a web dev team and enjoyed my time there even though it was stressful just due to release cycles, deadlines, and visibility. I mainly picked this mobile dev team because I wanted to gain some experience outside of web dev so I have more career opportunities in the future. 

Should I do anything about this feeling I have now or should I just wait and possibly change teams after a year?"

Please help.",mk937,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3kfnzd/soon_to_graduate_with_nothing_real_to_show_please/,"I feel i'm in a situation that most soon-to-be grads are not usually in and would appreciate any advice.

Brief history: I am getting a second undergrad degree in CS. I decided in Spring of 2014 that my anthropology degree and jobs as a nanny/assistant were taking me nowhere fast. I looked into different careers and decided software development was for me. I decided the risk was worth it and immediately quit my job to go back to school to get a CS degree.

So now I am in my last year and am starting to panic. Every semester, I have taken on the maximum load to try to graduate the quickest. I simply cannot live my adult life on savings, a small amount of student loans and a small part-time job for more than two years. Because of this, I have not had time to get an internship or had much time to work on anything outside of school. I need to graduate in May for financial reasons, so I will take on quite a large load next semester.

I also do not know what to work on as a side project. I look around and see people with different projects on their resumes. I feel like i've done nothing in classes but programs dealing with prime numbers or data structures that do not amount to much. I know its giving me experience programming but I don't feel like the programs do anything ""real."" I am taking all of my 4000 level courses this semester and next. Based on your past experience, will I have something to put on my resume when I complete these courses? Because right now, I feel like I have nothing. 

I feel relatively confident in java and I find it easy to learn new languages. 

TL;DR - 2nd time undergrad, no time to get internship or work on a lot of side projects. What do I do between now and May to get something on my resume? Side projects or wait to see what 4000 level courses will give me? Also, when should I apply for jobs if I have nothing much to say on my resume?  I would appreciate any advice!"

When applying to internships (plan to apply to Big 4, etc), is it okay to put ""BS in Math and CS"" even though my current official transcripts says ""BS in Math""? I have already gotten the guarantee from my advisor that the BS in CS will appear on my transcript as soon as I finish up that one engineering course next semester. Reason I want the ""BS in Math and CS"" is to be on equal grounds against other CS students trying to get past the HR resume screening process (it seems some employers screen out anyone that's not a CS major). 

If I get any interviews, I'll bring it up that I am currently a Math major, with the CS major to be added on next semester. Would employers be okay with this?

-----------

A modern form of prostitution where eager, young minds sign on with the most reputable ""practice"" pimp in hopes of success and fortune but end up being sold to the highest bidder while partaking only a minimal share of the profits. ""Partners"" pimps are noted for reprimanding personnel that do not perform every and all requests of the client john, as well as those who do not perform adequately in the eyes of the client.

---------

v. To feel a strong sense of self resentment or insecurity due to a realization of being second tier

n. A place filled with people who secretly (or openly) wish they had gotten into MBB. To compensate, they loudly proclaim, ""It's MBBD now!"" or ""We beat MBB in proposals all the time!""  Of course, at the same time they are constantly pestering their MBB friends to get them an interview.  Despite their bravado, nearly all Deloitte employees would take a paycut and give up their first born to switch.  

*""John got deloitted so hard when the girl he was crushing on hooked up with his best friend""*

---------

The last form of slavery in the US. This is where many young people begin careers and work 115 hours a week until they either quit or die from exhaustion. Former Deloitte employees often have scarred backs from the whip marks.

-----------

""Deloitte"" comes from the Greek denomination of ""De"" and ""Loitte"". ""De"" translates directly to ""miserable"", with ""Loitte"" translating to ""pathetic human being."" Formerly known as Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the name was shortened to just ""Deloitte"" after it was discovered that ""Touche"" was a 3rd grade version of the word ass, and Tohmatsu was too difficult to say. 
Members of the Deloitte firm are easy to spot. During the months of January through March, in preparation for hibernation, Deloitters typically put on between 5 and 65 pounds. Additionally, staffers can be seen aging as if they drank from the wrong Holy Grail during this period. The only members of Deloitte who seem to stay a consistent age are the partners, mostly because they drink and bath in the youth and souls of staff members. 

--------------

Deloitte is also a microcasm for the problems of American society. The wealth gap is clearly seen in Deloitte, with partners driving Porsche's, and staffers riding their new Dyno freestyle BMX's in January. In addition, Deloitte partners have new HP Tablet laptops, with staffers performing audit work on Abacuses. 
Deloitte staffers can typically describe their lives with the following tickmark: ""I traced and agreed my weight gain to the scale in my bathroom without exception. D&amp;T noted that 15 pounds was immaterial to performing audit work. Per discussion with my roommates, I noted that they no longer recognized me. Per further inquiry, they now refer to me as either 'The guy that sleeps in the other room', or 'The vaguely familiar friend'. D&amp;T assessed this explanation from my roommates as acceptable. I footed the number of outstanding bills received from the mail, and noted that it tied without exception to the amount that the bill collector said I owed. I re-calculated my credit score, and noted that the score of 4 was appropriate. D&amp;T passed on further investigation.""

--------------

A verb describing metaphorical anal rape. 

It is derived from the common practices of partners at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP. 

Partners at this firm expect their staff to 'take it up the arse' and work like dogs, whilst being grateful for this privilege.

*He was deloitted so bad he couldn't walk for days..*

A place where you are not family, nor do you want to be. 

A place where 40 fresh faced college interns joyously start on the same date for a new program, envisioned by a Senior Manager who cares about them and treats them well and makes them happy and the program is a success and saves the company hundreds of thousands of dollars. Where the Senior Manager subsequently gets fired a year later who knows what, but rumors abound that he was a target because he spent too much on outings that kept his employees happy and retained. 

A place where all but 7 out of those 40 interns have quit 4 years after being hired (three years after the Senior Manager was fired). 

A place where you work from 9am till 3am or 5am seven days a week, for two months, because you’ve been selected to run an engagement where you have absolutely no experience in that industry, and get no help from the Manager. He was supposed to be there at 7:30 – his first time there in 2 months – but calls you at 9:30, from bed, mentions that he has to drop off his laundry and maybe get his car serviced, depending on the line. Not to mention that the reason you’re working so much is because the Manager deleted the prior year’s work-papers’ diskettes because they were sitting in a box on his desk and he thought they were junk. Yes, I’m talking about you, first initial of C. Your reward for all that hard work? A “Why did it take so long??” lecture from the partner. 

A place so full of pompous jerks that a Second Year’s opinion on how to get the engagement done quickly is completely ignored. To top it off, the Second Year person is neither congratulated nor recognized when their method gets the job done 3 times faster than either of the two Seniors’ and the Manager’s method. 

A place where the Senior tells you to ABC, and when the Manager reprimands you for it and demands to know why you did ABC, the Senior, standing two feet away, does not speak up and admit it was his instructions. 

A place where people who make a measly 50K a year act like they descend from Sultan Blue Blood Royalty and you, as a first year, should worship the dog poop on their leather Gucci shoes that are going to take them three years to pay off because they only make the aforementioned 50K a year. Of course, they have $100,000 in college loans, $30,000 in credit card bills, and live in the city with 3 roommates in a two bedroom walkup, but they are the bomb in their own minds. 

A place where you switch departments for a temporary two month stint under the promise of learning new &amp; exciting things, where your reputation for excellence and devotion will guarantee you respect and advancement. And instead you are put to photocopying and filing for 5 months. 

A place so full of snotty snobs, where someone you sit next to everyday prefers to turn their head rather than say hello to you as you pass them in the hallway, because you are a first year, and they are a Senior, and think they are hot, even tho they are butt-ugly and freakish looking, and therefore you are not worthy of a “Hello”. 

A place where your Senior tells you that you are too happy, and too nice to people, and that it annoys them. Then the client subsequently brings over a box of cupcakes and hands it to you personally, and when you open it and there is only one cupcake inside, the Senior doesn’t even rethink their feelings about you and how good you may actually be at client relations. 

--------------

A company, like any other, that is led by out-of-touch, miserable, lonely, and pathetic partners. 

These partners make broad generalizations about the younger members of their company's work force who happen to have negative opinions about the lifestyle they were thrown into upon signing their offer letters. They support these generalizations by throwing about unsubstantiated facts and figures (see the ""20-30%"" comment and the ""daddy"" reference in definition 2. above) and whining to anyone who will listen that they can't figure out how to keep talented accountants.

Further proof of the fact that those at the partnership level are out of synch with those who actually do their grunt work lies in the partners' belief that the audit staff members are unable to admit to themselves that they made a mistake in choosing their profession. This is completely false. Every one of these so-called ""over-achieving grads"" will freely admit their mistake. But calling it a ""mistake"" isn't exactly fair, is it? It would be more truthful to say that they were ""duped"" into employment by way of empty promises, audit room war stories, and lucrative internships. 

These partners continue to walk around with their heads in the clouds, making up fantastic stories to explain the parade of 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-years walking out the Deloitte door each year. These made-up stories include, but are not limited to, impressive details about their workers desperately trying to impress ""daddy"", workers who didn't pay for college themselves, and workers who ""do not yet realize the benefit of hard work."" Again, see definition 2 above.

Just finished my last internship of my undergrad career at a great video game studio in Santa Monica and received a returning full-time offer. The initial offer is $90k + ~$15k in equity, along with covering relocation.


Here's my dilemma.

Myself, and many of my friends, have interned at several of the Big 4, so I know what competing offers look like. The base pay is a bit higher, while the signing bonuses seem astronomically higher than my current offer. Is it reasonable to compare offers from the Big 4 to a game studio?

1) I am thinking both the sides. 

a) If I accept the offer I will get to learn a new technology. 

b) The other way round I think - if I apply for the job of Java developer later, will my experiance in Ruby on Rails be counted at the time of application ? I think probably not, isn't it ?

So should I go for the internship or not ?

2) Can I apply my experiance in Ruby on Rails to learn other tecnologies say frameworks of languages like Java, Javascript, etc ?

3)I've researched a little and found the demand for Ruby on Rails is declining. Is it true ? I would like to hear opinions.

A year ago I realized that I learn literally nothing here - basically the dev's job is to convert XMLs to Java code, slap them together, fix broken parts and produce another XML file. You even don't have to be a decent Java programmer to do it - just copy-paste from a similar place.

I thought that I'm ruining my career this way and asked for a build engineer position. 
Why didn't I simply leave? Because I had no chance to get in the good company, given that my programming skills really degraded.
Why build engineer? Because I had all the necessary skills for the position and other guys from this team are really passionate about their job (in contrast to devs) and improve everything they touch.

Fortunately, I got this position. During the past 8 months I've learned and created a ton of cool things. But at the same time I was sharpening my skills, taking MOOCs, trying side projects and preparing for a dev interview.

Now I'm feeling confident and ready to apply to a dream company as a developer. How should I explain such job switching in a positive way? Honestly, I didn't become a build engineer because I wanted to - I just couldn't stand being a developer there and couldn't leave."

Coming out of highschool I had a lot of drive and excitement for this major, but now I really dislike the classes and even my career outlook.  

I've had three internships so far with 2 separate companies (1 aerospace, 1 robotics/manufacturing), and rather than helping me see a light at the end of the tunnel it made me think I was going through all of this miserable coursework just to end up at a desk job I didn't enjoy. My most recent internship was actually very hands on, working with robotics and CAD design, and it still didn't really spark anything within me that gave me assurance that I was on the right path. 

My least favorite course right now is Linear Systems, as I just have no idea what's going on and it's very defeating. I struggled with Dynamics, but did very well in Statics and Thermo once I finally figured it out. Looking at the future courses I have to take in this major like machine design, fatigue, and combustion really don't excite me like they used to. My friends on the other hand are excited to get into these classes. Overall my grades are OK and I still have a 3.5 despite often feeling like I'm going to fail 50% of my classes. (They always curve at the end)

I'm thinking about switching to Civil, because I think it may include the problem solving I enjoy without all of the super intense math and physics that's killing me in Mechanical. Even though I'm a junior, switching to civil wouldn't set me back all that much. My current goal if I took that path would be to eventually work in consulting for environmental related areas like brownfield remediation or water resource management because I'm a very outdoorsy person. My biggest fear is that it wouldn't be any better than mechanical, or even worse, and I would regret switching.  

I just can't tell if I would be switching for the right reasons. I can't tell if I really hate this major as much as I think I do, or if I just hate it because of how hard and defeating it is.  I'm really unsure what to do and it's been stressing me out a lot.  Any help or advice would be appreciated, and I apologize for so much venting. "

3kl1v0,32,2015-09-11,Adviser fucked me. Help me graduate.,myadvisorsucks,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3kl1v0/adviser_fucked_me_help_me_graduate/,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible.


At the age of 30 I decided to go back to school in an attempt to change my life for the better (under the 2011/2012 catalog). I just finished up an internship which *should* complete my degree (Network Administration). Previously, I was told by both my adviser and a professor (who I like, trust and who is also an adviser himself) since I had completed the classwork that now all I had to do was take an internship “at any point”, turn in a Report and Daily Log and I could graduate at the end of whatever semester i submitted those requirements. The reason I asked two people was because my adviser is an idiot, doesn’t actually seem to understand his job, and has steered me wrong before and cost me a semester, so I made sure to get a second opinion.


I was offered two internships prior to the one that I accepted. I opted for a third that I felt would look better on my resume (Entry IT vs. Junior Sys Admin), I had to wait to get in though, which unfortunately took about 6+ months. So I missed a semester, and by the time I completed the internship it was too late to register for the current semester. So basically I missed a whole year. In that time they introduced a new rule stating that your internship must be done *during* the semester, but this wasn’t a rule that I was ever made aware of until now nor do I feel it applies to me since it was instated after I had completed my catalog anyway. 


Now my adviser is telling me that my internship didn’t count and because I missed a semester (or two), I’m no longer a student, if I want my degree I’ll have to register under the new catalog (2014/2015? - which you can imagine has changed significantly in the last 4 years) take all the newer classes and re-do an internship. I told him that was unacceptable and asked for the name of someone who could actually help me. He gave me a name, which turned out to be the wrong person (big surprise) though *they* were at least able to steer me in the right direction. So I wrote a very nice Letter of Appeal and talked to the General Education and Transfer Division Chair on the phone as well. She insists that she’s doing everything in her power to find the easiest possible solution, but I haven’t heard from her in a week. I’m certain it’s too late now to register for this semester which I can only imagine will be yet another issue for me. 


I worked very hard to get though school while working, I’m completely paid up (read: I’m broke), I have a 3.73 GPA, two semesters on the Dean’s List, I have professors that will be able to verify that not only did I do well in class I spent time helping other students catch up. I have an internship that are as concerned as I am (some down-right pissed) and willing to give me resume references or letters of reference and any other assistance I might need. Which is nice. Though (and i may be wrong here) I don’t think the school calling them to verify whether or not I was ever there has helped me in my pursuit to land a job with them. 


Now I feel completely defeated and helpless, not to mention embarrassed for being in this situation which I’ve been made to feel is my fault and on top of that I’m being punished for trying to beef up my resume. I have requested my transcript so at the very least I’ll have that. I’m fully prepared to tell them to go fuck themselves and take my chances in the job market, but I would rather have my physical diploma if possible, for my parents sake more than my own but I’m standing my ground on not taking more classes or another internship. 


I’ve collected all the phone number and emails of everyone who I’ve talked to so far, anyone who is above them (in the school) who might be able to help and the Board of Regents for the Dept. of Education for the state. However, before I waste my time rattling off emails to people who will surely tell me “tough luck” I thought maybe Reddit might have some advice.


TL;DR - Adviser is an idiot, school doesn’t think I’ve earned graduation. I’m like...whaaat?"

I would like to list my pros and cons, as I see them, for potentially being hired as a data scientist, and request a discussion about what I should do over the next few months to prepare for applications, interviews, etc.


Pros:

- My thesis is heavily statistics-oriented

- My academic coursework has been primarily in machine learning and statistics

- I have done moderately well in some online data science competitions

- I know Python (and Matlab) very well, and I have a public GitHub account with a few of my favorite scripts

- I have been contributor to several IEEE publications during my studies, and the primary author on one

- I can intelligently discuss most popular machine learning and data mining algorithms and concepts

- I am very comfortable distilling this type of information and communicating it to people of all technical levels (I practice on my wife and friends regularly) 

Cons:

- Although I have a lot of experience with data and modeling in university, I haven't had much formal ""data science"" work experience (I have taken several internships over the years, but all have been very EE focused)

- Almost all of my CS knowledge has been self-taught, so I currently can't answer many of the data structures, time-space efficiency, or more complex algorithms questions straightaway 

- Along those same lines, my experience with production software, using revision control, coding conventions, etc. is all very limited

- I don't have much experience with ""big data"" technologies


All that said, I am super willing and motivated to make progress in any and all of these areas over the next few months. Does anyone have suggestions about where to start? Would any recruiters be willing to point out what they would see as the most glaring hole in my experience, if my resume were to come across your desk?"

I'm a 24 year old who just finished up my masters degree. I will, in the next couple of weeks, know if I got accepted to my dream job opportunity (currently interning at the company) allowing for a 2-year rotation throughout different divisions in different countries.

The catch is, that if accepted, I will have to start next September in 2016, and would need to be studying in the meantime.

It's a complicated story, but essentially I'm involved in an internship now that was suppose to be undertaken by someone in a sandwich year with another year of schooling left. Since I have recently finished my masters, they said it wouldn't be possible to be accepted onto the rotation unless I did more schooling before the next intake in summer 2016. Both my managers tried to fight for me on this, but it was an HR decision that can't be changed.

Initially it was something I was extremely reluctant to do, being 24 with a masters already... But now seeing this is an extremely cool company, great opportunities for travel and growth, and great salary, it's something I'm willing to do if offered.

That being said, what I'm looking to do is enrol in a postgraduate online certificate course where I'm a full time student, yet nowhere near as intensive as another masters degree. Since I have completed my internship I can tailor my studies more towards what will help me  when I start the rotation.In the meantime, I was thinking of working part time and travelling etc. 

A couple of questions:

Am I mad for thinking of doing this?? Really this would mean not working my first big career until I was 25.

Is it possible to take out a low-interest loan out to fund this gap year (essentially 10 months)?? Not only for the actually certificate course, but if I decide to travel,etc. I'm currently in no debt, about 5k in savings, 750 credit score, and will pay no rent until next January. The job will pay about 90k. And would aim to repay the loan within 1-2 years after starting.

Any advice?",revenging_narwhal,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3koggn/received_an_internship_offer_not_sure_if_i_should/,"I'll start with a little background information. I'm a junior studying aerospace engineering at a fairly reputable school, and I've been fortunate enough to have 3 summers of internship experience in the aviation field, both on the federal and contractor side. I've interned with a well-known contractor during the summers of 2014 and 2015, and was offered a part-time job doing remote work during this school year (which I accepted). I was doing excellent systems engineering/testing work, as well as less-fun (but equally important) test analyzation and procedure drafting. Towards the end of my term, I was called by their recruiting office, and was told to expect another internship offer, as well as to be on the lookout for a full-time position upon graduation.

Yesterday, I received the internship offer for the 2016 summer from the company, which included a very attractive pay raise, however I'm not sure if I should accept it. Their primary work is in the electrical and computer engineering field, and while I find that interesting, ultimately that's not what I want to do upon graduation. 

So, I'm here for advice. I have a meeting with a career adviser at my school, and I'm going to speak with my manager about my options. There is a division of the company that works with aircraft structures, which I would love to work in, however the offer letter doesn't make it seem like that's where I'll be working. I have a month to accept or decline, and the deadline is only a few days after the big on-campus career fair. Several aerospace companies expressed interest in me last year, and I even had a couple interviews with promising outcomes. I'm just apprehensive to decline the offer so soon, because I'm afraid I won't end up getting an internship in the aerospace field. My manager, who is an excellent boss, knows I want to work in the aerospace field, and knows the work I am doing (while great), isn't getting me the experience that I really need. He tried find me a spot within the company as closely suited to my needs as possible for this last summer, however it proved challenging since they aren't too focused on the structures aspect of the aerospace industry.

Are there certain questions I should ask? I don't want to talk to my company and sound demanding, because I don't want to sour my reputation and lose my references. 

Thanks in advance!"
3kom5c,8,2015-09-12,Been offered a job a week before my plane is booked to move to Asia... Do I take it?,throwaway_doidoit,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3kom5c/been_offered_a_job_a_week_before_my_plane_is/,"I live in the UK and have worked a soul crushing customer service role for the last year to save money to move to Asia with my SO at their parents residence. Before getting the customer service role, I got interviews for a few jobs - one of which was at a small company in the technology sector. I was very impressed with the company and it is the sort of sector I would be interested in getting in to.

I didn't get the job in the end, however recently they have contacted me to say they are potentially looking to hire a PA to the CEO and have asked me to send them my CV and let them know what sort of starting salary I would like, assuring me it would be reviewed after six months if I perform well. I was contacted directly by the CEO, who also interviewed me when I initially applied, and they said they were confident I could perform to their standards.

The original plan was to move to Asia for the year so my SO and I could get voluntary experience and possibly apply for internships, and then move to London to start our lives. My SO's parent has a lot of good connections and could probably help the two of us out when we go over.

Also, as far as my personal life is concerned, I am pretty sick of the UK and my friendship group in general right now and have been very excited to get away for a year and do some writing and general 'finding myself'.

This job offer throws a bit of a spanner in the works and is very tempting, but that may simply be because of the instant gratification element. Not moving would put strain on my relationship of three years due to the time difference etc.

Just looking for any advice that can be offered by the far more experienced than me members of this sub?"
3kp49b,1,2015-09-12,Need help with attitude (?),raininlondon,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3kp49b/need_help_with_attitude/,"Hey guys, let me provide some backstory before I pose my problem.

I finished my degree in accounting about 2 years ago and started lookig for a job back then. Didn't get one and a month later I decided to go on with studying and I opted for a Masters in Audit. 

Later on I got my first job in accounting while I was finishing the first semester in accounting. I want to say that I got it not because someone liked me but only because my father knew someone who knew someone that could employ me. So, I got a job at that person's office for a year and a half on internship since it was payed by my country's job-incentive programs. When the internship was over, I left, no big deals.

So I start looking for a new job, with only my master thesis left to defend (I already submitted it), and nothing. For 4 months, nothing. Add to that the time I spent looking before I got the previous internship, I'm probably looking at something along the lines of 15 interviews, 3 of which went kinda bad, but the rest went either good or great or almost perfect. But yeah, 0 calls. At this time I'm questioning if there is something fundamentally wrong about me as a human being.

Back when I left my internship, a friend of mine submitted my resumee to the audit company where he works. But they didn't call me until 5 months later. That was when they finally called me (probably because that was when they decided to discuss hiring someone).

So I went to the interview and it was kinda strange. It went good, I was calm and composed and answered all the questions with ease. But their body language was telling me that they were not that happy for some reason. And then it just ended abruptly, not even asking me about salary or availability. Basically I was asked some personal questions and stuff about my past and it was done.

So basically I thought ""welp, i'm not getting hired"" but this one time was strange, I really did not understand why they even called me if they were not interested in me, as I did not give them a reason not to like me in the interview for sure.

And ironically, a week later I get called in telling me I was hired. I was very happy, it's what I want to do in my life after all. So, I go there on the day they told me to start working and here comes the problem I'm having.

I arrive there in the morning, they tell me that they were going to need me to give a lot to the company, that a guy who was 4 years younger than me was showing a lot of commitment and I have to catch up to that. then they tell me to leave the room and present myself to the others (they didn't even show me around the office). So I think ""ok, this is a competitive envirionment and I have to take a lot of initiative from the start"". So, I walk out of the room, turn a corner and there's a big table with like 10 people working on it. I present myself to everyone, handshake and stuff, all's good I think.

We had training for the whole morning and half the afternoon, and then... everyone started working on their laptops and I was left without anyone telling me anything of what to do. So, I get up and walk up to my mentor and ask him when do I start working. And he answers me ""you're already working."" And I look at him and say ""yeah but I mean, doing something for real, like don't you have any tasks you can assign me to?"" And he tells me that we were going to organize the office's papers in a bit. So I nod and sit back again while he wanders off to file a report and everyone is still working in laptops.

then some people start working on organizing the cases where papers are but they don't tell me anything, and I couldn't just start organizing things, not jsut because I didn't know where to put them, but because I didn't know which papers belonged to the team I was assigned and whatnot (there are 2 different teams).

I ask them if I can help, they tell me no. Others are still working and I couldn't do much to help them since I didn't have a laptop. About 2 hours later my mentor shows up again and tells me to help him pack the papers. I got up and started FINALLY doing something.

At the end of they day I got mixed feelings. I love audit and it's the career I want, and the workplace was really good. Serious, young and intelligent people mostly at my age who were very laid back and talkative. However, this was actually a deterrent for me, because where I worked the relationships were very formal and there were much less people working there. I used to work with 2 people by my side, now I'm at a table with 10 to 14 people. So it feels overwhelming and kind of hard to blend in. But what I really wanted to discuss is this:

Those 2 hours I was doing nothing, looking at people work and barely able to start a conversation, was it my fault? Like, should I have insisted on helping people? Because they are so many, I am also afraid of asking each and every one for help, only for them to turn me down every time. After I asked 2 of them and they rejected help, I kinda feeling defeated. And I get that there is a lot competition, so you need to be motivated, have the initiative, do whatever it takes to get the job done, but still, after a day of thinking about this I think it's also a bad start from them when it comes to me. Like, they tell me to go around the place, present myself to everyone, sit wherever I want, give me no task whatsoever to do, practically ignore me the whole time, all the while working and talking to each other like they a big family.

Honestly, It was just the first day and I know these things are normal to happen. But at the end of the day I was asking myself: ""why was I even hired?"" and with the sensation that I should have had more initiative and talked more.

Tell me, did I really go wrong about all this, or is it also the company who did not prepare enough for taking me in that particular day? I'd also like to know fi you have any experiences that relate to this."

""Did I kill you?""

""Maybe.""

""Maybe? That's not fair. You can't say maybe. You have to tell me,"" I was on my back on my mattress, staring at the ceiling. Alvarez's ghost was on the ground, his back propped up against the bed frame. His hair was mixed up with mine. My hair was the same color as dried out grass. His was the color of graveyards. 

""Would you have killed me?"" He asked. His voice sounded weird. Like he had said all the words individually and then they were recorded and played back as he spoke. 

""Of course I wouldn't have killed you. We worked together. You were nice. I *liked* you. I still do, even if you are dead""

""But would you have killed me? If you had to?""

""I used to think things made sense,"" I said, then paused. ""And if you asked me back then, I would have said no. Absolutely not. Of course not. But now? Now things don't make sense. So who knows?""

We were both quiet for a moment. Beyond my bedroom, LA was waking up with traffic and lawyers and garbage men and actors and those who would die that day, they just didn't know it yet.

""Alvarez?""

""Yeah?""

""Did I kill you?""

Outside, a car alarm was going off. It sounded like an air raid siren, like the bombs were coming. 

The room went suddenly cold. I sat up in bed and looked down at the floor. Where he had been nothing was instead. 

*****

Gwen, my agent, had her office in Culver City. It usually took under an hour to get there. I had been on the I-10 for about twenty minutes when Alvarez was suddenly in the passenger seat. 

""I'm sorry about that,"" he said. ""Back in the apartment. Disappearing like that.""

""It's ok,"" I said, trying to pay attention to the road. 

""It's because I'm not really here. This isn't me. It's just...light, sort of. So it can short out sometimes.""

""I understand.""

Downtown flooded by us, SUVs and skyscrapers and sunshine. I had the windows down. The air felt like last chances. 

""Queen Mab told me there's no heaven, just hell. Is that true?""

""Once upon a time,"" Alvarez started talking. His body flickered. ""A warrior came to an old monk and asked him if there was a paradise, if there was a hell. The old monk said he was too ugly to be a warrior and besides, his sword was probably too dull. The warrior got mad and unsheathed his sword. When the old monk saw that, he said, ""You open the gates of hell."" The warrior stopped, and put his sword away. ""Now,"" the old monk said, ""you open the gates of paradise.""

*****

When I got to the office, Alvarez had vanished again. Think of it like crappy wi-fi and sometimes I just can't load, he had explained to me the biggest before, after we had left the club. I don't know if that meant he was constantly around, but not visible, or always perpetually about to exist. I wondered if the world was full of the invisible dead, floating at the edge of every conversation, every conflagration, every kiss, every empty moment, forever wishing to be seen. Death is a permanent act of voyeurism. The sky was full of clouds. I was still wearing the clothes I went out in last night. I think I still smelled like Queen Mab. 

Gwen rented out a place in the Clarkdale section of Culver City, in a nondescript strip mall few blocks away from LA Weekly's office and the freeway. It was ugly and busy with parking lots and fast food places and traffic. I knocked and walked in.

The girl who worked the front desk wasn't in her usual spot, which wasn't unusual. Gwen always hired interns for that job and they tended to have fairly flexible schedules. Or nonexistent schedules. Tomato to-ma-toe.

Her door was in the back, down a narrow hallway. It was cracked open and light spilled out from it and onto the faded carpet as I walked toward the door. I had emailed her that I was coming over after she hadn't answered the phone. The floor squeaked under my boots. The building had previously been an orthodontist's office; Gwen joked the squeaks were the sounds of the children's braces being tightened. Like it never stopped.

The same way light doesn't stop.

I knocked on her door. ""Gwen?"" 

No answer.

""Gwen? It's Chloe. I had to ask you a question...""

I opened the door. 

Gwen was at her chair, like always. The room didn't have any windows, just her increasingly unnecessary filing cabinets. 

""Chloe,"" she said, slowly. ""Good to see you.""

""Nice to see you, too. I sort of...""  I tried to think of something to say. What do you say? ""I needed to talk to you.""

""The world is sick. Sickness waits for cures."" 

I could see an ant crawling on her desk.

She stood up. Ants fell from her as she stood, falling like rain does in a long wet summer rainstorm when it feels They hit the ground at her feet, their exoskeletons glowing. 

""The world is not good,"" she said. She sounded like someone had put a tape recorder in her throat. Ants were crawling out of her eyes and down her face, leaving trails of liquid.

""Have you ever been —""

She stepped out from the desk. Her lower half wasn't her legs. She had been cut in half — *or chewed, look at those ragged lines. I thought, staring at her body, those were teeth* — at the waist and she was tied by some kind of rope to the body of a horrible ant that was too large to be real. The ant began to move. Unlike the things in ""White Horses"" it wasn't standing, but it was moving instead on all of its hideous and long six legs. 

""All ways into the world are good,"" droned Gwen. Her hands grasped the smooth and shiny ant shell exterior. ""Even though world is not good.""

I backed away, out of the room. The ant stood up on its hind legs. Gwen wrapped her arms around its upper body. The chimera lumbered toward me. 

""Sickness waits for cures,"" Gwen rasped. Blood and ants were coming out of lips. I realized what tied her to the ant wasn't a rope. It was her intestines, stretched out and pulled as snug as a tourniquet, a gleaming pale pink. 

Have you ever heard of depersonalization? It gets used a lot but I'm not sure if it's always correctly. It means feeling like what is occurring isn't occurring. That the actions involving you are not real. You can feel dreamlike or distant — as if you were watching a movie. 

That's what was happening to me. I staggered backward out of the office feeling an inexplicable lack of engagement with the situation. I watched the mandibles of the ant  click with the same interest as I would observe a cashier swiping my items. It felt like a movie. That's what they say on movies, right? It feels like a movie. Unrealistic. Unbelievable. And horrifying. 

I walked into the main room. The ant was at the edge of the door of the office at the end of the hallway. It's antenna quivered, desperate and tremulous. Gwen was saying, underneath the aegis of the bright halogen lights ""we swim at night."" 

I stepped out of the building. My car was in the parking lot. Alvarez was in the passenger seat, smoking an unfiltered cigarette. His hair was black and swirled up like smoke. 

""That was a bad idea, coming here."" I sat down in the car and took a deep breath. He handed me a pill. I looked askance at him.

""Ativan,"" he shrugged. ""Can't hurt.""

*****

We didn't go back to my apartment. Alvarez told me his ex's place in West Hollywood was empty; he had gone away early for a long weekend in Mexico with his married (but not to him) producer boyfriend. I wanted to ask if Alvarez knew about all of that before he was killed or if that was something he learned about later, from the confidences of the dead. 

The boyfriend's apartment was nice. Minimalist and clean, bamboo floors, bright orange appliances. The place was filled with radiant lighting and the windows were stuffed with flowers of all sort, jostling for space, rioting green thoughts in a green shade. 

I sat on the couch. Alvarez sat next to me. He held my hand. It felt like January in Chicago.

""The ants are workers,"" he said, without waiting for me to ask. ""They follow the scent of food from the NotHere to here. White Horses opened up a river. They're swimming in the river, following food.""

""Are they bad?""

""What do you mean?""

""I mean are they, like, evil?""

""Throw rocks in the water when you're bored and hit a frog. You're joking but the frog's dead,"" he said. His eyes weren't really there if you looked at them. They flickered back and forth. ""Are you evil?""

""I liked you better when you were alive,"" I said. 

""I'm not really me anymore. I'm more like an idea of me.""

I turned on the tv. It was showing footage of some black kid in LA who had been shot and killed by a cop. He was from Denver and had just moved to LA. DeJuan Morris. The TV showed his drivers license photo of him. He looked like a little kid. Under his face the text crawl ran:

*""Suspected of arson in Denver...neighbors say he was ""no angel""...the police officer who shot him hasn't been named by police but identified on Twitter as Malik Reynolds...LA residents are already worried about another riot....police already moving to block area of shooting where an impromptu protest is forming ...""*

I stared at the screen. ""Why does this feel weird?"" I asked Alvarez. 

""It's part of it. It's mixed up in the transmission.""

""The video talked about the transmission...""

""White Horses is a transmission from the NotHere. It's the dream of the one who is asleep there. All the suffering and nightmares and pain feed into the dream. It's projected on electronic billboards in neon, splashing down all over dirty streets. It reflects in bathwater when you drown. You see it in your coffee. You see it in the eyes of the ones you killed that you can't forget. And when it gets too much, it spills out into here, into the real world."" 

""And then what?"" I asked. 

""Either it goes away, or one day, the thing that's sleeping will wake up. And all will become nothing.""

""Fuck.""

The news showed video clips of a crowd that someone had filmed with an iPhone. The crowd was shouting at the cops. The footage cut back to the news anchor. 

""I told Queen Mab I was going to bring her Milo Sacer,"" I told Alvarez. ""On a scale of one to ten, how bad did I fuck up?""

""Ten.""

""Ten?""

""Maybe eleven,"" he said. ""He isn't Milo Sacer anymore.""

""What is he?""

""Do you want me to tell you or do you  want to find out?""

The television was talking about how there were rumors the crowd was starting to turn violent. The news flashes a screenshot of a photo trending on Twitter. A fire beginning to start 

I stood up.

""Let's find out.""

About 2 of those years were spent interning while I was getting my bachelors in Comp Sci. I spent the last 5 months of my internship in the department I work in now. When I graduated, the company liked me enough to hire me on full time into this group. I have spent about 9 months total in this group with internship + full time.

I would categorize my position as more of a operations support role for the various systems that my team is responsible for. The department is more of a business unit with some IT support mixed in. 

Therein lies my main problem. I originally got into Computer Science because I loved programming and development. However, this position is more of a system support/maintenance role. Albeit there is some programming/database work thrown in, but it is not the main responsibility or the main thing I spend my time on.

I knew this when I accepted the full time position, but I was kind of hoping that I would maybe get the opportunity to move into more of an IT development role in the company. However, my manager is very ""old school"" and is very apprehensive to me moving around within the company or leaving his group too early, even after expressing my concerns.

This is frustrating for me because I really like this company. The benefits and job security are very good and the pay is probably as good as it's going to get for a new grad in my area. But I don't really enjoy the current position at all, and I'm afraid the longer I stay in it the more my programming skills will start to fall off, and I'll have a harder time transitioning into development later down the road.

Should I try to hold out in my current position for a few years and try to move around within the company, or should I just bite the bullet now and look for something closer to my interests?"

I found the Eurail Train, which sounds pretty attractive to me. I was thinking about doing the 4 country ticket. Has anybody used this train before or have any other suggestions?
Should I travel by train, or just fly (like on Ryanair or something)? Ah, there are just so many options!

Those of you who have done this, tell me stories of your experiences! Tell me what you wish you did, and what you wish you hadn't!
I am not very wealthy, so saving money is pretty important to me. But I'm letting loose for this! I still don't have much, but all I want to do is make the most of my time here in Europe. Please help me out!

It's the fall of my sophomore year at university and I recently began a Data and Analytics internship within NYC's educational sector (I'd like to pursue data science as a career). When I was interviewing with my future-supervisor over the summer, she and I spoke about what being on the Data and Analytics team meant, their workflows, in-house tools, languages, databases, etc. It went pretty great, and I was excited to finally have an internship that was both technically-demanding (writing code in python, using pandas, general data analysis) and relevant to my career-interests (data science).

That said, I started my first day this past Friday, the 11th of September. I go to school in NYC (and it's Friday) so there was an especially lazy/somber feel in the air. I was looking forward to having a one-on-one with my supervisor to discuss what projects I might be able to take on this semester that would both **contribute to the greater organization** and **develop my technical skills**, but that meeting never came. For the ~7 hours or so that I was there, I did some trivial data-confirmation and entry within Google Sheets and set up my work laptop's PostgreSQL configs. From what I understand, my supervisor had a meeting with the CEO and The Powers That Be, so she was out for the last hour and a half of my first day.

Which brings me to the title: **How should I go about setting expectations for myself at this new position?** Furthermore:

* Is it normal to have a slow first day/week at a new internship/job? (If so, how'd things pick up?)
* How should I go about offering/self-initiating projects? I figure that anything to streamline the data team's general processes would be welcome, but I also want to be sure that the skills/tools/methodologies I pick up will be relevant and transferrable to future internships.

Any other general advice (coming from those who have been/hosted interns) on how to really stand out as an intern is very welcome! Thanks!"
3ksyos,22,2015-09-13,Undergrad considering applying to graduate school,CouldYouBelieve,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/3ksyos/undergrad_considering_applying_to_graduate_school/,"I just finished third year of an undergraduate computer engineering program. I'm currently doing a one year internship, after which I will return to school to finish my undergraduate degree. Many of my colleagues (undergrads themselves) and some job interviewers have told me to consider attending graduate school, and I need to decide soon so that I can take the GRE, complete applications, etc.

On one hand, I do feel that I haven't learned enough in undergrad to satiate my personal hunger for knowledge or to be useful to any of the companies I'd like to work for. A course-based master's degree is an option, but I don't think it's as valuable as a research-based master's degree for personal growth, and making yourself look good in the eyes of prospective employers.


On the other hand, I have no research experience whatsoever. Those who recommended that I consider attending graduate school have done so based only on my transcript. Not only does this weaken my application, but it also makes it difficult for me to evaluate whether or not I have the aptitude for a research-based master's and whether I'll get what I'm looking for out of it. I think I have done well in undergrad because of the relatively rigid structure: take these courses, read these books, pass these exams. But graduate school is nothing like that, so I'm unsure whether it is right for me.

To top it all off, I don't know any of my former professors well enough to ask for a letter of reference. Some know me as that kid that did well in their class, but that's it.

**TL;DR: I just finished third year of undergrad computer engineering. I want to keep learning after undergrad. I have a good transcript, no research experience and I don't know any of my professors well enough to ask for a reference letter.**

Is it worth it for me to apply to graduate school? How can I, at this stage of undergrad, get some research experience (hopefully a recommendation in the process) and/or more information on whether or not grad school is right for me and whether I have what it takes to succeed in grad school?

I'm currently a second year computer science and software engineering double major. My university has their career fair coming up where we have about 290 companies that will be on campus looking for interns and full time hires. Basically, if they like you they will call you that night and interview you the very next morning. I am super nervous for this. My resume is ready to go so I am confident in that regard, but I am unsure of how to approach the employers. They all stand at a booth and usually there is a line to talk to them. Basically, can you guys give me some advice on what to say once I get to speak to them? Do I just introduce my name and then tell them I'm looking for a CS related internship or do I give an elevator pitch of myself? Any advice and guidance will be super helpful!

 Thanks :)"

How do I explain this to future employers?,TangerineX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ku9k5/didnt_get_a_return_offer_for_full_time_after_my/,"I finished a software engineering internship at Facebook but did not get a return offer. This is due to plenty of factors, mainly due to the fact that this was my first internship in industry and had very little practical coding skills. Coupled with the fact that my manager wasn't able to really mentor me much, I didn't perform/grow enough to get an return offer for full time. 

I'm quite greatful for my internship and felt that I really learned a lot from it. I know exactly what to do if I were to have another internship. However, I will be applying for full time positions after I graduate this year. I'm afraid of me not being able to obtain an internship as a sign of incompetence. How should I explain this to future employers, if I am asked ""why"" I didn't get a return offer?"

I started out really enjoying the program and the stuff I learn and I still do. On the internships side, I've gotten less and less passionate about any of the work I do. While looking for full-time employment, I've received a really good offer from a company I interned at before. A good % of the compensation is in equity though, so I'm kind of worried about whether or not I'm evaluating it correctly. I'm also looking for other full-time work too so there are more choices. But while doing this, I'm just constantly dreading the fact that I now have to do this work full-time. I'm no longer really enjoying the work that I do, and I don't feel motivated anymore. There are small moments here and there where I get excited about some small piece of a project that was really elegant or cool, but that's it. And now I see that these offers are going to tie me up for the next 4 years. 3-4 month internships I could always get over the bored feeling since I knew it would end fairly soon, but something 4-6 times as long, I'm not sure if I can last it. Has anyone experienced anything similar?"
3kuosm,201,2015-09-13,"Senior year university student, I feel like it was all a sham. I'm kind of having a breakdown. Can we have a conversation about the value of school?",Ntopper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3kuosm/senior_year_university_student_i_feel_like_it_was/,"So I started working on a CS degree about 4 years ago, I was 21. I just assumed that is what you did if you wanted to get into the field and become an SDE. I learned the fundamentals of programming on my own while I was in community college doing all the engineering math/science pre-reqs. I was keeping a 3.8 or so GPA and I felt like I was working towards getting into my university, where I would be taught some profound secret about how to be a real software engineer.     
    
In that time, I learned a few languages, a few web frameworks, learned my way around linux, did some neat arduino projects, apps, and just became the guy my classmates come to when they are stuck. I'm not going to say I'm self taught, because that takes away too much credit from the people who put resources on the internet. But I will say I'm not school-taught.     
     
I finally finished my two years of learning Calculus and got into my university. I immediately started doing research, ended up with a paid position in a lab, and was successful. I also started getting involved with the info-sec club because I started to notice that I wasn't going to learn anything about security unless I went out of my way to. Meanwhile, I was forced to take intro programming courses with kids who just graduated highschool and knew literally nothing. I just stuck with it thinking soon I will get into the 3000 lvl courses and I will suddenly understand why I had to study calculus, physics, and chemistry.    
    
Then I had to learn a foreign language, learned about sustainable farming, some sort of music appreciation thing, bla bla bla, all out of my loans and measly scholarships leftover from high school. I won't say none of that stuff was interesting, but I will say it a lot of time took away from my research and personal projects. And my GPA started falling off.     
    
Then I finally got into my real classes. I thought I was going to be taught about data structures and algorithms. Bullshit. In the high-level classes, I wasn't taught anything. I was assigned projects, and administered exams. The rest is up to me. Just like how it has always been. Do I think knowledge of discrete math/algo/data-structures is useful? Absolutely. But did I need 2 years of calculus to be able to understand what an AVL tree is? No. Did I need the professor to understand what an AVL tree is? Not at all.       
    
Sure, this made me slightly better at tricky technical interviews, but I now understand that at the time I didn't even know what software engineering was.     
    
But were the  Here is a list of phrases I had never even heard come from the mouth of any instructor in my life:   
    
* unit testing 
* source control
* agile/scrum
* code review
* security
* dependency
* api   
The list goes on and on and on.     
     
As I learned these concepts through personal projects and internships, I started to realize something. Universities do not produce software engineers. They produce *computer scientists*,  I.E. mathematicians. This is because **we pretend that universities serve some function besides preparing skilled workers to enter their prospective industries,** despite the fact that society pressures us to not even attempt to enter any technical field without first acquiring one of these mathematics degrees, along with the massive debt that comes along with it.   
    
Lectures are an archaic ritual, as there are far better ways to learn that attending the professor's sermon. Exams only evaluate the students ability to take exams. Projects could be valuable, but in my experience they have just been batch-compiled and ran, only checking for correct output. That last point lead to a lot of frustration, I knew I was programming *right*, but I had no way to know if I was programming *well*.     
    
Before, I just thought that I was too naive to know what is best for me, and I should just keep digging deeper into debt paying for math and science courses, because the powers that be know what I need to be a real engineer. Now that I have earned a full-time job offer ready for me after graduation, (which I attribute to skills learned outside of my studies), I feel confident in myself, and I feel qualified to really look at the establishment and see what is wrong.     
     
* Universities are a social barrier-for-entry for technical industries, and they exploit the taboo of the ""uneducated worker"" to the maximum    
* Universities use this taboo to circumvent the ""consumer/producer"" relationship that the rest of our society abides by, this taking an authority position over the students, who are the ones paying for the ""service"". Teachers are sadists who are paid, students are macisists who pay. 
* Universities operate as for-profit institution,  and ensure the students must invest 5 years of tuition in order to graduate. 
* Loans create an infinite pool of money, and the universities can increase tuition every year without consequence.    
* Universities are too large to change their curriculum quickly enough to respond to changes in the industry. 
* I feel like if a less wealthy nation (say India or China) were to treat software development as a vocation and not a science, the american worker would eventually become obsolete.    
    
**My situation right now**    
It feels like there are these old men (my professors) and they are trying to consume as much of my time as they can, just because. I feel taken advantage of. My head is spinning, I can't deal with it anymore. Iv'e dabbled as an artist, iv'e earned money as an engineer, I know what it feels like when my effort is going towards something that is creating value.     
    
I have several professors who take a great deal of pride in the fact that their courses are ""time intensive"". I am supposed to follow 8 incoherent pages of instructions on how to simulate a simple digital logic circuit, (Y = A * /B + /C) turn in my simulation, then go to a lab and make the circuit I simulated on a breadboard, to prove that I can make the circuit I simulated on a breadboard. In other words, I need to prove that I devoted time to this class. It is not challenging, it is not interesting, it just costs time. It is an exercise in following instructions.         
    
I can't do it, I can't put effort into something that yields no fruit. I can't take it anymore, I can't care even when I try. It hurts. I feel like I am just part of a system draining my of my time and my money. And I have had almost no time to work on my research projects, which I have actual motivation AND obligation to do.     
     
I feel the same way about my coursework right now as I do about eating or exercising when I am having a depressive episode. It is overwhelming.    
    
**My One Single Software Engineering Course**    
I do have one single software engineering course. It is called ""*Intro* to software engineering"" despite being a senior lever course, and the only software engineering course available. Let me explain how that is going.     
    
* Our class is sectioned off into groups of 6.
* Each group of 6 is given a web-app project from a local startup who doesn't want to hire real devs   
* Groups were balanced for skill. I am our groups ringer, and our scrum master:   
    * I am the only one who knows git
    * I am the only one with web-dev experence
    * I'm sure the other members are great students, but if they followed the curriculum to the T, there is no reason they should have any experience with these concepts.  
    
So this is my role in this course:    
   
* I pay tuition
* I produce a ship-able project for some start up, for free
* I fend off bad code that is being checked-into a public repo that I own, which recruiters will see (when I look for competitive offers) 
* I teach 5 students the skills that I thought someone was going to teach me when I started 4 years ago.     
* Yet it feels like I spent the last 4 years working towards this one course   
    
I'll admit that I derive some satisfaction from the creative process, and that I enjoy teaching my peers. But in principal, I feel taken advantage of. This is just re-enforcing all the feelings iv'e been having and sending me deeper into this dark place where I just can't function.     
     
**Do I just drop out?**    
I got my first job offer, and at the end of the month I'll be meeting with a bunch of recruiters, and will have a job locked down within a month or two.    
    
I can't see myself moving forward without counseling. Tomorrow I'm going to my school's mental health resource center and talking to them about things, but they are probably just going to tell me to drop my research or something that I value more than classes. I may even go to the disability resource center, sence what I'm feeling probably has a lot to do with my major depression, which is covered under the ADA. But I can't even think of what the best-case scenario would be in that situation.   
   
**Are my feelings valid?**    
People get uncomfortable when I bring this sort of thing up, and sometimes I'm even afraid to talk about it around people in academia. But it's getting to the point where it's not just an opinion anymore, it is actually an emotional crisis that I am having. I don't even know what I want besides more control over the next year of my life. Are there other people who feel this way?"

A quick back-story:

I'm twenty two years old, and I live in Michigan. It's taken me quite a while to decide over the years on what I want to pick for a career path, but I've finally decided on computer programming. I started programming way back when I was about thirteen years old or so. During those times I looked at computer programming as more of a hobby, such as making websites for video games, and creating scripts for games such as GTA: San Andreas (SA-MP). Now as I've grown up, I've realized that this is my passion and I want to make a career out of it.

I've never gone to school for it, but I've began trying to learn through online sources. To be specific, my focus is C# / ASP.NET. I've been using LearnVisualStudio.net as of lately to help with learning the language.

I know a few people in the field and I've tried contacting them on advice of how I could ""get my foot in the door"" in the IT field, and really have received nothing. The first person I asked told me that they could possibly get me an internship, but that didn't end up happening. And the other person I asked decided to just not contact me back. 

I've searched around Craigslist for possible internships and have found nothing. And everything I have found requires a degree, in which I don't obviously have. So I would love any and all advice from you guys. What should I do? Should I go back to school and work towards a degree? Should I just get certified? What should I do? I have such a huge passion for this and I feel like I'm at a loss right now.

Thanks guys!

I'm a senior in college. This past year, me and a girl in my close knit friend group dated. Things were kind of volatile throughout the entire relationship. We had our fair share of knock-down; drag-out fights, but overall, things were really good.

Over the summer, she made plans to visit me and spend a long weekend at my internship. One night about halfway through the weekend, I say something she doesn't like and she breaks up with me. It was extremely sudden and a huge overreaction. In any case, she cuts the weekend short and we barely talk after. To me, this was whatever. The few times we did talk after the breakup, it usually resulted in me feeling really down about myself or angry at her or the world. The lack of talking ended up just let me heal and forget about those feelings.

Fast forward to the school year and she still isn't talking to me. Having dated her for almost a year, I know her little quirks, and I can tell when she's being genuine and not. Ever since we've gotten back, she's consistently brought things up in conversation out of context specifically to poke at me emotionally (like talking about the boys she's fooling around with or about how she is happier than she's ever been in the past year). We share almost the exact same friend group, so I can't just avoid her, but she does a much better job at not showing that she is (or not being) as upset as I am about it. 

I don't want to care about her any more. Even if she were to ask me back, I wouldn't do it. I have no interest in dating her or even caring for her. I don't want to even deal with feeling like this anymore; I just want to move on. I want to be able to let myself feel emotion or be intimate with other people, but I just don't know how to get past her when I can't avoid her and she intentionally takes those jabs at me.

I am from the midwest and I moved to California for college. I go to UC Davis and study Computer Science (graduating next year). I've interned every summer since freshman year.

Anyway, I absolutely loved my last internship. It was for a company in San Jose (rather small company) but the work was very interesting and I actually looked forward to going to work everyday. Glassdoor said the average software engineer makes $105k/yr at this company with the lowest ever being $85k/yr. They just gave me an offer for next year for $80k/yr with $5k signing bonus and no stock (company is private). I have 2 months before the offer deadline.

Anyway, what should I do about this? I really loved this company and would love to work for them for $90k/yr or higher but it would be difficult to live on $80k/yr in the Bay Area, especially since I would have to live alone or find housemates (parents are back in the midwest). I tried to negotiate but the company refused to budge. Almost everyone at my job has a PhD in EE or CompE so maybe that is why they are lowballing me?

So I have a few options here. I could accept the offer and try and find another job while living on $80k/yr for a few months or however long it takes me to find a job. I could decline the offer and keep trying to find better jobs.

What do you guys think I should do in a scenario such as this? This company has been amazing to me so far. All the employees are very nice, the work is interesting, and our customers love our product. A lot of the guys here have been here 15+ years and love it. The company has never had any financial trouble and has never had any layoffs at all. We have no competitors and our sales have been going up quite extensively the past 10 years or so. But damn... I was really hoping for a better offer."

Should I.. if offered the job.. ask for let's say.. 50/hr.. or is that ridiculously high and will make them think I'm conceited. or should I start at the price I think I'm probably worth.. but would that end up in me getting less than that?

3kw1ak,5,2015-09-14,How to come up with ideas consistently?,experiment00,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/3kw1ak/how_to_come_up_with_ideas_consistently/,"For some of us, it is difficult to come up with ideas. To excel in the current world which puts a premium to ideas, it would be disadvantageous to lack ideas.

Those who have ideas are the drivers of the world while those who don't have ideas are the passengers, forever dependent on others to bring them somewhere.

In this post, we'll look at the following:

1. Why is it important to come up with ideas?
2. What causes this problem in the first place?
3. One exercise that can help us come up with more ideas.

&amp;nbsp;

**WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE IDEAS?**

Idea is one of the currencies of life. They are the sparks that move the world forward. If we do not ignite any sparks, we are going to receive nothing from the world.

We feed the world ideas, the world likes them, and it will reward us.

&gt; The first thing about being a beginner at forming ideas is noting the importance of quantity over quality.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thomas A. Edison

The above quote encapsulates everything about generating ideas. Most of the ideas you thought of are going to be crappy and repetitive. The great thing is a few of them will shine brighter than the others. Simply put: if you find it difficult to generate ideas, great ideas will find it difficult to meet you.

&amp;nbsp;

**WHY CAN'T WE GENERATE IDEAS WHEN NEEDED?**

Below are the possible reasons:

***Lack confidence***

I lack confidence. Yet, I've improved myself as I got older. As I got more confident, I can come up with more ideas.

Why is this so?

Remember that idea generation is all about the quantity. If we are not confident, we probably can't generate even one. Try to observe strongly opinionated people. I had always thought that they are opinionated because they are smarter than me. Not shockingly, they are not. They are able to come up with a lot of opinions because they know they can.

I believe we all can too.

***Not enough practice***

Generating ideas like any other skills require practice. If we don't practice, how do we expect to generate ideas when needed?

***Perfectionism***

Generating ideas is all about quantity. Once we have the quantity, we can move on to quality. Some people, like me, are perfectionist. In Idea World, perfection is a villain. This is because we always expect our ideas to be perfect, which is virtually impossible even for those who are expert at producing ideas.

Ideas are synonymous to possibilities. Whereas perfectionism is geared towards the absolute, and that goes against possibilities.

***Thinking that life's rules can't be broken***

Imagine someone asking us the question ""How can a person become a doctor?""

It is easy to say ""Of course, medical school!""

Sure, medical school is one way but is it the only way? Get back to the basics - how does one become an expert on anything?

If someone were to grasp the basics of medical science and apply it in clinical situations, he is still a doctor even if he did not go to medical school. Of course, that 'doctor' will not be recognised by the current healthcare system, but he is still a doctor by the virtue of his ability to heal.

To break the ""there's no other way"" mindset, always recognise the limits producing the mindset. We do not want to limit ourselves when we generate ideas. Limits contradicts the first principle of idea generation - possibilities.

***Caveat:***

""How can I make money without spending anything?""

There is a limit right here: no money. Now does it contradict the principles of idea generation?

No.

That limit is actually an anti-limit. An anti-limit fights against the true limit, which is ""you need to have money if you want to make more money.""

Note: possibilities.

&amp;nbsp;

**ONE THING WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO GENERATE IDEAS**

I stole this one from [James Altucher](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/)*.

It's called the Idea List. By making the list consistently, we will strengthen our ability to come up with ideas.

Here's the basics:

1. Identify the issue.
1. Phrase them as questions using the Rule of 10** (or any number above that). For example, ""What 10 articles should I write next?"", ""What are 10 things I can think of regarding abortion?"", and ""What are the 10 ways I can become a good writer?""
1. Fill the list with whatever you can think of. No holds barred
1. Do this at least once daily. Plus, do them whenever you're stuck.

Below are two tips that helps to improve the use of the Idea List:

**Note pad**

Carry a small note pad. Physical or digital - pick whatever is most comfortable. Whenever you're stuck, take out the note pad and do a flash Idea List.

**Handling certain situations**

Don't feel bad if you are unable to do an Idea List in certain situations. In my medical school, I have hospital sessions where I need to meet patients while being accompanied by an intern or resident. They will always ask questions to me or anyone in my group  and it is difficult to churn out ideas at times like that. It is impractical to write down an Idea List in that kind of situation because I have about 15-30 seconds to think before the tutors caught on that I am a doofus.

Here's a solution: Focus on quickly generating an idea and just blurt it out. We tend to filter our first thought when we're uncertain. It's good to do that but too much filtering means we don't give enough trust to our first thought, which can be true at times. The only way we can know if it's right or wrong is to try it out. If it's wrong, learn from that.

Note that if the situation is more knowledge-based and no amount of common sense or thinking can help us get the answer, it's okay to say ""I don't know"". Always judge the situation you're in and answer accordingly.

&amp;nbsp;

****RECAP****

Ideas are important. If we have difficulty generating tons of them, we'll find it difficult to improve ourself.
Focus on quantity first, quality second.
Know the reasons why we can't generate ideas. Maybe it's because we lack confidence or experience.
Make an Idea List every day. Also use them whenever we're stuck.
Thanks for reading.

&gt; Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. We’d run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-tow minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a-half minutes per mile].
&gt; 
&gt; So this morning he said to me “We’re going to go five.”
&gt; 
&gt; I said, “Bruce, I can’t go five. I’m a helluva lot older than you are, and I can’t do five.”
&gt; 
&gt; He said, “When we get to three, we’ll shift gears and it’s only two more and you’ll do it.”
&gt; 
&gt; I said “Okay, hell, I’ll go for it.”
&gt; 
&gt; So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and I’m okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m tired, my heart’s pounding, I can’t go any more and so I say to him, “Bruce if I run any more,” — and we’re still running — “if I run any more I’m liable to have a heart attack and die.” He said, “Then die.” It made me so mad that I went the full five miles.
&gt; 
&gt; Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, “Why did you say that?” He said, “Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it’ll spread over into the rest of your life. It’ll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.

After doing 3 years of computer science in college first and realizing I still don't know shit in the grand scheme of things I want to know the things I should teach myself that I won't learn through my degree. 

I know I need to learn things on my own. I didn't do that in college because I was very naive about school. I thought they would teach me what I needed to know. I still have 3 years until I graduate so I do have time to learn and to get internships. I also am working on my portfolio and learning how to code better through games (I learnt more about C++ through one very small game than a whole semester of a C++ class).

I'm not saying school is completely useless, but I want to be prepared as much as possible.I hope that right now I would be good enough for an internship but I really don't know if I am. My biggest worry is that I won't be ready when I graduate.

What are things I should learn that would impress employers (whether I worked in games or a big 4 company) and that would put me ahead of other candidates?"

My experience so far has taught me to be a pretty decent tier 1 help desk tech.  I want to pursue the sys admin route.  The best way to do this is work my way through the trenches of help desk, and ascend to the pantheon of Sys Admin.  I have the blessing of a great sys admin who is willing to train me.  As a young padawan in IT what is a good curriculum? I am studying Net+/Security+ but these teach me a lot about how things work, not actually how to do anything. 

So here is what I know how to do:
-Password Resets
-Many Email related tasks
-Set up RDP connections
-Manage basic AD stuff (ou's, groups, etc)
-set up network/local printers
-Basic pc/laptop set ups
-Configure backups (NAS)

Family holding me back.,mkanan113,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3kwova/top_of_my_cs_class_no_internships_family_holding/,"Hey, currently a Junior majoring in CS. I would say I'm at the top 5(probably #1) in my CS class. I've participated in programming contests that involved every university around the east coast. Participated in research interns with professors. Tutored the freshman and sophomore programming classes(while I was a freshman). 

Have a 3.8 GPA.

But no actual internships. Why? You may ask. Well my family owns a couple businesses here in my city. So in forced to help out after school. 

Tried to persuade my father to let me do an internship over the summer but he refused because summer time is one of our busiest seasons at our stores. 

I keep mentioning all the money I could make if I focus more on programming and software development... He always brushes it off saying ""You can make twice that working with me"". 


I just don't know what to do... I want to quit working but I can't. It's a family business. 

What should I do?"

I just thought I'd write in a post for anyone who is stuck in a job that they don't like but are too afraid to get out. This short story focusing on my experience should give hope to the one's who wanna do something they like but don't know how to go about it. 

I went to law school in India, but by the time I reached my 3rd year of school, and 2 corporate internships later, I just knew that the legal field wasn't for me, but having already finished 3 years of the 5 year course, I decided to stay in and get the degree. My last two years, I started a small business (e-com) selling bar and party accessories. It did fairly well till we graduated (May this year) but wasn't something I could blow up in the future considering the very niche market in this side of the world. 

Lack of options, and having no clue what interested me, I ended up starting to train at a law firm after I graduated (July this year). The moment I'd enter the work place, I'd be looking at the clock and waiting curiously for the day to end so I could leave my boring desk and paper work. I wouldn't get into the details of it, but long story cut short; I found it boring, and wasn't happy doing it. I need to be happy in order to be productive, and that kinda work never made me happy. I wanted a job where (a) I wouldn't have to sit on a desk all day (b) Had less paper work (c) Work should be something that aligns with my interest. But with a law degree, and no full time experience, I couldn't see myself getting job in some place else. I was confused af, and didn't know what to do, but I didn't give up, and knew something would work out. 

I always had an interest in fashion (menswear) and would research + read about the industry in my free time, and followed this all through my 5 years at law school (in India, law degree = 5 years straight after high school). I knew I wanted to get into this industry, but with a legal background and no full time work experience, I was quite hopeless, but well, I did not give up and knew something would eventually workout. 

I was always very fascinated by raw denim and ivy style, and my research led me to a brand called [KORRA](http://www.korra.in) ; an Indian Startup that made raw denim selvedge jeans with organic raw materials and used a single tailor to make the product from start to finish as opposed to being made in an assembly line. Having bought into the concept, I ordered a pair, and fortunately, I did NOT fit me (you must be wondering why I am happy about that) and this led me to a job that I wanted. How? Well read on - 

I contacted the owner since the jeans didn't fit me, and he requested me to send it back, but I decided to drop in to get them repaired fast. Beginning August I went to their workshop cum office, and the owner and I started chatting up while my jeans were getting fixed. We ended up speaking for about 3-4 hours. I discussed a lot of ideas with him, shared my interest in raw denim and startups (remember I had a little experience of running an e-com store). I told him about a lot of ideas and shared some strategies that, in my opinion, would help the brand grow. I sold my self, and showed I would be adding value. We spoke for quite sometime, and by the end of the conversation, he asked me whether I wanted to join them in the future? I was like 'What?!'

2 more meetings and 3 weeks later, I joined [KORRA](http://www.korra.in) as a full time employee doing brand management, and product development but I end up doing a bit of everything, like in any other early state startup. 

Some take-aways : 

- You don't need formal education in a specific field to get into it. If you want it bad, you will get it one way or the other. 

- Don't always wait for a job opening in a company you want to join. I ended up joining a company that was not looking to hire, but created a space for my self. 

- Sell your self! If you don't have technical expertise, it doesn't matter. Show people what you are capable of and how you can help, and don't give up or feel shy. 

I, right now, earn half of what I would make in a legal career (although I hope that increases soon), but I like my work a lot more, and am happy going to work everyday. In terms of experience, my salary = Million $. This would be the perfect to start to have something of my own in the future. 

So for all the folks out there who don't like what they are doing, I'd like to only say that STOP, and START figuring out NOW. It isn't rocket science, and all you gotta do is figure out your interest, and sell your self. 

I'll be here for a while answering any question(s) that some of you might have :) "

3ky32a,2,2015-09-14,Looking for open source experience?,Dunceiam,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/3ky32a/looking_for_open_source_experience/,"Hey guys!

tl;dr I'm looking for a few people who want to get involved in open source. The project in question is a native Python HBase client, where HBase is a distributed database similar to BigTable, Cassandra, etc. Brilliant resume, not to mention personal growth, material.


**-- Background --**

Over my internship with Flipboard I started work on an open source [native Golang HBase client](https://github.com/tsuna/gohbase) under the mentorship of one of the original authors of [asynchbase](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/asynchbase). I took what I learned from that client and started work on my own [native Python HBase client](https://github.com/CurleySamuel/PyBase). That Python client is the subject of this post.


**-- What is it --**

I've provided a detailed description [here](https://github.com/CurleySamuel/PyBase/blob/master/DESIGN.md). See below for the short version.

HBase is a very popular distributed database used by a myriad of companies. On release it was bundled only with a Java client which meant languages operating outside the JVM were screwed. To use HBase from outside the JVM you instead have to go through proxy services (Stargate/Thrift) that effectively double latency and in the case of Stargate, requires additional servers sitting in your cluster. Because of inherent complexity in the client there have only been a few native HBase clients released (notables include Node.js and an asynchronous Java client). I helped write the first native Golang client and I'm writing the first native Python client (here the term 'native' implies that we don't use Thrift under the hood. We communicate natively with every machine in a cluster via sockets). We expect these native clients to be very popular and once stable, used in production systems all over. 


**-- Want to help out? --**

I'm looking for people to help out on the Python client (henceforth referred to as PyBase). You don't need to know anything about HBase, git, databases or distributed systems. I'll effectively act as a mentor and give you crash courses in all of the aforementioned. All I ask is that you have some Python programming experience and are able to soak up large amounts of information :). If you think you might be interested or are on the fence then take a gander at [this design document](https://github.com/CurleySamuel/PyBase/blob/master/DESIGN.md) I wrote up that gives you some insight into the client. Also shoot me a comment/message so I can gauge interest!

If you're interested in distributed systems or parallel programming then this is right up your alley.

Happy to answer any related or unrelated questions!"

I don't really have much good reason to suspect that he's moving on, but I still obsess over it. I love this person in a way that I've never loved anyone else (I've had my share of relationships, but this one is special).

Since I've been 18, I've wanted to help at-risk teens. I'm kind of burnt out on that now as a career path, because I can't seem to qualify for a job that pays more than $12 an hour, and I'm really interested in working in an office with Data Entry / something excel heavy.
The last thing I want to mention is that I can't seem to stick to college. I've tried three times, and I can't seem to do it. So no degree."

So, it was an initial round (i.e my first interview with them) and on top of that, my first ever interview with them. And, long story, short, I got a pretty easy question (i.e. it was pulled straight out of CTCI) but flubbed a bit due to nerves. The interviewer I got was super nice, luckily, and was pretty helpful (i.e. he gave me a tip here or there, some of them didn't help, but i could tell he just didn't want to give me the answer as he shouldn't), but in the end my solution wasn't completely correct (it contained what seemed to be all of the correct answers, but also gave some extra ""incorrect"" stuff).

I guess I'm mainly sad because had I just memorized the answer from CTCI, I would've aced it. The interviewer actually said ""we don't expect you to just memorize the answer, but we can try and work through it"". I had seen the question and done it before in my preparation, but I forgot a few little tidbits that led to my answer not being completely correct. I made sure to explain my thought process to him, and luckily (my main positive IMO) was he saw me kind of ""debug"" everything as we were using coderpad.io and I could use the compiler to test and find my mistakes. He seemed pretty receptive of what I was doing, and said ""good job"" and ""good choice"" now and then when I explained my thought process, but I was just bummed that I couldn't get the completely correct answer in the end.

Do you guys think there's any chance of what I described actually being a ""good"" interview? TL;DR had I just memorized the answer and/or had it on a piece of paper infront of me I could have answered it in like 5 minutes (but I don't cheat and wanted to do it myself, so, obviously, I didn't do that). I'm hoping he either knew that, or saw past it. I think my thought process/problem-solving was pretty good, but my final solution just wasn't 100% right."

I am an undergrad in my final semester and I am interested in applying for grad school. I've been browsing through posts on this subreddit, attended info sessions, and met with a graduate advisor in my school department to accumulate information. 

My B.S. will be in Computer Science and my interests are in computer graphics, computer vision, and simulations (although I'm also interested in many other topics as well). I feel like I've done a fair bit of homework on what my school has to offer but yet I still feel unable to decide on applying and I'm hoping I can get some pointers (no programming pun intended).

I am pretty active on GitHub. I've completed one 10 week internship last Fall at a web dev company (LAMP stack), and I'm currently doing a 25 hour per week internship at a software contracting (unit testing) company. My other options aside from grad school would be the tech industry I suppose. Although I'm kind of not excited about going to work there based on my internship experience. The pay is nice and I've met interesting people, but I hate sitting at a computer all day (I don't mind doing desk work, but I can't stand doing it for 6-8 hours straight working on projects that I frankly don't enjoy at all). I mean I can handle it sometimes but it seems that most software jobs ""pay well"" in exchange for boring, legacy coding (at least that's where I worked at). I also frequent /r/cscareerquestions quite a bit which has given me great insight on the software industry. I guess I'm afraid of working some grunt job on useless legacy code nobody cares about anymore.

I'm also interested in getting involved in something... Maybe Peace Corps? I'm really not sure.

I'm a very shy, introverted person. I've dealt with severe depression since I was about 13-14 (I was admitted into a hospital and diagnosed), and that's one of my major concerns about attending grad school (based on what I've read here and elsewhere). I also think I might have Asperger's syndrome but I've never sought a diagnosis, I thought I should mention it anyway.

I'm also curious how the application process works? My graduate advisor says that I only need 3 professional references (I can skip the GRE since I would be applying at the school I attended for undergraduate) and a statement of purpose (and the application fee). In regards to the quality of my CS department, I think my school is pretty ""average"", meaning its not a Stanford or Waterloo but its a pretty decent state school (last I checked its ranked a bit below UPenn and Penn state which are pretty good STEM schools I think). I'm only familiar with one professor (the computer graphics professor that I took), and I like him a lot. He agreed to meet with me last week but I cancelled the appointment because I said I was no longer thinking of graduate school. He's very nice and he said I can schedule again if I want to.

The last thing I wanted to mention is regarding debt. I'm currently about $13 in debt, which isn't too bad. I live with my mother which sucks but it has helped me save a lot of money. I'm hoping to get a TA/RA position because that would wave the tuition. I was wondering what happens if you don't get the position? I think it would cost me about $20k annually which I cannot afford and I really don't want to take out more loans.

I guess I'm looking to see if anyone else has been in the same boat and how they navigated the journey. "

3l00d9,2,2015-09-14,"Need Advice, Stressing out",nyklyfe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3l00d9/need_advice_stressing_out/,"Hey guys, the CS career fair is coming up soon in my college, and I'm finding myself stressing out like crazy. Just looking for advice from some fellow CS majors. Here's my story basically (sorry for the rant). 

I attended St. Johns University for the first 2 years of college. I originally attended mostly due to financial reasons and proximity to my house; at that point I wasn't quite sure what I really wanted to do. I chose CS right before college started, and my college experience was going great. I had a 3.8 GPA, went to school only around 2-3 days a week, and the commute was only around 20-30 minutes from my house. 

Towards the end of my sophomore year I started to realize how little I was learning from St. Johns. The CS department was very small and wasn't very good at all; I honestly barely learned anything from attending the school for 2 years. My coding skills were pretty mediocre. 

I decided to transfer to Stony Brook University, a college with a much more reputable CS department; one that would actually challenge me and help me learn, and eventually help me land a good career after I graduated. Going to Stony however came with a bunch of other problems: the commute was over an hour long, I would have class 5 days a week, I wasn't even guaranteed into the CS program, and I'd probably have to stay in school an extra year. But in the end, I decided it was the best thing to do to help me learn and secure a good future. I just started Stony this August, and honestly I've already learned so much in just the couple of weeks I've attended.

The problem arises from my personal life however. My father has been diagnosed with ALS over 10 years ago, and ever since, his health has quickly deteriorated. 5 years ago, he was put on life support and now he is paralyzed from the neck down, breathing through a ventilator, bedridden. He can still move his mouth and communicate with us(only because we are used to reading his lips). Long story short, the last 5+ years have been extremely difficult on my family. Taking care of him is a 24/7 thing, its just a constant responsibility. For the last few years, my mother, my brother, and myself have been taking care of him, but this year my brother went away to a top medical school, so the workload has fallen on my mother and myself. Due to this I've really been unable to give any sort of commitment to any job related to my field because I have a ton of responsibility at home, and it's really not plausible to drop all the burden on my mother. The last 2 weeks since school started has already been tough, and adding another job of some sort on top of that would make it just that much harder on my mother, and it just wouldn't be sustainable. Along with all this, I also have to take care of my younger brother who suffers from mild autism and ADHD, among other mental illnesses. 

As of right now, I have very little job experience in the CS field, aside from a job in which I implemented paperless filing systems in a law firm using Excel (not even sure if this is considered CS related) . I also manage my fathers real estate business and worked at a tutorial center, but other than this, I don't really have anything on my resume. I honestly feel trapped because I don't see how I could add any job experience throughout college. Unless I decide to ignore the problems at home and drop all the burden on my mother, I just don't see it as a possibility. 

The only chance I have at getting any job experience at all for college would be this summer; my brother will be home from medical school(the only summer he will be free) and I could actually work a job. I'd love an internship for the summer but I'm just worried that I'm not even going to land an interview due to my crappy resume. I'm pretty good with Java (took a course, and did a ton of self practice this summer- along with what I learned at St. John's ), and I'm currently in the process of learning HTML/CSS, and python. I also just started a VMware course. I'm motivated to learn a lot more, it's just that I wont be able to get the job experience that most of these internships are looking for. If I don't get an internship this summer, I have no idea how I'll graduate with any sort of job experience at all. Will I even get a chance at an interview? I'm desperate at this point, but I have no idea what to do. 

God bless anyone who read this whole thing haha. But any sort of advice would help at this point. Thanks a ton.

I started college and wanted to be a computer science major because ""I spend all my time on computers, why not work with them."" In my first year of CS classes sadly I had a professor for both who basically did not really teach the class anything, and basically handed out As for low effort.

 My second year I went into my first data structures &amp; algorithms course, failed because I didn't even understand how for loops / if statements worked, and felt bad. Considered changing major at this time, ended up thinking I might as well try retaking the class again + take other classes that work towards both computer science as well as another major in case it doesn't work out. Retook the class, something clicked in my head, was able to actually understand some coding and managed to pull an A- in the class. I got a B in my discrete math class, enjoyed the class a lot because it was a type of math that I found a lot more enjoyable, but I guess the grade wasn't superb.

 I am now working on my next set of classes, and I just don't feel like I have the work ethic/drive it takes to be a CS major. I overhear a lot of people talking about the things they do outside of class or the side projects they work on that is related to programming, and just feel depressed. I tried spending my summer doing something productive but I didn't really accomplish much. In school we only learned/used java, over the summer I tried learning C++ and did a bunch of tutorials, made a shitty tic tac toe game, and did like 10-20 or so of Euler's problems (only the beginner ones though) to try and increase my coding skills. I also tried working on some game development software and did a few tutorials to try and learn that as well but...it just really isn't going nowhere. I know some guys who have said they made things with over 15,000 lines of code.... I think I have not ever made anything with more than 500. 

I feel as though I don't have the outside drive/work ethic that everyone in my major seems to be imbued with. Should I keep pushing on in my major, or perhaps considering dropping out/doing something else? I think it is to late to drop the classes I am taking this semester, and if I switch to another major I will probably have to spend an extra year or two. I really don't know what to do at this point. Career fairs are coming up in about a few weeks and so I will have to start applying for my first internships, I guess any advice would be appreciated at this point."

A bit of background:
I'm a 22, soon to be 23M living in Hong Kong, one of the most competitive communities in the world. 
I graduated with a degree in Philosophy (yea yea what would I do for work..etc) and I currently speak 5 languages. Korean, English, Japanese fluently- Mandarin and Cantonese(The local language). 

My family is not well off, financially and physically. I had to work during most summers, tutoring or working translation gigs to earn tuition money (thank the lords my University tuition was not a crazy amount). 
I went for a degree in Philosophy because I didn't know what I wanted a career in, I wanted to be as open minded and a rational thinker as I could be. Thanks to it I was able to gain analytical capabilities.
When I first got interested in the business world, those capabilities and a little bit of self studying helped me gain an internship at a large management consulting firm in Tokyo. Unfortunately, it was the only internship experience I could gain before graduation, as the other summers and winters were spent earning what money I could. But this is where I realized I wanted to be in the business world, creating products or services that I thought would help people live more conveniently. I guess I was very entrepreneurial in that sense.
After graduation I joined a startup firm in the tech field. I did this because I wanted to see how my knowledge in the business field that I attained up till that point would translate in the real world. I wanted to see how my contributions made an actual difference. Interestingly this is where I had a run in with the finance field, and I was open to the idea of a career in it as well.

That's when my dad had a stroke, and I was placed in this position where I should lead my family. I was to be the pillar to my family structure. So I quit my job to look for a job that would pay me well now. 

As I knew it was not during the usual recruitment season, I knew it would be tough but I relied on my linguistic skills and analytical capabilities to help land me a job. That was about 7 months ago.

I've had quite a few interviews, but everyone I've met with wanted more experience from my resume. They all say similar things: that they like who I am, what I can do, but they don't want to be the ones to place a bet and train me. I've come to assume that this means that because of how open I've kept myself for a career in anything and everything, that it's backfired and I look extremely flakey.

I'm becomming more and more desperate as time passes, and I feel trapped.
What should I do? Help!"

Intern is maybe the wrong word but it's the only translation I could think of. In Swedish it's called LIA which translates into learning while working. 

It's a person who is going through some sort of IT education and part of their program is spending time at a real IT-company learning what working means. 

We've had them here before but the only one we ever had focused on Linux was extremely bored with her tasks, cut her time with us short and complained that we didn't give her enough access to systems so she could learn in her own way. 

Obviously we can't give anyone access to systems just like that. 

So I'm looking for things to occupy this person while still giving them enough contact with our systems to be educational. 

One idea that was already thrown at me by someone at the local hackerspace is that they could build a dashboard and setup a monitor at our operational department so they can see alerts. 

Edit: Thanks everyone for your ideas, I will make a plan based on most of them and try to keep the kid occupied for 12 weeks. :)"

Currently I'm doing my CS degree and I'm going into my 2nd year.

**Story:**

I've started a side project a year ago. The intention was to get an internship or a relevant job during studies by this time. However this side project has grown huge and generates a decent amount of traffic. On the other side I try hard to get more experience in a real world company, but we don't have that many IT-companies here (it's a poorer area) and the existing ones don't want to hire (me) at this time.

However I have this crazy idea to monetize my side project and start another one, so by the end of the year I can hopefully have my own little business. 

**My questions are:**

* Can Startups be a substitution for internship / job experience?

* Should I wait with the Startup until I my second side project is running?

* Given that it already takes a lot of my time, how this will affect my studies? 

* I use my GitHub account as ... my GitHub account and therefore a lot of code is not public. Do HR look into GitHub profiles? 3/4 is closed source.

* I lack experience with documentation, unit testing, logging and distributed systems. Do you recommend any books, videos courses or any other material?

Once they took nearly a month to pay me for the photos that they had already printed and ran. I was a little upset about it at the time and I stopped contributing for a while. After a month they got a new editor and asked me to try contributing again (mostly because they desperately need photographers). I decided to give it another shot, literally.

I went to five different events and did a shoot at each one. The one in question here in an event put on by the publisher of the magazine (a relatively local credit union). They called it ""The Leader Bash"" and it was basically a few college kids getting together with free food and music.

The problem here is that they decided to not use any of the photos that I actually took of the event and instead they used photos taken by a cell phone by their marketing interns. However, when they published the issue they put my name on the photos that other people had taken. Without asking me, or bothering to let me know that they were going to do so.

I don't know what to do or if I should even be offended. Honestly I feel a little bit cheated. I mean, sure, I got paid the little bit that they actually pay, but I didn't take the pictures that they used and plastered my name on. I am basically wondering if I should, and if I could take some sort of action against them if they decide to be dicks about it when I talk to them.

I have plenty of evidence that I did not take the pictures by the way, I feel like I should mention that.

My internship is going to end by the end of December and I will probably give back to them the MBP 15 which I grew to love using ...
So I need a substitution for that since my laptop kinda broke months ago. I did some research and XPS 15 comes up as a slight alternative for MBP 15.
What do you think? Which one I should get? Is there any other alternative?

Some desired specs:

- At least 8GB RAM
- i7 processor
- Good/excellent display  
- 15 inch is prefered but 13' is fine too if above specs are satisfied

I will be using the laptop for mainly programming (Android Studio, nodejs, etc) and some multimedia stuffs (unity/UE4/PS)"

Salary Negotiation Help!,CloudsTasteGeometric,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3l3j4y/expecting_to_receive_offer_from_amazing_company/,"Hey all, I'm in the job hunt right now and have some concerns about salary negotiation and my situation - I could really use some advice/a second opinion!

I'm on the job hunt now and the long and short of things is that I am *very* competitive in this job market, receiving lots of calls and awesome interviews after only three weeks (a stark contrast from my last job search). However, I am eating through savings since I recently moved to this better job market and I can't afford not to have a job for more than a couple more months.

I am expecting to receive an offer from an *amazing* company - awesome culture, office, people (a google-tier employer in my industry)...but according to Glassdoor their pay is *garbage* for the positions I'm being considered for. I haven't heard a number from them yet, but the number I'm expecting is $31k.

The going market rate for entry level positions in my industry is $45k (which I made the hourly equivalent of at my last internship).

It appears that there may be some wiggle room, and as you move up the ladder of titles the pay *does* increase - but I am interviewing/being considered for other positions at other companies that I know would be willing to pay as much as $50k for me.

This company is otherwise amazing - it has impressed me enough that I'd be willing to settle for $40k, or even $38k with a signing bonus (keeping in mind that while I'm living on limited savings I do live in a pretty cheap metro area). How would I negotiate up to this when the time comes? Is this number too high in contrast to their expected $31k? I know I'm worth more than that, and I have no shortage of leads and interviews, really - but time is also a factor.

If you have any thoughts I'd really appreciate it! Thanks in advance!"

That went well, they asked me some questions regarding my internship, where I worked with GIS and Python scripting and I knew most of the things they asked me, except a few but they said it was alright.  

So now I have an in-face interview this Friday and wanted to ask you guys what I should study.

They told me at the interview I will have to go through a GIS screening, I guess that means Ill have to sit at a computer and do certain tasks on ArcGIS.

When they were asking me questions on the phone interview, the few things I didnt know very well were:

1. Clip- there is a clip tool in ArcGIS and I just gave them an educated guess.  Im thinking this is something I should brush up on.  Its been a while since I used GIS for anything really.

2. I cant exactly remember what this was, should have written it down but things were moving so quickly and I was a bit flustered.  Based on the name, I guessed that it was something similar in function to a spatial join, and she told me that I was on the right track and they were similar.  I think it started with a D?  If anyone can help me identify this I would be so grateful.

3. The ArcGIS API.  Something on my resume led them to believe that I have used the API, although I haven't.  She said it was ok, it just would have been a plus.

But yea thats about it, everything else I knew, they asked me what the difference between a feature layer and a shape file was, they asked me what a buffer was, they asked me about my experience with Python.  Thats about it and they seemed pleased.
  
Also, how important is model builder?  I have not used it very much to be honest, always just seemed so confusing.  Should I try to brush up on that too?  They didnt mention it at all on the phone, but I guess its always good to be prepared for anything right?

TLDR:  Sorry for the length.  Any tips you may have for me regarding an upcoming GIS Technician job interview, what I should study, brush up on, review so that I can really show my skills, please share.  Thank you.  "

3l4wvw,0,2015-09-16,Embedded Programming: Prospects?,sphotavada,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3l4wvw/embedded_programming_prospects/,"Hello,

I am an aspiring embedded/firmware programmer. Any form of low-level design (drivers, RTOS's, etc.) peaks my curiosity and motivates me to make embedded programming into a career. The idea of making lifeless physical objects functional with lines of code is spectacular in itself -

You get the point. This is what I want to do, and what I want to know every little detail about.

Embedded programming (perhaps due to my short-sightedness?) is rarely spoken about amongst young aspiring developers. There are no books on how to ""Learn ARM assembly in 21 days"" (Lol, I'm not saying there should be, I would never buy that book anyway). CS undergrads buzz about making a million-dollar iOS app, not on how interrupts work. There are few to none internships for embedded programming (I know there are definitely none in my area). Are the salaries embedded developers get even reasonably high? Is it a good career choice? Do the Big 4/5/whatever demand low-level devs?

And finally, ARE there any good books related to the field out there? Excluding the ones that focus on DS/Algo purely, which I know I need to master anyway.

Thank you for reading. Have a nice day!

3l5qih,65,2015-09-16,Starting to think it would be a better idea for me to move back to the USA,HardTarantula,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3l5qih/starting_to_think_it_would_be_a_better_idea_for/,"First off, I got a job opportunity here (while in America) that was supposed to end with my full-time employment after I got my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. I moved to Hamburg. I had a girlfriend living here (yes, admittedly that was part of the reason I wanted to move here.) And I started working and all was fine and dandy after wrestling with the Ausländerbehörde for a temporary work permit here.

Long-story short, the company I'm with actually can't keep me on due to financial constraints and I have to apply for what feels like ten jobs per day before they let me go in a few weeks. I haven't heard back from a single person for the past two-three weeks and I'm already pretty certain that's a bad sign since generally companies will get back to you at least within a week if they are really interested in you.

I am 99% positive I'm going to continue to fail to obtain a job because I am not fluent in German. I can understand the language and write it somewhat and am taking classes to learn it at an accelerated pace, but I honestly think that it will take too long for me to be business-fluent. Were I business-fluent in German, I definitely think my qualities are desirable among employers here since I hear there is a lack of Electrical Engineers in Germany, but sadly I'm pretty damn certain I will get nowhere without that skill.

At the same time I am having a hard time wanting to move back to the US. I really enjoy it here. I've come to really enjoy the culture, I like the people, and have an intense desire to adapt further to the country. My girlfriend is also completely unwilling to immigrate to the US and keeps urging me to apply for jobs here until I land one.

Furthermore, without my job I will have no income and I need to be able to apply for a job-seeking visa which I won't be able to do without showing that I have the necessary funds to support my continued stay here. My girlfriend has offered both getting a new job for her and having her family help support my stay here and I absolutely loathe that idea. I can't stand the idea of taking handouts from my girlfriend or her family while I look for a job when they're already struggling with their own issues. I can't bear the shame of explaining to my own parents that I broke my ass at college for 6 years and went tens of thousands of dollars in debt to get a good education only for me to have to be supported by somebody else. I don't want my girlfriend and her family to pay for me only to waste their time if I can't get a job in the next six months. I sincerely doubt I can hold out for that long either just on my girlfriend and her family's income.

I hate that I haven't adapted fast enough. I already feel shitty when I have to ask someone to speak English to me because I didn't understand what they said in German. I want to adapt. I want to be a good working human being that contributes to society here and adapts to the language and culture. I have done everything I can to research German hiring practices. I have gone to job fairs, I have applied to many different places, I wrote some of my application documents in German. It's not enough. I don't blame anyone for it not being enough, it's literally just the reality. And I'm making everyone I love suffer for it. Why would a company here waste their time breaking their asses trying to get me to integrate with their language and their culture?

tl;dr: I am a fuckup who came here, thought I could get a job after my internship, wasn't able to, and now I'm afraid my girlfriend and her family are going to be ruined financially if they try to support me while I look for a job for the next six months which I'm extremely afraid I won't find because I'm not fluent in German and I don't think I will be fast enough. Also really want to stay with the people here that I love since they don't want to immigrate to the US.



Edit: just want to say thanks to everyone who is responding. I was freaking out a bit yesterday. I'm infinitely grateful to everyone's replies even to those that were more pessimistic about my situation as it is important to have insight from all sides. I got a lot of nice encouraging PM's too.

I am applying to places in Ireland and the UK and also applying to places in other parts of Germany. I'm also applying to some US companies that have offices in Germany. Also looking into classes at Harburg for German in the meantime.

I decided to let my girlfriend and her family support me until December and if I get nothing, I'm heading back to the US and separating from her for hopefully a temporary time. Not an easy decision, but may be better for everyone involved for the time being. I also asked my girlfriend to only speak to me in German for the time being unless it's something she needs me to fully understand better.

I also got PM's from others that will assist me in finding jobs too.

People in this country really are too nice. Makes me want to stay even more. Doesn't surprise me at all that Germany is praised as one of the best countries in the world.

Seriously, thanks everyone! :)"

Option 1: Join 2 very experienced founders in creating an enterprise SaaS as a part time intern. 

Pros:
 
- Learn from them and get to see how they work, as I'm interested in the SaaS space. 

- If we find each other a good fit, they are open to offering me future permanent employment.

- They are very open to invest in teaching me, which I appreciate.

Cons:

- I will be doing front-end, which is not something I am too keen on.

- I may be still be treated as an 'employee' and not learn as much as I want.

Option 2: Join a startup that is currently being in an accelerator as a cofounder

Pros:

- It's more exciting, because I will be actively making decisions, and possibly learn more. I'm also very entrepreneurial-inclined so its an experience that will be good.

- I will be doing backend, which is something I more keen in.

Cons:

- As with all startups, it's most likely to fail. It may just be another crapshoot whereas working with the 2 founders will guarantee me an experience.

This is the same antivirus company that a couple nameless people have also told many of tales to you guys and I figured I would share my forehead smacking.  This company's policy (and really the only reason to buy their software monthly) was if you had our software on your computer and something went wrong, you could call in and we fix it for free if it was something our software was supposed to prevent.

I had taken a Level 3 escalation at the request of a coworker/friend, old lady's computer will shut down after 5-10 minutes of use.  Glancing through the ticket... 3 Level 1 techs have spent a combined total of 2 1/2 hours with the lady before escalating the ticket up to a Level 3 tech who spent another 1 1/2 hours with her before giving her the lame ""Will call customer back, researching issue.""  He has been known to do this and just sit on tickets until the customer gets pissed off and cancels or some one else with a brain (Me) actually fixes the issue.  
So I take the ticket, call the old lady and ask a very simple question.
&gt; Me: ""Maam, have you added anything to the computer before it started shutting off on its own?""  
&gt; Old Lady: ""I added a cover for my computer.""  
&gt; Me: ""What type of cover?""

&gt; Me: ""And does it cover all sides of the computer including the back?""  
&gt; Old Lady: ""Yes, how did you know?""  

At this point it was obvious she was overheating her PC and not one of my coworkers in the 4 hours of talking to this old lady including the level 3 tech the very simple question of finding out what she did to the PC in the first place.  I advised her to never use that cover again and sent the ticket to my supervisor for review and bill the customer for an issue that was not our problem.

I'm about to graduate in December with a degree in computer science from a large university in the southeast. While I don't consider myself an incredible programmer, I've had my share of conventional success through a couple of internships, independent ventures, contract work, etc. I'm currently a full time offer from a very large company that is known for it's short turnover rate, I'm sure you can connect the dots.

I don't want to accept this offer - this role is not what I want to do. While it has good money/prestige, I felt like a zombie after two summers of working on somebody else's project that I don't really care about / will never use.

My main hope is that I'm granted one of the two foreign research/english teaching scholarship grants that I've applied for, and believe I have a solid shot at receiving based on research and my credentials. Both of these, however, are not announced until April-ish and start in July. If I don't receive these, I'm going to pursue some sort of other option along this route, whether it be a less prestigious program abroad or simply using the money I make in the meantime to travel independently for the next 6-9 months. Since I'm potentially going to be out of the country for a year on a grant, I don't want to use the spring semester to travel abroad beforehand. 

My concern is that, regardless of whether I get a grant or not, taking the spring semester off will push me back to at least a year with no solid development experience. I'll be continuing a few side projects and doing the freelance work I currently do, so I won't be completely stale or worried about money, but I likely won't be gaining that much useful development experience. I think I'll be able to find a job afterwards, but probably not a great job that will accelerate my career like this one will.

If I were to take this job, I would leave in June at the earliest and probably December at the latest, meaning I would be staying anywhere from 5 months to a year. Will I be screwing over the company if I come in simply for 5 months? Will they understand that I was given an unique opportunity / scholarship to pursue something worthwhile? I am not interested in returning to the company after, but don't just want to cash in on a short opportunity if it's not the right thing to do or if it will hurt me in the future. 

Sorry for the scattered thoughts - going through a tough time at the moment. I appreciate any feedback. And of course, if anybody has an opportunity or would like some work done early next year, I'm open to new plans."
3l83rv,3,2015-09-16,Where to go from here,Rurik37,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/3l83rv/where_to_go_from_here/,"Hey so I am going into my Junior year as a computer science major at a moderately prestigious university. For the first two years I haven't really programmed outside of the classroom setting, and I feel that my apathy toward both 1. Programming on my own personal projects and 2. Not working towards getting an internship have cost me dearly in terms of atrophied and under developed skills. Im looking to learn some more technologies and take on some personal projects to try and get back into the game so to speak, but am daunted as to where to start.

Things I know ""relatively"" well are Java, C++, C, and Python with basic knowledge of how to use terminal, bash, etc and passing familiarity with git, flask, and other programs. My main questions are then as follows.

1. Would it be better to try and come up with a fairly large project, such as a game or app or something, and continuously work on that to improve my skills or would it be better to try and do smaller contained problems such as those found in cracking the coding interview that focus more on algorithmic skills and approaches to problems as opposed to pure syntactical knowledge.
2. What technologies would be in my best interest to learn (and preferably most interesting) in order to land a junior summer internship at a reasonable tech company. It doesn't need to be google but something would be better than nothing.
3. Any general advice you would give to someone in my position.

Thanks to anyone who is reading this, I realize I dug myself into this rut but there is nothing to it but to do my best to dig myself out. My grades are reasonably good, so I don't think school is my main issue."

I know this isn't what this sub is for but I have no one to speak with at this moment as I hope by the end of this post you will be able to tell me if I need an attorney or not. 

Preface: I also did, my first time ever doing something illegal other than speeding by the way, shoplift from Walmart on May 22nd however I participated in a diversion program and removed that charge ending on August 31st. 

Before story, here is the charge:
""HE DID ON OR ABOUT 08/11/2015 UNLAWFULLY DESTROY PUBLIC PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE (REDACTED) POOL, VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $400.00. IN VIOLATION OF S18.2-138 OF THE 1950 CODE OF VIRGINIA AS AMENDED""

Story: My friends and I frequent a pool in our town. It's a pool where neighborhood residents pay $475 yearly to get access to this pool (I am not a member. Lifeguard A, we shall call John, allows me in for free). We use this pool from opening until August perfectly fine, no troubles. August, lifeguard A is quitting and gives keys to access to the pool out to friends who may have an interest in throwing a party there later. Friends make copies of the pool key and return original key. Lifeguard B (drug addict; frequent user of ketamine, one week before this incident she took 5 xanax pills drove, had a hit and run with a civilian, then hit a police officer with car and hit in face same hour. Pleaded insanity, got away free, she's 17) August 3rd steals MY Rayban Sunglasses, estimated worth of $200. She refuses to admit she stole them, also won't pay me back. Irrelevant, just bringing up context. We decide, in our dumb teenage minds, to get revenge on Lifeguard B by using the key to spray paint the cameras inside the pool guard tower. 

We go in at night, two of us painting (how did I get my dumb ass into painting...,), two watching. We mask ourselves with a shirt on face, and the other with sunglasses and a hat. Walk to pool, spray paint the 6 cameras outside of the pool and use key to open pool. Open room, walk in, paint camera and walk out, close door. We think the paint is on the wall by accident, we go buy matching wall paint color, fix up walls, then lock door and leave. This thirty minute task is the reason I may end up killing myself if I do indeed get charged.

Next day; John last day. We tell about paint, he hardly noticed, laughs, tells LG B about it. John leaves. Three days later, we see cop at pool. Cop talking to B. B tells them it was us, gives out our info. 

We see the cop at the pool because myself and two other friends are taking a walk, but we parked at our friend J's house who lives by the pool. Cops go to J's house, J has to go home and talk to them, we ignore and hide like the babies we are.

2 days later, cop calls me on cell phone. We talk in person 1on1. She says they have evidence of me doing it with my mask on. She says we can either admit and the pool board will discuss a punishment, possibly only banning us from the pool and nothing more, or she will have to make a petition and take us to court. I get scared, I admit I did it. 

3 days later friend who painted has not yet admitted. I tell him to admit and we will have to easier because of what she said. He admits.

2 weeks later, cop calls me and tells me the pool wants to press charges. After this happened I emailed the pool president (on the website) with an email asking for forgiveness and pleading my case, straight A/B student with over 100 hours of voluntary community service, member of multiple volunteer clubs at school, senior in high, and have an internship on capitol hill this year. He says he will get back to me if the board changes their mind or not. 

He never gets back to me. Today, September 16th, I receive a summons for me and my mother to go to court on September 29th.

The charge is ""HE DID ON OR ABOUT 08/11/2015 UNLAWFULLY DESTROY PUBLIC PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE (REDACTED) POOL, VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $400.00. IN VIOLATION OF S18.2-138 OF THE 1950 CODE OF VIRGINIA AS AMENDED"" 

I have asked the pool board several times to make me pay a civil fine (no matter the cost), allow us to do community service, and ban us form the pool (all of the above together) instead of prosecute us yet they have decided to do so. I am honestly scared to death of being charged. I am going to lose everything I have worked so hard for in the past four years for doing one dumb thing. I also am in a political science class internship program at my school where I will be working on Capitol Hill as an intern for a senator (cannot name) however if I am charged this will be cancelled. I won't be able to go to college. I won't be able to get a job. My life will be over.

Is there anyway to not be charged? The court date is on September 29th, very soon from now. Do I need an attorney? I have already told the officer I am guilty, can and should I still plead not guilty? I know what I did was dumb, I regret it more than anything in the world, but I cannot express my regret in this post because I am here for legal help.

Do I need an attorney, can I not be charged, and what will happen to me? I am 17, I live in Fairfax County of Virginia. 

If I get charged I may very likely kill myself, honestly. 
Thanks."

College computer,billybobjoerocks,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3l8p5s/build_complete_my_first_build_college_computer/,"First off, thanks so much to everyone here! You guys (and PCPartPicker) made this process a lot easier than I thought it would be. Overall, I'm super satisfied with how this build turned out.

[Pictures here!](http://imgur.com/a/x1cSP)

For the curious, I bought all this with the money I made during my summer internship! That being said:

* I got the CPU and motherboard as a combo for $400 at my local electronics store
* The two monitors are from my dad's job. He wasn't using them and they were just lying around the house
* Got Windows 10 Education for free from my university
* Mouse was free, got it at some college event
* Keyboard found around the house

The rig works great! I can stream two sports games on one screen while playing GTA V at 60fps on the other, all without the PC breaking a sweat.

**Concluding questions**

* I see a bunch of builds on here lit from the inside and they look awesome. How do people do that? Is it an LED strip or something? What would you guys recommend? I was thinking either red or white lights on the inside.
* The keyboard is fine for my needs (I play games with a PS4 controller), but my wireless mouse is right at the limit of its range and is kinda jumpy sometimes. Do you guys know of any cheap &amp; accurate (probably wired) mouses? I just need a simple, solid, precise mouse that'll last me a long time.

Thanks again! You guys are great.

3l8r8r,8,2015-09-16,Critique my strategy for negotiating an internship conversion offer,l_2_the_n,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3l8r8r/critique_my_strategy_for_negotiating_an/,"Hi everyone. I interned at Google last summer, and I'm about 80% sure I'll get a return offer, and I will almost certainly accept it. But I want to maximize my compensation. I don't have any experience with negotiating, and it seems like negotiating works differently in tech than in other industries. So I want to make sure my approach makes sense. Anything else I should do/not do?

I should get a decision from Google by Oct 9, and have until Nov 30 to accept.

My plan: 

1. Apply to top tech companies like FB, Uber, Twitter, and also other companies with which I have a former relationship. My coworkers said that Google mostly only matches offers from the ""best"" companies. I've been applying since late August. I won't get many/any offers before Oct 9. 
2. If/when I receive Google's offer, if it's not stellar, just say ""I was hoping for a little more X because I have a master's and I will be productive immediately due to my internship."" At this point I won't have many counter offers. Focusing on stock &amp; signing bonus because I heard salary is pretty set-in-stone. (*should I even try this? It seems likely to fail.*)

3. When receiving other companies' offers: If their offer is lower or similar to Google's, say ""That offer is lower than Google's, and plus I would be leaving a known for an unknown. Can you beat Google's by giving me X, Y, Z? Otherwise I will just go to Google."" 

4. After receiving all other offers, compile all the ones that are higher than Google's and ask Google to match/beat, otherwise I will be tempted to leave Google for those better offers. I can't honestly say I *would* go to another company  for higher pay.  (*is it dishonest to omit any competing offers that are lower that Google's?*) 

Thoughts?"

3l9kvs,2,2015-09-17,Undergraduate student from Sydney (Australia) looking for advice for developing my resume and moving into finance!,assetmanagement1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3l9kvs/undergraduate_student_from_sydney_australia/,"Hi everyone,

&amp;nbsp;

I've been a bit lost on what career I want to pursue, and how to pursue it. I think I've found a bit of clarity regarding that: I want to go into Asset Management. As such, any and all comments would be really appreciated on how to best achieve my goals, and whether you think they are realistic or not.

&amp;nbsp;

This will be quite long, as I want anyone who’s willing to give me advice understand my circumstances, and how I got to them. So I’ll break it up thematically into two main sections: University and work-experience. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Unversity**

&amp;nbsp;

- I am currently two years into a 4.5 year degree. I'm doing a Bachelor of Commerce (Liberal Studies) at Sydney University, and majoring in Finance, Economics and Philosophy. This is considered a target University in Australia.

&amp;nbsp;

- I left high school a very strong student academically. I achieved an ATAR of 99.4, with the highest possible mark being 99.95 (it is an indication of the percentage of the state that you placed above. As each individual is a part of the state, it is impossible to beat all of it).

&amp;nbsp;

- At University, I had a very poor first year. This was for a number of reasons, but primarily due to the fact that I missed half a semester due to misadventure within my family, and that my work ethic was particularly poor. My second year marks are far better, and my marks thus far are shown in a table below.

&amp;nbsp;

It should be noted that 0-49 is considered a 'Fail', 50-64 is considered a 'Pass', 65-74 is considered a 'Credit', 75-84 is considered a 'Distinction' and 85-100 is considered a 'High Distinction' at Australian Universities. I have been told that top-tier companies, bulge bracket Investment Banks and the like, won't accept you unless you have a Distinction average, although I have heard of exceptions to this rule if applicants are strong otherwise.

&amp;nbsp;

*Semester One, 2014*

&amp;nbsp;

Subject Name | Mark | Grade | Major
----------------|--------|-------|--------
Reality, Ethics and Beauty | 72 | Credit | Philosophy
Accounting, Business and Society | 78 | Distinction | N/A
Understanding Business | 63 | Pass | Compulsory subject for degree requirements
Economics for Business Decision Making | 72 | Credit | Economics

&amp;nbsp;

*Semester Two, 2014*

Subject Name | Mark | Grade | Major
----------------|--------|-------|--------
Quantitative Business Analysis | 55 | Pass | Economics / Finance
Introductory Macroeconomics | 75 | Distinction | Economics
The Business Environment | 53 | Pass | Compulsory subject for degree requirements
Foundations of Business Law | 71 | Credit | N/A

&amp;nbsp;

*Semester One, 2015*

Subject Name | Mark | Grade | Major
----------------|--------|-------|--------
Corporate Finance I | 75 | Distinction | Finance
Intermediate Microeconomics | 85 | High Distinction | Economics
Business and Economics Statistics B | 66 | Credit | Economics
Psychology 1001 | 68 | Credit | Degree Requirement

&amp;nbsp;

*Semester Two, 2015*

&amp;nbsp;

This is ongoing, but I have dropped down to three subjects this semester. The reason for this is twofold:
1) It gives me more time to focus upon improving my GPA.
2) This will cause me to finish my degree halfway through 2018, as opposed to my original finish date of 2017. As individuals are generally accepted for internships within the Summer holidays leading into their penultimate year, I will technically have two bites of the apple as I should be eligible for internships over the 2016/2017 break, and the 2017/2018 break as well.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently sitting three subjects: Intermediate Macroeconomics, Environmental Economics and Corporate Finance II. I am tracking to get 85 in the first two, and 75 within the last.

&amp;nbsp;

After this Semester, my average should therefore be 71.87, or 72 if rounded upwards. However, my Economics Major average (not including statistical subjects) should be 80.4 and my Finance Major average (not including stats) should be 75.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, looking over my subjects, the three passes really weigh me down. Two of these are in core subjects for my degree, and I can’t stress enough how much of a waste of time these were. They were over intellectualised subjects that covered absolutely every aspect of Business, whilst covering nothing at all. The way in which they were assessed was ludicrous (I could go into it but I won’t bore you) and as such I did pretty poorly. My other pass was for my first statistics subject, and that was in the semester that I missed 6 of 13 weeks of. I came back, having never done statistics before, to a heap of Greek letters and jargon that I had never seen before and honestly, I panicked. This panic trigged my flight or fight response, and I ran like a little bitch and buried my head in the sand. As such, I did very badly. This then carried on to my second stats subject, which I managed a credit in, despite having to learn pretty much the entirety of the 1st course all over again.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, outside of these two core subjects, and my stats subjects, the rest of my marks come from subjects that I did out of interest, or subjects I did to satisfy my degree requirements. So I guess my question is:

&amp;nbsp;

If I continue to perform strongly, how much will my poor performance in these early subjects impair my ability to get internships and future job opportunities? 

&amp;nbsp;

Also, how will my third major of Philosophy look within the job application process? 

&amp;nbsp;

I think it has its merits in the way that it develops critical thinking, and also the way it encourages the clear vocalisation of one’s thoughts (whether this be in writing or out-loud). I further think the type of reflection that you learn in philosophy is extremely healthy, and makes anyone that studies it a more well-rounded individual. I have a friend that works at a bulge-bracket Investment bank, and he said that during the interview process they discussed his second major, Art History, extensively. He believes it set him apart from other candidates, and I was just wondering whether you guys believe that such a major has its merits?

&amp;nbsp;

I had originally planned to do Accounting as my third major, instead of Philosophy, but after several existential crises, I came to the honest conclusion that I didn’t want a future in accounting at all. I also decided that I had been putting too much focus on trying to be employable academically, that I didn’t put enough effort into how employable I was as a person. As such, I’ve really tried to invest time in myself. I’ve started learning German and piano, and have picked up the sport I used to play in high school (Rugby Union). I plan to go on exchange to Berlin next year, to further immerse myself within the language.

&amp;nbsp;

One of Australia’s biggest exports is education, and as such, both our Universities and our job markets are flooded with individuals from a non-English speaking background. I am not exaggerating when I say that 90-95% of my Finance classes at University are comprised of people that cannot hold a conversation in English. I’ve heard, and seen, that the financial industry, for lack of a better term, is a bit of a ‘boys club’ and I was wondering, will all these things set me apart within the application process?

&amp;nbsp;

**Work Experience**

&amp;nbsp;

As a further bit of background on me, I attended one of the elite high schools in Sydney (part of the GPS schools system for those that know it), and as such, networking is something that has been, and will continue to be, quite easy for me.

&amp;nbsp;

Whilst I refuse to apologise for my upbringing, it is something that I have to be honest with myself and others about, and so I feel like it should be stated here. To put it into perspective: I am on a first name basis with a CEO of the Australian arm of an international BB IB.

&amp;nbsp;

Aside from that, the vast majority of my friends fathers are in senior positions in financial firms across the country, and as such, finding work experience hasn't been particularly hard. If I continue to bolster my resume, I should have a foot in the door within the application process at most firms. It sucks that this is possible within the financial field, but I would be a fool not to make the most of it.

&amp;nbsp;

In 2014, my first year of University, one of my friend’s fathers was appointed CEO of a major Australian company. He contacted me and asked me to apply as an intern within the Business Development and Strategy department, and I interned there for a year or so as a result.

&amp;nbsp;

It was unpaid, menial work, and I didn’t particularly enjoy my time, but it gave me a bit of perspective on what I want to, and what I don’t want to, do.

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of my time there, my friend’s father, who owns and runs a (very) boutique IB in Sydney, contacted me and asked whether I would be interested in applying for a position at his company. I did, and I got the position. I’ve been working there since November of last year.

&amp;nbsp;

At this firm, I act as an accountant for a fund that they manage, and do a bit of data analysis on the side. I also value the fund at the end of each month, prepare presentation papers, and sit in on their monthly investment committee meeting, with occasional input when asked. As such, it is largely administrative. I have also done a tiny bit of work for their M&amp;A team, but nothing substantial.

&amp;nbsp;

I understand that these are minor roles, and when they hired me, they did so with the intention that I would stay in the position until I graduated (end of 2018). I love it there, and I love the people, but I feel like the work is very simple and repetitive, and that I need to spread my wings more in order to bolster my resume to secure summer internships. However, it is runned by my friend’s father, and leaving would be quite awkward. Ideally, as I only work there 1-2 days a week on average, I would get another position that I could do alongside it. Whether that is possible remains to be seen.

&amp;nbsp;

I understand fund accountancy is the bottom rung for positions within asset management. What do you guys think? Should I look elsewhere, or will something like this be impressive enough to set me apart from other candidates? If I do carry this job until the end of University, which I currently aim to, I would have had it approximately three and a half years, so I am hoping that in time they trust me with more challenging work.

&amp;nbsp;

**Other Notes**

&amp;nbsp;

- As I am hoping to go into asset management, I feel as if I should think very seriously about obtaining a CFA. Would it look good if I set the first exam within the next few years? If I do, would the work that I am currently doing qualify as part of my four years within the industry?

&amp;nbsp;

- I am looking to get involved with charity organisations and student bodies related to the financial field to bolster my resume (one charitable funds management company is looking for an equity analyst). Are these worth it, and do they set you apart?

&amp;nbsp;

- As another job, I currently work for a tutoring company and I tutor highschool students in maths, English and history. As this is a (somewhat) skilled position, should I include it on my resume whilst applying for jobs?

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion**

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry this has been such a long read, but in summary: I believe that I am an intelligent guy, I am exceptionally driven and ambitious, but in my first two years of University, I have let myself down.

&amp;nbsp;

As such, I am looking for anything that can set me apart from other candidates, and alongside that, general advice from those inside the industry.

&amp;nbsp;

If anyone has any advice or comments, feel free to comment it below. Alongside that, if any readers work within the financial industry within Sydney, feel free to send me a PM. I would love to catch up for coffee to chat about what you do, why you do it and how you got into it. What I want to today as a career is vastly different from what it was a year ago, and it could change again within the next year. I am constantly looking to learn from those with more experience than me.

Thanks in advance. "
3l9nol,89,2015-09-17,Ten Essential Tips for College Students,Nicodemus_Reborn,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3l9nol/ten_essential_tips_for_college_students/,"I've been in college for four years now. In the past four years, I've made my fair share of mistakes, discoveries, and just little tricks that make the whole experience infinitely easier. I figured that I'd post a few of these for everyone's perusal, and hopefully it will help someone out! While I may not post all ten right away, they will be up within the day.

1.) **Textbooks**

*The bane of every poor college student's existence, textbooks are a money vacuum - plain and simple. However, there are so many ways to mitigate the excessive cost of your textbooks.*

*First, while I would never advocate pirating textbooks, I will say that you'd be surprised what a textbook name or author's last name will turn up on the popular torrenting sites. They may be an older edition, but the changes between two editions are usually minimal.*

*Second, your university library is likely to have copies of some textbooks available. If you are the early bird, you may just get the worm in this instance (The worm is the textbooks).*

*Third, you will always find a cheaper place to buy books online. Amazon or various book rental sites will sell them at a fraction of the cost. Online PDF copies of a book are far cheaper than their physical counterparts. For classes that require an access code, always check the website for how much directly buying the code would cost - sometimes these programs come with an ebook included, or will provide an eBook far cheaper than the physical book with the access code.*

*Fourth, if you are willing to take a small risk, and have trustworthy friends in the class, go in half for the book. There's no shame in sharing a textbook, especially when it saves you money.*

*http://gen.lib.rus.ec/ may also help you in your search for textbooks or general knowledge!*

2.) **Professor Picking**

*If your college allows for you to register your own classes, you will often find that the same class is offered by multiple professors. You have resources available to you that are invaluable to this choice. Ratemyprofessor.com will give you a general idea of what the professors are like (if you can wade through the reviews of disgruntled students). Asking around in your major, particularly the older students, is another great way to get some insight into the various professors, their teaching styles, the workload, and how willing they are to work with you. Taking the time to research the 'optimal' instructors will save you a fair amount of aggravation. Every college has 'horror story professors' and you can avoid them if you try, usually.*

3.) **Office Hours**

*Most, if not all, students never visit their professors during office hours. This is a mistake. Aside from earning a few brownie points that you can hopefully use in the event of missing an assignment, professors are happy to help you if you're struggling with the class. For those of you that don't require any help, still go! Professors have spent years networking, and may just be your ticket to an internship or co-op.*

4.) **Keep your old classwork!**

*I have an entire external drive devoted to all my classwork that I've ever done, with folders dedicated to each class. There are often times where your courses subjects may overlap, and you may find answers to current problems hidden amongst previously completed work. Use an online free cloud storage like Dropbox.com or Google Drive to store your work, both old and recent.*

5.) **Find a healthy stress-reliever**

*College may be one of the most stress-inducing times in your life. Without an outlet to release some of this pent-up stress, your health will suffer, and subsequently so will everything you're involved in. Find something you can dedicate an hour every other day to, and do it. For me, it was boxing. Three times a week, I'd go to a gym nearby, and just spend 30 minutes or so unloading my frustrations onto a punching bag. Give something similar a try, whether it be jogging, a martial art, weightlifting, swimming, anything! It will keep you physically healthy, as well as mentally healthy.*

6.) **Procrastination and You**

*If you are anything like me, your biggest enemy will be yourself. Namely, your penchant to procrastinate on assignments until the day they're due. I'm guilty of it, I'm sure most college students are. Heck, I'm procrastinating on an assignment as we speak by writing this post. I'm sure you've heard the spiel about proper time management at some point or another, so I won't even bother. I'll tell you what actually works.*

*Take your books/laptop, only what is absolutely necessary to do your homework, to a quiet location. The library is the obvious choice, but maybe you have somewhere better. Set small goals for yourself, rather than a large one. Stay in the library for 1-3 hours, and tell yourself what you are going to do in that timeframe, and do it. Without your phone or other people to distract you, your productivity will skyrocket. It's far easier to say ""I'll do a page of this essay in the next hour"" than ""I need to do ten pages by Thursday."" Do not allow yourself on social media during this time.*

*I encourage you to make a small investment in a dry-erase board - preferably one with a calendar. It lets you write down everything you have due, the due dates, and it's immensely more satisfying to wipe them off this board as you finish than deleting them from a smartphone list. At least I think so. If your assignments aren't submission-time-restrictive (having to turn something in on a specific day, and no sooner), then as you write your assignments down, shift the due dates back a few days. You'll finish earlier, and it gives you a less wiggle room to procrastinate. If you're like I was freshman year, you'll try finishing (and starting) a paper the night it's due. This way, when you enter panic mode, you'll realize that you aren't as strapped for time as you thought.*

*All in all, procrastination can only be solved by you and your willpower. Removing temptations from the equation, and putting yourself in the proper mindset will help you emerge victorious, but it still boils down to that key battle.*

7.) **Making Friends!**

*I've always found that since I've been in college, my friends have always fallen into one of two categories: academic friends, and activity friends. Sometimes these overlap, but it's the exception and not the rule. The former can help keep you on track, provide a study buddy or a textbook trader/sharer, and (if they're older) give you advice about the major you both have. The latter will keep you sane, and make sure that college doesn't completely send you up the wall.*

*Your college or university will probably have more clubs than you could imagine. These clubs are a great way of meeting other students with similar hobbies, beliefs, and interests. If you're a political person, join the Young Democrats or Young Republicans. If you enjoy gaming, I almost guarantee there is a club associated with video games. Devote some of your free time to attending a few club meetings, and see if you make some new friends!*

*On the other side of the coin, you should try to make a few friends that share the same major as you. These will be the people that you will probably see in the same classes you're taking for the next four-five years. It could be as easy as introducing yourself to the people sitting next to you in class or making friends during a group project. Your major probably has a club or group associated it, and this can be another good place to meet people. These friends will be godsends if you miss a day of class and need notes, need a helpful reminder when something is due, or give you a groupmate that you know.*

*If you feel like making friends with neighbors in your dormitory, try leaving your door open some! You'll be associating with these people in some capacity for at least a semester. If they walk by and see you playing a videogame, you may find a player 2.*

8.) **Your GPA and Scholarships**
 
*I cannot stress this tip enough. If you are a college student and receive almost any type of financial aid - whether it be state/federal grants, scholarships, anything - there is most likely a GPA requirement. Using myself as an example, my scholarship requires I maintain a minimum 3.5 GPA to continue receiving it. It is vital that you find out what these requirements are, memorize them, and understand what that means in terms of your expected academic success.*

*While it is sometimes possible to appeal to the Financial Aid Office if you do not meet these requirements one semester, it's better to avoid the situation all together.*

*So what can you do to salvage, save, or maintain your GPA?*

*Give yourself some ""easy A"" classes. They may not count towards your program. They may not help you meet your upper-level course requirement. They might not even teach you anything. But if your entire college career rides on you maintaining a specific GPA and getting that financial aid, having a small cushion can help. They may cause you to be a bit behind schedule for graduating (most people are anyways, these days), but for institutional scholarships I have found that requesting an extension is far easier than appealing for it to be returned.*

*If it is relatively early in the semester and you find yourself utterly failing a course (sometimes you miss/fail one exam, and that's all it takes. It happens.) look into your university or college's policy on dropping courses. Pertinent information to know is the deadline to do so, the cost of withdrawing from a course, as well as if a ""Withdrawal"" counts against your GPA. You shouldn't do this often, but it is better to withdraw while you can than to ride a rough course until it is too late, and end up with a E, F, U, or even a D in some cases. These grades will not give you 'credit', but will utterly sink your GPA. Be realistic and honest with yourself if you see this happening, and act decisively.*

*To show an example from my personal history, I had managed near-straight A's throughout my first two semesters of college. Due  to a professor's strict attendance policy, I failed one course during that second semester. Fifteen hours each semester, with one E, one B, and eight A's, my end GPA was a 3.5 - nearly losing my scholarship . Do not underestimate how much a bad grade can affect you.*

*In more extreme cases where an entire semester went wrong, you may have the option to declare Academic Bankruptcy. It's a fairly complicated process, and you should really only consider it in the most dire of circumstances (you failed literally everything, or almost did). It basically invalidates a whole semester of your college work. It will not count against (or for) your GPA, you will not receive credit for the classes you passed, and a note will be made on your official transcript noting that you have done so. It's a double-edged sword, so be cautious.*

**For the last two cases, remember to discuss these options with your academic advisor or financial aid advisor, to ensure that there are no complications or hidden drawbacks.**

9.) **Citations (AKA Satan Incarnate)**

*It may just be me, but I've hated citations since the first essay I had to write in college. APA, MLA, in-text and 'Works Cited'/'Bibliography' pages, they can be infuriating, confusing, time-consuming, and grade-determining. Fortunately for the citation-inept among us, we have the joyous internet and its many resources.*

http://www.easybib.com/ *and* http://www.bibme.org/ *are sites designed for one main purpose - to create your citations for you. Website data can be automatically retrieved for the most part, and you may need to manually enter it in for some other media, but these will provide you with the proper format and even help you make the page itself.*

10.) **The Other Tidbits**

*For things not extensive enough to write a lot about.*

* *Wear flip-flops in the public/community bathrooms. During showers, especially. The germs...eugh.*
* *Your campus most likely has a health clinic. Use this. From counselling services, to STD testing, and everything in-between. Never be embarrassed to go, for any reason. They are professionals, and doctor-patient confidentiality is a thing.*
* *Give online classes a chance, especially if you find yourself struggling to attend the face-to-face classes.*
* *Learn how to do the FAFSA yourself, if you need it.*
* *Meal plans may be a requirement for your school. They are generally not cost-effective, and mostly encourage unhealthy eating. Reducing your meal plan or eliminating it gives you a chance to learn how to budget your own food, how to cook, and may just save you a fair bit of dough (ha, ha)*
* *Online classes + PDF textbooks can be an...interesting...combination when it comes time to take quizzes or do homework. If your morals are slightly malleable, CTRL + F on the book and keywords from the questions might just help your GPA.*
* *Seriously, invest in a dry-erase board.*
* *Sync your school email to your phone/tablet/everything. Last-minute updates can happen, and let's be honest...you will check it more this way.*
* *Backup all your important class files. Twice. Immediately. Google offers free Cloud storage, and flash drives are inexpensive (and probably offered for free somewhere at your college). We've reached a point where ""my computer crashed"" is no longer a viable excuse to most professors.*
* *Beware of energy drinks. All-night study sessions and energy drinks are a tempting combination, but will seriously hurt your health in the long run.*
* *Try to acquire a credit card. If there are banks near the college (or affiliated with them), they may have cards specifically for college students. Now is the time you want to start building your credit.*

I was the new guy doing a internship.  The power fault would happen every weekday around 730 and had gone on for years. Lasting about 10 to 15 mins.  My boss got the bright idea of having me handle one of these for the first time. So I arrived early like a good eager beaver.  Pulled up the floor tiles leading to the mainframe to the power supply box.  I was getting all set for the power going out when I noticed the maintenance guy coming into the side door with a 220 plug in hand.  

It hit me...  I found the reason for the power loss. I watch in stun expectation of what is sure to be the face palm of the year.  He stops and looks at the floor tiles and me how do I expect him to run the buffer/polisher. I told him we would skip it today. I will just use a dust broom this time.  I replaced the floor tiles did a quick run with the dust mop. Went into the command room my boss is there.  ""Good idea checking the cable runs, also nice of you to do a quick clean up after""  I grab the chair in front of the main terminal and wait. An hour later nothing has happened.  The boss is not an IT guy.  I ask him if anything happens normally that not going on.  He says the only thing is the floor on this level did not get polished.  I go that's it the motor in the floor polisher must not be shielded properly. 
My boss said ""Ok, we try this out.  We have maintenance skip this level for next two weeks.  If it works you and the building supervisor will get bonus checks and both of you are reasonable for punching new equipment that does not cause the computers to crash.'

Next day I report to the building super, I told him the truth.  I don't want this to comedown on him or his employees. So lets get this fixed. We order a 110 volt floor polisher and 4 green outlet childproof plugs.  Once they came in I went through plug in the plastic pieces in outlets not connected to server room.  

At year end we both enjoyed a nice bonus check.   "

I need some advice. 
I'm graduating next month with a BSc in computer science.

The problem is this: I am not confident in my coding skills.

While I studied several languages in uni (java,python,c++,c), I never focused on one language. Also, I have no professional experience (no internships..etc.)

I am currently studying Java at home, and want to find a job involving the language.

Below are some of my current options:  

-Continue to study java at home and build a portfolio of projects, and wait until I become confident in the language before applying for jobs. (how long will that take? will i miss out on jobs?)

-Apply for graduate jobs now. (what level of coding do they expect? maybe I will be trained in the language ?)

-Apply for internships now. (most internships run in the summer time though?)

-Get work experience some other way.

Any advice ?"

I'm a good student, I've TA'd, but I'm not heavily involved in the CS community in my meh, non-target school. I have zero side projects, and most of my extracurricular involvement is in non-CS groups. As for other people's perceptions of me, my non-CS peers see me as a ""geek"", and my CS peers don't.

One time the topic of internships came up and someone told me, ""You only got it because you're a girl and they're trying to increase diversity. A guy with your resume wouldn't have gotten in."" I hadn't thought of it that way, but yes, come to think of it a lot of the interns in my program were girls or guys from minority groups. But we all still had to have a certain level of talent and ability, right? Or did we actually have an advantage because we're girls?

I'm so grateful I got the internship opportunity, but I struggle with the idea that my gender/sex gave me an advantage over other applicants. Does actively increasing diversity reduce quality? I like to think not. I guess what I'm asking, is how do I respond to that? How would *you* respond to that?

I'd like to think I'd could begin working in industry come June when I graduate; I already have a Data Science internship under my belt where I pushed my own code into production and saved my company a good deal of money with some insights I gathered from the data I was playing with, and I have a degree in Math, but then I read the daunting requirements for some of these job postings, and I can't help but feel I am under qualified. I have limited experience with hardcore machine learning which I feel will be held against me, and my statistics background is just at the undergrad level. I do have a good amount of experience in Python and a decent amount with Java, and I have experience with some common tools like Elasticsearch and NoSQL databases, but I haven't done anything with Hadoop or Spark, for example. And don't even get me started on visualizations...

Should I consider higher education if I want to consider this as a career, or will a Bachelor's suffice?

I was in the same situation and took a couple unpaid 3 month internships with startups that ended up being a huge resume booster when talking with mentors/investors for my current startup. I'm sure there are tons of other students who are wanting to pursue entrepreneurship and looking for experience and would take an opportunity like this seriously. Hell...I took my work with startups in college way more seriously than the actual classes I was enrolled in.

I recently attended my university's career fair, and I tried to speak with as many recruiters as I could who were looking for software engineering interns.

I was an intern here last year so I know that not all teams are like this, but I want to know if it's very common at software companies and if it's a decent reason for trying to transfer after only a few months.

I like the projects I've been working on, but the structure and culture of my team is very different from what I'm comfortable with, and it's a major contribution to my stress at work (and I have a condition that makes that a bit of a problem, read my post history if you really want to know.) Most people work on their own features independently, with little collaboration. Of the 5 people I sit close to, there are 2 managers, who aren’t here very often since they have a lot of meetings. The other 3 people that are closer to my level all speak Chinese, and it seems like the only time they speak English at work is when they talk to me or one of the other more senior guys, which isn’t that often. I don’t think I’ve ever had a problem with being around people of different cultures, but I hope you can understand why not hearing a word of your own language for several hours could be stressful.

I thought I would adjust to it after a while but I just keep thinking about how much better my experience was as an intern, and it seems like most of the other people I’ve talked to have a better relationship with their teammates. I try to talk to them when I have a chance, but the language barrier does make it challenging, especially when I hadn’t ever tried to make friends with anyone until about 2 years ago."
3lcm73,1,2015-09-17,"Finishing up my masters, is it too late to find a internship/entry level ?",DoggieEmpress,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3lcm73/finishing_up_my_masters_is_it_too_late_to_find_a/,"Hello new user on this site, I've been lurking for some time but finnaly made an account to ask a question here.


My life story is that I've finished an IT related faculty (Automatics and Industrial Informatics) a few years ago and then tried to find a job in programming.


And to be honest I went to **a lot of interviews** so I managed to pass multiple early scrreenings but I could never go all the way with a firm and get an offer.


As this was going on I decided to enroll in a master to continue my education, but I started going to fewer and fewer interviews and stopped updating my linkeding profile.


Right now I'm working a data entry job I don't like as to support myself (really hoping it's a temporary sittuation), as I finish my thesis and I'm mulling over wether to get back in the game for round two of internship/job hunting.


The thing is I feel I'll look old with a minimum of 2 years older than the current generation of graduates and most people these days start applying for interhsips way earlier so it's 2+ for sure.


The thing is I've heard of people getting into IT at a greater age but they are usually cases like ""I have a Phd and couldn't live off research and teaching"" and not my case that I tried to get into IT at the very start spent a lot of time and then put it on hold.


*So this is why I made this thread to get a honest objective opinion, if as a 26 year old with a related faculty, 2 internships and a job hunt which did not result in a job should try again or should I throw in the towel now that I still have some dignity.*


I say objective because I have a old friend from college who works as a programmer (I have more old colleagues in IT but him and I are closer) and he's allways talking about how I should send my CV to this firm or that or his firm, but he used to say the same thing back then and it didn't work out then so I want a more objective  opinion.


For some additional data about me:

* I'd like to be a dev (not QA or helpdesk that's too close to my job right now)

* I feel like I do my best work when there's a visual aspect to the task so front end (still need to ++ my JS skill) 

* but on interviews I had the best results on languages like Java or SAP 


* and to round it off at my masters I'm mostly doing Matlab."

Hardly anybody seems to care about academics and there isn't much to do outside of the college itself.

I don't feel like I am being challenged in my classes even though I am interested in what I am studying. I hated the winter semester last year because all of my friends go skiing and I hate the snow and the cold, so I am left alone. I've also been thinking about transferring because my school doesn't have exactly what I want academically and I would like better internship opportunities. Even with the clubs I am involved with on campus, I constantly feel bored and like I would rather be somewhere else. Basically I just feel like I picked the wrong school. Does anybody have advice on transferring? Are these good reasons to transfer? How is it making friends as a transfer?"

So I'm currently sitting in the office doing my internship at a company about a 1.5 hour travel commute from home. I just had a question run through my head and asked myself if I was wasting my time being here. 

Don't get me wrong I love web development and have been at it at home for 2 years now and just completed a college diploma in web dev. I know HTML, CSS, PHP &amp; MySQL. Javascript skills are weak but improving. 

Anyway, this is a web design role at fairly new established company. Coming here 1 day a week for 3 months and i currently have 6 weeks left. I don't have any intentions of working here afterwards due to being relocated in 2 months. I thought to myself in the first place that maybe web design will benefit me but really all I'm doing here is just playing around in WordPress. I don't think any of this can be added to my portfolio as it isn't utilizing my own skills. 

My last project that I have done was a movie site using PHP where users could add their favourite movie titles, login system, rating and importing CSV files into MySQL database tables. 

So what do y'all think? Boot it or stay?

The interview will be 30 minutes long and topics will consist of academic experience, work experience, technical skills and communication skills.

I have above average soft skills and shouldn't have a problem with the academic, work or communication aspect of the interview.  I am confident in my technical skills but am nervous that they might be expecting me to know things I won't know until the end of this semester.  

How should I prepare for this interview?  Should I try to learn ahead as much as I can and wing it or should I be honest with the interviewer at the beginning of the interview and let them know where I'm at in my coursework?

The house in the video for ""Thriller"" by Michael Jackson is on Carol Avenue. It's just one of the multiple Victorians that dot the area, making the neighborhood appear to be a misplaced street from San Francisco that relocated here as if by accident. 

After Michael died in that weird scene with the anesthesia and the enigmatic   doctor, I remember driving out here to see the house from the video. I was with with a boyfriend who had tattooed arms and with whom I no longer keep in touch. We talked about death and ghosts and Vincent Price and fame as we wandered up and down the sidewalk. My at the time boyfriend believed in ""shit that's not real"" as he called it. He said that believing in ghosts was, for him, a version of Kierkegaard’s subjective leap: that the only way to prove you exist is to make irrational choices. For Kierkegaard, it was being a Christian. For my ex-boyfriend, it was ghosts. 

I was thinking of that day as I parked. According to Alvarez, Milo was in the corner house. It seemed to pulse, like a barely perceptible heartbeat, nearly vibrating in the gloaming. As I walked down the cracked sidewalk, the house waited for me to get closer. It was the thing in the dark we learn to stop believing in. That thing in the dark that was real all the time.

""Hey, Chloe,"" said Alvarez. He was translucent and somehow next to me again.

""Hey, yourself. I can barely see you. You ok?""

""I'm dead, girl. What do you think?"" 

""Sorry,"" I said. ""Easy to forgot. I'm not really sure how, but it is.""

I stared at the old Victorian with its gables and strange angles. It almost looked underwater. I rubbed my eyes and took a breath.  I realized Alvarez was talking.

""How was it getting here?""

""Not so good. At all. Cops are starting to block roads. I'm worried. Did you live here for the one in '92?""

""Naw, I grew up in Denver. I moved here in the aughts. You're from  here though, right?""

""Yeah. I was little. I don't really remember it..."" I rubbed my temples. ""I'm getting a really bad headache. This is awful timing. This is like Olympic athlete level of timing. This is  Spider-Man saving Gwen Stacy but she was already  —""

""That pill I gave you in the car wasn't Ativan,"" he said.

I stopped waking to stare at him. 

""It was a drug called Dante. It isn't from here. It's being made in the NotHere and sold in this world. It's erasing borders and things are getting in and things are getting out. It's what's causing all of this. The riots. The ants. ""White Horses."" Everything is getting unstable.""

He was talking. I could barely hear him. Everything had a pulse. Everything was dying and I could hear everything's heartbeat. Slow. Slow. 

""Queen Mab called me up, Chloe. It's not like I could say no. She pulled me out of where I was. I just had to help her.""

""Alvarez,"" I said. My voice was turning visible, my letters trapped in balloons floating over my head and bursting as I said the next sentence. ""What did you do to me?""

""Same thing you did to me, girl,"" he sort of smiled and he kind of didn't smile at all. ""I killed you. Good luck with Milo. Good luck with everything.""

And he was gone. And so was I. 

**********

The house on Carol Avenue was growing limbs. It's windows were starting to fill up with fangs. The mouths held bodies. I heard bones break. They sounded like xylophone music. 

I walked up the stairs and rang the bell. I tasted cameras filming me, even if I couldn't see them. I could hear noises in the sky. Things with wings that were invisible. The door opened. 

The Famous Actor whose name I don't mention from the video was standing on the other side of the doorway. He was missing most of the lower half of his face, including his entire jaw. He didn't seem to have a tongue. Behind him, the interior of the house spread out dizzyingly. There was too much in it. Miles and miles of space with people dressed in ball gowns and powdered white wigs and ruffled sleeves and high collars. There was music: a quartet in the corner with cellos and violins. The musicians had their eyes cut out. Throughout the scene, there were naked women who seemed dead but were still walking. They were decaying as I watched. 

The famous actor typed something on his iPhone and held it up. 

""Cat got my tongue. You're late. Wanna go upstairs?""

I nodded and we walked through the dying party, ascending the spiral staircase and heading up. 

*******

Upstairs was a long winding hallway, with flowery designed wallpapered walls rising above faded red carpets with dull gold symbols sewn into them. There were doors pockmarking the hallway at regular intervals, similar to a hotel. I could hear a great rushing noise that sounded like water, as if there was an invisible river somewhere hidden from me. The actor typed and held up his screen.

""I'm glad to see you again. Did you miss me?"" 

""I'm here for Milo,"" I said. His face was like a crushed flower. ""What happened to you?""

He typed onto his phone: ""You aren't here for me, right? Go ahead, chose a door. I'll be here."" 

There was blood spilling from his mouth. 

I walked down the hall. Everything smelled metallic. There were cctv cameras on the wall. They oozed and moved, bending as I walked by them. Your girl stays in the picture, I thought. 

I stopped in front of one of the doors. The doorknob twisted and pulsed before I could touch it. The floral wallpaper in the hallway was breathing, the viscous green and creamy white contracting in and expanding out in some sort of queasy, clockwork rhythm. I grabbed the doorknob. It felt *wet.* Taking a deep breath, I twisted and pushed it open. I stepped inside. 

I was on a long, empty two lane road with a broken yellow line in the middle. Trees lined each side and tilted in, so that their elongated branches bent and scraped the pavement. Overgrown weeds burst in startling colors in the tall dark green growths that terminated upon reaching the pavement.  In the distance, at the end of the road, I could see a white silo and a crimson barn. 

I began walking. It wasn't cold. It wasn't hot. Everything was a strange, non-existent climate, like I was in a bath filled with poisonous flowers. Above me, where there should have been a sun, there was nothing but the dead blue grey of the sky, glowing a soft, unsettling light. The way into hell is easy, I remember Virgil writing in The Aeneid, but I didn't recall if he said anything about getting out. 

The barn was the barn from the video. I knew it would be. What else would it be? The white picket fence ran and surrounded the property. I could hear someone screaming. 

Alvarez's body was tied to the fence. He had the veil on. His body was half consumed. I walked over to him and pulled off the veil.  His eyes were glassy but I saw recognition flare in them. He went to speak, but instead of words there were only ants. They were chewing his mouth apart. 

I untied him and fell onto the deep, dark grass, wet with shadows and other substances. The ants fell out as he coughed and spat and retched until they were gone. 

Finally he was able to speak. 

""Chloe. Queen Mab lied. I don't know why I thought —""

""Don't worry. Don't worry. It's ok,"" I said. He was dying, if you could die there. You probably couldn't die, I realized. He was going to live forever like that. Unless the thing dreaming in the NotHere woke up. 

""Alvarez,"" I said gently. ""What is Milo Sacer?""

""He's an Other One. He didn't used to be. He was alive. A person. But he fucked up, girl. He made a deal with the Other Ones that he'd let the dreaming into the here. He thought he was smart. But he wasn't that smart. They turned him into one of them. Or they became him. It's hard to understand them because they're so different than us.""

""What are they?""

""You know how sometimes ants have wings but sometimes they don't? The ones with the wings are the ones who are going to start a new colony. Then the wings fall off.""

""What are you saying? He's one of those things?""

""They are things in hell that are undreamt of in your philosophies, Chloe. There are other things with wings.""

""Are you saying The Other Ones are angels?"" I said, slowly. 

""That shit you wrote on the walls of my apartment wasn't written in english,"" Alvarez said. ""It was Enochian. The language of angels. It's the same language that's been appearing all summer in the city. You remember?"" 

""I do,"" I nodded. Everything was slow. I felt hot and wet. ""The murders.   Those kids killed in the valley... There were rumors about some kind of weird writing at the scene.""

""There was. It's all connected. Jung was right. There's something underneath it all. It just isn't the something we wish it was.""

""So the Other Ones want the one who is asleep to wake up?""

""If the kingdom wakes up and is born again in the world, they think they will became exalted. And it's close.""

""Where is he?"" I asked. 

Alvarez gestured behind him. ""The barn, I think.""

""Thank you,"" I stood up and walked to the barn house. 

""Wait,"" I stopped. Alvarez had pushed himself up. ""Can you kill me? Please? Because I can't live like this.""

""Remember when you asked me if I thought I had killed you?""

""Yeah?""

""I told you I didn't think I could ever do something like that. And then I did. You say. But you know what? I still don't think I could.""

I walked away, hearing his screams grow fainter.

******************

The barn house was filled with televisions and they were all on, playing the static that used to occur at night, after the official programming was over. Over the snowy, twitchy images faces occasionally appeared, scenes from movies. The TVs were on counters, were hanging from the celling, nailed into the walls, stacked against each other. Everything felt warm. I could feel Milo, or whatever was playing Milo, lurching around. 

On a TV I watched a distorted Milo Sacer tell the interviewer he was going to eat her while a studio audience laughed. I heard wings behind him.

""You are here with us we are here with you we are together.""

""Hi Milo,"" I said. ""I'm still working on that script for you.""

""Turn around we need to see you you need to see us turn around we need to see you turn around you need to see us —""

""I'm sorry, I don't think I can,"" I said. I took a step closer to the TV. The TV screen began going blank, reflecting me. And whatever it was behind me.

""You saw us before you'll see us know we will see you later after this we are not in the now we are in the kingdom of forever —""

""And if I can ask you if you live forever, why are you so worried about now?""

""Now is tomorrow is today is before is after is the transmission that is holy the transmission is the now is tomorrow is today is everything all at once —""

I touched the TV screen. My hand melted into the image. It felt like a blizzard, like death. 

""Yesterday you were ours Claire tomorrow you'll be ours Claire now you'll be ours Claire we live in time like river we swim at night—""

""My name isn't Claire,"" I said, my hands beginning to trace a circle. 

""Are you sure do you remember who you were before you what is the first thing you remember who did you used to be—""

The image of the thing behind me was almost complete. All wings, terrible and beautiful, white and like a god, I think. 
""For your love,"" I whispered.

""We mark those the stories can come through we knew you were transmitting —""

""For you, love.""

I dropped to the ground. There was a pain in me, roaring through me, every wire and tendon and muscle of me felt as if were being cut and cut again. I feel on my back. The pain was moving down. Down my body and into the lowest parts of me. And then, crawling out of from between my legs was Queen Mab, teeth in a permanent grin, laughing, telling me if only I could see her face as the Angel began screaming to see her, a high and beautiful and dying cry of fear. 

********

The next thing I remember happening is waking up in my apartment. It was the day after.  I pulled up the news on my phone. After the crowds mostly dispersed, the riot hadn't happened. There were some skirmishes and one gun had gone off, fatally wounding The Famous Actor, who had rushed downtown as the protest started and received death as the payment for his sin. 

In the days that followed, things more or less went back to normal. Milo Sacer was found dead in a pool chair next to his backyard infinity edge pool of an apparent heart attack. Alvarez was found shot in his apartment, a victim of an apparent botched home invasion. Gwen, my agent, however seemed fine, with the only noticeable quirk being that she assigned her intern the task of getting her as many collectibles from the movie ""Them!"" as possible.

As for me? I think I'm ok. I'm writing for a horror show now. I toss around some good ideas in the writers room. I just got a new place in Echo Park. That's why I didn't think anything of the package I got the other day, addressed to ""Claire."" I just assumed it was a mistake. 

After looking at the small, heavily taped envelope, I began to wonder if I was wrong. I used a sharp kitchen knife to cut through the seals. I saw myself in the blade's surface as I did. 

Inside the envelope was a flashdrive. 

I shouldn't have, but I did. One file. I hit play. 

The video was short, under a minute. It's at the scene of the almost riot. The cameraman is swinging the camera in all directions. And then the camera stops. Filling up the frame are the gleaming white horses of the police. The camera zooms into their eyes. You can see my reflection in the pupil, filming.

And then you see the person behind me, filming me. 

And then the video ends. "

I learned alot this past summer and I literally feel like a 10x better programmer and I can solve interview questions much more confidently.

The problem is, that I know alot of companies have application filters and lots of them automatically reject you or wont contact you if you apply too soon. I have already applied to some companies only to receive an automated rejection 5 minutes later. I can't even apply to Facebook, etc. Should I just create new contact information, email, phone, address? That way their systems wont be able to link me to my old account. I thought I could get away with just email but they have linked me through different ways. Does anyone have advice on what I should do?

I'm a Master's student in Germany and am lucky enough to have been offered a well-paying internship as software engineer in the US for 2016.

As far as I'm aware, I'm going to need a J-1 visa which the company has to sponsor. The company is experienced with the process but they need some time for the official offer and I'm curious: What do I have to do in order to obtain this visa? I've read something about required legal sponsors and language requirements but right now I really have no idea at all.

How will my salary be taxed (state: California) during this time and do I need a US bank account for the duration (~22 weeks) or can I receive the salary on my German bank account?

The company will probably make a return-offer including sponsorship for the H-1B and I could see myself returning there after completion of my Master's degree. My Bachelor's is in Computer Science, my Master's is more specialized (IT Security). I've heard about the H-1B slots reserved for Master's graduates, is this limited to degrees obtained in the US? Would I qualify for another visa with my Master's? Demand for the H-1B appears to be quite high.

And given that I won't graduate before 2017: How, if at all, would the upcoming presidential elections affect skilled migration?

Thanks in advance!"

I am disappointed in myslef, but I just cant get myself to do better in math and I don't want to risk destroying my GPA, or graduating late because of math courses. I originally thought that after 152 and Linear algebra, that I would be officially done with math forever. However, Ive recently learned that there is a lot more math involved in higher level computer science courses (Ive even been told that some 400 level CS courses are basically math that revolves around CS).

So now my plan is to major in ITI and minor in CS. This is because i truly love programming, and while ITI has some basic courses, i believe a CS minor would well prepare me to become a great programmer (along with my own independent studying). However, I am worried that even if i take this route, employers wont consider me for a programming/developer job because I don't have an official CS degree. I really hope this is not the case because with ITI i should have a very high GPA + internships, and I do love programming and want to peruse a career in it. Please share your advise."

As I learned the software (enterprise hosted and in-house) my technical know how grew, I taught my self SQL and became quite proficient in it. I moved up to solutions engineer, which had quite a range as responsibilities, from implementation consulting, bug, defect testing and deployment, automation scripting, client training etc...

Around this time my wife started a company that was taking off so I decided to take things to the next level and formalize my technical education. I found a well respected master's program in my state and applied, interviewed, and was accepted. They weren't thrilled with my lack of coding experience but decided my 4 years of experience in the industry would be sufficient. 

I excelled in the program, graduating with a 3.8 GPA. Which was HARD. Damn it was hard. There were certain technologies you could choose to emphasis on, such as database design, big data, object oriented programming etc... I chose not to pursue any of them with the thought that due to my lack of real coding experience it would be best to get as comprehensive of an educational experience as possible. 

I decided I wanted to pursue a career as a DBA, so I got an internship as a DBA with a large insurance company while in school. I hated it. Not just the role, but the giant company culture among other things. I was offered a full time position but declined it to focus on school. 

I graduated in May and joined a startup that failed pretty quickly, (so quickly i didn't even put it on my resume, because we never even got to development), but it was a good experience. 

I looked after my son for the summer so my wife could focus on bringing in income. And that brings me to where I am now.

Because of my choice not to focus on a specific tech, I now find myself a jack of all trades, master of none. I can code, but not well, and there is no way I could pass a technical interview. I bought CTCI and am working through as many tutorials as I can. But I need to also look for a job. I'd like to pursue programming but can't focus on looking for a job and sharpening my skills at the same time and expect a junior position. The only answer in my opinion would be an internship, or another pee-on position to get my foot in the door, but I applied to two internships and both responded saying they only hire current students. 

So, help? I'm not really sure how to proceed. I don't regret my decision to go back to school but feel like I may have pigeonholed myself with my internship and by not focusing on an emphasis. That being said, I'm only two weeks into my job hunt, so I'm not hopeless or anything of the sort, I just need honest input on what challenges I am going to face and how to possibly overcome them.

Thanks!"

3lh90n,2,2015-09-18,Should I just give up on internships or just SWE all-together?,asdfasdfabcd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3lh90n/should_i_just_give_up_on_internships_or_just_swe/,"Clearly I'm not good enough based on the fact I can't land a single internship in a pure software development company, and the sad fact is the rejections don't just come from a big 4 name or large tech firm, they come from small startups too. I interviewed for a big 4 company last year but fucked up the interview, and I'm afraid to apply again this year. Instead I applied to a small startup and I took a coding exam which I thought I did ok in, but apparently not since they rejected me. I've taken 1 other coding exam this year at a mid-size companies which I also thought I did well in, so that means I'll probably be rejected from that too. All the large companies reject me without even an interview.

Should I just give up on trying to find an internship, or is the problem that I'm just a shitty developer and should give up on SWE alltogether? I've had internships that were coding at non-tech firms, but the firms are not known in tech so I usually get rejected by techy companies without an interview. Companies don't seem to care about my non-target school either. The one opportunity I had with Big 4 companies last year I completely blew, so even if I applied again and somehow managed to get an interview I would probably just fuck up the interview again. I have a coding exam scheduled for next week at a well-known specialized-tech firm, but the little confidence I had to begin is completely diminished by now. Should I cancel the exam and spare myself the rejection? I mean, if I couldn't get the startup, how am I possibly going to get this one? This coming summer is my last chance before having to apply to full-time jobs. Could I possibly get a job as a data scientist or maybe as a code monkey for accounting purposes or something?"

 - I have previous work experience with PR but practically none or very limited with marketing


Overview: 

- The pay for the two internships is comparable
- PR agency work sounds more interesting, but I think I could learn more about marketing


Now, I would like to know what do you think? Where are better career prospects? (keep in mind I don't have a Business degree which I think is my main disadvantage if I want to pursue marketing).

3lhqv5,2,2015-09-18,New grad failing to get interviews. What can I do to improve?,kerrang197,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3lhqv5/new_grad_failing_to_get_interviews_what_can_i_do/,"Let me explain some background first.

Everyone in college told me getting a job would be easy, and recruiters and consolers told me that I had a good resume for a graduate, but I haven't been able to get many interviews in the 4 months I've been seraching. I've applied to entry-level positions at large companies and start ups where ever I can find them and I've tried using some recruiters that contacted me locally, but out of the 40+ positions I've applied to, I've only gotten interviews from 5. Worse, I've failed every one.

I was trying to get a job in San Francisco, I know a few guys there and I fell in love with the city the one time I visited, and I was picky about companies I was applying to because I did not want to end up working as a government contractor or maintaining a legacy code. However, my current financial situation has kind of forced me to stop looking in SF and consider working locally in the DC area. Simply put, I need to start making some money soon.

Admittedly, my experience and skill set is kind of wonky. I jumped around in what languages and topics I wanted to learn in college, so I can't say I'm an expert at anything or at least I don't claim to be. My experience leans mostly towards front-end web development, but for a good while I tried hard to get away from web dev in college because my only exposure to it was WordPress and an unsatisfying internship working with ColdFusion. I've been getting into Rails now to refresh my knowledge in full stack development. I have some stuff on Github, but mostly in Rust since that's my langauge for side projects along with some course assignments which aren't fleshed out enough to include on my resume. And in interviews I always say I'm most knowledgable in C++, which I also have been refreshing on through Hacker Rank, but have not worked on any big projects with the language.

So when I kept searching for Junior Software Engineer, or Junior Web Developer, positions on Linkedin, Dice, and CyberCoders I don't feel like I meet the requirements since a lot of them ask for more experience than I have, usually 2-3+ years.

........................................................................................................................

With all that said, what should I do about improving my appeal to companies and performance in interviews? Should I be focusing on studying on theory and interview questions or should I try working on a lot of small side projects?

I've gone through Cracking the Coding Interview a few times, and have made my own study guide on algorithms, data structures, and interview questions. But a lot of it is nothing more than memorization to me. Are there any good resources on approaches to problem solving? I haven't been able to find anything that goes more in depth than explaining how to solve a specific problem. What can I do to improve on this in general?

One of my failing interviews was with Google, which I choked on due to some major anxiety, and the interviewer recommended that I look into internships. Is that even possible considering I'm no longer a student? Even then I was having the same issue I'm having now, no one would ever get back to me.

TL;DR I need to start making money, but I fail at interviews and I don't think I have enough experience to even be considered for a position. What do I do?

**Edit:**

Thanks for the info guys. I was in the mind set that I could only apply to positions that asked for 0-1+ years of experience and that I should apply positions with ""junior"" or ""new grad"" in the title or description. This is pretty new to me and I don't really have anyone giving me great advice since I'm the first college grad in my family. I'll definitely be upping the volume since I don't need to be so strict on the requirements. Again, thanks for the help!

I abandoned a graduate program I was doing well in (but HATING) and a bachelor's degree consisting of 5 years of pre-medical studies to start all over pursuing my new passion of Computer Science. Don't get me wrong - I have not regretted it for a second.

Starting all over as a freshman in college, I managed to get a summer internship as a web developer just after my first year. I did work with Javascript, front-end and back-end (using Node.js). I worked on user interface, back-end logic, and deploying to mobile devices. They liked me so much there that they made me an offer as a full-time salary employee! I took the offer and have been working there since.

The trouble is, now all of my programmer/coding colleagues keep talking about how what I do isn't ""real programming"". Every time they talk about needing to make a website or app or something similar for their independent work, they always say ""oh I'll just use this online tool I just Googled. Should take me like 5 minutes!"". Even some of the interns where I work who are computer science students make comments about how what I do isn't ""real programming"".

I'm still taking one computer science class at my university to try and keep up and build my skills in C++ and lower level stuff, but I don't know where to focus. I want to increase my skills overall and my usefulness as a coder; I want to build a good career for myself, but now I'm not sure where to focus. Does anyone have any good thoughts on this or advice?

Quick background about me: Studied Abroad for a year in Australia, did my internship there and came back to finish my degree in my home country. I currently work as a software developer, but I don't really like my major at Uni, so I'd rather quit it, and go back there. 
I have no problem working as labour, cleaner, or even Barista, it all sounds better than IT, but I don't really see immigration as a possibility on this career path."
3lirtz,128,2015-09-19,the surgery that changed his life.....,darklight29,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3lirtz/the_surgery_that_changed_his_life/,"I'm an anaesthesist. Basically I put people to sleep and keep them alive under the surgeon’s knife and make sure they wake up safe. Sounds simple enough. But what they experience admist the concoction of hypnotic drugs and volatile gases is anyone’s guess. But some tales heard from patients of mine are enough to prove that few things, despite our well approached scientific research and studies are beyond our logical comprehension. Such is this story of my friend. Was my friend.



""Do I really need this eye surgery? I mean, I can still see ""Kyle said with a raised eyebrow. To which I coyly replied ""You failed to identify the alphabet 5 feet away with your left eye. Besides why worry? Didn't i walk you through your appendectomy few years ago? It turned out fine and so should this surgery""



Kyle is a fit young man of 27 who plays soccer and is in excellent health. Partly the reason why his left eyeball needs surgery after being hit by a soccer ball, displacing his lens, impairing his vision. There was relatively low risk of anaesthesia and the surgery planned was a minor one.



 ""But this time its different"" Kyle retaliated. ""Julie (the eye surgeon) said my eyes would be kept open while they are slicing into it, does it mean I can see while they are carving into my eyeball?"" He asked in exasperation.



Damn Julie was never moderate when it comes to explaining surgical procedures. Some details are better left untold especially to an apprehensive patient. 


""Dude you will be under medications so intense that you would not be aware of anything that's happening and for Christ sake the chances are you will be dreaming of riding an unicorn across an inverted rainbow throughout the surgery"" I replied confidently. 


""Didn't you wake up with a smile after your appendectomy years ago?"" I asked. ""Yeah, but things have never been the same since then"" he added in a mumble while looking away.


As soon as Kyle finished his sentence the nurse interrupts us to inform that the next patient is ready and so Kyle left. But being the curious doctor and more importantly a friend, I was determined to ask more when I meet him later at for our weekly supper.



At supper Kyle told me something chilling. He was not one to believe in demons and the paranormal, he even scoffs at the topic. But his eyes and manner at which he spoke revealed genuine fear, a side of Kyle I rarely witness.

Kyle admitted that ever since I woke him up from the appendectomy 2 years ago he was 'discovered'. Discovered by an entity that he describes as a humanoid figure that is completely pitch black and bald, at 6 foot tall with a lean body bearing no appreciable features except for its eyes and teeth.


Kyle explains that it started the day after he was discharged home post-surgery on a month of medical leave. He was lying on his bed and soon with the help of pain meds, drifted into sleep. Hours later he woke up to the sound of revving motorbikes and he knew that it was night as the street lamp outside his window cast its glow into his room. He was awake for a few seconds and quickly descended back into his slumber. But within those quick seconds he saw a black squatted figure on floor, on all fours, searching for something on the floor, its face close to the floor, as if sniffing for something. Kyle distinctively remembers this as he wakes up the next morning but passes it off as a dream.



A week after the surgery Kyle once again finds himself awake in the dead of night. His eyes open while his body immobile. Same street lamp. Same glow. But this time he could hear the wind and the tree whistling in the strong breeze. He knew he wasn't dreaming and out of the corner of his eye he can see that above his cupboard, in the darkness hidden from the street lamp glow was another shade of black much deep, and soon that shade turned into a well-defined pitch black entity which began to crawl down the cupboard slowly on all four and made its way to the floor while carefully avoiding the region lighted by the street lamp. Kyle closed his eyes shut and listened for what seemed like ages. He could hear nothing but his heart beating in his ears but somehow fell asleep.


The next 2 weeks, Kyle looked up online for similar experiences but without any answers and now that I think of it I remember Kyle calling me a week after surgery to ask if weird dreams are a known side effect of anaesthesia, but they are not, especially not after a week. Kyle then for the next few days proceeded to observe this being but he had no control as he would spontaneously wake up in the night and he was not comfortable with the idea of using an alarm clock in fear of finding himself awake in between the creature and a loud ringing alarm clock.


Most of these encounters last only a few seconds, after which he will drift back to sleep accompanied by fear and his palpitating heart, but during which the entity is oblivious to him, unaware that its presence is witnessed by Kyle, going about and around on all fours, sometimes on the floor and other times atop of the bedroom closet. All that Kyle could see was a shape of pitch black as the entity was careful to avoid the light cast by the street lamp. Until one fateful day when Kyle decided to sleep with a torch, determined to shine his doubt on this intruder of the night.


He slept under the covers the with the torch sling strapped around his wrist. He did this for 3 nights but he did not wake up but his efforts bore fruit when on the 4th night he woke up and sure enough there it was crouching motionlessly in the corner, it's face facing the corner walls just beyond the sharp light line thrown by the street lamp. Kyle slowly inched his wrist and positioned his thumb onto to the torch power button and in a quick snap he pointed it towards the entity and clicked it expecting a gush of light but there was only darkness. The torch didn't work. But Kyle in his flurry of moves alerted the creature, and it slowly lifted its head and turned to face Kyle and for the first time the street lamp shone its light on the creatures face and Kyle saw a pair of gleaming fluorescent yellow eyes which locked sight with his. The entity then proceeded to make a soft hissing sound much like a forced exhale and opened its jaw wide to reveal a set of yellow pearly teeth. It then just stood there still displaying its jaw while its eyes remained locked on Kyle. 


Kyle remained motionless, eyes wide open, not knowing what to do, he closed his eyes and wished he would fall back to sleep like before. But he could not. His heart was racing wildly and although the hissing has stopped, he can feel that it is still gazing at him. He has been discovered. Kyle waited for a few minutes, his sweaty hands still grasping the useless torch. His bed cover drenched. He then did the unthinkable. He opened his eyes and he could see nothing. Nothing but two rings of yellow around a dead black center merely a breath away from his eyes. The entity was staring into his eyes, less than an inch away. Kyle passed out. And awoke next morning to a urine soaked bed and a useless torch. He knows now that he has been seen, his cover blown, the entity knows.

  
For the past two years, Kyle feared the very thought of suddenly waking up at night. For every time he wakes up he meets nothing but yellow spheres circling a black center, while his ears shiver to the tune of a soft hiss. These encounters only last a second before he closes shut his eyes, keeping them closed till he hears the crack of dawn and feels the warmth of the morning sun. On some lucky days he will fall back to sleep admist the fear, but on most days he will remain awake till morning, knowing that it is merely inches in front of him, in a fear of anticipation of what could happen. It doesn't happen every night, but frequent enough to keep him fearful. Regardless of where or with who he sleeps, the yellow circles appear.


""So know you know why I am very afraid of the surgery next week"" Kyle said as he ended his story. I stared still, expecting Kyle to crack up laughing, celebrating the prank he has successfully pulled on me. But no such luck. He leaned back on his chair and sipped off his coke. I stared down into my bowl of melted ice cream. Some supper this turned out to be.


I broke the silence and said ""assuming all this is true, so you are saying..erm.. that it just stares at you?"" 


""I don't know man, as soon as I open my eyes to something yellow and black, I close them back immediately. I don't want to find out what happens if continue looking at them ""Kyle said shaking his head. We decided it was time for beer and after, we called it a night and I assured Kyle that he needs this surgery, otherwise he will lose his left eye. I promised Kyle that I would be present throughout the surgery and will be there beside him praying.


The next week sees Kyle in his surgical robe being reeled into the operating theatre. In the background I am preparing syringes of medications and the anesthetic machine while Julie checks her instruments, oblivious to her fearful patient. I help Kyle onto the operating table, always keeping a hand on his shoulder, reminding him that I will be constantly monitoring him throughout the surgery. The heart monitor already show a rather anxious Kyle as I can feel his heart pounding when I attached the cables and monitor leads. “Nervous are we?” Julie stated as she assured that its going to be a very short and safe surgery.


“See you when you wake up buddy” I said as I held the breathing mask on his face and began the infusion that will render him asleep. He just nodded fearfully and soon enough his eyes rolled and eyelid closed shut. His heart rate calmed and he clinically behaved like any other patient I would expect to be once under. After a few minutes Julie was ready and Kyles eyes have been cleaned and draped before the incision. “You know this friend of yours keep asking if I could perform the surgery without opening his eyelids. Funny fellow isn’t he?” Julie casually remarked and to which I replied “well could you?” “I can see how you two are friends” she said while she proceeded to insert an eyelid retractor which will keep Kyles eyelids open so she could perform the surgery. I thought to myself, “maybe this time it won’t show itself, not in front of us.”


But I was wrong. As soon as Julie retracted his eyelids apart, his heart rate monitor shot up, to rates so alarming, that it might be interpreted as pain, awareness, or even a heart attack. But I knew too well that it wasn’t any of the above. I gave him enough painkillers and medications to put down a horse. He was in fear. Fear so intense that no amount of sedation could calm him. He was looking at it alright, right into its pitch black pupils surrounded by a halo of shimmering yellow. “That’s odd, I haven’t even begun to incise” Julie said. I just nodded and turned up the dial up on my machine, in a futile attempt to plunge my friend into a deeper abyss of unconsciousness in hopes of severing the creatures’ stare, but to no avail. The surgical equipment then startled me as it let out a soft hiss that I have never heard before in my years of working here. I would hate to think that is the dreadful sound that accompanies Kyle during his encounters. Kyle’s heart was racing furiously throughout the surgery.


Julie was about done with the surgery when she asked her assistant to file a maintenance check on the eye microscope. “I keep seeing a yellow tint on his eyes throughout the surgery, this equipment needs to be serviced” she said. This only confirmed my worst fears. Julie deemed the surgery a success, and left the operating theatre after she was done, leaving me with Kyle as I turned off the dial and waited for him to wake up. Once under, they take some time to wake up, but this was a very brief surgery lasting no more than an hour and hence I prayed in silence that he wakes up well. His heart paced down into normal rate which was a relief.


It was 2 hours since the surgery ended. He was supposed to be awake immediately after the surgery. I page in my colleagues and soon we are all in the operating room figuring out why a fit young healthy male is not waking up from a minor surgery. I slumped into my chair while my colleagues withdrew blood and went over various tests straightaway but could not find results as to why he is not waking up. They transferred Kyle to the intensive care with artificial breathing ventilator, determined to find the cause for his unconsciousness. I was sent home.


Kyle did not wake up. Every medical intervention and diagnostics did not show any abnormalities. He was weaned of the breathing machines and his heart, lungs, kidneys, bowels were functioning normally, with the exception of him being unconscious. After 2 weeks, he was transferred to a nursing center where his parents were taught to care and feed him, with the promise of soon being able to bring him back home, with the hopes of him waking up one day from this horrible state. I would visit Kyle ever so often. During these visits I would perform minor tests, just to check all his basic functions like his reflexes, breathing, heart sounds. But every single time I lift up his eyelids, I can sense his rate racing, so much so I have stopped doing that during my visits. 


After a few months in the facility, Kyle showed no improvement. But the caretakers have on various occasions told me that the white of his eyes have turned a pale yellow. But I refused to have a look. I knew all too well. We have on many occasions seen people being withdrawn from life support. But this was not an option with Kyle, as he was not on any support. He is alive and well, but forever in a state of unconsciousness. His family, torn between their responsibility to Kyle’s younger siblings and their work, did their best to accompany him; sometimes staying overnight, bringing visitors and friends.


It has been a year. Kyle turns 28 today. He was supposed to intern at his father’s company, but here he lies, as the caretakers tie the string of birthday balloons and exchanges greetings with his friends who have come to visit. The room looked warm with flower bouquets and confetti strings as to its usual white drapes and sheets. His cousins and friends have all come, all still holding onto to the hope that the once cheerful Kyle would wake up again. I found this somewhat heartwarming and grabbed my phone to take a shot of all of us singing the birthday song with Kyle. Against the soft glow of the candle lighted cake Kyle looked peacefully asleep, and as I snapped the picture, the crowd in the room cheered birthday wishes and took turns hugging Kyle.


I looked at my phone screen. And there it was. In all its evil glory, the black entity was kneeling on Kyles chest, with its hand holding his arms down and its face stuck to Kyles face, waiting for him to open his eyes. I walk out of the room heading to my car. I drive fast to my hospital and I grab what I need. Tonight I am going to end my friends' misery. See you in hell, demon.

3ljsiy,1,2015-09-19,TIFU by seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,PTFOholland,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3ljsiy/tifu_by_seeing_the_light_at_the_end_of_the_tunnel/,"Hi there, this happened on thursday!  
I am currently doing an internship in a city not too far from here, I drive to it and drive back, it's around 20km.  
So thursday was my last day of the week and I wanted to go home.  
I noticed my fuel light came on when I started the car but I knew my Peugeot 205 has around 3-5 liters in reserve so.. I should easily make the 20 km and fill her up!  
Along the way I tuffed along in the old Frenchie and he held up just fine.  
Then somehow it started sputtering in fifth gear. 
 Knowing it's a French car and well.. old.. I swapped to fourth thinking I had probably lost a cilinder or something.  
Then the tunnel came up, almost there, the exit was just after the tunnel and the gas station right there too!  
At this point, fifth gear came back so I turned on my lights and went in!  
The road down was great, but then I had to go back up!  
Fifth gear sputtered out so I swapped to fourth.  
I noticed I lost some power, but then again I had to go up this massive slope of like 3% man!  
So, naturally, I floored it.  
My open air filter fired up and then it was silenced.  
Thinking my MacGyver'd air filter had probably fallen of I thought I was still fine.  
At this point I thought about my fuel again (yeah yeah, I am a bit slow)  
I noticed the inducator went to about minus a quarter of a tank, which was interesting.  
Then my speed dropped and the engine turned of, about 10 meters before the exit.  
Here I was, stuck in the bloody tunnel with no emergency lane..  
Naturally, I panicked.   
However, because Holland, the road automatically closed because the camera's saw this idiot (me) stuck in the tunnel.  
A bit red X came on and people knew not to drive on the right lane.  
Then the middlefingers came.  
I've never seen so many angry Dutch middle fingers and honkers in my live.  
But, not to worry, I am a grown 20 year old Dutchmen so... I got my phone and called Mom&amp;Dad.  
They told me to get my AAA pass, so I grabbed my wallet and came to the conclusion that I must have lost it.  
So here I was, with no resque in sight, my dad calling me a cock on the other side of the line and me still in slight terror.  
My mom managed to call the AAA and the utter pillock on the phone asked me to GET OUT OF MY VEHICLE, and walk towards the nearest roadmark so they could see where the fuck I was.  
In my slightly panicked voice I screamed: I am in a fucking tunnel you utter fuck face, I can't get out because there's a billion angry Dutch drivers on the lane, it's dark and fuck you.  
*They understood.*  
At this point, I saw a tow truck coming down from heaven (or well.. hell since he came from below the tunnel, to this day no clue how it got there in 10 minutes) so I rejoiced.  
I got out of my car (ye ye I manned up) and walked towards him all happy.  
I opened the door and told him:  
Hello sir! As you can see I've run o- YOU UTTER COCK!  
*Pardon me?*  
""You bloody cock, who the fuck runs out of fuel in a fucking tunnel!?"" (now this is Rotterdam, so this is basically how we talk in a professional manner)  
I do sir, the gage is not really reliable you see, it's Fre- Get out of my face, ill give you a tow.  
Confident, and terrified, I walked back, untill another guy with a warning light arrived, this time on a motorcycle.  
Thinking he was police I greeted him in the nicest way possible.  
(I think I even saluted like the fucking idiot I am)  
  
He got of and said: You're lucky I am NOT with the police, I am with the Empire.  
Thinking I just walked into the set of the new Star Wars® I got rather excited.  
This was not the case, he was with Rijkswaterstaat which means something like: Empire Water State. Or, REICHSWASSERSTRASSE in German.  
After thinking how cool it was we got an Empire in The Netherlands I asked him: Why am I lucky then?  
""Well since you are such an utter cock to run out of petrol before you made it to the emergency lane, we can't fine you as we're not Police.""  
*So you guys will tow me to a fuel station for free?*  
No, we will tow you 100 meters infront of a fuel station so you're gonna have to figure something out yourself, as a learning moment because, well, you're such an utter cock.  
Reluctantly, I agreed.  
My lil' Peugeot was driven on the tow truck and then the best part began.. I COULD SIT INSIDE THE TOW TRUCK!  
How cool is that?!  
It had like all these instruments I was adviced not to touch and then I had to sign a document saying I ~~was an utter cock~~ was the guy who ran out of fuel in the tunnel.  
The bill would be paid by THE EMPIRE and that would be it.  
(Please keep in mind every Dutch car owner pays a road tax every 3 months, it's how we get an awesome road system and apparantly stuff like this, also the heavier and less enviromental your car is, the more you pay. I pay around 35$ per 3 months for the 205)  
Oh yeah, my story goes on.  
After being towed back the tow guy told me I would be able to start it because it was a flat service. Mr Tow was wrong.  
At this point, my dad arrived in his car, and proceeded to call me an utter cock.  
The Tow truck guy told us: Well, this is as far as I go, goodbye!  
And left.  
My dad then started laughing at me because he always wondered what idiot runs out of fuel, and couldn't be prouder it was his own son.  
Luckily, since I own an old car I was prepared.  
~~We quickly grabbed the state regulated high visability jackets from the car~~ We got out an old wonky tow cable and fucking hooked that thing, my brakes however were just gone because every drop of fuel had dissappeared so I had to use the handbrake.  
After almost crashing into my dad's car we arrived at the filler station and filled up.  
After about a minute of sputtering the old car came back to life!  
There is still a bit of air in the fuel pipes though, but it should go over after a few kilometers.  
  
**TL;DR: Don't be an utter cock and fill up your tank.**

Let me be frank. I have no idea how to code, how to use c++, or any other programs. Would it be worth my while to pursue a career in this field?

 What degree would/should I go after? What would be my starting salary and/or business plan? Would I need to get an internship first? How is the work environment in most places? And finally, what's a good plan for making more money?(I've seen a few people say switch jobs to get more money? As in quit and search for a new one? Would that be financially safe?)

 Sorry if these questions seem like something a person with any logic should know, but I love computers, and programming and the sorts looks very interesting. Would I be wasting my time in trying to join such a competitive industry?"

I couldn't make up my mind on where to specialize during my 3rd year (I liked everything) and ended up taking courses that are ""spread out"" over the areas of electrical engineering. Tried getting internships during summer, got quite a lot of interviews but none panned out. Then I came back to 4th year and finally decided I want to specialize in analog/RF/signal processing. The courses I'm currently taking are all in those areas. To be honest, I don't really know all that much about the field. So I guess my questions are, for you guys (and girls) who are in those fields:
1. Can you guys share your experience working in/about the industry?
2. What skills are most important to focus on when studying analog electronics?
3. Any advice on getting internships/experience and such? I have quite some free time doing part-time and I really want to improve my skills in electronics.

Sorry beforehand if my questions have been asked many times before. It's just that i'm still quite unsure of what to expect in the industry and t's not that I'm choosing something I don't like, I definitely like electronics. I realize how inexperienced I am in practical knowledge and I just want to improve myself.

Need feedback.",thelostgiraffe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3lo7ba/i_think_i_may_be_insane_but_i_want_to_transition/,"Well, I'm kicking myself pretty hard right now. A little background about me:

I am Australian, and recently graduated from a top university here with a Bachelor in Political Science and Bachelor of Laws with Hounours. I will be admitted to practice as a lawyer either at the end of this year, or early next year. I spent a long time working towards law, built up internship experience, and after 6 long years here I am -- soon 25, and... not at all thrilled at the prospect of being a lawyer. I've always been interested in programming and computer/network security, and there's a little voice in my head telling me I should go for it instead of pressing on with a career that I'm not really committed to and ending up bitter and regretful.

There are some obvious problems here I was hoping I could get some feedback on. 

(1) If I went for this, I would want to study in the United States. As a law graduate, my math and science background is relatively weak. What do you think my chances are for being admitted to a decent program? (I think my GPA is around 3.3 - 3.4 in my undergrad). Do most universities offer bridging courses? Is self-study at all recognised or acknowledged in the application process? What can I do to improve my chances?

(2) Should I be looking at BS Compsci degrees, or MS Compsi degrees? Cost is not a huge consideration as far as this choice goes, as my debt is near 0. I'm primarily concerned with receiving a quality education and employment prospects. Does the choice of BS vs MS typically make any difference as far as internship opportunities?

(3) Is there a chance that some employers might see my having a law degree as a positive (e.g. strong communication and analytical skills beyond the strictly technical side, and potentially legal intersections with some aspects of the technical work they do), or is it more likely to be a case of ""this looks like wasted time and indecisiveness""?

(4) How do people feel about these ""Cybersecurity"" degrees? I've spotted a few of them while doing my research and I'm a little sceptical, but they do seem to focus more closely on the subjects I'm interested in."

I'm applying for internships in SF at the hot startups (think Uber, Pinterest, Airbnb, etc) and I'm finding that I'm getting a lot of rejections without interviews, often at times like 8pm on a Saturday night.  


What I'm thinking is that it's some type of automated program scanning keywords, maybe school names, for potential interview candidates.  I'm guessing that since I doubt anybody is sitting on their computer at 8pm on a Saturday reviewing my resume.

I'm wondering if I'm having a tough time even getting interviews with these companies, who do they actually interview? Are there that many students at the top schools to interview?  Is school the biggest factor? I was thinking that since I had a pretty good company on my resume I would be much more likely to get interviews, but it doesn't appear to be that way.

First off, I apologize if I mess something up, as this is my first Reddit post ever.

Along those same lines, I've never built a PC before (however I have been PC gaming for years on an old beat-up laptop), and I decided that I wanted to build a gaming PC with the money I made over my summer internship. I've put a permalink below to pcpartpicker.com, which is the website I used to construct what I think is a solid mid-range PC able to run most games on moderately high/high settings. I'm open to any and all suggestions, however, I'd like to keep the price in the same ballpark (+/- $100 ish). I'm purchasing these parts in the USA.

Thanks in advance for checking out my build and for giving feedback!

On August 10th, I left NM to come back home. About 2 days after I left, I realized I did not have several of my video games, and texted my landlord / roommate asking if I had left them there. A few days later, she texted me a picture of the games, I confirmed they were mine, and she said she would mail them to me, so I took no further action.

I still have not received the games, despite attempting to remain in communication about them with her. Today (September 20), I sent her a text message requesting she either send me my games as she said she would, or pay me the value of the games (over $200.)

She responded by saying that I had left my room and bathroom unclean and in a worse state than they were in to begin with, and that I owe her cleaning fees as per their rental agreement, and that once I send her a cleaning fee and postage for the games, she will return the games.

At no other point did she indicate that I  owed her money for cleaning fees (though she did send a text saying she was cleaning, it did not mention me owing her money for it), and she has not provided any proof of the bathroom and room being unclean, though I have not yet asked for any. (I did clean the rooms before I left, but I did not deep clean. There may have been dust on the windowsills or some hairs I missed, but it would absolutely not have been anything egregious.) I did not take any pictures of the condition of the rooms when I left.

My questions are basically am I still entitled to having my property returned despite it being more than 14 days since I left? (She gave confirmation that she would send me the games within the 14 days, so I took no further action other than texting her reminders periodically. Does my having taken no further action mean that I surrendered the property?) Is she able to retroactively decide that I owe her money for cleaning fees over a month since I left? Can she hold my property hostage like that?

I'm currently a Junior working towards a CS degree and was wondering about the importance of web development skills. My classes have taught me things such as data structures, algorithms, etc. But when it comes to web development, all I've learned is basic HTML/CSS/JS(i've done two internships and neither have had anything to do with these). I browse job ads and I see things like Node, Angular, and all these frameworks I've never touched before.

I know the obvious answer is ""learn web development frameworks if you want a job in web development"", but I'm honestly not sure. Is it normal to come out of school being proficient in both web frameworks and your traditional software engineering skills? Learning these web frameworks would definitely be a large time-sink that could be spent bettering my current skills or picking up another language. 

I want to be as marketable as possible when I graduate, but I'm not sure if I should widen my scope or spend my remaining time at school refining what I already know.

Would love to hear everyone's opinion. Thanks"

For background, I am interested in computational chemistry and have done a research internship this summer. I am very lost in terms of the grad school admissions process.

I kind of want to get a sense of what grad schools prioritize in an applicant (grades, research, recommendations, etc.). Since you all have gone through the process I thought it would be helpful to ask. How do grad school departments determine who will be a ""better researcher"" in the future?

Also, is there anything I should be working towards that might not seem important right now? (Like doing research, getting papers published, applying for funding, etc.)

Lastly (on a tangential note), I worked very closely with an advisor who worked under our lab's (well-known) professor. However, I barely know the professor at all. The professor told me that to get a recommendation from him, I should write him a draft  of the whole thing first. Is this a good idea?

- What makes a good grad school applicant?

- What should an undergraduate sophomore be focusing on right now?

Could really use some advice :)",throwawayutm,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/3ltah0/thinking_of_dropping_2_courses_but_worried_i_may/,"I'm a fifth year student at UTM and I'll be graduating next year. I only need 3.5 credits to graduate, but I'm taking a full course load (and one of my courses is an internship course which involves me working at least 8 hours/week and several assignments). I'm feeling burnt out at the moment and I'm not sure if I can successfully handle this work load, which has caused me to rethink my plans for the year.

Right now, I'm thinking that it would be best for me to drop my course load down to 4.0 so that I have enough time to successfully complete my courses and give my all at work.

The problem is that I would like to attend law school or grad school (still not sure which route I want to take so I'm thinking of taking at least a year off to carefully think this through), and I've never taken a full course load in all of my years in university. I took 4.0 credits in my first year and almost ended up on academic probation. I continued to take less than a full course load in my 2nd (4.0) 3rd (4.5) and 4th (4.0), but my grades significantly improved since ( the lowest annual GPA I've had since 1st year was a 3.68, and I recently got a 3.81 AGPA). I had personal issues during my first 3 years that prevented me from taking on full course loads, and I was doing an ROP last year which took up A LOT of my time. I'm not so sure about grad school admissions, but from my observations it seems that Law School Admission committees pay attention to your course load, which I think could hurt my chances of getting admitted (should I choose to attend).

I really wanted to take a full course load this year, but after carefully thinking things out, I think it would hurt my GPA and ruin my upward GPA trend (which I was hoping to emphasize on my future applications to demonstrate how much I have improved). But at the same time, I'm worried that law schools and grad school admission committees might not consider me due to my workload.

I'm not asking for anyone to tell me what to do, but I'm interested what some of you would do and I'm in hearing from some people who have been in similar situations.

If you read through this, thank you so much for taking the time :)

**tldr: never taken a full course load, in my final year and still not taking a full course load. Messed up in first year, but was able to salvage it through the year, but I'm worried that I have very little chance of getting into law school/ grad school due to never taking a full course load.**"

It's been a 1 - 1.5 years since I have been in my MS program for CS and going to finish this year (undergrad was in cellular biology). No internships and all my job experiences were in dental work.

did some simple projects during those classes and I feel like I'm an intermediate level of java and python

and just recently I got my security + cert.

I'm thinking of being both a programmer and have some security background.

My question is how can I improve my standings from other candidates for jobs, I feel like I'm really behind the game here. (Or point me in a direction where this was already answered?)

Thank you!

Where can I take a look at doing just the similar things in PHP and Node? I like reading books, so that would be pretty fine. Keep in mind, learning a language is not what I'm after, I can do that on my own. The whole philosophy of building a back-end with mentioned tools, connecting it to front-end is what I don't know.

I had an internship at a certain US government agency that's famous for its space exploration. My task was to recreate an MSDOS solar cell research program in Visual Basic. You know, something more relevant to this century. They pulled up the code on the old MSDOS computer so I could look at it a bit for guidance. After a while of gaping at the ancient script, I needed to shut the machine off. This was back in 2007 where I wouldn't just immediately try to Google it. So I'm in the command line and try a few things.

&gt;Shutdown

&gt;Off

hmm...

&gt;Goaway

No luck. So I run out to go find a fellow intern, they also don't know. With bowed head I go to find the nearest greybeard. I explain my predicament, and he just laughed. He just reaches over and flicks off the power switch and leaves without saying a word. I realized that I was just like Scotty in Star Trek IV trying to give verbal commands to the mouse. Respect the greybeards my friends."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[So many questions...](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv91pnx?context=5)|Sometimes it takes 5 minutes sometimes it takes months. One guy we have been looking for, I had been looking for him since February of this year and barely found him last week.
[1\) How long does it take to track a person on average?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv91pnx?context=5)|Do not use credit cards. Do not contact any former family members or friends. Use a burner phone. Do not have ANY social media profiles. Do not have any utilities in your name or rent anywhere under your name. Do not vote. Do not take out any hunting or fishing licenses. Do not get any tickets, get arrested, or go to court. You REALLY have to be living off grid in order for me not to find you. You basically have to be homeless.
[2\) If you wanted to go into hiding, what would you do to hide yourself from people like you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv91pnx?context=5)|A common instance is where we talk to family and friends. Family and friends ALWAYS give up the goods. We just sound friendly and like an actual human being and usually get all sorts of information from them. Ex wives/husbands/girlfriends/boyfriends are the best for this. This one along with a very specific database we use are the two most effective tools we use.
[3\) Could you describe a common instance where you would use social engineering in your job? What method have you found most effective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv91pnx?context=5)|I've seen them as little as $2,000. We get paid $500 per case we close in the office along with any bonus the clients offer us however the owner takes half of whatever we make. This means I make $250 per case I close. On a good week I've made $2,300 for one week worth of work. On a bad week I have made absolutely no money since I work on 100% commission. If we are just helping process servers we average about $60 per half hour of our time. Not me, but one of our other investigators was looking for a Dodge Viper valued at around $120K which she did successfully find.
[4\) In the case of debt collection, how large would the debt need to be for you to get involved? How much commission/payment would you get? What's the largest amount owed by someone you found?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv91pnx?context=5)|Edit: Added some stuff.
[*Do not use credit cards, Do not have any utilities in your name, Do not take out any hunting or fishing licenses.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv987y3?context=5)|The databases we use are 100% legal for skiptracing purposes. The main database we use is in fact a large staple in the skiptracing industry and clearly stipulates how we are allowed to use it. All of the data highlighted is actually sold to third parties (ie: our database provider). Some states have laws saying it cannot be sold, in which case we have no info on these individuals and have to resort to just tracking them down via phone and documents our clients have provided us. The data packets our clients give us often have this information included and in the contracts individuals sign it clearly states what information can be used to find them.
[So can you explain why use of a credit card, utilities, or taking out a hunting / fishing license would be an issue??](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv987y3?context=5)|Edit#2: The credit card information if you have negative reports, it will be listed on the data packets our client sends us. The hunting and fishing licenses are listed by state so we are able to find a general area that you live in.
[So that detective got commission based on the value of the Dodge?  If so what percentage?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv95zau?context=5)|The investigator got such a shitty bonus on this car for the return on investment. The entire office was PISSED. We only made $1K for finding such an expensive unit.
[Damn that's under 1% the estimated value. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv986r0?context=5)|Hence why we were so angry. We saved our client all of that money and they cheaped out on us.
[How long have you been doing this and how long do you see yourself doing this work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv94wh0?context=5)|I have been doing this since roughly November or December of last year. I do see myself doing this for a while. It's a great job and I love the people I work with. I was hired on with the explicit goal of helping expand the business. The owner wants to be able to make $25K a month minimum take home after labor and overhead. This is definitely feasible with the right people.  Eventually I want to grow it to a point where I make $10K a month without even having to come into the office.
[Pros and cons?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv94wh0?context=5)|Pros: I have a set schedule, I spend more time with my family and friends, I can drink on the job, have all the tattoos I want, dress however I want, massive amounts of $$$ if I put in the effort, and not be politically correct.
[As in, not in an office?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv94wh0?context=5)|Cons: Because I'm on 100% commission I can make ZERO money and get behind on my bills. Also no benefits.
[Do you always have work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv94wh0?context=5)|Technically yes it could be done remotely but because sometimes we need a second set of eyes and we are always printing things, it is best to stay in the office. My goal is to eventually be able to do this from an RV anywhere in the country while traveling.
 |There is ALWAYS work. We have so much work that I'm behind on some of my files. Browsing Reddit doesn't help I imagine haha.
[Which was your most difficult case ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv93p6e?context=5)|*Personally* my most difficult one was locating a gentleman who had moved to a different state along with his wife. He left no forwarding info and I had no way to get a hold of him through the databases or phone numbers we had. Him and his wife did however have a Facebook which included public photos, but completely different states listed where they were living. I was able to locate them because his wife uploaded a photo of their new house which had only the number of the house. The wife's friend kept tagging the wife in halloween pictures but the wife's friend had a super common name. When I was looking through the wife's friend's husband's pictures I was able to see a partial dealer plate which helped me narrow the friends down to a specific city and state. When I looked up the friends up in our database I looked up their address in google maps and they had a very similar house number to the individual I was looking for. So I used the picture I initially found of the wife along with the street name of the friend and lo and behold I was able to locate them!
[Whee! That's my *jam*!! That ""aha"" moment :-\) How did it make you feel, to put all those pieces together?  I actually followed you from the other thread to read your AMA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv94t12?context=5)|I felt so fucking boss! I actually took a shot of tequila, did a fist pump, and then a jump kick. The feeling is AMAZING when you connect the dots. Thanks for following!
[Is it true you guys work kind of on the knife's edge of the law, and would you call your job dangerous?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv95q1y?context=5)|I would say for us specifically we stay within the confines of the law however I have heard of other companies being VERY shady such as threatening people with arrest, threatening jail time, and such things. We are successful because we don't resort to these methods. We just talk to people like they are human beings and most of the time they realize the trouble is not worth it.
 |We are fairly safe due us being inside of an office where we have no signage. We also never disclose our real names or our physical location. In the event some crazy person does find us, I always have this strapped to my hip at all times.
 |[Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/H2UwMpO)
 |I will say though that some of the agents (not us) we send in the field have been shot at and have guns pulled on them often.
[Are the agents you send specifically skilled or trained? Are they well armed? Or is it just Steve, the intern that nobody likes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv970by?context=5)|Not really. Most of the agents we send are just regular Joe's. An ""agent"" is just a fancy word for ""repo man"". I never meet the agents we send so I can't tell you if they are armed or not.
[What does your average work day look like?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv94c7g?context=5)|I get to the office at 9am. I work my cases and make calls until about noon. I open a bottle of wine at noon, have lunch, and wait for calls to come in throughout the rest of the day. From about one pm to about five pm I'm talking to individuals and doing research in between. Depending on if we had a good day making money sometimes I leave at five or maybe a little earlier. If we're having a tough day or are having a good day (or sometimes no reason) we keep a bottle of tequila we do shots from throughout the day haha. I'm 100% serious. I also browse reddit all day between working my cases such as when I'm on the phone.
[What's the craziest confrontation you've ever had? Any resources you don't mind sharing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv91fc4?context=5)|We don't go out into the field. We stay behind a desk ALL day and do all of our work on computers and the phone. The craziest one I can think of is a murderer that we had to find. Apparently the guy had killed his wife and his son for insurance money. Although that wasn't the primary reason we went looking for him, we learned about all of this after the fact.
 |Edit: Answering second part of the question.
 |Most of the resources we use are proprietary. However most of the free stuff we use is Google and Facebook. You can find almost ANYTHING on just these two websites alone.
[Thank you for taking the time this morning for this AMA. I have always been interested in this type of work and do well with research. What does it take to get into this line of work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv91yj8?context=5)|It doesn't take much, but some people are really not cut out for it due to the nature of not having a secure pay check. I would say 95% of people could not hack it because they want a steady pay check. Most people who do this either fall into it like I did, started out as an actual debt collector (I was a debt collector when I was 18 but quit because I hated the job), or start out in the bail bonds industry.
 |In my state, it doesn't take much. In other states you have to get licensed, insurance, incorporated,  and all sorts of other crazy certifications and whatnot.
[Can you name some of these databases? There are some books on skiptracing, can you recommend any? Any other good study material?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3lt66x/iama_investigator_aka_skip_tracer_aka_bounty/cv96lxk?context=5)|I unfortunately cannot recommend specifics due to it being a competitive market and we have such a leg up on our competitors but I can recommend some reading material.
 |Look up the OODA Loop, The Gift of Fear by Gavin De Becker, the entire power series by Robert Greene, and general books on human behavior. They help you recognize patterns about people.
 |Sorry to be such a downer.

3lu7g6,3,2015-09-21,What should I do...,chlgusdn,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3lu7g6/what_should_i_do/,"So, technically I'm a 5th year senior now, but I took a break last year of school. I started studying EE because I thought I should... I know that doesn't make sense, but at the time I was naiive and thought that if I wasn't going into medical or law school, I should become an engineer. So that's how my engineering path started. I should've switched majors sophomore year because I absolutely had no interest in any of my engineering courses and I hated all of them.


Fast forward to now, I took a break last year because school got too stressful. I had a 3.4 my freshman year, but starting my sophomore year, my GPA just plummeted and I barely understood anything I was studying (this should have been a red flag).

I tried to start school again now, but all my classes are really advanced and I don't have solid fundamentals for me to be able to do well in these classes. My parents are asking if I would be able to finish school by just taking it super slow aka take just 1 engineering class and 2 easy classes so that I can focus on the engineering class.


I want to be able to push through, but I really don't think I'll be able to since I don't know the topics that well and I'll have to essentially re-study everything I learned sophomore/Junior year.


I'd like to completely start over and go to a different school and either start studying accounting (I took accounting courses at a community college when I took a break from my current school and I really enjoyed them) or computer science so I can pursue web development (I had 2 internships in web dev and I actually enjoy developing).



I'm just wondering if anybody knows someone who changed their majors/started over their senior year and if they regretted it or not. A part of me wants to take it slow and try to finish my degree here (since my current school is pretty prestigious and if i start over, I'll be at a pretty lower tier school) since I spent so much time, but a part of me knows that it'll be near impossible to do. What would your recommendation be?

I want to apply for an internship with actual major companies but I'm worried that I'll be turned down since I've only completed the level 2000 courses, and one 3000 level course.

I commonly see people here on /r/cscareerquestions saying they sent out 50, 100, even more, and only got a handful of *responses*, let alone offers, if that.

I only applied for one internship in my undergrad, and I got it. Now, there are a few possibilities here:

1. The company was shit (seems unlikely, they had some big-name clients, seemed pretty well-respected in their field, and did interesting work)
2. I am amazingly skilled (again, seems unlikely, I was just an undergrad, admittedly more motivated to program than most)
3. I was phenominally lucky
4. Internship applications are just somehow fundamentally different between the US and UK.

I'd rather save my strikes for future opportunities.

3lvcdv,2,2015-09-21,Should I risk my career path to fulfill the dream of becoming an entrepreneur?,marketing_animal,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3lvcdv/should_i_risk_my_career_path_to_fulfill_the_dream/,"I've been waiting to get my comment karma up to post this so it's long overdue.

So I'm at a crossroad in my life. I'm 26 with a great Mathematics degree from a top 10 university. I focused most of my elective coursework in Statistics which led me to an internship for six months for a major corporation doing data analysis. That was great. I loved it.

I got out of school, moved back home and worked for my father's construction company helping him run the business for a year and a half. That was fun and I got to see the ins and outs of running a small company.

Then I landed a marketing internship for seven months with a startup entering into a more stable company. Eventually, they cut their internship program because of funding and I got laid off.

That was two months ago. I recently landed a job in banking doing data analysis of their marketing database to help them target marketing campaigns to increase ROI. I was literally a week in and last Friday I resigned from the new job.

I just wasn't cut out to handle the high profile nature of banking. They were at a level I never experienced and I just didn't feel like I could operate on that playing field. I posted this elsewhere on Reddit and got a comment that maybe I was just fearful of failure and that I should have given it a chance. That's probably right, but I didn't want to let the company down and my fear got the best of me.

So I'm looking back at my experience in the corporate world and wondering if it's right for me. I don't particularly enjoy it. I like the data aspect of it, but I hate all the work that I put out just to gain approval from some manager rather than working for something that I actually independently do.

For example, I loved university. I had exams sure, but I knew that if I worked my ass off, mastered the material and killed the exam, then I would get that self driven rush of accomplishment. It was a very independent setting. It was just me and my ability to master material.

I feel like it's very different in the corporate world. I have to do what they assign me, the way they want it, the deadlines they want, ect. I'm basically tied down by structure. I like to step back, plan my attack, devote time to what I think is important and just be independent.

So, I'm seriously wondering if the corporate world is for me. Ultimately, it's always been my dream to work for myself. I don't have any delusions of being the next founder of a Facebook type startup. I just want to be independent, maybe do some type of consulting, maybe e-commerce, ect. I don't have a specific set plan yet.

My problem is I don't know if I'm naturally cut out for being an entrepreneur. Everyone on here loves the idea of it or we wouldn't be on here, however, there are also some wantrepreneurs on here (myself included) who have never actually made something happen.

So far the most I've done was work on a project for about a month only to find out it wasn't financially feasible. I really did dedicate a lot of time to it and fully intended to go the distance with it. After getting to point of nearly launching, I found out that packaging costs would be astronomical given that the goods had to be shipped in a insulated box with dry ice. I won't get into it, but the value to cost ratio was way off and only an idiot would have purchased the product.

I know that my problem is I just haven't really tried enough. I think I'm just going through fear right now that I may not be cut out to be an entrepreneur. I'm probably unconsciously fishing for someone to tell me that there is no such thing as someone who is meant to be an entrepreneur I just have to make things happen and do it.

So, I'm thinking about taking the plunge and putting my career path on the line and picking up an entry-level, high school graduate, basic sales job selling solar. I got this idea from a video I saw in the comments on this sub. It was some entrepreneur that said if he had to start from scratch, he would get a sales job.

This actually is perfect for me. I suck at sales and that is (I'm assuming) a major aspect of running a business. I'm not naturally a people's person. I am articulate and smart, but I got the analytical math brain that is very literal and am naturally quiet. I want to get paid to literally practice all day long becoming personal and persuasive (not in a manipulative kind of way, just in a way that helps me become a better leader).

One of the things the guy in the video said is he would start out in consulting. He would get his sales skills up by getting the sales job, he would study some field such as digital marketing, then he would hit the ground selling his service. First, he would put together a plan for a small business, offer to do it for free in return for two referrals and then start upping his fee. Eventually, when he makes enough money consulting he would quit his sales job. He would then invest his proceeds into bigger business opportunities.

I really like his logic and think that would be an ideal path for me, but I am just scared to put everything on the line, exit my career path in the corporate world and take a basic job in sales. If it doesn't work out then I'll be kinda screwed, however, I'm unhappy in the corporate world and don't want to do that for the rest of my life so maybe I should.

Thanks for reading the wall of text. I hope you guys and gals have some input. I would really appreciate it.

TL;DR: Got a great degree and resume, young in my career, don't know if cut out for the super structured corporate environment, thinking about getting a basic sales job to improve sales skills, want to start out doing some type of consulting, then want to move into a less service oriented business"

If I accept one job offer but get another job offer that's better is it possible to accept the newer job offer and reject/decline the previous job offer?  For example if I get a job offer in October for $44,000  and accept it but in November get a job offer for $50,000 can I somehow decline a job offer I've already received and accept the new one?

2. Can you negotiate salaries with government jobs?  One of the huge employers in my area is a military base that hires a lot of software developers and electrical engineers.  Talking with them it sounds like there are certain conditions if you qualify you change ranks or something with pay.  Does this mean you can't negotiate with them and have to take whatever initial offer they extend?

3. Do you have any general tips for negotiating salaries?

4. Do you have any general tips for getting more job offers as a college Senior?

Any and all responses are appreciated!  

*Miscellaneous information:* I am graduating this upcoming Spring around May 2016 so I have began interviewing with some companies to get job offers after I graduate.  I go to an in-state school and my GPA is a measly 3.2/4.0.  I unfortunately have no internships and only a few projects on GitHub.

3lvpo2,1,2015-09-21,Dream Job Dilemma,puzzledninja,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3lvpo2/dream_job_dilemma/,"Okay so I have bit of a dilemma. I'm 22 years old and just started my first full time job a month ago. I recently graduated from my four year college, where I worked consistently as an office assistant even on holiday breaks and in the summer. I went straight from high school to my college (I didn't go to community college or take a year off or anything). I commuted to college so I lived at home and didn’t get that stereotypical college experience you see in the movies. Anyway back to my problem. It's been my dream job to work for a certain department of the government since I was in high school.
 
I never really thought it would happen, no one else really did either they thought I was aiming too high. I figured maybe after 10 years of work experience I would be edible to work this certain gov job. Fast forward to march, where I am sitting bored at my internship when I get an email from my college saying send your resumes for that agency and we'll hand them to our person on the inside. I figured why not, I got nothing else to lose and sent in my resume. I didn't hear back for months.
 
It's june now, I've graduated and im on the job hunt when I get an email saying I have a phone interview with this agency. I freaked out. The interview didn't go well at all I thought I blew it. But I got an email a few weeks later saying im a potential candidate reply in a week with your decision, You'd think I would say yes right? wrong I denied them.
 
There are many reasons I decided to that, but let me fill you in so you can understand my conflict more thoroughly. In april, I meant someone who would change and impact my life forever. We started dating which means so much to me cause I haven't had a boyfriend before. Him and I moved in together to an apartment, have a 1 year lease. this gov job would require me to move about 4 hours away from where we live. He was upset about the job at first, he questioned why I applied at all. I explained to him that a) I didn’t apply I just sent in a resume and b) it was before I even knew who he was.
 
So I reject that first offer because as sad as this sound I felt like I was finally starting to live my life for the first time in June and I didn't want to lose what I just worked really hard to gain. But to my surprise they came back at me with the offer again but had raised the salary 8k!! How can you so no to that, you just can't.
 
So I continued pursing this gov job and now im in the process of my background investigation to get a security clearance. This is where I'm stuck and need some guidance.
 
This gov job would be a career, one that I would have for many years! but im young still, do I really want to commit myself that?
 
I have so much that I haven't experienced and no body else understands this when I explain it to them because they can't relate since they've already had that leisure and fun time that I didn't. Basically I spent my teen years like a young adult, working and dedicated to my education so I can get a dream job like this one. But now, I feel like I missed out and that If i get this government job that I'd be throwing away my new young adult life that i've just established for myself too.
 
They say I'm being selfish because many people work hard and for years to be considered by this agency and they’re end game for people in my field of study. All everyone keeps telling me is think of the money but who cares about that when I'll be alone and unhappy again stuck in a regimented life with no fun again. I don't want to do that to myself again. Already at my full time job I feel like I've lost so much free time and It'll be ten times worse working for the government.
 
(TL;DR skip to here:) 
To put things into more perceptive one of the government workers who interviewed me explained that most people who are candidates for this job are in their mid to late 30s. By your 30s, you've already settled down, had tons of fun and life experiences already. But for me, I'm 22 and so lost on what im doing with my life.
 
I thought this job was my dream job and what I wanted but it's happening to soon (I'm not sure if it's what I want anymore). I haven't had a break! I don't want to work in a strict environment for the next 15+ years. I don't want to be stuck and throw my life away yet again. (I was on verge of suicide in march because I had felt that my life was pointless and I feel that If I continue with this path that I’ll feel that way yet again. When will I have finally have my freedom I so desire, when I retire and it’s too late?!! talk about a waste)
 
Let me know what you think. Should I keep going for that dream job with the comfortable salary now in my early 20s or wait and live alittle, work some full or even part time jobs in the meantime and see what goes from there? Also if you've experienced anything similar to this tell me how you choose your path and that you understand my struggle cause no one else does, they think im crazy."

Below, I'm mostly rehashing my post from the link above, but I have made some minor changes.  

Because of HR, I can't post details here, but if you are interested in a data analyst position in a new department in a new line of business in a growing company, please message me. I'm not a recruiter. Since we are new, I can't promise even 50% of your time will be working on fun stuff (predictive models IMO), but we are headed in that direction, and we do spend time on it. Inevitably, much time will be spent in the dirty world of scrubbing dirty data. We use Tableau, R, SQL, Python, and Excel, but no need to know all of those exact tools. Since bringing in new analysts, we have started to use a few new tools as they have introduced us to some neat tools!

Bit of background: 23 years old. BA in Business Grad. Want to switch to IT because I enjoy it. Only experience is having the odd personal wordpress site in the past and being good at fixing my own IT issues, setting up home servers. Little things like that.

Decided to start teaching myself web development. Focusing on front end right now - mostly Javascript, HTML, CSS. Dipping into JQuery and Node.js too. Really enjoying it. My goal is to make a little web app that scrapes Dublin cinema times and combines them into one site within the next month. 

Anyways, I applied for a few entry-level IT positions. I just got a call for an interview on Friday. The position is an IT Helpdesk internship. It's in a a multinational. They have maybe a couple hundred staff in Ireland. I'll be one of 3 or 4 people on the helpdesk team. Duties will be Active Directory management, remote user support, printer management, basic wifi/connectivity support, OSD build and physical deployment of laptops and desktops, installing user software etc... I'm taking all of that from the ad. I can guess what maybe 50% of it actually means. 

Should I take this position (if it's offered)? 

Would this look good on a resumé when applying for Web Dev internships at a later date?

Whats the day-to-day of a small IT Helpdesk jobs like?

What kind of things should I brush up on for the interview? I'm planning on reading a few chapters from a textbook and binging on YouTube tutorials. Any topic suggestions welcome!

Do IT Helpdesk internships generally pay? The ad doesn't specify a pay. I don't think I could go 2 months without any pay, let alone 6. 

My main worry is that I'd be going in the wring direction if I went for a helpdesk internship. However, maybe any IT internship is better than none? I wouldn't feel capable yet of being in a web development internship which is ultimately where I want to be. 

Cheers guys. Any advice or wisdom would be much appreciated.

In my 6+ years of experience in the industry, I've been seeing the following trends:

* You have experience in QA\Automation? Then you are **only** qualified to continue to get QA\Automation jobs.  It doesn't matter if you're technical enough as an Automation Engineer or SDET to be able to easily jump over the wall and do development.
* You have background\experience in PHP and LAMP stack development.  Then you are **only** qualified to continue to get PHP developer jobs.  If the industry for PHP developers shrinks, then you might be screwed in the future, since PHP developers are already underpaid to begin with (or so is the perception) and most other developers don't consider PHP to be a ""real"" language.
* You have background\experience as a Business Analyst.  Well guess what, you'll be relegated to working BA jobs for the next ten years.
* You have experience in C# and want to jump into Java, or vice-versa? You yourself know it's easy to do since the two languages are 90% similar, but the hiring managers and recruiters will always want people with more relevant, more recent, or just more experience period.

Even though the average person, especially young idealist-eyed people like you, are certainly capable of learning and picking up new things quickly, it seems that the entire industry is dominated by older people who have become stuck in their ways.  With old age comes loss of cohesion and learning ability.  Older people, such as notoriously the hiring managers and their drone recruiters, don't want someone who has related experience and can quickly learn new things.

They prefer to hire people who have several years of experience because they don't want to expend time and money to get them to ramp up, they want someone who has done that exact kind of thing before so they can hit the ground running.  This means the concept of ""career transition"" is all but a fading dream for most.

I can't even imagine how difficulty it must be for some of you entry-level people, once you start getting rejected left and right for not having any ""real"" experience or for ""only"" having a year of experience, and when you realize that they don't regard internships as being ""real"" experience and almost nobody wants to hire interns, and so you have to represent yourself as having been a ""real"" employee at that company (through malleable job titles on your resume) in order to get taken seriously by hiring managers and recruiters."

I say this because tomorrow I am interviewing for a google internship, and while they say the approach matters most, I am a bit skeptical. A huge number of people apply for google internships, and only a small portion pass the interviews. Given the large magnitude of candidates and very limited seats, wouldn't they choose the people who were able to get the best solutions to problems in interviews on the spot in like 5 minutes and also explain their reasoning? Ergo, just coming up with an approach is not enough, and only the most genius people get in.

I told my nurse practitioner about my experiences and we ended up deciding on 20mg Adderall (generic) XR everyday, as well as Lamictal 25mg as a mood stabilizer. As a working student my days are OFTEN 6AM - 11pm between internship, classes, and homework. 

When I went back two weeks later for a medication review (this was this previous Friday) I told her that I was crashing around 4:30pm and my classes didn't even start til 5pm and it was not working. She prescribed me 25 mg Adderall XR for the morning, and to take the 20mg around 2pm in the afternoon to avoid a crash between the two and have a smooth transition. Also upped Lamictal to 50mg.

Now I can't sleep at all, even though I took the 20mg at 2pm. I'm zombified later in the day because I didn't sleep but the amphetamines are keeping me awake. It is definitely working, I'm doing markedly better at work and at school. But are the side effects worth it? She decided on Adderall because I couldn't exactly remember my experience with Ritalin (so she ex'ed all methylphenidates) and I said that vyvanse gave me a super dry mouth (so does Adderall but not as bad).

I spoke to a couple friends also prescribed various ADHD Rx and they mentioned things like Strattera, Wellbutrin, and Concerta and not having these negative side effects like mood swings and crashing etc. My body is really sensitive to medication and I'm afraid to switch to anything else because I can't afford it in my day to day life to succumb to the ADHD side effects even for a little. 

**So** I really want to know, for those of you that have switched medications from one type of amphetamine to the other or from amphetamine to methylphenidate based Rx what was your experience and how did you *know* that one was better than the other.

**TL;DR** People who have switched from one medication to the other, how did you know the original was wrong, what was your experience switching, and how did you know you're prescription is **definitely** know this was the right one? (Applies to everyone I guess)"

Upon graduation this year, I had been a Software engineer intern as a start-up working on C#, JS, SQL.. tiring but fun stuff, however after hearing their full-time offer, I quit. I graduate with 3.5 GPA and have about 4 other internships (2 unpaid) so I thought I had enough for the job market, but I was wrong. I had only 4 interviews in 3 months and could not land into any software dev position.

Being desperate and frustrated, I ended up accepting an offer as a Cloud Engineer (AWS, Unix, Networking, I found them easy but will take a lot of time to master).After nearly a month, I haven't been much productive except writing some automation scripts in Linux. IMO, I think this job is easier than a software development role.

Most of people I spoke with told me I should find another job because my major is CS, which is suppose to develop, I'm not sure about that but please don't get me wrong, I'm OK with this job as long as I have income, but it seems managing and maintaining systems are not what I learned in school and not really my interest. I'm always concerned is the pay range, would a Software guy make more than a Cloud guy at the present or in the future? Honestly, I really need to make income now that I'm graduated.

What should I do, stay with this job to make income and hoping that they pay is good as I advance? or keep looking for new opportunities?"

Many years ago, I worked for an MSP that supported a large corporate office.  My team was responsible for the usual desktop support - hardware issues, software installs, etc.  One day I get a ticket that a machine won't boot, so I head on over there to check it out.

When I roll up on this desk, I'm greeted with the sight of the PC COMPLETELY disassembled.  And I mean completely - every component is out and spread out (very neatly) on the desk, all the way down to the MB.

""What's, um... what's going on?""

I had never encountered an end-user tearing down their machine so I wasn't quite sure how to process this.

The user looks over and says, ""Oh good, are you here to put my computer back together?  The other guy said he'd send someone.""

""Who's the other guy?""

""You know, the new guy.  He said he'd fix it for me.""

I have other tickets piling up, so I figure I'll figure out mystery guy later.

I reassemble everything, turn the machine on, and I see right away that it's not booting because someone left a floppy disk in the drive.  I pop it out, and everything is fine.

After things slow down, I go on a hunt &amp; eventually piece together what happened.

Another department (outside of IT) had hired an engineering student as an intern.  He was ""good with computers"", so they asked him to look at this machine &amp; see if he could fix it.  He took it apart ""to look for problems"" and then couldn't remember how it all went back together, panicked, and called it into the helpdesk as 'machine won't boot'.

I'd love to say that he got canned for that, but turns out he was the son of someone important in the company.  He tried an internship with engineering, but couldn't keep up so they shifted him over to the Business Unit Rep team (interface between users &amp; IT).  

This was apparently the second machine he had completely dismantled, so I had some rather harsh words with him about where his responsibility ended, which I clearly defined as anything short of physically touching a PC.

He was there for another 6 months before he went back to school, where rumor has it he eventually failed out.

I still imagine he's out there somewhere, randomly taking machines apart as his first troubleshooting step."

I interned at company X this past summer. They loved me, and I really liked them. At the end of my internship, my boss brought me into his office and said that he wanted to give me an offer right then, but because of bureaucracy and some difficulty with the private equity firm that owns the company, he couldn't do it yet. He said that I should expect to get the offer within two weeks.

This makes me very excited, because I loved working there, and I thought that it would be a great place for me to get acquainted with software engineering as an application of theory.

Fast forward two weeks, I have gotten no such offer.
I got in touch with one of my co-workers to ask for advice, and she told me that some of the developers have been asking about what happened to me and whether or not I was going to be hired. She encouraged me to reach out to my boss. So I asked him what's going on, and he said that there's been a little difficulty getting the req open, and that I should get the offer in a week.

At the beginning of the next week (this week), the university relations manager emails me to ask me to be  representative for this company at an upcoming recruiting event at my school. This rubs me the wrong way because they haven't given me an offer, yet here they are asking me to go help them hire more people.

I haven't responded to her yet. I don't really know what to say.

I'd be happy to go to the event and talk about my experiences over the summer, because I had a blast. But this whole ordeal has put a bad taste in my mouth. 

If they aren't going to give me an offer, I need to go to this event to focus on getting hired by somewhere else because I graduate in December.

Part of me is thinking of throwing the whole thing out because if the process of hiring someone is really this hard, would I really want to work there?

But on the other hand, I really did have a fantastic time at this company.

I don't know what to do."

I am asking because Google seems to be offering the same internship position (Winter 2016) but at different locations (US/Canada). Would it hurt my chances if I apply for both locations? 

**Additional Questions:**

1. Winter 2016 application deadline is on Sept 30th and they also have applications for Summer 2016 (again at different locations) with the deadline date set at Nov 30th, would it be wise to apply for both locations for that application as well?

2. It mentions that after the completion of your internship, you must go back to school for the continuation of your program. Is this strictly enforced? 

I am in a dilemma because my expected graduation date is April 2016 and would prefer a Winter internship so I can go back and finish school. If I were to get the Summer internship instead, do I simply hold off taking courses in the winter and come back to finish my courses after the summer internship?

Would love to hear some advice on this.

I've been told many times by peers that they think I'm talented in coding. I've done a lot of solo projects for fun.

But I am not confident in my ability to code, and I'm too scared of making mistakes. I essentially do the ""let me check 1+1 on my computer"" equivalent of programming. As a result, I go to my coworkers and bosses and ask questions that I already know answers too. I look at a problem, and get scared and right away ask for help. But I've been through much larger challenges in personal projects and though it might've taken some time, I've figured out solutions to them. This seems to be a problem when I'm in an environment where I feel like ""everyone here is amazing but me"". Because of those frequent questions, my bosses are losing confidence in me to do more challenging work and say they would assign more mundane work if I can't prove to them I can handle difficult work. But I've done difficult projects before so I want to take those on. 

This seems to be a recurring problem. Even at my last internship, my beginning was ROUGH. They said I wasn't performing well. I kept asking questions for some reason, and kept being scared. I don't know how, but at some point in the middle of that internship, I somehow picked up my slack and became completely autonomous, to the point of even assigning myself tasks. My manager and his client said I blew them away. In fact, the client insisted I get the highest performance evaluation, which is what I got. 

Basically, I want to avoid these problems in the future, but I'm also looking for advice on how to cope with my current struggles. I'm just too afraid and scared, and ask everything I already know just to reaffirm to myself that I'm not ""dumb"" and know what I'm doing. But that's not really working autonomously, and would obviously make others lose confidence in me. "

This is possible because I have a program called HFS+ from Paragon that gives PCs the ability to read and write Mac-formatted drives.  The mac-drives worked perfectly fine until I upgraded to Windows 10.  Now, even though my PC recognizes them, they do not appear in Windows Explorer.  I checked HFS+, and it was functioning normally.  I then went into Device Manager and tried updating the drivers and was told that they were up to date.  I looked under Universal Serial Bus Controllers and found that ""Microsoft USB 2.0 Host Controller Simulator"" had an exclamation mark next to it.  I looked at the device properties to see what's wrong and it said that the device was not working (code 10).  I updated it and it said it was up to date.  I then clicked troubleshoot and Windows said it couldn't find the problem.  I did find under ""events"" that Windows uninstalled that driver and attempted to reinstall it several times before giving up.  I searched all over the internet and found a couple people with the same problem, but no responses to their questions.  Without any options, I decided to uninstall Microsoft USB 2.0 Host Controller Simulator.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find any place to reinstall it (there were a ton of sites where you could download it from, but I don't trust them).  I even checked Asus Support (my motherboard's manufacturer) and found nothing.  I uninstalled one of the drives (#2) in Device Manager and restarted my computer hoping the proper drivers would reinstall, but this did not happen.  Now, my computer won't even recognize it, calling it an ""unknown device.""

Being able to work from these external drives at home is crucial for school and my internship, so this is very urgent.  I sincerely appreciate your input!

I'm using a custom PC built by an acquaintance.  He used it for gaming, but I bought it from him for video editing and other multimedia work.   
System specs:
Windows 10 Professional (64-bit) - formerly Windows 7 Professional
Intel 3930k Processor
Asus P9x79 Iga 2011 Motherboard
24 GB RAM
MSA Nvidia 660ti Graphics Card

#1: WD My Passport 2tb for Mac
#2: [Toshiba Canvio Basics 3.0 1 TB Portable Hard Drive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005J7YBRW?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00) - This is the one I uninstalled in Device Manager.  

Thank you!

PS: I feel like upgrading to Windows 10 was a mistake as my PC no longer runs as smoothly as it used to.  Would reverting to Windows 7 help, or make things worse?

EDIT:
I need to reinstall Microsoft USB 2.0 Host Controller Simulator.  How would I do this?  I can't find it on either Asus's or Microsoft's websites.

And when I feel like shit I try to make sure everyone else is happy, and in a good mood, try to be extra nice to people. And seeing other people happy makes me less depressed. So I was ringing people up and a few guys were saying jokes about how we ask to many questions, and ""what are you going to ask for our first born child next?"" I thought that was hilarious and wanted to try out on a couple customers. 

So these two older woman come up to my line (about 60's) and I went through the questions with them and one of them was joking about allot of questions, so I go after all the questions, ""and that'll be your first born child next haha."" And one of the ladies says with her voice all crackly, ""it's a little too late for that."" Then she starts to tear up and begins to cry. The other woman just goes right to comforting her and says, ""it's OK, it's OK, he didn't know, he didn't know."" As soon as I heard that I immediately shut my mouth. I couldn't speak for the rest of the transaction. I couldn't make eye contact. I started tearing up myself. I finished up the transaction and I felt and still feel like shit for triggering the memory of her first born dying. I thought I was going to be funny, but I intern made two woman feel horrible and made my day worse than it already is.

TLDR: Asked woman for her first born child as a joke. I triggered a memory of her child's death. She cried  I cried, I feel like shit."

3m4gey,2,2015-09-23,Ask for a raise or switch company? Intern to hire on,butterrz,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3m4gey/ask_for_a_raise_or_switch_company_intern_to_hire/,"So a bit of a backstory.

I am finishing my degree in computer science in december 2015, and have currently been hired on as an intern at a small firm since the beginning of august 2015.  The position is called an ""internship"" but honestly I feel like I would do the same amount of work if I was hired on regardless.  Come december, I will have the opportunity to stay with this company, or part ways and thank them for the opportunity.  

My question to you guys is should I ask for a raise if I were to be technically hired on?   I feel like I am just hired on as an ""intern"" to have a lower pay, which I'm fine with for now because that's how I view myself.  But I know, once I get hired on, I'll be doing the same exact thing and feel like I deserve more money.  Is it out of the question to ask for more money? or would I look greedy if I asked for more money after only a few months with them? 

Just to throw some numbers out, They are paying me $20/hr as an intern, and honestly I'd be happy with making $25/hr when they hired me on full.  Is a $5 increase too much? I also ask because I don't really know my own worth so I don't want to be taken advantage of, but I also don't want to seem greedy.  I live in Portland, OR if that helps with the number crunching. 

edit: I do really love working here, it's very close to where I live, and my co-workers are very nice and friendly. "

Lots of questions, please help.",heyheyloretta,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/3m4tdw/help_with_harassment_lots_of_questions_please_help/,"I actually have a ton of questions and I have no clue what to do about any of the things that are happening at my new place of employment. 

First, here are a few things going down...
1. This is a large company, but there is no HR person? The CFO calls himself the ""HR Dept."" but does nothing as far as hiring or handling any employee concerns. He doesn't accept phone calls and has fired people before just because they have entered his office without an appointment. 

2. The lady that hired me is a marketing person that shares an office upstairs. She has multiple interns that she is not paying and they are not getting school credit for it. 

3. The place has MULTIPLE lawsuits for not paying employees and when I ask anyone about when I will get my paycheck they all just laugh and say, ""IF you get your paycheck."" This is common with everyone that works here. A co-worker has told me that the past 4 checks have been very late or they just don't exist. 

4. I'm not going to say where this place is, but the people that work here are only here because of the international recognition. (TV shows, press, etc.)


Now here's my personal issue.
I would've quit already but I am waiting until I have a paycheck in my hand first. I don't trust this place to send me one and I'm not about to walk away from 3 weeks of full time employment without getting paid for it. But today there is a co-worker that I have (I'll nick name him ""Bob"") already had issues with since working here. He is on drugs and is a jerk to everyone. He even makes up names for himself and lies about being the owner of the company and then customers will call and yell at me about it. But today, this is what happened:

I was standing at the front desk helping 8 customers.
Co-worker A: Do you know where the packing tape is?
Me: No, I don't, but after I finish with these guys I can help you look. Give me just a second please. 
Bob (was standing near by): Well, what do you f***ing know? Do you know what city you live in? Where you parked your car? F***ing moron. 

Then he walked away. 
This was all in front of the customers that I was helping and I just stood there in shock not knowing what to do. He has said multiple things to me before. Stuff about not being capable because I'm a woman. Stuff about me being Native American. He calls my gay co-working a f**got all the time. Every customer of any race that comes in, he has to say some sort of snide/hurtful remark. He's very, very racist, but then always brags about his ""hot middle eastern wife.""

Since there is no HR dept, what do I do? I plan on quitting right away (as soon as I get my paycheck), but I've seen the list of lawsuits already against this place and I know that if I were to do the same, it would get thrown onto a pile of literally hundreds of others. 

If this helps, I live in the state of California. 

Is there anything I can do?  Is it worth my time, since I know I will be quitting as soon as I find a new job?"

3m5fin,3,2015-09-23,When will companies in Vancouver (BC) finish up internship recruiting for summer 2016?,ffranglais,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3m5fin/when_will_companies_in_vancouver_bc_finish_up/,"**Boring preamble**

Last night, I went up to SFU and sat in on a presentation by Microsoft student recruiting. I go to community college at the moment, and am beginning the second-year course in data structures. I have yet to begin the second-year core courses in computer systems or software engineering, however.

I spoke with current interns, alumni, and the university recruiter after the presentation, and this is what I was told:

* Since I'm not an SFU student yet, I am not eligible to join the summer 2016 recruitment cycle for Microsoft internships down in Redmond. I would have to be accepted into the compsci major, and since the department is not accepting applications for the spring 2016 term, I would have to do an internal transfer for the summer 2016 term, so that's no good.

* I don't have enough solid experience in coding projects, just one little personal project in Python that uses Beautiful Soup to search for a string in a web page. Also, I'm only in early second-year standing, which means my experience level is more appropriate for the Foundry program in Vancouver (which only pays $3000/month) or the Explorer program in Redmond; full internships, I was told, are seen as temporary full-time employees, which means I would have the responsibility of a f/t dev.

* Microsoft's internship vacancies for summer 2015 were filled up by October 20*14*. I have no reason to believe this year won't be any different.

I came to the conclusion that I'm not ready for student or industry internships at Microsoft yet. I feel I should use internship experience with a Vancouver company as a stepping stone for the ""big show"", which would be a subsequent internship with an SF/Seattle big tech company.

**Next steps?**

So, the moral here is I shouldn't be setting my sights too high. I should get some coding experience, start off at a local company, and *then* go south. The pathways to get coding experienced have been discussed many times on this subreddit so I won't go into much detail there.

Now I have to figure out when Vancouver companies finish their recruiting for the summer. I already know big US companies end by October/November. Hootsuite already has [co-op postings up](https://www.bcjobs.ca/jobs/co-op-software-engineer-vancouver-332259?utm_source=Indeed&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SoftwareDeveloper) with an expiration date of November. SAP has already posted their internship positions.

My guess would be I should target smaller startups in Vancouver (e.g. Clio) who have a bit of a harder time getting internship spots filled, and for whom the process might end in February or March.

Alternatively, maybe some decent startups in SF or Seattle are willing to take on interns from Canada, and aren't as competitive as Microsoft or another large/high-profile company (e.g. Dropbox, Quora). I'm not looking for a tip tier company here!"

I want to go into web development/design, &amp;amp;amp; apart from the artistic aspect of designing websites I have some experience with the lighter side of coding like HTML/CSS/PHP and was looking forward to delving into other languages.

However, I understand computer science involves math. While I am good at basic math, I am struggling in my college algebra class (which I had to take a prerequisite beginning algebra class to get into because my placement test scores in math were too low) and will be lucky if I can pull a C or B...my overall GPA is currently a 3.8 and it is hitting my self esteem that for math it takes me a longer time to complete assignments and understand concepts. 

Another reason my grade may be so low is that I'be started off the course with a poor grasp of time management and end up trying to cram chapter's worth of material in one day in order to take the test. I failed some grades and now my current grade for this class is awful, so I am hoping to bring it up to at least a C or B over the course of the semester. I don't think an A is possible at this point. 

I noticed I am a slow ""programmer"" if you call designing websites programming, but at least when I do that I am really enjoying myself and don't feel discouraged.

I had my first semester which consisted of 4 classes, only 1.5 of which brought value (Programming in R  was the best programming course, including compared to many of those online, and Warehousing, in a very hands off approach, ie watching the teacher type n the parser for datasets and running it on AWS) The class on Data Science was just copying pasting pretty much Python sckit-learn code instead of learning numpy etc.

I am finishing up my third week this semester and I feel like we have barely touched anything hands on and recently relevant (ie just some basic SQL queries, instead of AWS solid examples, the Machine Learning aspects are all theoretical, and we haven't done ANYTHING for visualizations)

Part of me is thinking stay in and see if I can get an internship with a HUGE(well funded series B) medical device startup the head of the program (MIT CSAIL grad with friend in there who told me try back in Autumn due to Series B funding being hectic) or even Google's BOLD program. The other part of me is thinking I have 7-8 months (vacation or not) of time left until I get my degree. I recently took up Scala over the summer, after my first semester, and LOVE it. I love the functional programming paradigm  and I not only find it intuitive to use functional programming but Scala's syntax much kinder and more scalable than python. Although UI have to say I miss the stat and visualization packages out of R.

So my question is...should I leave to work on a project myself (healthcare/adtech, some of which's data is hard to get outside of Kaggle) developing my Scala/Python/programming skills at home, in a bootcamp, that are HIGHLY valuable to post grad income but not being taught deeply in this program or to modern day relevance (ie Scalable, in a Python Spark/Hadoop environment) ....or grind on something the next 7 months or so that might not be fruitful.


Any thoughts? $16k in tuition for the semester is due within a week and I have to decide."

I have about a year and two quarters left to finish my bachelors, despite being in school for 3 years already. I took a bunch of technical school classes to start off for my first year and jumped right into programming, but then decided I'd rather have a 4 year degree so I went for my Bachelors. My goal is to become a web application developer.

Things have changed greatly for me over the last year. I have a long term girlfriend and we are expecting our daughter to arrive on November 1st, and that's going to take up a big portion of my time.

Granted, despite this I wouldn't drop out if I didn't have any other routes. I am currently developing a web application for a freelance client that will help him and other users in his business manage their projects, and I'm being paid a decent amount for it. However, now that school has started back up and I'm taking 4 classes I'm finding it really hard to put time into the application, which costs me money and can eventually mess up this opportunity if I fall too far behind.

I also need to be saving money for my daughter's arrival, but college is draining every penny I have despite taking out maximum loans (about $1,500 a quarter). My books go for $200+ and my tuition is $3,000 a quarter, not to mention paying for my living expenses.

The biggest reason I want to drop out is because I feel like I'm wasting my time. Computer science degrees cover a general spectrum of computer science related topics, and I only need to focus on software development. About 3/4 of my classes aren't very useful. From my understanding, having a portfolio is much more effective for landing a job than a degree is (although having both is obviously better), and once I finish this current web application I will have something solid to show off as well as an internship opportunity I have available to me if I can take it full time which could turn into a paying job.

I paid my friend a lump sum to live with her from Feb-June earlier this year.  At the beginning of May, I found a summer internship out of state, and told her I would likely take it and leave by end of May, and offered to forfeit the amount I paid through June after I left and help her look for a replacement.

She thought I committed to stay through her lease, which ends in September.  I never did, and I have in email communication that that was not the arrangement.  She demanded I either pay the rest of the rent through September, or move out immediately at the time (which was beginning of May).

Again, I already paid to live there through June, and I told her I couldn't do either of those 2 things she was demanding.  We argued, she said she was gonna call the cops, and I told her to do so because I have proof I paid to live there.  Turns out, it was an illegal sublease because it was a one bedroom apartment, and the cops told me I have to go because my name is not on the lease.  The cops heard the story, told her she needs to pay me back the rent owed for forcing me out, and I left.

I tried sending a certified mail, but she wasn't there and I don't think she ever got it.  Now she is possibly moving out, and while I do have her email and phone number, I don't know where she soon may be living.

I want to get into AI, or at least machine learning, professionally. I feel that that's the only way I will enjoy my job again, maybe it's because the novelty of programming computers wore off, or just because programming advertising stuff is boring as hell.

Any tips?

Ok, I graduated with a CS degree a little over two years ago from an average school as one of the top students in our class. I was not by any means one of the smartest people, I just worked really hard during college. I had an internship the summer before my senior year at one of the big banks on the storage team. Over those couple months I honestly didn't get to do much technical work, just some data analysis stuff here and there. I ended up getting an offer to return full time after graduation, but to a completely different role. I didn't know the specifics of what I would be doing, but after going through interviews and getting a few offers, I decided to come back (Big name on resume and money was good). 

The role I ended up with is in L2 application support. I think this is a role that doesn't exist in many companies, so let me briefly explain: We own ""production"" for our apps. When AD wants to get something out into production, they go through us. So we do the actual deployment of applications. On top of that, we handle other tasks which AD can't perform due to separation of concerns (regulations). It's all very basic stuff. When there is some issue with an application, the L1 team contacts us, and most of the time we just contact L3 (AD), and do whatever they say to fix it. 
Or if Tomcat goes down, we restart it. 

I can't deny I've enjoyed how chill the job is, but I have my days where I feel completely useless, invaluable, and I worry about losing this job eventually (Especially because I haven't picked up any valuable skills). Recently, that's most of my days, so I've been trying to figure out how to move on to something better. 

From what I see at my company, I feel like there are two general types of roles. Either you're a developer, or you work on the infrastructure side of things (It could be a DBA, SA, storage engineer, network engineer, etc). I'm having a hard time deciding which route to pursue exactly. I don't necessarily love either one. In school I would say I was a good programmer. Didn't exactly like the theory side of CS, but I did enjoy coding to solve the problems which were presented to us. Again, I'm not the best at it though. My favorite class was databases, although we never really got too in depth. 

In order to make the move, I know I need to invest some of my time teaching myself whatever skills the route I choose requires. I'm having a really hard time deciding what to study exactly. I've been studying for the Red Hat SA certification on and off recently, since that interests me somewhat. What to do with that eventually? Maybe move into a security role which would interest me, or DBA like I wanted to do before. Either way, the starting point would be SA (And by SA I mean supporting the Linux servers in which some critical applications run, not an SA who deals with users and whatnot). Other times, I feel like I should go into development because there are a lot more of those jobs, and the pay seems to be better than doing other roles in technology? 

To sum it up, I have a degree in CS, I'm 24. I've wasted the last two years of my life in terms of gaining skills for my career. I don't necessarily love technology or CS the way most people here do. But I know that I can work hard and be good at what I do. I feel like I'm in this not because I love it, but because I need a job to pay for the life I want (That might sound bad, others out there like that?). I don't want to worry about going into something that won't be around in 20 years or something either. Anyways, taking all that into account, any advice on what to do exactly? How to decide what to learn? Which route to go? 

Thanks a lot!

3mbt68,14,2015-09-25,"(TL;DR) Advice request: love experimental life sciences, but done with pursuing a PhD",I_Cannot_stop,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/3mbt68/tldr_advice_request_love_experimental_life/,"Dear all,

I would like to ask for your advice, especifically to people from the field of life sciences (molecular biology, medicine, physiology).

My background: BSc in Biology from Argentina, needed three more years than the usual to graduate (due familiar problems, economic crisis, me being only son and incredibly insecure, having to work part time in some occassions, among other things). Finished in february 2009 with a very average GPA (7.21 out of 10).

Had a lot of issues finding a studentship in Argentina (went fr4om a lab without funding, to a lab where is suffered bullying and mobbing and got expelled to a great lab in heart ischemia but without funding for a scohlarship).

Worked during 2012 in the private sector (cardiac drugs Pharmacovigilance) just to save money for moving abroad. Crappy job, crappy company, but hey... it was a salary.

In the end of 2012 I moved to Spain to pursue a MSc in Biotechnology and Biomedicine using my money savings of the year. Topic of my MSc Thesis was related to brain ischemia. Great environment, lot of help, enjoyed work and my stay. The downside is that they had little funding. Began my PhD there but it was hard due to VERY limited funding (I had no scholarship and the lab had no grant) I worked a second job to cover my life expenses: for about 6 months I slept 5-6 hours per day.

In february 2015, after doing CV carpetbombing over all Europe got admitted for a PhD In Belgium where funding is only renewed for 1 year after evaluation. Detail: the position was intended originally for a postdoc, but as they saw my motivation they offered me the position. It was a position in one of the top pharma companies of the world, doing research in ischemia-induced heart failure. Entered and began my training in surgery (which was hard, took me a lot of time but I loved it). In the last two months I have been doing extensive training and working 9-10 hours a day at full capacity.

Long story short, a few days ago my supervisors and the chief of the department had a meeting with me and told me honestly that it would be very likely (99.9% probability) that I don't get funding for the next year. They think I am clever, enthusiastic, optimistic and hard-working; however my learning curve is taking longer than they thought. It was a warm meeting, in the sense that it was an open conversation and sincere. They told me also that they don't see me as ""laboratory science material"" in the sense that I don't have the talents to plan and perform experiments with the high standards they have. They said that instead of cutting my salary now they will leave until the completion of the year so that  I can find out what to do next

Truth be told, I didn't feel bad nor depressed, nor angry. I thanked them for the opportunity to work here and train myself and asked them what I could do for them. They encouraged me to write a review on my topic of research and a project report (challenge accepted).

After 15 years of struggling in science (I will be 35 in november and began my BSc studies in 2000) I am tired of the PhD race. I am tired of not having a girlfriend (never had, I was too busy and poor studying or doing internships), I am tired of not doing anything just to keep all my energy for my PhD, I am tired of the science environment where most of the women I met are unattractive, taken or old (sorry, ladies), I am tired of the lack of funding everywhere, I am tired of keep pushing for the sake of keep pushing because I am not a quitter. I see that the academic career is not as nice as I thought (limited salaries, excessive duties, lack of stability, relocation every 3 years for a postdoc or tenure, ecc) and I don't want to live the rest of my life for my job.  I want to have a life, get a girlfriend, marry and kids. My job is not my EXCLUSIVE priority as it used to be.

As academia is not my cup of coffee anymore, I think of a different career. However, I love working with my hands (animals, and laboratory techniques), I love being creative and I love challenges. I am afraid that I will not be able to do that all together outside the laboratory (academic or pharma).

Have you ever been through this? Could you please give me same advice? Thanks for reading me! :)"
3mcrn3,25,2015-09-25,I work for an intelligence agency. Two of my colleagues have disappeared in the strangest way.,rowaway0,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3mcrn3/i_work_for_an_intelligence_agency_two_of_my/,"I work for an intelligence agency. It's nothing like the James Bond stuff you see in movies. I have a boring entry-level desk job that requires me to sit in front of a computer and attend the occasional training session. Six days a week at the job really take a toll on your sanity but at least I'm being compensated generously for my time. The same goes for my colleagues. But lately, we've had two entry-level guys in my department disappear, which was highly unusual because office employees are typically not the ones to disappear. The guys out in the field - the ""agents,"" as we'd call them - were the ones who had to deal with worrying about being captured or assassinated, not the office guys. The really bothersome part of it was the fact that the disappearances were strikingly similar to each other, too similar to have simply been a coincidence.

We'll call the first guy Ben. He had joined the agency as an information security analyst in June 2014, about a year after I did. We were both 22 at the time, and the age similarity made it easy for us to form a friendship. At the time he joined us, I had recently gotten banned from hypbook, a social networking website for adults interested in hypnosis. The website had a chatroom and I had a reputation there for not being the nicest person. In March 2014, I eventually got banned for breaking into a private chatroom. I made a new account, used VPN to bypass the IP ban, and continued to use the chatroom. This went unnoticed for about three months. When I got caught again, I just kept making new accounts and changing my IP address to bypass the bans. Eventually, the admins decided that new users must pass a Skype interview in order to validate their account.

One day while we were off duty, I asked Ben if he could do a favor and make a hypbook account and complete the validation interview. Honestly, it was embarrassing to admit I use hypbook because it has a lot of adult content on it. But Ben was the new guy who had to make a good impression, so what was he going to do? Let our superiors know that I had been on an adult hypnosis site? Anyway, Ben did make a hypbook account. We agreed to install a plugin that encrypts over Skype and leaves no message history so that we could talk about our plans for hypbook without being traced. All scripts that we'd write for hypbook would be stored over a secure network so that they wouldn't be found if we get searched. We were never to access hypbook using our real IPs. A few days later, Ben completed the interview. Part of our plans required Ben to log into hypbook and idle in the chatroom while running our scripts a few times a week, which he did for about a month.

One day, Ben didn't come to work. He didn't call out sick or anything. My boss, who knew we were close, asked if I knew where he was and I said no. At first, we thought he'd gotten stuck in traffic or something. But by lunchtime, he still wasn't here. We called him and emailed him but didn't get a response. Towards the end of the day, when he still didn't show up, we called his roommates and asked if they knew where he was. They told us he had never come home the previous evening. They were worried but wanted to wait at least 24 hours before filing a missing person report. We filed the report ourselves and let his roommates know. Forensics reports were run on his computers and iPhone but nothing significant was found. I remembered him installing the Skype plugin, but I was too embarrassed to let anyone know we'd been on hypbook and I didn't think our conversations about hypbook were relevant to the case anyway.

A little past midnight, I got a Skype message from a friend telling me how angry she was at me for hacking hypbook. She wanted me to never enter the website again so I agreed. I hadn't been going on the site much myself anyway, except to monitor Ben's activity on it. I lost weight over the whole situation but eventually gained some of it back.

The search for Ben went on for several months but no trace of him was ever found.

Before I move on to tell you about the second disappearance, I feel that it's appropriate to mention someone else who may have played a role in it, the Sleepychat hacker. The Sleepychat hacker and I met in Sleepychat, a hypnosis chatroom. He sometimes causes mayhem on the site. Once he spammed chat with inappropriate pictures for twelve hours straight. The mods tried to ban him but he had TOR so he'd just re-log in every time. I had helped him with some trolling software just because I could. For example, we wrote a PHP script that could steal users' IPs. We figured out how to map the script to a .jpg extension. Since images autoload on Sleepychat, all we had to do is send a victim a .jpg image and the script would steal their IP. The image we chose was a single white pixel since we wanted to be discreet. We'd send an innocent-sounding message something like, ""Hi, how are you? [insert .jpg]"" The victim receives the message and doesn't notice the nearly invisible pixel. When the image loads, the script grabs the IP attempting to load it and sends it to us. We wrote a chat bot that behaved somewhat like a human and just had it idle in the chatroom and occasionally interact with other users for several hours a day until it got banned. We wrote anti-ban software that allows a user to stay logged in even after being struck with the ban hammer. Not everyone was happy with what we were doing. In fact, I had several friends complain and request that I stop the hacking. But I really wanted to continue just to see how much we could do.

Now, the second disappearance happened to a software developer whom I'll call Andrew. At the time Andrew was hired in June 2015, the Sleepychat hacker and I were working on a mass surveillance program to identify everyone who uses Sleepychat by logging their geodata as well as information they self-report. The end goal was to create a wiki of each Sleepychat user with their legal name, age, sex, race, street address, and links to their Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, FetLife, Collarspace, bio on their workplace/university website, and personal websites. Like Ben, Andrew and I were around the same age so we became friends quickly. I saw that Andrew was a brilliant young man who had done a lot of work on mass surveillance in the past so I decided to ask him to help the Sleepychat hacker and me with our program. When he enthusiastically agreed, I laid out the same rules for him as was done with Ben and the Sleepychat hacker. He had to install the Skype encryption plugin, store all code and data related to the program on a secure server, only use fake IPs to access Sleepychat, and never bring the topic up with anyone other than the Sleepychat hacker and me. For a month, the three of us made incredible progress on the program. Then Andrew disappeared.

He simply never showed up to work one day. We thought maybe he was just running late. By 10:30 that morning, I had figured out he wasn't just running late. When I vividly recalled the day Ben disappeared, I was struck such a severe pang of fear that another one of my colleagues asked why I had suddenly turned pale. I couldn't answer immediately, since no words would come out of my mouth. When I felt that the color had returned to my face, I replied, ""I'm OK. I just..."" My voice trailed off. ""...just didn't feel right for a second there. But I'm OK now."" I continued working. Hopeful, I made the intern try to get in touch with Andrew. Nothing. Andrew was living alone so there was no one else to call. We filed a missing person report, the way we had done for Ben. The case was investigated. Andrew was last seen on July 28, 2015 at 11:25 pm on camera at an ATM that was near his home. The footage showed him withdrawing money, putting it in his wallet, and then walking off the screen. Nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be happening in the video. His computer was searched but they found nothing.

When I logged into Skype later that evening, I saw that the same friend who had been angry over me hacking hypbook had left me a few messages: ""I know what you're doing in Sleepychat. You need to stop. I want you to be someone I'm proud of, not someone who hurts my community."" I found this so odd because she'd rarely message me first, maybe only 2-4 times a year. Again, I lost weight over the stress of the situation.

A few days later, I messaged Ely-Senpai, the Sleepychat admin, to let him know I'd do everything I could to remove the Sleepychat hacker from the website. However, Ely-Senpai wanted me to have the Sleepychat hacker arrested but I didn't want to do that. As promised, I did encourage the Sleepychat hacker to move on to other websites instead. I don't want him to disappear too.

The search for Andrew is still ongoing."

The problem is that they are going to probably be sold into Electrolux by the time I get in.

Point is, should I just try to join ITLP (they seemed interested) to get a foot into GE despite using no Computer engineering for a summer and doing IT and skip out on GE Appliances? Or should I go for Appliances, get some actual computer engineering experience in software/hardware but have the possibility of not getting into a GE summer internship in the end?

Today i was looking for a video on youtube, when my laptop Bluescreened on me, with the caption MEMORY_MALFUNCTION or something similar to the sort on the screen. So I run a diagnostics test, and it tells me i have a hardware issue right away. after diagnostics, it tells me i have a memory issue and to contact the manufacturer. Seeing as i'm pretty sure i'm way beyond the warranty date, my biggest question is; how do i save my laptop, or do i bite the bullet and buy a cheap notebook?

EDIT: Just checked, not eligble for warranty support. "

When should I start applying for jobs?",Rosco_the_Dude,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3mekbn/college_senior_graduating_in_summer_2016_when/,"I want to get the ball rolling asap, but I also don't want to start too early if most companies won't be considering new hires for that far into the future.

A second question: How do I manage applying to companies in different states? I can think of about 4-5 different cities I'd like to live near that are also good for the industry, but they're all in different states. I imagine anything past the phone interview would require an on-site interview, which could potentially involve a lot of travel. With school and my internship, I'd need to plan out when I can take time off to go interview.

My last question: The company I'm currently working for has expressed interest in hiring me after I graduate, but I really don't want to commit this soon. I especially don't want to keep living in my current state, so the company I'm working for is my fallback plan. How do I keep this opportunity in my back pocket and still give other companies a fair shot?"
3meq6w,7,2015-09-25,"""I have to go home.""",Kervin555,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3meq6w/i_have_to_go_home/,"“I have to go home,” she’d tell me sadly.

Up until a few months ago, I had pretty much everything in the bag. I was doing fairly well at one of the best high schools in the country, I had a fantastic friend group who loved and supported me, and my aspirations to be a an engineer were going extremely well - I had internships and everything, not to mention the time I spent making noise and handling equipment as my high school’s DJ! All in all, it was pretty good life to lead; no problems at home, I avoided as much drama as possible, etc. You must think - hey, this guy sounds pretty lucky, I wonder why he’s posting here at /r/nosleep - the legendary subreddit of problems and nightmares? Well, not everything was fine and dandy in my life. There was also the matter of Iona.

That’s not her real name, of course, but Iona was my girlfriend. Currently ex-girlfriend (we’ll get into that), but for several months during my sophomore and junior years of high school, she was my girlfriend. And she was pretty great! We’d go on dates, we’d say “I love you” to each other, and there would be an inane amount of kissing. She was nice as can be and I even made friends with a lot of the people she knew, and hey I wasn’t one to deny getting to know more people; I wasn’t always the most popular chap at my high school. She went to a school closeby; it was an alright school, it wasn’t the best around but, you know, alright. No one at my school knew who she was, but I decided that was probably for the best. That sort of thing can lead to problems. I’m remembering right now the ridiculous amount of drama that went on when it turned out that one of my friends had decided to break up with his girlfriend; his ex then went on to make a smear campaign along with her friends - who were friends with his friends. There was a big and very immature “civil war” between my friends before the two finally just decided that ignoring each other would have been a smarter move. Things calmed down after that.

But I digress. The point is you can see why it would be better to separate my friends from my love life. She wasn’t always the most normal girl, though. At first it was just normal stuff, she’d spend hours in her room - not talking to me. That was pretty okay; she was shy and introverted and I was her first real boyfriend (she’d had several “online boyfriends” in the past). But as time went on, things just started to get weird.  She wouldn’t talk to me for weeks at a time (wouldn’t answer her phone, wouldn’t come by my school, etc.), and when she did finally start talking to me, she’d end up crying every time. I… can’t really remember many of the conversations we had; it was all a big blur - she tended to talk about a lot of different things, all of them pretty inconsequential. And every time I saw her, she wouldn’t be wearing the comfortable clothes I knew her to wear - she’d start wearing really conservative clothing that covered up every inch of her from the neck up, even on really warm days. When I asked her friends what was up, they told me that she’d been taking absences from school, especially on days when they had gym class.  I do remember, though, that when we started going on consistent dates again (her instances of not talking to me would occasionally lapse and she’d be back to normal) that she’d developed a little bit of a catchphrase and a strange tic.

“I have to go home.”

It would be at the end of a date. At night in the park, at a cafe, at the ice hockey rink. Immediately after saying it, she would have this look of extreme sadness. She’d drag me away and cling to me as we went back to her house - wordless. I tried talking to her but the only thing that would happen would be that she’d cling even tighter onto me. It was pretty embarrassing, to say the least, to have Iona basically have a vice grip on me as we stood in the subway. And every time I left her at her house, she’d have this look of absolute dread on her face. It looked as if she’d start crying any second, and sometimes she did.

A few weeks after the last time she’d dragged me off like that (she had once again stopped speaking to me), it was showtime at my high school. We’d been preparing for months on this concert - the dancers were on stage and dancing, I was in the back manning my mixer, and the crew were behind the scenes helping the cast put on costumes. My beats roared through the speakers, and the lighting booth was doing their job - mood lighting was perfect. It was the best concert I’d ever worked on. I was happy at the end of the night, and even happier when I saw that partway through the show Iona had showed up and watched it to its completion. She’d never loved going to the shows, see, because she was scared of the darkness and the loud sounds. But she was there that night.

After everything was done, Iona dragged me up to the lighting booth which had emptied out since the lights guy needed to get home quickly after the show. I tried asking her what was wrong, but she just kissed me and told me to stay quiet for now. She took off that big overcoat of hers and suddenly, I understood everything. She wasn’t wearing much under it - a tank top and shorts. But I suspected that this was on purpose. There were scars everywhere on her body, starting from her collarbone down. Huge gashes streaked along her torso (she’d pulled up her top to reveal massive scarring - which looked recent - on her stomach and back), cuts and bruises littered her arms and legs. As I looked at all of this damage, I began to get dizzy and I felt the increasing urge to throw up. Iona began crying.

I asked her who did this, but she didn’t answer. Instead, she just kissed me one last time and whispered in my ear.

“I have to go home,” she said between sobs.

She rushed out of there, but my foot got caught on some loose wiring on the floor. She managed to bolt through and get on the subway before me. I followed her home - stalkerish as that may seem, I was extremely worried. When I finally got to her house maybe forty five minutes after she’d gotten there, no one answered the door. I banged on it as hard as I could, called her on her phone (it was off), tried calling her friends (they had no answers for me and just yelled at me for calling them at such a late hour). I stood outside of that door, tearing my hair out for such a long time. When I started to calm down, I noticed a strange odor coming from someone nearby; at the time, I’d chalked it up to the garbage on the sidewalk that had yet to be collected. As I stood there, I seriously contemplated breaking a window to get inside. Eventually, I left.

When I got home, I told my parents everything. They were shocked, of course, and we all agreed that it would be in her best interest if we called the police. So call the police we did. We didn’t hear anything else about it that night, until I woke up in the morning and they told us that they’d investigated the house. That horrible scent I mentioned had actually come from inside of the house - it was Iona’s dad. He’d killed himself with a revolver and was splayed out across the living room. When I heard that, my stomach seemed to recede into itself. That wasn’t all. There were a lot of crude torture implements found in the basement: knives, pokers, bindings. There was a lot of blood on the walls from what we’d heard. It was pretty clear from everything present that all of this was her father’s.

And, of course, there was Iona.

She was in the closet in her room, a rope hanging around her neck. She’d taped a message across her chest: “I LOVE YOU. I’M SORRY.”

I threw up after hearing that.

It was all over the news and everyone tried their best to console me, even Iona’s old friends - who were weeping on their own. There were vigils set up for her at her school, and at my school. Church bells rang constantly in my head. But I receded into myself. Now, I don’t talk to anyone. I just go to school but don’t go to any classes. That way I can’t be hurt anymore than I already am. It’s easier this way. I spend all my time in that lighting booth, reliving that day when I could have stopped her from killing herself but I didn’t. That day when I saw all of her scars and I was too scared to do anything about it. I wanted to get revenge, but there was no one to get revenge on. Her dad was dead already; killed before I could go do it myself. I didn’t even care *why* he did it; I just wanted to kill him. *Want* to kill him. I quit my DJ job, stopped attending my internships, my grades have hit the gutter, haven’t even started on my college applications. It’s funny, you know, the sort of things that life throws at you.

It’s getting late and the school building’s closing up soon. Right now the last thing I want to be is stuck inside this building. I’ll finish this up now; I have to go home."
3mew4o,6,2015-09-25,Internships require skills not taught in school,xxdeathx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3mew4o/internships_require_skills_not_taught_in_school/,"You could say a good majority of software engineer intern positions fall into one of these categories or require some of these skills:

* Web development: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, *.js, PHP, SQL
* I don't even know what front end, back end, and full stack mean or any of the skills associated with them
* Frameworks: don't know what they are
* Mobile: Android, iOS

I don't know if UC San Diego is an exception, but as of the beginning of my junior year (prime time to start hiring interns) not one of these topics has been mentioned in any of my classes. The only languages our CSE classes use are Java, C, and C++. 

If other universities are the same, then do these positions even have any competition? I don't have the skills required so I wouldn't feel safe applying to them, and I'd assume they only consider the few qualified applicants anyways. I've mostly applied to the companies that have Java/C++ as the hard requirement, but most people probably learned those at school so the competition is fierce (and I haven't got one callback for a summer position).

Maybe these topics are covered in upper division classes, but it doesn't seem too likely that they'd be able to teach such a wide range of skills in the 2 years left. People I've spoken to in real life said do a project and learn it on your own, but I thought the sentiment in this sub is that you shouldn't be spending all of your free time on your career. 

Really, this whole thing has been nagging at me and confusing me. I can't figure out how it works."

However that is not 100% and I want to give myself the best chance possible to land an internship even if it's some BS data entry something simple anywhere job. What classes would give me a better foot in? Will any of these even help? I am ready to learn and get in the field, get down to work.

Real work doesn't happen that way. If you are aiming at hiring a bunch of fresh out of college grads who have crammed up these programming puzzles, I don't want to do anything with it.

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3mdbgr/f6f7f4_part_2/)

White lights greeted me once again as I woke up. I did not know how long I had been in this hospital bed, I lost track of the days. The nurses were ordered to turn off my clock and tv which wasn't helpful. What started as occasional headaches had turned into a constant dull pain and, every so often, feeling like someone was sticking a hot knife in my forehead. I tried not to cry but whenever I did, a nurse growled at me and quickly wiped my left cheek, throwing out the rags before I could manage to see them. I heard my mother talking in the hallway with the nurses what felt like a few days ago, but she wasn't allowed to see me. They told her I had an accident and needed tests done. 

Liam's father visited twice after the first day, asking me questions about my year. Hesitantly, I told him about William. Honestly, I'd run out of options. He didn't give me the same reaction as Will and my mom did, but looked amused rather than confused. He asked me to describe Will and tell him about my trip to the city. Drugs coursed through my veins to keep me pain-free (Liam's father ordered the nurses to use ""the strong stuff"" and gave me a wink) but all they seemed to be doing was make me slur my words and make every movement slow and weak. 

Tonight though, I was alone. The intercom switched on and the receptionist asked all visitors to leave the building, as visiting hours were over. My door was open a few inches, and through the opening I saw the lights in the hallway turn off. The emergency lights remained on, orange and dull, and the night staff went about their business. During the day, nurses would come and go in my room, but not as much at night. Maybe they expected me to sleep.

There were not usually voices in the hallways but I heard two people talking further down the hall. One was Liam's father, I was positive. The other was a woman, but I didn't recognize her voice. Perhaps she was another nurse. I wasn't listening particularly intently, until I heard the woman say my name. The dull pain in my head made it hard to concentrate, and I couldn't hear them very well, but I wanted to know when I was going to be discharged. I slowly raised myself out of bed and got a head rush. The springs in the cheap mattress groaned. I waited a few seconds to keep my balance and took a couple steps to the door. With my back pressed to the wall just beside the opening, I leaned toward the hallway. 

""That's not possible, Jim."" The woman's voice said coldly, ""I have studied this procedure for years and that has never happened.""

""Sue, there's no doubt in my mind that her body's repaired the connection. I realize there are no recorded cases like her, but there is no other way to explain how the effectiveness of it could have been reversed."" Liam's father countered. Sue was Liam's mother's first name. There was a moment of silence. ""Sue, this is huge. She could be a gold mine. We have concrete evidence of the body's ability to repair damage to the prefrontal cortex,"" Jim continued, excitedly.

""Quiet down,"" she snapped at him, ""and do you think the hospital board will overlook the chain of events that lead to her procedure?"" Sue asked, ""Her boyfriend's father recommended surgery to be performed by his wife? I don't think so. We had every reason to keep the bitch quiet, but I put my job on the line to keep your son happy and out of jail. What did you give her tonight?"" 

My breath caught in my throat. They were talking about me.

""A general anesthetic,"" he sighed. ""She'll be out for hours. Sue, she's been complacent for two years. I even asked her mother when she tried to visit, and she said she didn't notice anything out the ordinary until Kali's breakdown.""

""The procedure fixes people, turns them into vegetables, or kills them. No one just 'reverses it', Jim."" She started walking away from him, coming towards my room. I clung closer to the wall, sliding out of sight from the opening.

""Sue, we have to do something."" 

She stopped. ""What do you suggest?"" She asked him, almost as if she was mocking him, ""Kill her? That would mean we risked our jobs in vain, Liam would be a little put out, and we can't just let her go."" 

Jim hesitated, ""We have two options. We do the procedure again, or we study her progress."" 

""Progress?"" 

I could practically hear his grin through his voice, ""I had an intern two years ago named William. Maybe she heard his name and saw his paperwork, but over the two years since her procedure, her subconscious has created an alternate reality for itself where she met him and fell in love after leaving Liam. She even described his address to me, I'm positive it's him. Her subconscious probably created this illusion to protect itself as it healed. She has no memory of the real past after, or just before the procedure,"" Jim took a deep breath, ""she doesn't even remember their fight in Louisiana.""

Sue was quiet. I felt like throwing up. What the hell kind of procedure could he have recommended? Could I actually have made everything about William up? None of this could have actually happened, they can't do something major to someone without their consent. The pain in my forehead worsened, but I pushed it aside. I needed to hear, but every word they said made me sick. Hot tears welled in my eyes but I fought back making any noise. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 

""If we give her a few months, we can record her recovery and-""

""We do the procedure again,"" Sue interrupted, ""I didn't risk everything for it to not work. Liam and Kali will be together, whether she's aware of it or not. His future will be destroyed if she opens her giant mouth about his temperament issue. We can't afford to let her recover those memories.""

My heart pounded in my chest and my head ached. I raised both my hands to catch the tears and wiped them on my hips. A deep red stain was left on the left side of the hospital gown. I suddenly remembered the gas station. Good god, was I crying blood? Is that what the nurses were wiping away? 

""We'll just need an operating table, so I'll have one ready tomorrow night,"" she said, her voice getting farther away, ""do the anesthesia yourself before you bring her downstairs. I want this under the radar."" 

I had heard enough. I didn't understand most of what they said but I understood the danger I was in. These people would rather risk my life than let their son's true nature see public exposure. If they thought I would go under the knife quietly,they were mistaken. Another drop of blood rolled down my cheek, and I looked to the bedside table for a tissue. With one step forward, the floodgates opened and pain rushed in. I crumpled to the ground. The orange lights from the hallway cast a beam of light across the floor. I heard slow footsteps in the hallway and a tall shadow cut into the light. The shadow came closer. The footsteps entered the room. The door shut.

After a brief stint with a very large tech company in south bay, I decided I wanted to be in San Francisco at a smaller company, so I joined a startup that had been operating for several months right after they raised Series A. Then there was just a dozen other employees, and a year on it's not much more.

I joined the company for a few reasons, but the biggest reason was location, I wanted to live and work in the city. After meeting some of the team I was assured of their technical capabilities, everyone seemed very smart unlike at the previous large company where I felt a distinct lack of talent. There were some trade offs though: I took a pretty sizable pay cut (especially when adjusting for cost of living in SF) in exchange for stock options, and the product did not really capture my imagination: initially pitched as a consumer-facing voice conferencing app it has now essentially become an enterprise app which was the very thing I was avoiding.

We launched officially this past spring at one conference with high ambitions but from what I can see we failed to reach the numbers we set for ourselves. We took on a guy to handle marketing of the product who seemed very talented and enthusiastic, launching advertisement campaigns and helping us maintain an active presence at conferences and online. Most recently, we premiered a slew of new features at Dreamforce.

There are several things that is making me think of a change of scenery and I wanted to get some second opinions:

- First off, we've had a few people quit recently. Two were seed-round hires who've been there longer than I have, though everyone from the core founding team remains. Most troubling to me is that the marketing guy has quit after only 4 months on the job, despite what seemed like endless enthusiasm and optimism. I suppose it's possible he just found something he believes in more, but I can't help but think he might've had reason to doubt the company or product.
- Lately it's been tough working on my end of the product. Though generally smart, the few people I have to collaborate with have become increasingly stubborn and I've been unfairly burdened with solving problems that I don't feel are mine to solve. There is, I feel, a general lack of respect for me--there have been several times now that I've identified a key problem with some approach or plan, only to be argued down by people more senior than I am (I am by far the youngest person at this company, barring some interns). Later, when the problem manifests I have to help clean things up. I'm not bragging about being right to my coworkers but at the same time I feel like it should be acknowledged that we could've behaved differently. This is actually something that I'm going to bring up and try to resolve if I continue with the company, but if I'm not then I won't bother.
- There is a total lack of disorganization between different teams and very little sense of chain of command. There are not enough product managers and designers to augment the technical teams we have, so very often am I forced to play the role of both engineer, PM, and designer--I'm given a vague feature and I have to figure out how it will function and look and then implement it, and then the feature is redesigned and properly specced so then I have to do it again. When pointing out this failure, the CTO expressed that he was proud of the lack of hierarchy and the CEO stressed that we should be willing to do whatever is necessary for the product. I got hired as an engineer, not a designer nor PM, and it seems unfair to expect this of me.
- The team for our flagship product seems like it's in dire straits--two people quit it recently, and those that remain appear very stressed out. The product I work on won't really matter if this product ends up dying.
- From a numbers perspective it seems like the product isn't doing nearly as well as expected. It's hard to say so soon after Dreamforce but we didn't even express hard numbers this time around. Of course, when we try for Series B in a few months it will be abundantly clear how good or bad the product is doing--either we'll be funded again or not.
- After a recent injury, money has been rather tight as I pay off an expensive surgery. I'm getting paid way below market rate, though enough that before the injury I was able to live pretty comfortably. I know that I stand a good chance of increasing my salary meaningfully if I join another company.

This is my first startup and I feel like I've learned a lot. On the technical side I've mastered several front-end technologies; early on I spearheaded the effort to modernize the stack and create a sensible architecture to work in; through necessity have learned more about UX design and product management; and have learned a bit more about the politics of working with others. However, I feel like I've stopped growing as an engineer. Work that used to be challenging and fun has become tedious and mundane. I've been learning new technologies but I will be unable to use them in my current work.

Way I see it, I have a few options. I can stay until my one year anniversary is here, in about a month, and from what I understand the quarter of the options vest, though it's unclear right now what that means to me. However, it seems far better to leave it after that happens than before.

The other option is to wait until February until Series B. If it turns out my concerns about the company itself aren't ominous, I can try to work through the problems with my coworkers and stay the course.

I've heard, I think, worse stories about startups: I'm not forced to work more than 40 hour weeks for example nor is there any sort of intimidation from management. It's possible that I could jump ship only to find myself in a worse situation. What do you all think? Are the problems I listed enough to make the move?"

I'm a second year University student that is gradually approaching my placement year. I am curious to see as to whom on this subreddit has taken part in an internship before and if so, where, what your experience was like and how vigorous was the application process? I should mention I'm looking for a programming position.


I've spent the last year or so building up my portfolio and worked it in quite nicely with my resumé. I've been utilising LinkedIn and noted taking part in discussions and I've also set up a website (something I did in college though it does need some tuning to be more games-focused) to let studios have a more interactive view of what I do. (Won't link due to guidelines)


What I'm really looking for is some advice, as an employer, what do you want from an intern?"

Unfortunately my two prior internships have nothing to do with cs (mostly power) and I've only taken one mandatory intro cs course. On the side I've been going through C++ Primer and Accelerated C++ but I've had a hard time thinking of any worthy projects to put on my github (did a decent amount of programming to make a maze solving + mapping robot but I'm not sure if that's enough). My school's career fair is this Tuesday and I think I have a very good shot at getting another EE spring internship and possibly a full time position for when I graduate. I would prefer to go in there seeking a cs internship to at least to get my foot in the door, but I hear Fall career fairs are the best time to get a full-time offer, which I am much more likely to get for EE positions.  
  
One more thing I'm very worried about is the lack of C++ jobs in my area. For every job listing I see asking for C++, there's 20 java/web-dev/dba positions. I think I would enjoy application development a lot more than firmware dev as well. My question is, what is the best course of action I can take to transition into software by the time I graduate (May), given my experience with mostly hardware, and what fields in cs would benefit from an EE degree (besides firmware because I absolutely hate working with assembly)?"

cahokiamounds.org
Anyway, it's been my home away from home since I started college two years ago. I'm an anthropology major, and I started here as a intern. Now, I'm an assistant for one of the archaeologists, but my favorite part is to help out with day-to-day operations (giving tours, making brochures, working at the information desk, etc) The place is so beautiful, and it's about 2,200 of woodland, prairie, and marshland smacked together. We have about 200 deer and hundreds of turkeys, foxes, hawks and songbirds on the site. Even though I've worked here a while, I never get tired of taking walks. The wildflowers smell like a hot cup of brewed tea, with a glob of honey stirred into it. In the summer, we pick persimmons and peaches from the smaller trees in the marsh. At winter, I love to sit at my desk and look out the window at the frozen ponds and the geese forming their V's over head. It's kind of a weird place to have an internationally known historic site, because it's in the ghetto of this little city. People get shot in their cars, just down the street, and we can see a trailer park from our visitor's center. But there's always something going on, so many wonderful people to meet, here. If you can't tell, Cahokia Mounds is heaven to me. 

I don't think I want to work here anymore.

Today, I drove out to one of our picnic areas. I like to take pictures of the deer after work, and the deer tend to hide out in this area. There are a couple of vending machines out there, under one of the pavilions. I was walking toward this pavilion, which is fenced in by a low wall. It was a bit after 6pm, and since the seasons are changing, it's getting darker a lot sooner here. So, while it was still pretty light from the sunset, the area beneath the pavilion's roof was pretty dark, except for the lights from the machine.

I saw a woman banging at the glass. She was beating one of the machines, and arching her back and lurching forward like a serpent. Every few seconds, she would shriek and claw at the glass again, like her child was stuck inside or something. I crouched down a bit to watch her. Her hair was very long and brown and matted, like she had started to get accidental dreads and just decided to go with it. She wore a baggy gray shirt and black leggings, but I couldn't see her shoes. I noticed a hunting knife on her waist. That wasn't so odd, out here, but to be honest, I'd never seen a woman with one before. The handle was black with a bright copper tip. She seemed to be very thin, except for a huge lump in the middle of her abdomen. I thought she was pregnant, but I wasn't sure. She continued attacking the machine, until she collapsed on the ground. I only saw the top of her head, over the little wall.

I looked around to see if there was anyone else nearby, but I didn't even see a car in the parking lot besides my own. Surely, she must have walked here from the visitor's center. I gazed away, thinking I should just find the pack of deer and leave the girl alone. Obviously, she had some emotional issues. I turned back to look at her one last time. She was standing, smiling at me. I smiled back. ""Need help?"" I asked. That's sort of a habit from working with 'the public,' as my boss calls it.

She responded in Spanish. That's not so unusual, since most of the people in the neighborhoods around here are Mexican. I thought it was weird that she called me a ""little baby,"" though. Maybe my Spanish is not as good as I thought. I noticed a huge brown stain on the front of her shirt. When I looked at it, she started to scream at me.

This really confused me. Yes, okay, it might have looked to her like I was looking at her boobs, but I'm also a teenage girl. I don't know why she would have been concerned. But, she shrieked at me. Her eyes bubbled out, huge, in her skull. She was yelling in English, now, I think. It was hard to tell. She looked straight into me. Every time she screamed, I couldn't help but notice how low her voice was getting. She sounded almost like a man. Her eyes were huge, her face was taut, like she was dead. Her face was too calm. Her voice was too deep. 

She did say something in English, though, in her male-ish voice. ""HI, BABY."" I saw pink rings around her neck. They must have been scars. It looked like the skin was raw, there. She was getting closer to me, and shrieking, and I was backing away, but she was moving fast. I couldn't stop looking at her neck.

What frightened me the most, more than her apparent craziness, was the fact that I recognized her. But, I'm not sure. I shouldn't say her name, or who I think she is, until I'm absolutely certain that it was her. If it is, then this just got a lot weirder. Anyway, I just picked my camera off the ground and ran. 

I didn't turn around until I got to my car, in the small gravel lot. Then, I looked back at the pavilion. I heard a scream, a wail, something I've never heard before. Then, a swarm of deer bolted from the treeline. Their gangly legs should have tangled, they were all running so fast. I know she was just some girl, but I don't want to go back. I don't want to photograph those deer, ever again.

Should I tell my bosses? What should I do?"

3mpxze,1,2015-09-28,Better to stick it out or have a gap on my resume?,stuckinajob,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3mpxze/better_to_stick_it_out_or_have_a_gap_on_my_resume/,"(Throwaway for privacy reasons. Sorry for the wall of text.)


I've been in a sticky situation for the past few months, and I could really use some outsider advice/perspective.


A friend, who I haven't talked to since graduating high school, reached out and contacted me in February. He'd heard I was looking for a new job, and his family's company was desperate for an office secretary. I was completely burnt out by my previous position (I'd been classified as a part-time employee, but working about 50 hours a week with no consistent schedule/a lot of swing shifts), so I quickly accepted. 


The job started out great. Sure, it didn't quite match up with the job description. I was more of an office manager/running the business than just a secretary. But I was alone in the office - I got my work done as quickly as I wanted. I didn't have face-to-face customer interaction - it's an industrial company and all customer contact is via phone. I had regular, daytime hours - I got to get back to a gym routine and go out with friends in the evening. I didn't have a dress code - I could wear yoga pants or sweats daily. And I was making almost the same as at my previous job - minus a little, since I never work over 35 hours. All in all, it was great. 


Then, about a month and a half after I was hired, one of the field employees sexually harassed me. Long story short, there was nothing physical and it only happened once, but it completely changed my view of the job. I've been stalked in the past, and it really freaked me out because he had contacted me in a really roundabout way. 


I reported the situation to my friend (including that I've been stalked in the past and was very uncomfortable), but his family has made minimal efforts to remedy the situation. They gave the employee who harassed me a verbal warning. He was not formally reprimanded, despite the fact that I wrote up and filed a complaint (I have access to all employee files, and my complaint was never put into his file or mine - I just checked). They hired another part-time secretary to come in 3 days a week for half the day in the summer, and they came in the other 2 days for a few hours. This lasted for 3 months, until the other girl had to go back to school and they figured it'd blown over enough to not hire another. They said they'd get a different lock for my office that only I and they had a key to; it was never bought. 


Now, I'm alone in the office every day again. And it's starting to take a toll on me mentally. I'm consistently down. I think I might be starting to suffer from depression, and I have random panic attacks in the office sometimes. I dread coming into work more and more every day, so much so that I sometimes don't fall asleep until 4AM.


I've been looking for a new job (full-time) since it happened in April. I don't think I'm applying for jobs I'm unqualified for. They're pretty much all entry level administrative/secretary positions. Sometimes, I'll reach for a position if I'm really excited about it, but I tend to stick within my qualifications. 


The closest to a job offer I've gotten was for an unpaid 3-month internship, even though I had applied for a full-time job. They said they couldn't guarantee employment at the end of the internship, either. I've not gotten a single interview for a full-time job yet. It's making me feel even more lost and hopeless about my situation.


I'm getting to the point where I want to just quit without another job. But I've never left a position (or felt like I needed to) without having another position waiting. I haven't quit because I know how hard it is to find a job. My brother got laid off in January, and he still hasn't found anything (and he's been able to dedicate full days to job applications/has a business degree.) So it terrifies me because I feel like if he's having trouble, it'll be impossible for me. Even though I've worked in offices since I was 16, I graduated 2 years ago with a BA in History (I had a 3.9/4.0 at my Uni's Honors College, but it's still a Humanities degree). 


Is it better for me to just stick it out until I can find something - even though I have no idea how long that could take? I'm also hesitant to do this because I don't want to leave my friend's family in a bad spot, either.


If I were to quit with no other job, how would I explain my departure and employment gap on applications/in interviews?  I'm really worried prospective employers would find out I'd quit over a sexual harassment issue and assume I'd be filing complaints or causing trouble at their company.


Should I risk applying for internships just to get my foot in the door, even though I'd have no guarantee of a job at the end? (I had to move back in with my parents, so I wouldn't end up homeless at least.)


It's been a really rough 5 months. I've been trying to tough it out and figure it out on my own, but any advice would really be appreciated. 

**tl;dr** was sexually harassed, they didn't do anything about it, i feel unsafe. haven't found another job. should i quit? how would i explain to prospective employers?

EDIT: Tried to break it up and make it easier to read. I didn't realize how much of a wall it'd become..."

2. A series of knee injuries has left me with some physical problems. Things are better now but I still can't do anything terribly strenuous, no heavy boxes or lots of stairs, etc.

3. After my initial injury I had to quit my job (dog walker/trainer). I started pursuing standup, which had always been a dream of mine. I've worked very hard over the last 2.5 years and I've achieved quite a bit. I've also produced several independent comedy shows and I worked as a technical/production manager at a major theater in my city for over a year (unpaid internship).

The problem is that I'm not making enough money solely from comedy to support myself yet and I probably won't for a little while. I'm running out of money and I need something to help pay the bills, but comedy is the only thing I really love to do. I included my experience running shows and performing in my resume, but I know that's backfired for some of my friends because it's clear that whatever job they're applying for isn't what they really want; they're applying out of necessity and would leave if a creative opportunity arose. It also means I can't work night shifts, at least not every night, because that's when I perform or practice at open mics (and working at night has exacerbated my sleep disorder in the past anyway).

I'm not even sure what to look for when I job hunt; I don't know where I'd fit in and be content. However I am smart and capable and willing to work. I feel like I'm kinda old for the amount of work experience I have (I'll be 30 in December and only worked at an office for a year and as a dog walker for about two years, did some volunteer work, took other classes, and worked on standup/production besides that). The internships I'm seeing specifically ask for recent college grads; I graduated in 2008. 

I feel very, very behind in terms of knowing how to do computer stuff. Most of my friends know some graphic design, how to code or program, etc. and I'm totally overwhelmed by the programs these jobs want you to know when I look at job postings. I took some online courses in social media marketing, SEO, and HTML basics. I was decent at the social media marketing and SEO but I really, really hate doing them. I took a course in WordPress and I have no idea how anyone does anything with it; hats off to you if you do. I'm just at a loss, and I have no idea what direction to go in or how to find a job with some of the limitations I have. Any advice would be very appreciated. "

Here though, when I checked the Macintosh HD, it was greyed out almost as if it was not being used and it said not mounted. So I verified the disk and clicked repair disk...after all that was done, it said that the disk could not be repaired and to reformat it and backup. The teacher said he didn't care if I had to wipe it out, so that is exactly what I did and restored the system as if it were factory new. Was that the right thing to do?

The project is building a monitoring tool for some of our cloud services, that will record and present key performance metrics on a webpage dashboard."" Ok, but internships are usually documentation/learning/basic coding aren't they? They weren't too clear, seemed like it might have been a bit more than that..  

&amp;nbsp;

So I asked if I would be getting to work with anyone else on the project or just reporting progress to a manager with daily meetings, I asked if I'd be able to work with the skills I'm comfortable with (JS/Node, Sass, Git) or do I need to pick up their preferences(C#, LESS, TFS) where I'd be inexperienced/slower and not benefit from learning if the internship doesn't progress to employment(I learnt skills that are more common in job adverts here, besides Node where C#/PHP is more common). I also asked why we'd be creating this from scratch(NIH) instead of integrating with a proven provider(they have plenty of money), was it just a project they had on the boilerplate to delegate to me and evaluate my skills or were they serious about this. I expressed my concern for being responsible for everything with minimal guidance, but felt I could handle it and deliver if needed, I didn't feel comfortable taking on that sort of work load as well as learning alternatives to what I knew if I wasn't getting collaboration experience or mentoring out of this short term internship. 

After that a few days later I was informed they would not go ahead with the internship, HR wasn't feeling too good about my location/relocation concerns mentioned below, and the dev manager felt that he had given more than enough information in the quoted description above to decide. I was told that should another full time role(like junior) be advertised again that I apply and give that a go. I'm sure the reference might have been useful, but would you say not taking this internship on seems like a good thing? It didn't sound like a regular internship I've read about, and the dev manager not wanting to provide more information seemed troubling.

**More Background**  

So I've been job searching for about 6+ months for web dev career(frontend mostly, or node/devops) and studying web dev for about a year now(have had previous experience programming under the table for a casino company I dealt cards at for a year doing a desktop/mobile e-learning app and a little hobby/freelancing). I'm fairly confident that I can handle entry/intern role, maybe even junior positions, however I rarely get passed HR without a related degree.

I recently finished a 3 month long interview process for a junior web dev at a big enterprise healthcare company(web team is about 10 devs), I made it down to the last 5 candidates and things were looking good, got on well with all my interviewers and HR, the manager and lead/senior devs interviewing me never got degrees they were self taught like me. In the end I got told they chose someone with more experience who they felt ""could hit the ground running"". I was offered an internship paid for 3 months(minus the xmas downtime that was unknown in length, later revealed to be 2 weeks), said I'd need more info and to think about it.

I live a bit far from the company, so transit for me is about 5-6 hours a day and they start at 8am so I'd be looking at having to wake at 4.30am, then arrive home around 8pm eat dinner and sleep for 6-7 hours, only getting weekends free. Or if I could manage find temporary place to rent with others nearby, but I wasn't sure if I could afford it with the down time during xmas(was estimating 3 weeks unpaid). Still I have not had much luck so far and want to break into the industry, but is this internship valuable enough to be putting myself through potential health/financial risks? I expressed that I would be interested in taking the opportunity but also shared my concerns and what I hoped to gain out of it, including asking for more information about what I'd be doing exactly and if I'm working with others much. Today they decided to not go ahead with the internship after discussing my concerns."

What should I be doing? Programming for me is very fun and I enjoy creating, reading and tweaking code to suit my needs, so I set out time daily to practice but even then I don't feel like that's enough to be internship ready before my 2 years are up.

Again, I'm a complete 100% beginner coming from nothing. Any tips for guys out there like me to prepare themselves for post-graduation?

I understand having projects is very important, is there anything else?"

So I'm a senior in CS and I'm also in my school's accelerated master's program. Basically you take graduate classes in your senior year that count toward your master's and bachelor's and this allows you to finish your master's in one extra year. I'm set up with an RAship so I'll have my tuition paid for along with a significant stipend.

All of my experience is in web development (2 internships and my RAship) but I don't find it very fulfilling. I bought an Arduino Uno and I'm having a lot of fun with it and now I want to try taking an embedded software internship this summer to see if I like the field.

What I'm wondering is if the things I learn in my master's program will benefit an embedded software engineer? Are upper level CS classes just as applicable to embedded as other fields?

Forgive me if I sound condescending towards the field, I just don't know anything about it. Thanks in advance! "

I've had a tough hunt over the last few months because of my lack of a real internship and lack of experience (which go hand in hand). I've had a few interviews, but either A.) was never followed up with or B.) didn't make it past the call round.

My interest is in Web Development, so I've spent the past month and a half beefing up my side projects and diving into Node+Angular and have really enjoyed it. I've also spent time building up my resume based on critiques from friends in the industry, and building out my portfolio site.

I interviewed about two weeks ago for a position (Front End Engineer) at a startup through a friend of a friend that works for the company. They just reached out this week and extended an offer, but here's where I'm at with it:

- I live in SF...the offer is (what I believe to be) a very lowball offer of 50k.
- I didn't really like the company vibe, and don't feel like I'd be a good fit. When I interviewed, the office looked very drab, kinda old and dingy, and many of the employees would be much older than me.
- I'd have to commute by car down the peninsula at least 30 minutes to an hour each way depending on what will likely be horrible traffic.
- My current filler job working as a Desktop Support rep is hourly, but would be about 60k if it was drawn out to a salary number.

While I understand ""paying your dues"" for experience early on, is this something I should bother taking if I'm not really into it? Right now I think my plan is to counteroffer for more in the range of 60-65k, and see what they say. "
3mzb77,10,2015-09-30,Hi Germany! My landlord refuses to pay back my desposit and I have no idea what to do,Staerksten,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3mzb77/hi_germany_my_landlord_refuses_to_pay_back_my/,"Hello,

As the title says, my landlord refused to pay back my deposit. I seek some legal advice or suggestions whether what she did was within her rights, because as my understanding goes, Germany does have strong laws for tenants as well. 

**About:** She is technically not the landlord even. She sublets the appartment, and the landlord is aware of that. Nonetheless, for our understanding I will call her 'landlord'.

I am a non-EU student, and the flat is in Frankfurt am Main. 

Deposit in question is mere 100 EUR, but as a student who funds his own education and with a weak financial standing, I cannot allow her to just keep the deposit. 

Period I stayed in was June till September. Total of 3 months. 
My 'landlord' reasons that:

- I did not pay the rent on time.
- I didn't leave the house at the time we 'agreed' on.
- The place wasn't given back as she received it. She had to arrange several hours arranging and cleaning it.

**Point 1:** I have written proofs that:
a) we had no set timeline of rent to be paid on. (as in 'rent should be paid by date x of the month')
b) I paid the rent for month of:
 mid-June to mid-July on first day itself, 
for July-August: on second/third week of July
for August-September: on first/second week of September

Thus, each time I paid the rent in full and before the completion of the month itself. Nowhere in the contract it says that I must pay the rent by certain date as well. 

**Point 2:** I was on my last day of my internship then, which means completing my reference request with supervisor and team get-together. My usual time to return is 18:30, but naturally that meant I would be back by 19:30 at least. 
My landlord:
a) Pressured me into coming earlier. I told her specifically that I can try to come between 18:30 to 19:30, and leave to another city by 20:00.
b) Without consulting with me, she called the new tenant to come right at 19:30! 

Nonetheless, I arrived at 19:30 and I moved out at 19:45. (I had three heavy bags to pick) 
The new tenant was completely fine with that, and since I am in touch with her, I am sure she can vouch for that as well that I did not result in undue pressure to her or landlord, infact vice versa.  

To add further on this, at one point she mentions herself that 'she would prefer if I come back before 20:00', which I did. As for the comment regarding 'cleaning', the landlord spent less than 3 hours at the flat after arrival and in arranging and cleaning, and I did ask her to provide me the images of unclean flat she found which she completely ignored.

**Point 3:** 
As for her requiring several hours, I actually believe this is quite normal that I am free to move the minor things where I find fit! I am talking about things like lamps and chairs, and putting them from one place to another. 
Furthermore, there is no contractual obligation against this as well. 
In fact, since we were texting and based on the timing etc, I can prove that the landlord required less than 3 hours to 'arrange and clean' as she says. 

**Other points:** 

a) The 'landlord' overcharges significantly for the flat. (Around 1,5x) This is based on my conversation with the neighbor girl, whose flat differs only minorly in structure.
In fact, I wrote the landlord specifically about it, who then lowered the rent a bit - and my understanding goes that she wants to keep the deposit to cover the losses. 
She is overcharging the new tenant by about ~2x as well. 
While the 'landlord' defends this by telling that 'landlords in Germany are free to charge as much as they like', I am quite certain there are laws in place which mean you cannot just charge whatever amount (10x, 100x) as you please. Furthermore, she is not even the 'landlord' herself as well, as such.

b) In an earlier conversation, 'landlord' told me in written that 'she will pay the deposit after she has received the rent and been to the place'. While I was moving out, she mentioned nothing regarding being displeased with the flat's conditions as such.

c) For first few days, there was no proper lightning in the flat. Upon my asking, the landlord just asked me to use the lamps, which strained my eyes badly and I was sitting in a dark flat for days. After calling her few times, she did come and we resolved this with the original landlord who installed new lights, but I am sure it could be termed as a health hazard that 'landlord' knew about, but chose to ignore.
Reddit, I could not approach any lawyer primarily because I do not know how all that works, and also I could possibly not afford that. Furthermore, I don't speak German as well.
Landlord specifically mentioned to me orally that 'you as foreigner won't have much rights here in Germany', meaning she is doing as she pleases. It is not only about 100 eur, but about the way she threatens. In fact, I would like to know if all the other points enable me to sue her for harrassment/ill-treatment etc?


Can you please help me with at least providing me with links etc to laws and regulations? I am sure a properly worded response to her with links to laws etc could help her understand that I am not completely alone by myself. "
3mzgtb,4,2015-09-30,Can you get an internship if you are out of school or close to graduation?,maxurmama,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3mzgtb/can_you_get_an_internship_if_you_are_out_of/,"I understand the bar for internship positions are generally lower than that of a full time position. However, every internship job posting states that the candidate must be in school and returning to school after the completion of the internship. I'm currently close to graduation (from a Masters degree), and I lack solid software engineering work experience, so I think it's more feasible for me to get an internship position instead of full time. I've been to two onsite interviews (for full time positions) from two great software companies couple months back, and from one of them the recruiter later told me my work experience looked weak compared to the other candidates. Does anyone know if it's possible to do an internship when you are out of school? I know it's not the convention. Any suggestions or comments is appreciated."

Advice?",emberyfox,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3mzikd/im_having_problems_with_paying_forsucceeding_at/,"I'm currently an intern at a large software engineering company, and I need advice. 

I'm making good money, but not enough as I'm having trouble paying for school/bills. I'm also having difficulty with school to boot. 

Loans are not ideal at all, as I've already accumulated a lot of debt being an out-of-state student at a large university. I've since switched to a cheaper school, but I'm still having trouble keeping up financially.

As for school, I have health issues that hinder my performance with my schoolwork. My doctor recommended dropping to part-time to lower my stress levels and help me succeed. However, I will be let go if I stop being a full-time student. I've ignored his advice and loaded up on my credits so I can graduate sooner and get a full-time position, but my performance in both school and my job is dropping.

I have two years of experience as a software engineering intern, but I'm not able to be hired on as a full-time until I get my Bachelors. Once I finish school, I'm guaranteed a job in the company with a 70k salary, which makes me hesitant to leave. 

What should I do?

***tl;dr:*** I have two years of experience as an intern, but I can't become a salaried employee until I graduate, where I'll make 70k.

3mzteh,5,2015-09-30,My engineering skills are so rusty I feel like an impostor applying for most engineering jobs.,job1011,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3mzteh/my_engineering_skills_are_so_rusty_i_feel_like_an/,"So I got a BS in EE back in 2007, I worked internships with a laboratory throughout college.  After graduating I traveled overseas for about 6 months and when I got back the economy crashed.  I did well in school, had technical internships with a prestigious national laboratory, but after 2008 that didn't translate into getting a job using my field.   I did eventually get an engineering job that lasted about a year before I got laid off, and I've worked various other jobs in between, only one of the others really using what I learned in school.  

Now, I hardly remember anything I learned in school.  I've forgotten a lot of my calculus, electronics: I remember all the basics but anything more complex than that is gone, programming and the like is almost entirely gone, but I never really cared for the programming in the first place.  It seems obvious to me that when I interview for jobs in my degree field, that I'm not up to snuff.  

Anyone else ever experience this?  The thing is I don't even know if I want to do EE anymore.  It's just the only thing I have qualifications for (at least on paper) that pays a decent wage.  I'm not really cut out for sales.  I was actually going to be a project manager, I was offered a position as one but the offer was later rescinded (long story).  

I'm just not sure where to go from here, I could re-train in a different field, but I would essentially be starting over and competing with recent graduates 10 years younger than me. 

It seems to me if you are a STEM major, and do not use your skills for the first few years after graduation and didn't finish graduate school, you are kind of screwed.   "

I've lost so much weight, I've had a couple of internships and I'm feeling great about my abilities and my outlook to find a job after I graduate.

But there's always this one issue that always hangs over my head. It's a brick wall that I'm always trying to tear down. It's social interaction, especially with girls. I'm so out of touch with people of my generation and I don't feel like I have any similarities with people my age.

I grew up pretty much isolated and it's been so, so hard to break out of my shell. I still haven't done it. I don't have people in my life whom you would call ""friends"", just ""acquaintances."" When I go home at night, I just have myself and my hobbies.

I've never had any success with girls. It seems like I try too hard or not try at all. How can I find a medium? It just sucks seeing all your friends having it so easy and girls are just fellow human beings to them, when to me they're like a different species when I develop an interest in them. I just want to find someone because I'm so sick of being lonely

I'm so scared that I'm going to wake up one day and be 35 years old and have nothing but a one-bedroom apartment with a dog with no girlfriend and no friends in my life.

My biggest problem is my laughable lack of self-awareness. I often do things when trying to interact with people and I have a hard time getting what their perceptions of me are. I feel like I do things without realizing that make people figure that I'm not worth being around. I mean nothing but well and it sucks.

What really sets me off is when people like my mom so badly miss the root cause of my problems. My mom thinks I don't push myself enough. The hell I don't. The problem is I try too hard. I can't find a medium. She thinks I set unrealistic goals when it comes to making friends and talking to girls. Little does she realize that it's not like that anymore.

My mom keeps telling me to think about the great things I've accomplished at college, but it's just that this issue is so important to me that thinking about these positives is only a distraction. It's hard to stay positive when you try so hard and fail so much to do the things you desperately want to accomplish.

The worst is when somebody says ""don't worry about it. It's going to happen. Just give it time."" Pretty much every person who has everything figured out gives out this advice. They never understand how lost the people they're giving this empty advice to are.

They say I've grown so much, but what has really changed? I still feel the same and my problems are the same.

It just really sucks that I still can't really convey all the things that are part of my problems, no matter how much I can write in this post.

I'm going to keep trying. What do I have to lose? I'm going to stay strong because I have everything to gain. But it's so hard and I'm trying to go into uncharted territory."

I am a masters student at a well renowned university in London, currently studying Financial Mathematics MSc, having completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics earlier this year.

I am wanting to pursue a career in quant analysis / algo trading, but currently somewhat lost for direction.

To be clear, I do NOT have any internships in banking, however I recently completed a 3 month summer internship in data analytics and have a good grasp of programming.

To what extent would not having an IB internship hinder me in the future? What do you advise I should be actively doing at the moment? Is there any point applying for IB grad positions, since many sources tell me that chances are slim without a prior internship? Should I apply for internship roles at the major banks as an MSc student?

My future plans are unclear at the moment. A PhD is a possibility depending on how this year unfolds, however I would quite like some industry experience. Are there any other things I could be doing to increase my chances of landing a job in the future?

I dont imagine the CFA is particularly well valued in the field right?
