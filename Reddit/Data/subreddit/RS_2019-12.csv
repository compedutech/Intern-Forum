As mentioned in the post, I've been able to get myself a handful of coursework started since Junior year but due to the requirements of my institution I don't qualify for a CS minor (those require 9-10 classes). 


Luckily, to my upmost surprise, I got an internship with a nonprofit who found out that I knew how to code with ReactNative and basically went ""Can you build us an app?"" I've been working on it, totally on my own, for the last 2-3 months and will be delivering it at the absolute latest this upcoming Wednesday. I'm just not sure where this can lead me. 

I'm unable to drive a car, so the fact is it's a basic requirement that I live in a major metro area since those are the only places with public transportation in the US. I will have a handful of CS coursework completed upon graduation (mostly in SWE, Web/Mobile Development), and am very interested in working in the EU if it's possible out of college. I'm fine working for a startup, getting 30kEUR a year, whatever it takes. The US market has always seemed cold, to a point where if you don't have specifically a CS degree you won't have any chance at an interview. Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden (while those aren't exclusively where I'm interested in, I've got family in Hungary), seem a lot less competitive or at least a lot more of an employee's market. Correct me if I'm wrong. 


Is this even a possibility right out of a US college to work at some startup or a bigger company and get a decent wage?"

I do however have some questions I need answered from people who go to UP.

- I plan on going for Computer science, I have been programming since I was 12 years old and for the past 2 years I have been an intern at an Advertising agency where we build, host and manage websites. We have some huge clients and I have experience in web development from this. (Note: Despite being an “intern” I am considered a full on employee within the company - I work on and manage sites, front and back end, of hospitals, pharmecutical companies, and much more) I do NOT want to follow web development as a career choice as the real money is in Software development. What should I do to prepare? What areas of math should I brush up on now, what classes should I and should I not take, what clubs should I join etc..

- To put it plainly, I enjoy the devils lettuce. Will it be easy to obtain? Are the campus security always on the lookout? Could I easily sneak off somewhere to light up / could I rip a pen out of my dorm without too much worry? I do not drink so idrc about alchohol however I’d like to know how Pennstate is on grass, I would hope its quite common like most colleges. Most importantly however, what is Pennstates policy on ganja and what will happen if Im caught?

- How’s the party scene? I plan on doing a lot of studying but I am quite a fan of the occaisonal party and I would assume its quite large speaking that the school is huge. 

- Where are your favorite places to hang with friends? 

- What is good OUTSIDE of campus? Cool places to go? Things to see? etc..

I know these questions are quite random, I just don’t really know where else to ask and they are questions that eat away at my mind constantly. Thanks for helping!"

I have been thinking a lot about what I want to build my career in. I started my MS in ECE at a Top 10 US university this Fall. I am currently taking courses in Computer Architecture and Digital VLSI Design. I love working on designing system architecture as well as RTL design/implementation. I recently got a summer intern offer at Nvidia as an ASIC Design Intern. I had following questions:

1) I wanted to know the skills I should build during my MS if I am interested in designing domain-specific architectures for applications like deep learning at these big companies in the future. I am genuinely interested in this area and feel like it's gonna be the future of hardware. 

2) How easy would it be to transfer to Computer Architecture roles after few years of experience if I start as an ASIC Design Engineer working on RTL implementation. 

3) Any tips/advice regarding courses or building a career in the industry in this post-Moore's law era?

Thank you for your time and advice!"

The general consensus is that you can get a Big N / any top internship without going to a target school. This is 100% true.

But a lot of people seem to downplay just how hard a top school name can carry you, even if you literally do nothing. If you get into a target school, you're pretty much set for life.

I'm currently heading into my junior year, and I have no prior internship experience (opting to hang out with friends freshman year, and study abroad after sophomore year). I also have no side projects other than my class projects and 1 hackathon project (took 5 hours max). I go to a top 3 (MIT / Stanford/ CMU)

My entire resume is pretty much just class projects and 1 TA position (for algorithms). I only applied to SF companies (mostly on LinkedIn)

**67 Applications**

**46 Coding challenges/Phone Interviews**, decided to do **15** of them.

**12 Final Round Interviews:** Decided to do **10** of them.

**7 Internship offers** (I did decently but didn't solve optimally for the 3 offers I didn't get).

My 7 offers include : (FB, Amazon, Uber, Riot Games, Slack)

I literally have near 0 software engineering skills and all I did was do \~50 LeetCode problems.

I made an ALT so hopefully this doesn't come off as a bragging post, but it's just funny how people seem to think the difference between a top-15 state-school and a top 4 doesn't make a difference.

edit: The point is that if you go to a top school, you can get great offers even with an empty resume and little skills. I'm not saying that a top school is necessary. The great part about CS is that no matter where you go, if you're qualified you will get offers."

This did not happen today, but rather last year or so. Anyway, so, back then,  I was in a Real Estate Company and was an IT Intern. However it has been decided in our department that we conduct a Information Systems Audit. I was assigned  check every files from other departments and what drives they access. So I was in this certain department checking all the computers. But I realized I missed out one. So I went and check out this guy's pc. I realized that his face was not so familiar, but looks like someon, I'm guessing he's new or something.However,  when I checked his pc, I noticed that he was not in the domain. That was when my supervisor stepped in and stopped me and asked, ""What are you doing with Boss' Laptop?""
That's when it hit me, I realized I was auditing not an employee but the brother of the CEO's pc. He was kinda cool though and luckily I didn't get fired out of spot.

TLDR;
I unknowingly breached the CEO's brother's confidential and personal laptop, that's why it is not connected in the domain."

I want to jump into the industry asap. As I’m completely sick of the industry I’m in just to have money throughout college. And I’m seeing all this talk about certifications and low cost boot camps to help jumpstart a tech career. Should I just wait until I get my first internship via school or should I get one of these certifications to help me get my foot in the door?

Anything that you want in life, that you can visualize in your mind, is possible. Your mind is a great tool, so use it wisely...

...

I grew up under the guise of someone else, not knowing how much of a follower I was, and not realizing that I had a lot of problems. More or less, these problems revolved around being to selfish; taking all the money for myself, eating all the food that was available to me, and learning how to be the absolute best in whatever hobby I took up so I wouldn't have to feel the pain of not being good enough. My household fostered this idea even more; that you need to be selfish, because others will always try to screw you over.  

This way of thinking brought me to social isolation and deprivation. I became over-concerned with upholding a higher standard to everyone and everything that I was interacting with. I got to a point where I became overly fixated on independence and self-sufficiency. I re-enforced this idea of self-sufficiency by joining the military. Military life was as they say, regimented, cultured, and unnecessarily time-killing. I am still happy that, to this day, I still have not let any bad military behaviors become habits (drink excessively, chew tobacco, go to the military only strip club off base, display an over-whelming macho behavior, etc...). However, I realize that the military did help me with one thing; learning how to grind through the suck no matter the circumstances. 

Fast forward a couple of years, I became heavily involved in college with clubs, classes, and events. I started to open myself up and put my military persona out there a bit more. I displayed an overly professional personality to most social situations and did not know how to let go (unless of alcohol), let the conversation flow naturally, and have fun. My social skills were not up to par and I didn't even know it. I would trick myself every single night by positive self-talk, which was ingrained in to me from the military, that I was not the problem and it was just the environment around me. I never took the time to explore why I had so many social insecurities and instead avoided exposing myself to situations where I could be bested. 

Another year or two later, I was sitting in a class, minding my business as usual, then a visiting professor comes in to talk to the class. We were all juniors and seniors who had upcoming internship requirements to fulfill, and she was going to give us the opportunity to fulfill them in a fun way; by studying abroad in Germany and The Netherlands. 

I was skeptical about the program at first because it only lasted a month, all the academic work was front-loaded, and it seemed too easy, but I wanted to travel to Europe so badly, so I took out another student loan (which the military did not cover), and signed up. Fortunately, I got the trip approved by my military chain of command, who waited until the last minute to sign off on my paperwork and let me go. 

From this point on, I didn't realize how much pain and pleasure were ahead of me but I did it anyways. 

From the start of the trip, I was thoroughly enjoying every moment of being abroad, seeing the sights, and learning about peace-building initiatives, procedures, and international criminal and/or civil law. There was even one girl who was flirting with me during these first couple days, and I was becoming fixated on her and her ""affection"" for me. Later on, her and I split off from the main group, and toured the inner-streets of Hamburg, Germany on our own. It was such a beautiful experience to share together, and I thought that when we went back to the hostel we were staying at, to get changed and meet the main group again for dinner, I was going to seal the deal with her and make her my girlfriend (on the spot, right then and there). I thought that she was the one who would finally work out for me because I never had actually been in an involved relationship before. It was so nice to receive the feminine energy that I thought, ""this is what having the right girlfriend must feel like... this is what love must feel like."" 

I was wrong, and extremely wrong... when she friend-zoned me. She then started to act very weird (doing things I didn't understand), talking to the other guys, and portraying like she didn't know she was flirting with me the during those past few days. 

I had been verbally slapped, emotionally hit harder than I've ever hit before, and mentally defeated. I didn't know what to do with myself to overcome the pain of social embarrassment and exposure. I started to drink, at least a bottle of wine, for the next few nights, just to fall asleep and forget about her. I complained to the other girls on the trip and spread rumors about ow much of a bad person she was in order to make myself feel better, not caring how much damage I was potentially inflicting. 

But then, I made a breakthrough. One morning, barely wanting to get out of the bed, I put aside my ego, and accepted how much of a social screw-up that I was. I accepted the fact that I was the problem, not everyone else. When I did this, my social situations became slowly better. I started to not try as hard to please everyone in the conversations and began to let go and just have fun, regardless of everyone else's opinion of me. I did something that I had never done before; dance at a nightclub! 

Slowly but surely, I was bouncing back from the emotional low-point that I was just in. I was going out to night-clubs, every single night, approaching girls, and having fun. I made it my personal goal to overcome this weakness that I had just realized. 

Fortunately, we had just arrived in Amsterdam, where you can improve your social game at an exponential growth. It accelerated my learning so fast, that I couldn't believe how much improvement I had made in the course of a week. Eventually, I had a breakthrough; I successfully pulled a girl back to my room and we made sweet sweet love! After that day and night, which I will never forget, my social growth was at mock-speed... and I didn't know where I would end up, but what I did know, was that I will never return to the socially isolated person again, so I continued my social improvement journey. 

Fast forward to today... I run my own social improvement business, where I work with young men to improve their relationships, build social networks, and gain alliances. I never would have thought that so many people are going through some or all of the same struggles I went through and I'd be in a position to help them through it. I must say that I riding the wave of my social improvement journey panned out very well and I am forever grateful for the process. 

...

The message I want to convey to you is this; whatever self-improvement journey you are on, stick with it, you will never know where that sailboat lands and enjoy the ride as long as you can. There will be plenty of ups and downs along the way, but its all worth it! If by chance this story resonated with you, and you are in the situation now that I've been in before, I urge you to reach out and get the help you don't just need, but that you deserve!

Having been rejected from all graduate jobs I had applied to, I decided to do an internship, realising that the lack of industrial experience was probably hurting my chances. I managed to secure this internship with a massive company, I was lucky that a site of one of the biggest chemical manufacturers in the world was only 10 minutes from my parents' house, so I could live at home and work here.

The problem is, the pay is minimum wage, which I guess is to be expected for an internship of this sort, and it isn't too much of an issue as I'm saving money on rent by living with parents for the time being. Nevertheless, it's quite disheartening.

In terms of work I am doing, it varies, although it is mostly project engineering work, which I find quite boring due to the endless paperwork involved. When I have been involved in more process-type work I have found it more interesting, although these opportunities are few and far between.

In the 5 months I have been at the company I have actively been applying for other permanent jobs, and have had 2 interviews, 1 of which they were very impressed with me and I have been put through to the next stage of the interview process, however to my dismay the interview process has now been put on hold and everything seems to be moving very slowly :/  I have used holiday leave on these interviews and as a result have very little left. I feel like having this job is holding me back from applying to other ones.

So basically my question is if it is a wise move to leave without securing another job? I have a plan in my head that I will leave this internship in January regardless if I have secured a full time job or not, seeing as I will then have had 6 months experience with a respectable company.  I have saved a reasonable amount in these 5 months and am currently investing the money. 

I also have plans to travel at some stage and to be honest, if I don't manage to secure a permanent job immediately it would be nice to be freed up again for a month or two as I'm currently working long hours for low pay. The only thing is, I am worried about companies looking at a gap in employment if I don't manage to find a job immediately.

I'd appreciate any advice or guidance!

TLDR: Graduated from Chemical Engineering, doing a year internship, good company, low pay, work is boring most of the time, using most of holiday leave to apply to other jobs, do I quit the internship without having secured another job?"

I am an Indian citizen looking to apply for a job seeker visa in 2020. I have a Masters in Nuclear Physics and have worked in the education sector for three years. A year back I decided to change my field and did a diploma in Data Science and Business Analytics. Presently I am working as a Data Science Intern for a company in India since October.

I was going through some websites and read that one of the criteria to be eligible for a job seeker visa is having 5 years of experience, though some websites stated you only need 3 years of work experience. My question is, will my experience before my Data Science diploma count or do I need 3 years of experience in Data Science to be eligible? 

Also, how likely is it that I will find a job in the field of data science in the six months the visa is valid?

Thank you."

&gt;We all try so hard here for that 1600, 4.0, EC, jobs, etc for college and many of us...will go to a state school like everyone else who didn't try. We'll have everything we did for nothing. I feel like if I get rejected from T20s, I've accomplished nothing. My time has been wasted and I would have been in the same school if I had done nothing.

That got upvoted to hot. I'm not trying to call out OP, just point out that the sentiment is alive and well on this sub.

But it shouldn't be. **You might go to the same school as your less driven peers, but you'll come in with better opportunities and better skills.**

# Scholarships

Thinking plainly, if you're going to your state school but you're competitive for T20s, you'll get substantial scholarships. That's going to offset the cost of your education a lot, and there's a chance you could graduate debt-free, or close to it.

You might not fully appreciate that now, but I guarantee you will at 35, when all of your debt-ridden classmates are still paying 20% of their income to offset student loans. And if you do decide to go to grad school, you won't have to worry about the loans you took out for your undergrad.

# Honors Programs

Any state school is going to have a good honors college, which you'll be a member of. Here are just a few of the perks:

* **Priority registration for all of your classes.** This is a lifesaver at the bigger schools, where kids freak out the second registration opens and rush to get a spot in their preferred class (and usually don't get it). You'll never have to worry about your long-term graduation plan being thrown off because you couldn't sign up for a class on time, or have to settle for a class with a professor you don't like. You get first pick.
* **Priority and/or special housing.** Lots of colleges give honors kids the first pick of dorms, or they have the choice of living in honors housing. And with the wide range of housing at most state schools, from *built in the 1910s and falling apart* to *modern tech paradise built 2 years ago*, you'll be extremely grateful. Plus, honors housing builds a community for you and lets you find academically minded peers.
* **Specialized advising and mentoring.** Going to a big state school, or even a T20, means you'll probably see your advisor a few times a year, usually just to schedule classes. With honors programs, you have a counselor dedicated to you, and you can meet with them regularly. Obviously this is super helpful when you're looking for opportunities like internships or summer programs. Plus, you'll get connected to a mentor in your field of interest, and growing that relationship will give you access to a lot of amazing programs you won't have known about otherwise.
* **Honors classes/seminars.** Not a thing at all schools, but some state schools let you take a few Honors-only classes, which tend to be much more discussion-based. They're also capped at a much smaller number of students, so your learning is much more personalized.

# Advanced Standing Opportunities

You know all those AP/IB/dual credit classes you're taking? Remember how the whole point is to get you college credit? It actually transfers at state schools, unlike most T20s. You can build a much more personalized schedule, from graduating early, double-majoring, skipping weed-outs, or just enjoying your classes more than if you were forced to take ""Intro to Physics"" as an English major.

For me, my AP classes clear away all but 6 credit hours of a 32 credit hour gen-ed requirement at my state school. I could graduate a year early, but because my scholarships are so nice, I'd probably take 4 years and leave with a major, related minor, and 3 school-year internships in my desired field. I wouldn't have that much course flexibility if I went to a T20, and it's honestly a big reason why I'm considering staying in-state.

# Resume and College ECs

No matter what, the tangible stuff disappears once you reach college--you won't be MUN President or LD State Champion--but the lessons you learn from your ECs don't. You're going to enter college with better time management and organization, better soft skills, and better understandings of what it takes to run an organization like a club.

That stuff can stay on your resume until you build up college honors. If it's freshman year and you're trying to get an internship in your field, you'll have the EC experience that shows you understand what you're doing. When you're competing with other underclassmen, or even some juniors, internships/competitions/leadership shows that you know what's going on.

That experience also makes it easier for you to dive into campus extracurriculars so you can build up your resume and keep doing the things you loved to do in high school. At your state school, you'll be a big fish. You'll be able to take up leadership more quickly and be a star within the clubs. You'll get to be fully immersed in what you're doing as extracurriculars, not just a minor role like you might be at T20s.

# You've put yourself on a track for success no matter where you go. State schools will throw opportunities at you, and not everyone gets that opportunity. Don't forget that.

e4qz8e,1,2019-12-01,Academic or Industry Letter of Recommendation,Neilson5,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/e4qz8e/academic_or_industry_letter_of_recommendation/,"**Bad TL;DR:** I have three letters of recommendation. A former boss, a professor and a colleague from my current job. School wants 2 Academic letters and one industry letter. Former boss considers himself an academic and I suspect most people would, but the school doesn't seem to after a limited discussion. I am hesitant to remove him (integral to talking about my intro to research) and my former colleague (how I have been doing thus far). Should I chalk up the disagreement as just a miscommunication, or should I proceed with replacing one of my letter writers (probably the colleague)?

I am currently wrapping up my first wave of applications (the ones that are rolling or are due in December), and I have run into somewhat of a problem.

I met with an admissions person at one of the schools I am interested in and they told me that they valued letters of recommendation very highly. I originally thought it wouldn't be a problem as I had a really good research background from both my internships and my current work. With that said, they emphasized that I should have 2 Academically oriented letters of recommendation and one industry oriented letter of recommendation (as I have been working for quite sometime). Again, I initially thought I had 2 academic letters of rec, but there seemed to be some disagreement.

Currently, my letter writers are my former boss from a previous internship, a professor of mine and a colleague at my current job. Initially this seems like 2 industry letters and one academic however, my internship was more of an REU. Not to mention, the professor who is writing my letter of recommendation is a colleague of my former boss and he took part in the research that we did together. My former boss considers himself to be an academic letter of recommendation as well.

So I am not quite sure how to proceed along those lines. I have some time for this specific application as its a rolling application and not due until early next year. However, if anything I would probably need to drop my colleague and reach out to a professor I had in the past. Although, if I do that, then they have no recommendation about my current work experience which is also a major factor. I can't remove my former boss as I believe his letter is also fairly integral to my application as he had the most hands on experience with the research project, while the professor had more experience working with me in class along with some discussions about approaches to take for the research project.

It was only a very short discussion with the admissions person, so I am not sure if I managed to describe the experience as well as I could have and I didn't want to push. I believe the miscommunication may come from the fact that I mentioned getting paid for the research but that was mostly just for the cost of living. I am currently planning on pushing ahead and hoping that my former boss writes it in such a way that it is very clear that the research was more academically oriented rather than industry. However, I am interested in other people's takes about if I should replace a letter writer.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm at a top-5 US university and really relying on having a lot of control over my schedule to be able to function. The one time I had to get up five days a week for class kind of tanked my ability to do anything and I missed a lot of class. I've gotten okayish grades since then by making sure I don't wake up before noon more than twice a week. That probably won't fly in most workplaces, especially not the sort where my specific degree will have much sway. My family is not super well off and already has one very smart child who will probably never be able to work full-time (autism spectrum disorder) and as the one-who-got-into-an-ivy-league I feel some responsibility to be at least financially independent, and it would be really cool if I could actually help with some of my family's debts and such. I'm personally pretty frugal so money isn't a huge deal, especially not right away, but I'd like to at some point make a respectable income. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what I have going for me:

\-fancy degree

\-(implication that comes with a fancy degree that I was deemed worthy of a prestigious institution and related traits of intelligence/creative talent/general personal integrity) 

\-more specifically, a BA in English with a concentration in creative writing

\-maybe an MFA at some point if I want to stall even further

\-paid marketing internship at the university press

\-technically pretty good at writing. especially fiction but also creative nonfiction. this has some transferable skills i hope.

\-i would say an especially good eye for editing/critique due to a lot of experience in student workshops

&amp;#x200B;

What my unreasonable requirements are:

\-three day weekends (at least)

\-not getting up before eleven more than twice a week

\-not super stressful or competitive but still interesting

\-workplace that's pretty chill about you falling asleep as long as you get your work done lol

\-probably more sick-days than average because I don't have far to fall before I'm too tired to function and shit happens despite my best intentions

&amp;#x200B;

ideally:

\-relevant to my skills

\-well paying"

I hope your Thanksgiving weekend went well! I had two questions I wanted to reach out about:

1) How likely is it for someone to be placed on their #1/2 choice for a team? I'd strongly prefer to develop in Java and have more of a focus on backend development, so the XX, XX, &amp; XX teams really interest me. I was wondering how likely it would be for me to get placed onto one of these teams?

2) Would it be possible to increase the relocation bonus and have a portion of it provided up front? I am based out of EAST COAST, so the move would be pretty significant for me and I don't really have enough savings to cover most of the travel expenses and initial costs like furniture &amp; leasing an apartment (first month's rent &amp; deposit). Would it be possible to increase the relocation bonus to $4-5000 and have 25-50% of it provided immediately (Dec-March)? I am concerned about the costs associated with relocating &amp; this would be extremely helpful me transition to WEST COAST.

Earlier this semester I accepted back at GE for an internship next summer, following my previous summer there. It pays well in a low COL area, and aligns perfectly with my career goals. 


A few days ago, I got an offer from Amazon which pays more than double, but isnt as perfectly aligned as GE wirh my goals, but wouldnt prevent me from pursuing them. I’d be sad to miss my last summer of college here, but I know Seattle would also be fun, and that this internship would be huge for my career. 


What would y’all do in my situation and, if you’d pick Amazon, how would you go about rescinding an acceptance?"

I am currently a Junior in my undergrad CS degree, and am debating between going to Zillow or Twitter for my last summer internship next year.

I have one friend who interned at Twitter in the past and absolutely loved it, and I don't know anyone who has worked at Zillow but I enjoyed all my conversations during the application process and from what I read online people seem to really like working there.

Compensation and bonuses, etc., are very similar so that doesn't matter too much. Zillow would be in Seattle, and Twitter in SF. SF is obviously more expensive, but seems like the cooler city and may lead to more networking opportunities in the tech industry.

If you have worked or know someone who was worked in any of these companies before, I would be glad to hear about the experience!

I am looking for a company that I would like to return for full-time the following year, and would likely extend an offer after an internship. But I also would like to know which of these companies would you guys say has a better name and would make a greater impact for my future opportunities?

Thanks in advance!"

I am inside an academic extracurricular where I have to write several reports annually on the financial and economic analysis on various companies, and there are few financial CCAs in my college.

I'm thinking of quitting since I:
1. Don't like the culture inside
2. Don't like the seniors 
3. Find the research very boring (not interested in what we are analysing on) 
4. Find it a waste of time due to how unsatisfying and dry it is
5. Find it quite stressful (I spend over 30 hours on one report) 

My estimated GPA would be over 3.7, and I plan to spend my time learning other skills like coding, excel and participating in other clubs.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry, i do not really know how to start this. I am 22 years old and i don't really see the future as something pleasant. I am at a point in my life where i wake up everyday ( for the past 8 months at least ) and the first thing i think everyday is ""Kill yourself, it will be better then what is coming"".

It is not that there is no reason to think this, but i just want it to stop before i give in to the voice. I studied as a biologist for 2 years, before deciding that this isn't my future. This to great disappointment of my parents also with quite some financial consequences. I am in my third (second to last) year of business engineering. I failed my previous internship an my stomach is telling me i will fail this internship again. One would think that i would be extra driven to not let it come to this. But my feeling of failure is making me even more incapacitated. I am at my internship, just staring at my screen, 8 hours a day. I know what i have to do, but i just don't do anything. I don't know why.

Even if i complete my internship and thanks to some kind of miracle i will get my degree, i don't see the future as something bright. I am just afraid about what will happen next, what ""normal life"" will be.

I grew up in a very aggressive home. Had to call the police several times to stop the violence at home. Even though things are looking brighter at the moment at home, my parents don't love each other. I don't know if they ever did. Maybe as a result of this is am not eager about relationships. I have been in them, but i cut them off before i can hurt them. I am afraid i inherited the violent and aggressive side of my family and i would never want anyone to see this side of me.

I also have two little brothers of 15. I love them more then anything in the world. But these two angels are starting to become more and more independent. I am awfully proud of this, but when times got rough in the past i knew i couldn't call quits because i had a responsibility of these two. But more and more i am beginning to think that also they are better off without a deadbeat brother.

My procrastination is getting out of hand. Just had a panic attack just opening my mail and i wanted to voice my concern on this subreddit two months ago.

And even now i am close to submitting a post, i still don't know why i am doing it or what i am expecting.

I just want to be happy again and do things, go forward.

Sorry for wasting any time, because the answer is always. Just start doing it.

Gods bless all of you"

e4zert,37,2019-12-02,I need help escaping soul-crushing work,funerealfeghoot,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e4zert/i_need_help_escaping_soulcrushing_work/,"Sorry this is going to be a long one but I need to get it all out. If even one person can help me feel less miserable it might be worth it:


I’ve always detested the idea of giving away years of my life working for someone else. But I’ve accepted that in order to provide for myself, I don’t have much of a choice right now.

I have always loved writing, the only thing in this world I am truly passionate about is creating fascinating characters and compelling stories. So my compromise to becoming a cog in the machine, is to find a job doing something I love. But it seems to be... pretty much impossible. I graduated with a double major (English and communications) and a concentration in creative writing from well-known and respected university, and could not find a decent job in over a year. No one would give me a chance in any type of creative position (no matter how far down the ladder it was), so I started applying to jobs I knew I would not enjoy but could at least help me save some money. Finding a job I did not want took another year, and now I am finally working as a digital marketer. 

I have only been at this position for about 5 months, but it already makes me want to scoop out my eyeballs with a melon baller. I write bland uninspired social media copy and create blog articles that are not so subtle ads. My coworkers are all friendly and it’s actually a very laid back environment, but I can’t shake the feeling I am wasting my time and energy at this place. My boss told me if I keep at it for another year or two they can move me up to a managerial position and that comment alone almost made me vomit. Why the hell am I wasting the (supposedly) best years of my life getting entry level experience for career I don’t even want? I come home so drained I barely do any personal creative writing anymore. I only have about 2-3 hours of free time a day once everything is said and done. I don’t even workout anymore because I struggle to find the time, and it’s doing a number on my self esteem. I’ve also been having a crazy amount of health problems lately, so much so that I feel closer to 85 than I do 25.

The plan was to work here for a year, so I could save up enough to study screenwriting at a prestigious graduate school that can hopefully put me into an internship program at a studio. But I don’t know how much longer I can take it. My life feels so empty, so meaningless with each passing day. I have dealt with major depression for most of my adult life and this job is undoing a lot of progress I made with finding happiness. I have even noticed thoughts of suicidal idealization reappearing, which I haven’t dealt with in years. 

I know I can’t expect strangers on the internet to have all the answers but I just need help. I‘m sure people will probably tell me to see a therapist first but I have been multiple over 5 years with little progress. I recently stopped because I can’t afford it if I want to save any money, and I frankly don’t have the time. I know my mental health isn’t helping but my situation is the problem. I need to start doing something I care about, or at least feel like I am on the path leading to doing something I care about. 

What I need help with is escaping the 9 to 5. I don’t see how I can realistically prepare for grad school, write on my own, and submit to contests/ send in job applications, all while working 40 hours a week. It’s just not feasible. So I was hoping someone would have ideas for me on how to escape full time employment. Are there any freelance or part time opportunities I should research? Should I look into something like buying a property and becoming a landlord? I am lucky enough to have parents who can provide for me now but when they retire in a few years I won’t be able to rely on them anymore, and honestly I really don’t want to sponge off them anymore than I already have. If anyone has ideas on how to break into the film or tv industry that would also be helpful, but dont worry about trying to deter me, I know how incredibly slim my chances are of my making it. I have family members who keep trying to push me to find a realistic career but I can’t wrap my head around anything they suggest, it just sounds like giving up on my life. I know I haven’t picked an easy career path, but it doesn’t feel like I had any choice. It’s the only thing I care about and the only thing I’m halfway decent at. I just need a mentor, someone to help guide me down the right path.  I have been looking into online film courses or mentor ship programs (such as film connection) but can’t decide what my best options are. Please, if you have any advice for me it would be really appreciated right now."

Firstly I have a type of arthritis (AS) which causes difficulty sitting for long periods (I've tried many, many chairs), and crohn's, fatigue is a bastard. Therefore I'm looking for part-time work. Secondly I had really bad anxiety during my twenties (I'm now 36) and fell into alcoholism. I have been sober for 6 years, but still struggle with depression and low self esteem. I have basically no work experience between 22 and 30, and then only sporadic retail jobs.

The good stuff, I guess, I'm volunteering with Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion (yeah, I don't know if that would help or hinder) and at a forest park as admin in the office once a week. I study with the Open University part-time, 1st year (2nd in real terms) Computing and IT. I have some experience with Java and Android apps although I'm pretty rusty now.

My motivation for my studies is going downhill, I believe this is solely due to lack of seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. I've checked out local volunteering and can't find much (waiting to here from local hospital about a role in admin), internships are for 2nd years really and all based far away from where I live. I just don't know what else to do. I had a refusal where I asked for advice and the HR lady kindly replied but what stuck out was the job was offered to someone with 6 years experience. There ain't much I can do about that, it was entry level too. Everything needs a bachelor's degree, teach abroad, volunteer with UNICEF etc. I've just run out of ideas. I want to be a productive member of society."

It took me a guts actually to write this. But somehow I do need an advise and moral support.

To begin, I am being diagnose for PTSD for almost 4 years now (after actively seeking medical help with my local psychologist). During my first year visited for my therapy, I slowly able to cope with my fear for saying NO to people who always used me for their own benefits. After a while, yes I did improve to lower down my fear. However, I starter to notice that I tends to be more sensitive with people especially every time I started new employment. FYI, for 3 years coming 4 years of my working experience, I am harding staying for more than 5 months for the company I work with (Well not all the company is bad, one or two of the company I work just for an internship). Reason is due to toxic environment, mismanagement, nepotism and bully.

As for today, I just starting to work with new company (after 5 months from my last company that I work. Reason for resignation: Got offered to pursued my study. Yes currently I am a part-time student). And somehow I've noticed that all my colleagues exchange smirked to each other as soon they saw me. At first I said to myself ""maybe is just my first impression"" but somehow, it's getting more noticeable cus they did the smirking stuff for the whole day. The question is, if they did not like my existence at the office, why hired me and why offered me at first place? Or am I just being sensitive and overthinking due to traumatic experience?

Disclaimer: My context might be a not organise. So, I apologise in advance. I kinda feel like a little bit down right now and my depression slowing hitting me."

Im currently a highschool junior, but my mom has been pressuring me to do a ton of college research and its starting to stress me out. Shes never been to college, and just wants the best for me, but id like to know what i *really* need in order to apply or be set to start college, as i dont have anyone else to ask. As long as i pass all my classes this year ill have all my required credits, but my mom is pushing me through senior year, so i figure that will give me some time to gather all the information i need. 

First Question: The major id like to go into, Environmental Science, is not offered anywhere near me, or the surrounding states. Ive found a college ive set myself to hope to apply to, but what do i need in order to set myself up for going to an out-of-state college? 

Second Question: Is searching for internships in that field worth it? Or any feild really. Ive heard both sides, that it has helped people, and also heard that it harms them. Im not sure what to do or which to believe. 

And last: Should i start my in depth research as well as application process now? Id like to apply Early Decision, and im also working on scholarships as my grades are pretty good at the moment :) ill be taking the SAT soon, as well as the ACT if my family has money. I was sure i should wait to begin my application until after i take those, but i wasnt sure :)

e52lpi,3,2019-12-02,"""Discuss a time when you made a mistake.""",Charles_Stover,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e52lpi/discuss_a_time_when_you_made_a_mistake/,"RE: any variant of this question

I just happened passed the following quote, and it reminded me of this behavioral interview question with which I used to really struggle.

&gt;“Smart people change their mind, and they do it sometimes when they get new data, they do it sometimes just because time has passed and they have analyzed the situation better. People who are right a lot don’t get trapped in self consistency. If something has changed or if they have re-analyzed it and they realized they were wrong, they change their mind.” ~ Jeff Bezos

When I first entered the workforce, I thought the best answer to ""What is your biggest flaw?"" was to say that you're a perfectionist about correcting your flaws as a roundabout way of saying you don't have any.

Being able to admit you have flaws, have made mistakes, and will make mistakes is a crucial part of _growth_ and team integration.

Companies do not want to hire you so that you can blame everyone else for your problems. Companies do not want to hire you if you will always be an intern or junior because you are incapable of growing from your mistakes.

Companies are not looking for some perfectionist who has never made a mistake, because _that person does not exist_.

Being able to admit you made a mistake is the shining star we're looking for. It means you can improve over time. It means when you are hired today, you will be better tomorrow. You are an _investment_. It means you will own your mistakes and not blame your team, creating strain and resentment. Teamwork is vital to success, and by extension, so is self-criticism.

Do not be afraid to talk about a time when you made a mistake. I absolutely want to hear that you screwed up, _and that you realize it_. I want to hear what you **learned** from that experience and that you won't make that mistake again. Speak confidently about how you screwed up, because literally everyone at that company has screwed up in much more major ways. It will not be held against you. It will be held in your favor.

Good luck out there!"
e52r9l,58,2019-12-02,From one Cmpsc Major to another. Graduating senior this semester,JacquelineCharmander,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/e52r9l/from_one_cmpsc_major_to_another_graduating_senior/,"I \*should\* be graduating this semester with my BS in Cmpsc, unless my Cmpsc 458 fuck me over since I have a 74%-ish in the class right now, and there are still a few things left including a 15% final. But that aside, I wanted to write a little bit about my thought, collect it and write down what I really, really feel, especially now that I'm finishing up my CS degree at PSU.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Cmpsc 458, Don't take the class. Cmpsc 458 is Fundamental of Computer Graphic. I \*know\* walking into the class that it was going to be a hard class, I figured it's my final semester I only take 3 classes how bad can it be, even if it was hard I could spend extra time blah blah. Ha ha. The programming assignments in this class are super hard. You can understand the materials, write correct code (by correct I mean you can go to the TA and ask what's wrong with your code, they compare their code to your, said ""your code look like mine"", but it is not working). The first 2 projects weren't so bad (first 2 were Height Map and Rollercoaster), but the last 2 is crazy hard, the first is Raytracing, which I don't think the material itself is hard, but because it's C++ I guess and you are dealing with vector/matrices with OpenGL and all the normalizing vector and shit it make it needlessly difficult. Even if you do the math right, you will still be throwing in i don't know 20+ hours and not make any progress because the equation is right but you don't know why it isn't working. The last project is... well, kinda stupid, you are given 3 choices of what to do, you have to pick 1 and start from scratch, I tried to implement this ([http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/NPS/alg.html](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/NPS/alg.html)), but man the calculation for SSD is a bitch. Even right now I still don't know how to do it, but it isn't due until like next Friday (before the final) so I still have sometime to figure it out. It's a very, very math heavy class, and even as a math major (hilariously) I still can't do it .\_\_. . Good thing though, it's an elective, so you only need a D, but still, pick easier elective.

&amp;#x200B;

You want more hot take on Cmpsc courses? Coming right up, Cmpsc 475: App Programming with John Hannan. Don't get me wrong, he's a great guy, great professor and I think he really care for his students, but I really, really, really, I can't stress enough, REALLY hate the fact that he force NOT JUST ATTENDANCE, but also participation in his class. I.e you can't just show up to class to get point, you have to go to class and raise your hand to answer AT LEAST once. If you don't do it? Well participation is 20% of your grade, AND, I don't even know if this is legal or not, but you need to get 70% in EVERY category to pass the class, so if you get 100% on your final project, 100% on your weekly assignment, but a 69% in your participation, guess what? You fail. Also his weekly assignment take forever, it isn't even that it is hard, it just you are literally building an app almost every weeks, so there are a looot of work. Overall, decently class if you aren't a graduating senior or having senioritis.

Oh, speaking of being a senior, DON'T take Cmpsc 483W, a.k.a Capstone. Unlike other major, you actually have a choice, don't take it, take Cmpsc431W instead (preferably with Wang Lee, he's such a great man). I dropped Cmpsc 483W and switched to 431W, you know why? Because you might get put on projects that you don't care about or get, well, not as ""good"" teammate. For example, when I took 483W, I was assigned to a team of myself and \*drumroll pls\*, 3 Industrial Engineer major, and our project was to build a system to help PSU communicate with job recruiter better etc, I should press that they \*want\* a prototype, i.e something you code, I will leave the rest up to your imagination. Oh and, this is just personal opinion, I think the whole capstone system is a scam anyway. It's a cheap way for companies to get you to do their pet projects for them without having to pay much money in exchange for ""experiences"". So in a sense, it's an unpaid internship, but in fact it is even worse than unpaid internship because you are paying to get that experiences. So yeah, take Cmpsc 431W instead.

&amp;#x200B;

If you can, take Cmpsc 465 with Kamesh Madduri. He doesn't make Cmpsc465 easier than other professor, but goddamn he does care for you and he really, really want to make you pass. I passed his class with an A first try, and I had a friend who dropped his class first semester because he was busy, then take it the following semester with a different professor who (like many other Cmpsc professor), weren't that great, end up dropping it and wait until Madduri teach Cmpsc 465 again, to take it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know people talk about how bad Cmpsc 311 and 360 is all the time, it's a deadhorse, so I won't mention it. However, I do want to talk just a little bit about Cmpen 331, which I assume for most of you is with Mohamed Almekkawy (I think he been teaching this class over and over again for the last few years), he's care, no doubt about that, and his class is required so you don't have a choice, so this isn't really a recommendation or anything, just a rant. Why does he have to make his midterm 3 hours long? Even if you study the material well, 3 hours midterms are just bad, like after the first hour my brain is fried so, whew.

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit about Cmpsc 473. Quite frankly, I don't think this class is hard, it just the fact that you are programming in C that make it hard. When I took it in Spring 2019, I think over half of the class did not finish Lab 4, and a lot of people were caught cheating on it. The worst part is, the material for it wasn't hard, in fact I think I wrote down the preliminary logic for the lab within 2 hours, but then spend the next 7 hours fixing a segmentation fault, then another 8 hours to fix a bug that come from the fact that I didn't malloc an array. I am almost positive that a lot of people actually knew the material well, it just C was giving them shit.

&amp;#x200B;

It getting quite long, so I will wrap it up with positive stuffs. Overall, I would be lying to myself if I say Cmpsc degree at PSU was useless. I really enjoy the fact that they teach you theory and force you to understand not just how to write a data structure, but actually understand how it work and more importantly, \*why\* it work, or just how computer work, or even how programming languages are designed. I really think this is what make you a good programmer, and while you don't need to go to college to learn these things, the fact that they force you to learn this alone show that PSU did put in a lot of thought when designing the cirruculum. I won't get too much into detail as to why I believe that to be the case, but I will say: Think of it this way, what separate a bad programmer from a good programmer? The fact that he can spit out a lot of code fast, or the fact that he actually understand how things work and able to architect a whole efficient system from start to finish? You can learn practical coding stuff anywhere, but learning the theoretical stuff is harder and can push your skill to a different level.

&amp;#x200B;

And just a little bit more: All the Cmpsc advisors I met have been nothing but great, Mark Mahon, Owen Grall, they all are very passionate and want to help you, albeit they are quite busy and have limited time.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly: Recommended technical elective: Cmpsc 451 with Wenrui Hao, Cmpsc 410 Big data, no recommended professor."

My biggest issue is all the code I'm doing is mostly in COBOL and pick BASIC. We do some type script and xammel but that's it.

Writing this on a throwaway, really need some help. 

Currently I'm an intern on my year in industry and am living with 3 other people in a bed house, I am 4 months into my 12 month contract. We moved into this place mid August. I live in the UK, the house is owned by someone who lives in Poland and rents it out to us through PurpleBricks. 

About 8-9 weeks ago I came back from a day away to smell a very odd smell in my en-suite of my rented house. I cleaned my bathroom repeatedly to make sure it wasn't anything my end/the drains/the water traps in the system. This smell started to give me a headache that just never went away, it also caused me to hallucinate at night when trying to sleep, feel very cold and feverish and sick (flu like). I contacted PurpleBricks and they sat on for a week before telling the landlord. The landlords mate came round, 7 weeks ago, checked my bathroom and the attic (very briefly mind) and said it smelt like a dead animal but he couldn't see anything and left. 

After telling PurpleBricks it wasn't gone and the landlord's mate, who was meant to be his designated contractor, did nothing, they again, very slowly and painfully sent round a multitude of plumbers, and pest control. Keep in mind this was 2.5 weeks into me telling them I was getting ill and it needed to be dealt with urgently. By this stage I was peeing blood and had to move to my family home and was taken off work for 2 weeks whilst they investigated my health.

They eventually decided there were rats and finally found a corpse of one that had died directly above my en-suite and had rotten through the floorboards leaving a stain. This however was not told to us by PurpleBricks as they said it was in fact a leak in the roof and that everything had been patched up and sort, we only found out about the rodent problem due to our honest pest control and plumbing workers who had been sent out. This took PurpleBricks 4-5 weeks to deal with, damaging my health without any care. 

Alongside this, the landlord was very poor and communicated through my texts rather than through PurpleBricks and our PurpleBrick agent went AWOL for the tail end of the 5 weeks and the contractors rang me about 30 minutes before they came round every time meaning I had to travel, whilst ill, in order to let them in at my own inconvenience; rather than the landlord or the agency helping out at all.

This is where I was hoping it was resolved, I was getting better and I'd been told the issues had been fixed and things had been put in place to prevent any chance of animals getting in, even though we were also told it was a leak? However after moving back in I kept hearing scuttling above me and knew that it wasn't sorted, on top of this when I sleep there I get really severe headaches and neck pain still, but when I'm not there it eases.

To this now I'm done, I feel unsafe and neglected by the landlord and PurpleBricks, it's been 8-9 weeks since the my report and there is no care in my health or my well being, I want out of my contract and away from this house so this is why I'm here for advice. I've signed a joint contract with my other 3 housemates and I've checked the contract and there is no clauses on it for early exit. Given the situation and the handling of the event, coupled with my health issues, which I have doctors/hospital visit notes to prove; how can I get out of my contract. 

I'm a poor student at the moment and cannot afford these troubles, I can't stay in a house that makes me unwell but I have to work to pay for my contract/survive. 

Ontop of this I have contacted the council who do seem very concerned and have told me that the house next door had a rat infestation around 2014 which was poorly dealt with.

If anyone could give me advice that would be amazing, I would rather my money (what small amount I have aha) went to getting me out of this contract in legal fees rather than going to this neglectful landlord and purplebricks who I have realised are awful scumbags.

Many thanks, if there's any information that could potentially help a case that I might have missed please also suggest, I've barely scratched the surface of the ins and outs of this ordeal but my fingers hurt and I think you get the point!"

Here’s the general gist:
-Is NCI as terrible as people say?
-Which college will have me earning 200k for my internship with no work?
-Is learning Java the first level of Dante’s Inferno?
-How do I learn to code?
-Do I need a degree to get a job as a software engineer? 

-No it’s probably not, it’s actually got good connections
-None, I hope. You’ve got more notions than sense. I pray, otherwise I’m being vastly underpaid.
-Plenty of people like java. Decide for yourself.
-Google it. There’s umpteen resources online. Most are fine.
-No, your projects can speak for you. And that can be enough. But people with Degrees also have projects and a demonstrated ability to meet deadlines and some form of work ethic.


Can one of the mods maybe consider making a weekly megathread where people can ask these questions and people can answer rather than having them clog up the whole subreddit? 

Maybe something like: 
[Weekly Thread] College Clash: Ask your college course questions here
[Weekly Thread] Salary Smackdown: Ask your salary questions here! 

But hey, what do I know: I went to an IT

My bf and I are 2nd-year college students, he, in particular, is in an Engineering major. Mad smart, accepted the offer to be a TA for 3 classes next semester and got invited back to a federal research facility for the summer. (You get it)

We have been dating for a few months and my gosh, I'm falling in love with him. I feel so lucky to be alive when I'm with him.

He just got a call from his second-choice facility campus out in California. They had invited him to come and stay throughout the spring semester and do research.

I know this is huge, and I am doing my best to be that supportive gf. At the same time, being on a track-paced major, I try to have him keep in mind of school, he is almost done with his pre-requisites, and his great opportunities already awaiting.

I am proud of him, his story with his late-start at college,  receiving these magnificent opportunities. But at the same time, the little selfish part of me is not wanting him to go until the summer. I'm afraid of the relationship ending. Whereas the summer, we will both be busy with our internships.

I really want to be the supportive gf, but that little voice is crying out."
e58elu,2,2019-12-02,Does the school where I get my computer science degree from matter after having 5+ years of work experience?,Jetsquid1700,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e58elu/does_the_school_where_i_get_my_computer_science/,"Hello friends! I am a current high school student thinking about going into computer science in college and I have a   
couple of questions for those with experience to help me out a little if willing. To start with, I am a pretty driven student in several areas, with a passion for problem-solving, learning languages (Spanish and more), science, and math. I have been putting lots of thoughts into what I want to do with my future, and, after switching between Spanish, Engineering, Mathematics, and more, I have come to the conclusion that computer science may be the major that I am looking due to the languages involved and the connection to mathematics. Currently, I am planning on majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics and Spanish.

My problem coming off of this is deciding which school is best to go to. I live in South Dakota and am heavily interested in South Dakota State University because of its campus and everything and I would also have the opportunity to graduate debt free if I live in South Dakota for 5 years post-graduation. SDSU's computer science program is ranked among the top 20%, so it is not bad to go to. 

On the other hand, Dakota State University (Best school in South Dakota for computer science and ranked in the top 5% of schools for computer science) has offered me scholarships as well and I would probably be able to graduate debt-free from there as well, but I probably would not enjoy the school nearly as well compared to South Dakota State University.

I know that people go to college for an education and not much else, but I believe that SDSU would give me a great opportunity to grow and branch out as a person compared to South Dakota State University, so my main question based off of this is would I be putting myself at a major disadvantage for my future if I do not attend the best computer science school avaliable to me after 5 years of work experience? At either college I would plan on getting an internship and probably working on side projects.

Sorry for the severe wordiness and useless information, but any life advice would be appreciated with this, thank you!"
e58j0g,1,2019-12-02,Should I take this 15-20 hour unpaid internship in the last year of my degree?,ThrowRApixie,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e58j0g/should_i_take_this_1520_hour_unpaid_internship_in/,"I'm a 21 year old female student in the UK.  
I'm in my third year of my art degree and its getting quite intense and work heavy, i'm also working on my dissertation which is a bit wank and stress too tbh but im keeping on top of everything.  
One of my main anxieties in life is that i have an embarrassingly barren CV. I have worked at a few festival bars as bar recruitment and I did a bit of admin for a family business in my early teens for pocket money (but i've made that bit sound a lot more professional on my CV haha). I have genuinely tried and tried to get a part time job throughout my time in uni but it either hasnt worked well with my intense uni studio hours or they haven't hired me due to my lack of experience. I'm currently managing off my student loan and I'm lucky enough to have help from my parents if I really need it but I've always been worried about leaving uni with a piece of paper that says im good at drawing but no proper job experience and really struggling to be hired anywhere.  


Recently I found an ad for a local art therapist looking for two students to help her with part time admin. I jumped at the opportunity because I genuinely was interested in a potential art therapy career and It would be a great foot in the door in terms of getting a good job reference. In my mind this would be a small very part time job (maybe somewhere between 6 and 10 hours a week) that would get me a little bit of money and help me towards a career in between my time finishing my degree. She even specified that the hours were ""extremely flexible and accommodating for students"". it seemed perfect.  
I have since exchanged emails with her and I have come to learn that it is not only unpaid but also between 15 and 20 hours. She describes the job as managing her social media, attending meetings with her, general admin, helping her organise therapy classes etc. She also said it was a ""very busy"" job. Whilst its unpaid she told me there would be a small daily allowance for lunch, that i have access to her studio and her ""personal one on one life coaching""..

I'm unsure what to do. I have organised to meet with her for an informal interview on Thursday but it all feels a bit funny. I've always not really been there for unpaid internships because it always felt a little bit like taking advantage of desperate young people for free labour. I'm also not sure how much I feel about getting paid in what essentially sounds like a sandwich and access some spiritual chats especially when its potentially 20 hours a week. If those 20 hours are spread over say 4 days I'm not sure when I'd find time for uni? Am I crazy for thinking 20 hours of unpaid work seems kind of ridiculous? I think I'd be more okay if it was a couple of hours a week but it almost feels like it'd be nearing a full time unpaid job haha.  
My boyfriend was almost angered by this woman trying to ""get cheap labour from desperate students"" and told me I shouldnt let her take advantage of me but on the other hand it seems like something I'd regret not having on my CV when I'm struggling to find a job in a few months? And Art therapy was already something I wanted to do like it just seems so ideal?  And i don't know this woman. She might not be the evil capitalist my boyfriend is painting her as lol.  
She said It ""might"" potentially lead to a paid position which would be great but I'm skeptical over whether that was a little white lie to make the position look a little more attractive haha.   


I just don't want spending my time doing this unpaid work to fuck up my most important year of my degree when Its already so work heavy. The hours might be flexible but the time I'm not at uni, I should still be doing out of uni work like my dissertation and maybe even having a social life :/ ..  But then, am I just being a picky little bitch when a great offer could be staring me in the face. I guess I won't know till I go to the interview and ask some questions but at this point i'm rly unsure.

TL:DRI have a very barren CV. I'm in my last year of uni. Should I take a 15-20 hour unpaid internship with an art therapist whilst trying to finish my degree or is my boyfriend right when he says it isn't worth it and it could effect my degree"

Just wondering how much of it is a confidence issue or if I am indeed missing a major area of necessary skills.

I graduated from an electrical engineering undergrad with a solid amount of computer/software engineering foundation. I've done 5 internships, mostly in the power industry, but the jobs themselves were entirely or focused heavily in software, doing in-house application development with VBA. I developed automation tools and application suites for process improvement, so I feel pretty confident coding in the workplace, and grew to love software as a career. I thus decided to take on a masters in computer engineering with a software focus, but due to personal reasons had to withdraw and move back home. In the meantime, I've been doing a lot of personal training, taking Java courses on Udemy and doing code practice on Leetcode, etc. 

I'm now looking for full-time employment as a software developer, but looking at several job postings, I feel that with just Java/C++ (and working HTML/CSS) knowledge, I don't feel confident applying to 80% of the jobs out on the market. It seems that most focus heavily on full-stack/Javascript, but I don't know if I have the time to get into that and create a good enough portfolio of projects.

Things were going great, I was loving the job but 6 months in and I’m already experiencing burnout. I’m not sure if this is normal for full time working folks. My boss is very demanding in that he gives me a LOT to do within unrealistic time frames. This is something I actually love, because I feel fulfilled rising to the challenge and trying to be the best that I can. I also prefer this way more than staring at a clock all day.

BUT my boss is expecting me to complete these tasks outside of working hours and I am usually not leaving the office until 7:00/7:30pm every night. On top of that I am getting home just to do more work. The last two weeks I’ve worked 60 hr work weeks and have worked almost full time from home on weekends. Also I’m salaried, so of course no overtime. I’ve also had to work from home on my paid vacation days. 

This is not the lifestyle I want, as even though I’m passionate about the job and my career, I’m desperate for more of a work life balance. Question is: is this normal?

I have worked at a few festival bars as bar recruitment and I did a bit of admin for a family business in my early teens for pocket money (but i've made that bit sound a lot more professional on my CV haha). I have genuinely tried and tried to get a part time job throughout my time in uni but it either hasnt worked well with my intense uni studio hours or they haven't hired me due to my lack of experience. I'm currently managing off my student loan and I'm lucky enough to have help from my parents if I really need it but I've always been worried about leaving uni with a piece of paper that says im good at drawing but no proper job experience and really struggling to be hired anywhere.  
Recently I found an ad for a local art therapist looking for two students to help her with part time admin. I jumped at the opportunity because I genuinely was interested in a potential art therapy career and It would be a great foot in the door in terms of getting a good job reference.  
 In my mind this would be a small very part time job (maybe somewhere between 6 and 10 hours a week) that would get me a little bit of money and help me towards a career in between my time finishing my degree. She even specified that the hours were ""extremely flexible and accommodating for students"". it seemed perfect.   
I have since exchanged emails with her and I have come to learn that it is not only unpaid but also between 15 and 20 hours. She describes the job as managing her social media, attending meetings with her, general admin, helping her organise therapy classes etc. She also said it was a ""very busy"" job. Whilst its unpaid she told me there would be a small daily allowance for lunch, that i have access to her studio and her ""personal one on one life coaching""..

I'm unsure what to do. I have organised to meet with her for an informal interview on Thursday but it all feels a bit funny. I've always not really been there for unpaid internships because it always felt a little bit like taking advantage of desperate young people for free labour. I'm also not sure how much I feel about getting paid in what essentially sounds like a sandwich and access some spiritual chats especially when its potentially 20 hours a week. If those 20 hours are spread over 4 days I'm not sure when I'd find time for uni? Am I crazy for thinking 20 hours of unpaid work seems kind of ridiculous? I think I'd be more okay if it was a couple of hours a week but it almost feels like it'd be nearing a full time unpaid job haha.   
My boyfriend was almost angered by this woman trying to ""get cheap labour from desperate students"" and told me I shouldnt let her take advantage of me but on the other hand it seems like something I'd regret not having on my CV when I'm struggling to find a job in a few months? And Art therapy was already something I wanted to do like it just seems so ideal? And i don't know this woman. She might not be the evil capitalist my boyfriend is painting her.  
She said It ""might"" potentially lead to a paid position which would be great but I'm skeptical over whether that was a little white lie to make the position look a little more attractive haha. I just don't want spending my time doing this unpaid work to mess up my most important year of my degree when Its already so work heavy. The hours might be flexible but the time I'm not at uni, I should still be doing out of uni work like my dissertation and maybe even having a social life :/ .. But then, am I just being picky when a great offer could be staring me in the face. I guess I won't know till I go to the interview and ask some questions but at this point i'm rly unsure.

TL:DRI have a very barren CV. I'm in my last year of uni. Should I take a 15-20 hour unpaid internship with an art therapist whilst trying to finish my degree or is my boyfriend right when he says it isn't worth it and it could effect my degree"

I was prepared for all the questions and according to the interviewer, I gave great responses. I was getting very hopeful... Only to find out that they decided to move forward with other candidates.

Getting rejected wasn't what got to me, it was that I didn't even make it into the on-site interview stage. It was like the company was telling me I wasn't worth their time.

I worked really hard this year and I felt like I made a lot of progress and became a competitive candidate but this just crushed my confidence. I'm not even sure what to take away from this or what I should do next. For the first time in a long time I'm honestly lost and disheartened.

Been lurking on this subreddit for quite some time and always found some quite helpful information and great content that helps me get a better grasp of the devops practices and principles.  


However today I'm here enquiring for help, I'm currently working at the IT department of a big company offshored in a north african country. Our job consists in mostly maintaining and managing their IT infrastructure which basically consists of provisionning virtual machines, removing old servers, freeing disk space in machines, and also dealing with incidents (which I haven't started doing yet) Most of this is window btw although I get to work occasionnally on Centos7... I've been able to do some very minor bash scripting on the side after I insisted heavily and looking to try out ansible soon in work context.  


I've been at this company since april 2019 (I spent 6 months doing an internship) I'm freshly graduated.  


I try to study devops on my own, by following some courses on linkedin learning and thinking of getting some udemy courses as well during the little free time that I get (if I'm not making music).  


My goal is to transition to devops engineer as I don't want to be stuck in a role such as the one I'm currently in because I can not see any evolution in the future, what would be the best course of action in your opinion guys ? Am I being too hasty ? should I just hang in there for some time before thinking of transitionning ?  


Thanks for reading.

in my country, you do 2 years of pre engineering, in which we study math,physics,chemistry etc. Next there is a national exam and according to rank you get to choose an engineering school based on the specialty you want. I went to the National School Of Computer Science (i had very good rank).

In the years of pre engineering, i was infatuated, smart, i was solving problems and always thinking. Then when i went to compuer science the whole education system was, it was interesting but badly managed, this led to me (and most of us), being more lazy, not having time to work on ourselves. In this third year and final i learned a lot from networking, linux, graphs, compilers, OOP to web, cloud and IA. However we know a lot, but don't have the firm basics in none of them and i don't master one in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, i feel i know a lot, i don't master anything, and i don't have the basics in anything. Java for example yes i know the concepts of OOP but i haven't worked a lot with it, so i struggle in interviews in basic questions, yet i know if i'm gonna work an internship for a java project, i will be able to make something good.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next 6 months, i'm gonna have an end of studies internship, (Angular, and spring boot) and i really think, is it okay that i'm not good at anything, should i go back, learn the basics of the important concepts, when i learn Angular or spring boot, i usually see a tutorial, then start working and each time i get stuck i seek google, is this the normal way of doing things? Or should i read books, learn the documentation play with it before starting to work on a projects.

&amp;#x200B;

From now on, i want to get back the feeling of curiosity and solving problems and i have to be smart to go wild on a career, can you give me an advice on how to proceed and what to do.

I decided to switch majors to math because I felt it would bring better job opportunities. During my time at my 4 year I was alone , doing drugs and my mind was occupied with all this sex I was having. I wasn't as passionate for math as I was for writing. So I just scraped on by, playing video games, smoking weed and having sex. No internships,  no real experience and nothing. Just looming in between depression and addiction. 

And now I've come full circle , back to my hometown after over a decade and feel destroyed. I destroyed myself socially ,  emotionally and now financially. Maybe I'm catastrophizing. 
I can't even go see my therapist of over 10 years bc I'm filled with shamed and worried of she's gonna be like 'I told you so'. 

I guess I want to know what you guys think of my game plan for my life. Get a low tier shit job for the next 2 years , pay off my debts and prepare myself for grad school. Then in 2 years find a job near my college and try to get into grad school through the back door. I plan on going for data analytics and talked to the grad program director and she said she would vouch for me provided I good grades. 

I realize now that I always found something to be depressed about in all of my life. In cc it was that I was in cc. At 4 year was just so many things. I feel like I got raped by life."

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marcia Atwood is the Superintendent of the Diocese of Avon Valley (DAV), a network of private, independent, co-ed, college preparatory schools in the Avon Valley Region. The Avon Valley Region is composed of 4 small cities: Avon, St. George, Loudon, and Kennison. DAV is composed of 4 high schools (Avon Academy, Winthrop School, Dale Prep, and Ruthwood School), 2 middle schools, and 18 elementary schools. While the elementary and middle schools are cashflow positive with steady enrollments and satisfied families, the same cannot be said for the high schools.

DAV has been grappling with a worsening financial outlook for the past decade; as enrollments in the high schools declined, deficits grew, families became increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of the education students receive (considering the price of tuition), and student outcomes were becoming less impressive, just to name a few issues. After an intense period of public debate, faculty input, and deliberation by the DAV board, it has been decided that DAV cannot afford to keep all four schools open. Dr. Atwood and her deputy, Arnold Lathrop, must now select one school to close at the end of the 2020-2021 school year. Each school has a unique financial picture, as well as a host of pros and cons:

Avon Academy—Located in Avon, the largest of the 4 cities. Enrollment is 55 students in grades 9-12 with only 9 faculty members. The Diocese has invested over $1 million into the school over the past decade because they would like to keep a school in the namesake city. But enrollment has continued to dwindle. Despite this, the low student/teacher ratio has allowed the students to excel, boasting the highest standardized test scores in the Diocese (and some of the highest in the state), 100% graduation rate, with all graduates completing degrees at top 50 colleges and universities. Currently owes $1 million due to previous mismanagement, building costs, etc. Tuition is $10,000/year. Most families pay full tuition and are very satisfied with the school. Faculty members make $55,000 per year.

Winthrop School—Located in St. George, the second largest city and the poorest part of the region. The school endured four years under a principal who was tremendously unpopular and left mid-year after being accused of embezzling money. But, to his credit, he was able to maintain the steadiest enrollment of the four schools at 450 students in grades 6-12. He achieved this, in part, by offering scholarships to most families. Tuition is $8,000 but only 50 families pay full tuition. Another major draw for enrollment has been the school’s excellent sports teams who boast a state football championship, two softball championships, and several finals appearances for boys’ and girls’ basketballs all in the last five years. Under the new principal, 7 of the 28 teachers quit in the last year due to dissatisfaction with his leadership. The school is seen as a big behavior problem and almost no middle school students remain there for high school; families are not very satisfied with the school. The deficit is $500k and teachers only make $38,000 per year, despite bringing in the second highest test scores in the Diocese, which are in the 90th percentile in the state. They graduate 98% of students but few go on to complete a higher degree.

Dale Prep—Located in Loudon, the third largest city and a predominantly working and middle-class area. Under former principal Arnold Lathrop’s five-year leadership, the school’s enrollment fell from 700 to 250 students. Dale is also a 6-12 school, but many middle school students transfer to a different school for high school. To help curb the deficits, he fired ten teachers before leaving for the Diocesan office, cutting the staff from 28 teachers to 18. Deficit growth has slowed in recent years, but the school still owes $750k. Tuition is $6,500/year and about half of the students are on some form of scholarship, either through financial aid or gifts from the strong alumni base. The school has a variety of career training programs and internships ranging from STEM fields to skilled labor. Teachers make $45,000 per year. Dale has maintained 85% graduation rate for a decade and sends students to a mix of elite and mediocre colleges, but not all finish their degrees. They earn the lowest test scores in the Diocese, but the scores are just barely below the state averages.

Ruthwood School—Located in Kennison, the smallest of the 4 cities and furthest from Avon, which is the urban hub. Kennison is the most affluent city in the Avon Valley Region. Enrollment is 150 students in grades 9-12 with 24 faculty members. Tuition is $15,000/year and all families pay full tuition. Most families are satisfied with the quality of education. Ruthwood boasts a robust fine arts and music program and has a 90% graduation rate. Students attend a variety of colleges and universities and usually finish. Currently owes $100k and enrollment has fallen from 200 students just five years ago. Faculty makes $60,000 per year but their satisfaction is low, and there is often high turnover. Ruthwood consistently brings in the third highest scores in the Diocese and are generally average with the rest of the state.

Using all this information and the skills we’ve covered in class this semester, write a memo (no more than 1000 words, typed, Times New Roman, size 12, double spaced) explaining which school should be closed and why. Essays will be graded against the course’s standard rubric. You have 90 minutes to complete this part of the exam.

I have the opportunity to join a better company (with the possibility of better opportunity for career growth) with a decent increase in salary in an area where cost of living is relatively lower.

The only downside to the new position would be it is a year long internship. So I won’t have the benefits I have at the current position which I am fine with.

The internship is a year long internship with 90% of the interns being hired internally at the end of the year per a friend who works there.

So here rises my question, would it be advisable to leave a permanent position for an internship that looks better in a lot of aspects?"

Studied engineering with Interest and passion and scored good grades, better than average.

Got preplacement offer from TCS Tata Consultancy Services, but didn't joined it. Joined startup instead in different state, than my home-state, city Bangalore, India, working there on Python for Backend, practicing Data structures and algorithms and ran marathons as extra.

Then he said, these things are not-special, ""convince me more"",

I asked him, he said do something different than others and stand out, like make any side project ""which can really SOLVE problem,"" do Stackoverflow, get more reputation there, don't do only basic projects just  by following tutorials.

Also, tell me about your leadership moments, achievements, etc...

I asked him his LinkedIn-handle, but he liked me and gave phone number, within minutes I forwarded him my portfolio website, which I created for showing to recruiters......

I was very intimidated by this school and decided to not apply since I thought my work was not good enough. Now, looking back, I was an idiot and should have applied there in the first place, I would have been accepted and had been able to do my schooling there. 

For context, I go to an art college and took a year off after my first year due to my poor mental health, since returning (ive done 3 semesters since), I've been feeling extremely depressed again, and I think that a huge portion of it is because I'm unsatisfied with my experience at my current school. I've lost friends since I returned (for no good reason), and since my school is so small, it's extremely cliquey with a minimal social scene, and no real opportunities to get out and take a break from my studies. I'm a commuter (since it is very expensive to dorm) with a very long commute from out-of-state. I find that after class I am too tired to do anything, even when it comes down to getting my work done. I'm losing my motivation to continue and its been impacting my grades. I do know that my depression won't disappear by me being accepted to this other school, but being able to dorm while having a range of opportunities offered by a larger school may help me in the long run. I did dorm at my current school once and it was my best semester, academically, but even then, I felt that I wasn't doing enough with myself. 

I'm staying at my current college for the next semester, and hope to apply and get accepted to the other school for their upcoming fall semester. I am going to intern and take classes over the summer to fill in credits and keep my grades up. Unfortunately, due to my shit time management during my first semester, I have an extra semester at this school, which is leaving me to graduate a year later than I should. My current school is also very expensive, and the other is cheaper. 

tl;dr: I want to transfer schools, but I feel that since I'm already in my third year it may be too late. My current school is more expensive than the one I'd like to transfer to. I am severely depressed and unsatisfied with my experience at my school so far."

I have read the [web developer road map](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) earlier this year as well and from what I gathered, I am missing quite a few like React, Vue, etc.

Please guide me on what courses to get because I am unsure what lessons will help me. Also, in regards to MOOC, I find the lack of voice and video doesn't help. I remembered trying to learn via FCC 3 years back and did a few of the projects, it's kinda long-winded and the lack of voice doesn't hold me down (which is my fault by the way). Have yet to re-visit FCC since quite a lot has changed too, they even included a lot of YouTube videos.

P.S. - The night classes that I had only teaches how to do 1 web application which is to create a platform for job seekers and calling out databases and such, which to be perfectly honest, made me even confused as it was rushed. They even promised to get an interview for internship which I would not count on it either so on that front, I am going to be all alone learning and finding my own job interviews for internship this coming 2020. 

N.B. - I am from S.E.A. and won't expose which academy I am learning from."

I am an undergraduate student in cs in one of the 15 best courses in Brazil. So far, I had the opportunity to work as a Teaching Assistant for 1.5yrs, had a 1yr internship as SWE intern, and a 4m internship also as SWE intern.

The past year I’ve been applying to internships in the US and EU, but most of them were ignored or rejected before even giving me the opportunity to take a coding challenge (the fact that I need a visa sponsorship is the only reason I can think of) :-(

I will graduate at the end of the next semester (June/20) and I am thinking if its still worth it applying to companies in the US/EU since I still dont have a work permit. I’ve worked hard to get a good GPA and participate in a lot of internships, but that doesn’t seem to matter. 

Any comments on what should I do? I really want to work outside Brazil."

As a result, I'm considering transferring/applying to the nearby Madison Area Technical College to get an associates in a CS degree, and from there hopefully get either an internship, a job, or an opportunity to transfer back to UW and finish a bachelor's.

I'm confused about which program to apply for, however. I'm not sure how employers see associate's degrees in IT, much less how they'd see the specific differences in curriculums and titles of the various IT programs. Here are just a few:

[Front End Developer](https://madisoncollege.edu/program/front-end-developer)

[Web Software Developer](https://madisoncollege.edu/program/web-software-developer)

The rest can be found [here](https://madisoncollege.edu/careers-programs-classes), with relevant degrees having the suffix 'IT'. 

It seems to me that both of the programs I linked seem decently challenging, and would provide an alternate and cheaper way to learn coding fundamentals from the ground up. I've read good things about MATC in terms of job placement and networking with the faculty, but I'm curious about the more general ramifications of these two year programs. The class names don't mean much to me right now because I still have yet to learn much programming/theory, but I'm hoping this subreddit could appraise it how they might transfer to a four year university or to the work world."

I am currently a sophomore in Computer Science at my University, and for a few months I have been working on Machine learning research with one of the Professors, and I will begin getting paid at the beginning of this coming up Winter term. From the sounds of it, I can expect to be in this role for the remainder of my undergrad, and my Professor has committed to helping me get the skills and experience I would need to do meaningful work with Machine learning once I complete my degree. 

The reason I am making this post is that as an insurance, I also want to make sure I am equally focusing on developing skills as a software engineer in parallel because I know that finding a role as a ML engineer might be difficult without a graduate degree, and I don't want to be so specialized in ML that I close job opportunities after undergrad due to lack of having developed a SWE portfolio and the skill set that comes with that.

With that said, what are some challenging but doable projects for an undergrad that I might be able to use skills that I am picking up in machine learning, and augment that with some very practical SWE skills? While my classmates will most likely be getting their experience during internships with local tech companies, I will be getting mine in a academic setting, learning ML workflow. Is this something I should be concerned about?"

I am about to finish my degree from WGU and will (hopefully) be attending Kansas State University in the fall to start a M.S. in data analytics.

I have been looking for ways to get as much hands on experience, and training as I can - experience is kind of tough right now because I am in the middle of a cross country move, still trying to work full time, and finish my B.S. 

I  was recently made aware of a ""Boot Camp"" that is offered by the University of Kansas. They have coding, data analytics, and cybersecurity paths. They are 24 weeks, part time and claim to give ALL the training in the world, plus a slew of other career assistance benefits. It got my attention. Did some research, and it looks like it is a pretty in depth program. 

I talked with a admissions rep, and she really made it sound like it was the BEST way for to transition to the IT field. She said the admission is competitive, but that ""I would be a good fit"". After a few minutes on the phone, I started to almost feel like it was a sales pitch. I understand they need to ""sell"" this program to an extent, but at the same time, if it is as great as they made it seem, they wouldn't need to sell it at all - especially if admissions is so competitive. The cost of the program is almost $11k

I really think this would be a good program to get in to. KU is a very good school, and this would be perfect for me while I am in between my bachelors and masters (I am also hoping to find an internship over the summer too). I like the thought of this, but I am slightly concerned. I almost felt like I was talking with an admissions councilor from ITT Tech or something.

Does anybody have any experience with these IT Boot Camps or specifically the one at KU? Do they really offer what they say they do, and are the career placement opportunities as good as they claim? Or does anyone have better or different advice?

Thanks"

Up until this point, my school has provided me with a Macbook Air. I have been coding for a while, and over the past year have become interested in machine learning and computer vision. Through some internships and ""participating"" in research at a small university, I have experienced all the limitations of Mac's single-core (sigh) computing power. The thing is that I will have to purchase my own computer for university, and being that I am going into compsci and would like to continue my previous projects, I might need something a little more powerful. I do not, however, want to buy the latest expensive laptop with a GPU and all that.

So my question is:

Would having my own less powerful laptop and then SSHing into an Nvidia Jetson to run all my heavy-duty code/projects be a viable solution? Do you think having this kind of work setup might pose a hassle or is outright uncomparable to a better computer?

Or maybe the Jetson TX2? whatever might be better for my needs."

Generally speaking, if I'm able to answer any leetcode medium and some hards, would this be all I need to get through my technical interviews? I like the structure of doing a ton of leetcode problems as opposed to figuring out what I don't know through other means, especially since winter break would be the only time I have to practice for summer internships before classes pick up again.

And as these semesters go by, I can't help but notice how many better programmers there are. And I can't help but feel so behind when I see/hear about what they did/do. 

For example: One of the required classes I am currently taking is about object orientated programming with C++. We are all assigned a final project that where we implement a library system. Feeling generally confident with myself I start building a base class called library and derived classes for the three categories required. I build the functions required, test them, yada yada, you know just following the assignment syllabus requirements and I finish. However something that bothered me was how I created three separate vectors to hold objects of the three different categories. I thought that it would be better to somehow have 1 but I could not figure out how. Feeling somewhat defeated by this, I decided to just turn it it, since it did fulfill all the requirements (as far as I could tell). 

The next day, I see a coworker ( I intern at my schools IT department) who also took the class. I asked if he also had three vectors, but he said he only had one. A little confused and upset, I asked how. And from what I was able to understand, it included using class templates, virtual functions, and having the vector be composed of pointers to the base class (I think?? He explained it a little too fast). Throughout all this I just felt absolutely stupid, since most of these methods he talked about I learned in class, I just had no idea how to implement them in this project or had a strong understanding of them in the first place. 

I want to use these opportunities of comparison to learn how to be a better programmer but I seem to focus more on how his/her methods work better."

I started school the next week continuing the course load I had planned (before my mom died) including Honors Precalculus, AP Chemistry, AP Psychology, and AP World History.

Through therapy and antidepressants my depression has gotten a lot better.

• ""Enthralled"" or any variant of ""enthrall."" I've seen this in every essay this season. It always fails to impress.  

• ""I'm fascinated by ________ University's interdisciplinary approach..."" **STOP. STOP RIGHT THERE.** *Every* western university's approach to education is interdisciplinary: if there's one that doesn't have an equivalent to, say, Columbia's Core Curriculum that provides a grounding in philosophy, mathematics, literature, and the the other sound-like-an-academic-at-a-cocktail-party (don't worry, it wears off after a year or two) disciplines that make up a liberal education, then I've yet to see it and, if one exists, it's likely unaccredited and will grant you a very expensive diploma that is too thick to serve as toilet paper, but too thin to use as a doormat. There are better ways to express the sentiment (and the sentiment, whether or not you're willing to admit it, is base flattery), especially if you're an engineering or STEM applicant. A sentence or two talking about how the classics (think: The Odyssey) have always informed exploration is much better than ""_______'s interdisciplinary approach will help give me a solid foundation in education as I pursue my goal of eventually earning a PhD in Laser-Assisted-Robotic-Processing.""  

• Listing classes to pad the word count, e.g., ""I'm interested in taking classes such as LARP 241 Laser Assisted Robotic Processing, which will help me understand the laser-assisting robotic process and ERTH 116 Environmental Concerns and Policy-Making in the 21st Century which will help me understand environmental concerns and policy-making..."" While it's good to be specific, listing classes (*do not* use the class codes: outside of the registrar's office, they are meaningless) and then rewording the class description isn't going to make your essay any stronger. I've seen essays that list 4-5 classes and the first thing I do is whittle them down to two.  

• I [keep saying this](https://blog.blue-prynt.com/index.php/2018/09/16/uncommon-knowledge-on-writing-the-common-app-essay/), but this is the time to talk about yourself. Don't waste your time praising the faculty advisor from your internship or the author of the book that inspired you: talk about the effect those people or things had on you.  

• ""Perfect fit."" Banish these words from your essays. The phrase is the application essay equivalent of ""soulmate:"" quaint idea, but ultimately meaningless. ""Perfect fit"" is usually backed by hackneyed gibberish about how _______ University's ""intriguing interdisciplinary approach to education"" makes it the only school you could possibly succeed in. There's an exception to this: hyper-specialized fields or schools with particularly strong departments. That aside, it's psychologically unhealthy to fixate on a particular school when so much of admissions is a numbers game.   

• ""Impactful."" Please. Just. Stop.  

Other tips:  

• Some schools – UChicago comes to mind – have no specified word limit for their supplemental essays. Aim for 400 - 650 words. 

• Try not to sound insane in Stanford's ""Dear Future Roommate"" letter. 

• Yale – and a couple others – have two-part questions in some of their short answer prompts, e.g. ""What do you hope to add to your suitemates' experience? What do you hope they will add to yours?"" **Answer both.** 

• If you write a 1st person/present-tense narrative that positions you as already attending the school, avoid the following pitfalls:

-- Talking about food. Nobody cares that you had a ""steamy, piping hot soy latté and a chewy, delectable vegan breakfast wrap"" (this is an example, I don't quote clients), let alone that you know the top tourist places for cheesesteaks in Philadelphia (UPenn applicants, you are warned). 

-- Romanticizing the city/campus. This is always an issue with the NYU and Columbia applications I see. You're not going to be picnicking in Washington Square Park (unless you're trying to cop heroin) and Columbia's not a particularly beautiful campus. It's better to talk about the things you'll do there; how you'll make the most of your time (no, The Met doesn't count). Figure it out. 

That's it for now. I've got to get back to work."

Before this, I was pretty much set on becoming a software developer, even have an internship for next summer lined up. 

But, now that I'm enjoying this so much, I was wondering if a career in computational physics, i.e more on the fluids side of things would be a good idea. Maybe stuff like optimizing c++ code that goes into CFD software etc. 

If I were to go down this route, should I major in a more computer science-y engineering, or a more aerospace / mech engineering?"

I was planning on taking a semester off to do another internship and I was also planning on studying abroad next year. If I do both of these, then I won’t be able to fit in a double major. I definitely want to study abroad, so I have to decide between double majoring or another internship. For the record, I will have already done 3 internships by senior year even if I don’t take a semester off.

With that said, I've had 2 - 3 technical/personal meetings with 3 different companies.   Each of these, I realized after the second or third that the job post said a ""**BS in CS, SE, or equivalent required.**"" without the ""**... or equivalent related experience**"" after the fact like I've seen pretty much every other time.   What made me look was how heavily I was hit with questions regarding the time I had remaining in schooling during the last meeting with each of these three companies.

Two of the three stated the degree was a requirement and I can only assume that would explain why I was ghosted by both.  The third, whom I'm still waiting to hear back about my counter-offer to them, came back at me with an offer for an intern role, reviewed quarterly, until either they deemed fit for me to transition full-time or I got my degree. 

I always believed that if you had the soft skills, could demonstrate your knowledge both verbally and technically, and had the years of professional experience that would suffice just as much as a fresh grad.  

Is this more common than I thought?  Is this a sector-specific requirement?  Is this just certain companies make this a requirement some years back and the hiring manager has no say otherwise?

I would like to know how you managed to get around this, if you had any tips or suggestions, are you seeing this too with certain companies and what's your experiences?"

I’ve been asked if I want to go through the interview process with my current company. I like working there and it’s probably the best option in the area, but it’s not my ideal situation.

I am finishing my Cyber Security degree in December. I have a concentration in information systems. 

It is getting to the time to really crack down about finding a job and I just had a few worries. I was told and under the impression that it would be beneficial for me to start in the help desk circuit. This personally does not seem like a route I would like right out of school. 

I recently had an internship where I gained a great amount of experience reporting directly to the information security director and sometimes the CTO or CISO. 

Do you think it would make sense to hunt strictly for junior cyber analyst / junior infosec analyst jobs? Or should I take the other advice and sought after a help desk job?

Thanks everyone for any input!"

Investigation into Missing Persons Case 3102015-14

Missing Person: Cole Jackson, Cleveland, OH. Reported missing 3-03-2015. Missing Persons Case opened 3-10-2015

#Summary:

Case went unsolved due to no evidence, and has remained untouched for just over three years when it was officially closed. New evidence was found recently that has led to the case being re-opened, and will be entered into this report.

---

#Evidence:

**3102015-14-A:** Hard drive recovered during a raid in Case 9012019-3. Once the drive was accessed there were a series of video files showing what might have been the final days of Cole Jackson, and two others who are also the subject of Missing Persons Cases.

Lydia Poole: Subject of Missing Persons Case 3072015-8. Known friend of Cole Jackson, cases were never officially linked due to lack of evidence.

John Beck: Subject of Missing Persons Case 3122015-17. Known friend of Cole Jackson, cases were never officially linked due to lack of evidence.

Hard drive contained various graphics assets for a show they appeared to be making together called “Ghost Bros”. There were also a series of raw video recordings, and 10 finished episodes.

There was a fourth person credited as the editor, Alexandra Ellis, who was the subject of the raid in Case 9012019-3. She was questioned, but only confirms that after they dropped the drive off with her she never heard from them again.

#Transcript:

The following will be a written transcript of the episodes as they are processed.

**3102015-14-A-02: Ghost Bros Episode 9**

Episode opens with a shot of Lydia Poole in her room. Timestamp in the corner dates the shot a week before the events of episode 1.

&gt;Lydia Poole: Cole asked me to make a quick video introducing myself. My name is Lydia Poole, friends call me Di. I met Cole and Beck in daycare, and we grew up all going to the same schools. After high school, Cole and Beck started working and my family started to have… troubles. Dad got sick, and mom was working two jobs to keep the lights on so she was never home. I ended up basically becoming his care taker. It was… 

Lydia starts rubbing her left elbow and looks down.

&gt;Lydia: They were hard times.

She looks back up with a smile.

&gt;Lydia: I have a fiancé, Kevin. We met when he showed up to start doing in-home care for my dad once my mom got new insurance. Turns out it was his first job and we bonded pretty quick. The next five years were just, caring for dad and being with Kev every chance I could get. Cole and Beck would check in time to time, do what they could. But they were struggling to get their lives started also.

She closes her eyes and exhales.

&gt;Lydia: In the past nine years I’ve seen Cole and Beck maybe a dozen times. We keep in touch on the phone, but… About two years ago Kevin was in a car wreck, a pretty bad one. One night I was on my way home from the hospital and got attacked in the parking garage. The man had his hand on my throat and was trying to…

She looks off into the distance for a moment, then locks eyes on the camera.

&gt;Lydia: Turns out Beck was following me back to my car. I’d told him I would be fine, to get home to his kids. He just said *aight then* like he always does, but there he was. Making sure I was safe. Like he always had. He was on the guy in an instant. Pretty sure that piece of shit ended up in the hospital longer than Kev did. But, you know. Fuck him, right?

She rolls her eyes and sighs.

&gt;Lydia: Turns out that dickhead had a rich lawyer daddy and tried to sue me and Beck. Cole, coincidentally, was just completing an internship at that asshole’s rival law firm. He went to his boss and explained the situation. I don’t know if they just really liked Cole or if they just hated Douchebag and Associates, but they took our case pro-bono and crushed them. I got a settlement that paid for all my dad’s care going forward and Beck was able to pay off his house. Really get his family settled.

She straitens up in her chair and clears her throat.

&gt;Lydia: Cole and Beck always had my and each other’s backs. Always. That stuff is hard to talk about, but I need you to understand that when Cole asked me to go on a tour of spooky ghost sites it wasn’t a question of trying to make time, or figuring out if I was going to be too scared. I’d follow Cole and Beck into Hell if that’s where this tour was going. There’s no one on Earth that I feel safer around.

She giggles.

&gt;Lydia: I mean, excluding Kevin, *obviously*.

&gt;Kevin Spears: &lt;in background&gt; That *right*.

Footage cuts to a short intro sequence and picks up in Cole’s room, filming from a web cam.

&gt;Cole Jackson: Okay, so. We’re still three days out from meeting up with Drew, our editor’s psychic friend, and Di is having some problems. It’s spilling over and effecting Kev and her folks, so I’m going to head over there and stay with them until we get this sorted.

Footage cuts to Cole approaching Lydia Pool’s house, filming with a head mounted camera.

&gt;John Beck: You really recording this, man?

&gt;Cole: Beck?

&gt;John: I thought the show was over.

&gt;Cole: This is all related, I just thought….

&gt;John: Man, I *get* it, but you gotta make sure Di is alright with it.

&gt;Cole: She actually recommended it. Said the worst stuff was happening off camera anyway.

&gt;John: Jesus. Man, this really got fucked up, huh?

&gt;Cole: Yeah… So you staying the night?

&gt;John: Yeah. The kids are at their mom’s house tonight anyway, and Steph agreed to keep them until Friday. So I’m gonna stick around.

&gt;Cole: No arguments here.

The front door swings open and Lydia runs out and hugs them both.

&gt;Lydia: Oh my god it’s so good to see you guys!

&gt;Cole: You too, Di.

&gt;John: Yeah.

&gt;Cole: So what’s been going on?

&gt;Lydia: Just, all kinds of stuff. There’s the water noises, I’m hearing drums all the time. I’ve been pulled out of bed, Kev has started hearing noises, my dad’s health turned south, mom is having nightmares, the dogs…

John pulls Lydia into a hug.

&gt;John: It’s alright, girl. We’re here. Whatever happens, we got you.

Lydia holds John for a moment, then pushes away.

&gt;Lydia: I thought we could setup everything throughout the house. Maybe use it as a kind of, I don’t know, alarm system? A way to keep track of everything?

&gt;Cole: I’ll start getting everything moved in. Kev around?

&gt;Lydia: Yeah, he should be headed out in a sec to help unpack.

&gt;John: Come on, let’s go check on your folks.

Footage cuts to a quick montage of Cole and Kevin moving through the house setting everything up. Footage picks back up in a guest room.

&gt;Cole: Okay, we’ve setup a kind of base station in the first floor guest room. We’ve got cameras in every room.

&gt;Kevin: Except the bathrooms.

&gt;Cole: Except the master bathroom and the main guest bath downstairs.

&gt;Kevin: What? I thought…

Cole shrugs.

&gt;Cole: We’ve had stuff happen in bathrooms. 

&gt;Kevin: So which…

&gt;Cole: It’s super obvious. I used the big cameras, put them right on top of the toilets. No one should accidently drop trou in front of one of them.

&gt;Kevin: Trou?

&gt;Cole: Like… trousers.

They look at each other confused for a moment, then footage cuts Lydia talking with her parents, Jason and Abigail Poole.

&gt;Abigale Poole: So you’re recording us for your show?

&gt;Lydia: Kind of. We’re doing it because stuff has been happening in the house, and this kind of thing seems to be worse if you aren’t recording it.

&gt;Jason Poole: There’s nothing &lt;coughs&gt; going on in this house, Lydia. All your ghost &lt;coughs&gt; your ghost talk is giving your mom nightmares and Kevin has an overactive imagination. I want this &lt;coughs&gt; this stuff out of my house!

&gt;Lydia: Dad, it’s not...

&gt;John: Sir, I know how it sounds. When Cole asked us to go to a bunch of haunted sights I thought…

&gt;Jason: First of all, no one asked you. Second, Cole has always, *always* done nothing but get you and my daughter into trouble.

&gt;Lydia: Dad…

&gt;Jason: At least get this junk out of my room!

&gt;Lydia: Fine…

Footage cuts to John in his room. Timestamp in the corner dates the footage a week before the first episode.

&gt;John: Hey, what’s up? My name is John Beck, or just Beck. Cole asked me to come with him on a ghost tour, so naturally I was like *hell yeah*. And then he said he was gonna record it for a show he’s making and asked me to record a quick introduction so here it is.

John straightens up in his chair.

&gt;John: I’m a twenty seven year old father of two. Four year old boy and three year old girl. Got a real pretty ex-wife named Stephanie, and a good job working for the state. Being a government employee means I got loads of sick time, so this vacay was a no-brainer. Especially since he said Di is coming. One assumes she’s making one of these too.

He leans into the camera.

&gt;John: Since high school we’ve kind of drifted apart, but we were basically inseparable growing up. It’s gonna be nice running with that crew again.

He looks away thoughtfully for a moment.

&gt;John: I know I’m supposed to talk about myself, but I’m pretty boring. Di and Cole will brand me as the quote un-quote *heroic type*, and it’s true I’ll throw down in an *instant* if either of them is getting harassed. But let’s talk about Cole for a second. Cole is probably fifty pounds lighter and a half a foot shorter than me. But he would absolutely demolish me in a fight.

John chuckles.

&gt;John: I remember this one time I beat a guy’s ass for feeling up Di in the hallway. High school shit, right? Anyway, he caught me after class with five of his friends. I popped him in the mouth, but his buddies swarmed me quick and started kicking the shit out of me. Next thing I know Cole is just annihilating them. He flew in out of *nowhere* and just started throwing hands. He doesn’t have size or strength, but he fights like a fucking demon, and I don’t think the boy feels pain. Those assholes scuttled away quick after he lumped them up some, and he just helped me up like nothing happened.

He crosses his arms and leans back.

&gt;John: That’s happened a few times. I get into some dumb ass fight I can’t win, and Cole shows up and just fucking goes crazy. It was always nice knowing he was in my corner. Then one day I caught this guy messing with Di near the hospital and basically crippled him. As fucked up as I left him, he’s lucky Cole wasn’t there, ‘cause he’d be dead as fuck. We wound up in court later and I saw Cole put eyes on him for the first time. That look was the scariest shit I’d ever seen, still is.

He looks away, then back to the camera.

&gt;John: Since that day I’ve known what’s in him, what he’s capable of. But as long as we’ve known each other I’ve never felt anything but love from him. That dude is my brother, and growing apart as we figured out this adult shit has been… 

He clasps his hands in front of his mouth, then drops them and smiles.

&gt;John: I’m glad he called. When this trip is over we’re gonna hang out more. All three of us.

Footage cuts to grainy footage of the outside of the house. A large man is approaching, and stops just outside.

&gt;Unknown man: One, two, three…

Footage cuts to a shot of Lydia’s bedroom. She’s asleep in bed with Kevin as a dripping noise starts up. Drops start to fall on Di’s side of the blanket, starting around her waist and moving up towards her face. One hits her forehead waking her and she starts to gasp as she looks up towards the ceiling. She’s cut off as a glob of liquid walls from out of frame near the ceiling into her mouth. She starts making quiet choking noises, but Kevin doesn’t wake. It looks as if she’s trying to reach for her face, but something is holding her arms down. She’s panicking, looking left and right, apparently unable to tilt her head. Water can be seen pouring out of her mouth and nose. Her eyes start to roll back into her head as her body relaxes, then the door explodes open.

&gt;Cole: Di! Kev, wake up!

Cole leaps across the bed as Kevin sits up confused.

&gt;Kevin: Cole?

Cole tries to pick her up, but it looks like he can’t move her. He looks up and sees something just above the frame. He locks eyes on it and stands up.

&gt;Cole: Let her go. Now.

Lydia starts thrashing and coughing, throwing up what looks like water and gasping for air. Cole leans back down and starts patting her back.

&gt;Cole: You’re alright, you’re gonna be okay.

&gt;Kevin: What the fuck is going on?

&gt;Cole: Feed from your room set off a motion alarm. Checked it and saw Di having some trouble.

&gt;Kevin: Is she okay?

&gt;Cole: Yeah, she’ll be alright. But we probably need to start sleeping in shifts.

Footage cuts to Cole and Lydia sitting in the makeshift control center in the guest bedroom.

&gt;Cole: So that’s the water lady, huh?

&gt;Lydia: Yep.

&gt;Cole: Bleaugh.

&gt;Lydia: Cole, how the fuck did you scare away a *ghost*?

&gt;Cole: I don’t know. I was just acting on instinct, tell you the truth.

&gt;Lydia: Must have had that look in your eye.

&gt;Cole: What look?

&gt;Lydia: You know, the…

One of the monitors starts beeping.

&gt;Cole: That’s John’s room. Let’s see… Whoa. What the…

Footage cuts to John’s room. The woman in white is standing over his bed. She gently reaches out and caresses his face, then dissolves into mist. The mist settles over the bed and she rematerializes lying down next to him. Footage cuts back to Cole and Lydia.

&gt;Lydia: So do we…

Gentle moaning starts coming from the monitor.

&gt;Cole: Hmm…

The moaning increases in intensity.

&gt;Lydia: Should we… be watching this?

&gt;Cole: Probably not, but we should make sure she doesn’t…

&gt;John: &lt;from the monitor&gt; Whoa, what the fuck!? Get the...! Oh… what are… Oh… Oh…

&gt;Cole: See? He’s awake. He’s probably…

Rhythmic creaking noises start building up from the monitor.

&gt;Lydia: I’m going back to bed.

&gt;Cole: Yeah…

There is a loud crashing noise from the front of the house.

&gt;Cole: What the fuck?

&gt;John: &lt;from the monitor&gt; What the fuck?

Footage cuts to a camera pointed at the front door. A large man with an axe is entering the home.

&gt;Unknown man: …five, six. One, two, three…

Footage cuts back to Cole.

&gt;Cole: Get back to Kevin, get him and barricade yourselves in your parent’s room.

&gt;Lydia: What’s going…

&gt;Cole: It’s the axe man, from Detroit.

&gt;Lydia: What’s he doing here?

&gt;Cole: Me, John, you and Kev, your parents. There’s six of us here.

Lydia’s face goes pale and she runs out of the room.

Footage cuts to the hallway outside of John’s door. The door flies open and he storms out.

&gt;John: Now who the fuck is out here making all that… Oh shit.

The large man enters the shot walking quickly towards John.

&gt;Unknown man: One…

He raises his axe, then gets tackled from behind by Cole.

&gt;Cole: John, get to the parent’s room and try to find a way to get everyone UMPH.

The large man elbows Cole in the face sending him crashing into the wall. The man looks back up to John.

&gt;Unknown man: One…

Cole jumps on the man’s back and hooks an arm under his chin.

&gt;Cole: Go!

John starts to run by the man, but get’s punched so hard he smashes through the closest door into the downstairs bathroom. The man reaches back over his shoulder and grabs Cole by the hair, then turns and flings him just out of frame under the camera. He walks up and raises his axe.

&gt;Unknown man: &lt;frustrated&gt; ONE!

He brings the axe down, but it stops just out of frame. He looks like he’s struggling, then starts to be pushed back. Lydia enters the frame holding the axe by the blade. A small trickle of blood is running down her arm.

&gt;Lydia: His path is not complete.

The unknown man seems to struggle with the axe as Lydia continues to push him back.

&gt;Lydia: He will not rest until he takes the final steps.

&gt;Unknown man: Six… seven... No… Too many.

The man rips the axe out of Lydia’s hand and shoves her to the side, then walks past her and out of the shot towards Cole.

&gt;Unknown man: One, two, three, four, five, six… Seven… Seven…

Footage cuts to the camera facing the front door and shows him leave the property. It cuts back to the hallway where Lydia has collapsed and Cole is holding her.

&gt;Cole: Di… Di!? You okay? Hey!

Footage cuts to the car. John is filming from the back, Lydia is in the front passenger seat, and Cole is driving.

&gt;John: So, we all saw the footage.

&gt;Cole: Yeah…

&gt;John: So what the fuck did she mean, the path isn’t complete?

&gt;Cole: I didn’t think it would matter. I figured we’d get with the psychic, get it sorted, and quit.

&gt;John: So we have another stop to make?

&gt;Cole: Yeah.

&gt;John: So what is it this time?

&gt;Cole: It’s just a normal haunted house, in town. Spooky noises. Nothing spectacular, I promise. The house doesn’t even have a history. Just some weird sightings that sparked up recently.

&gt;Lydia: That doesn’t sound too bad.

&gt;John: It *never* sounds *too* bad. But we just got run out of Di’s house by like fifteen ghosts, so I’m wondering when the other shoe drops.

&gt;Cole: I’m sorry, guys. I didn’t mean for…

&gt;Lydia: We know you wouldn’t put us in harm’s way on purpose. 

&gt;John: Yeah, man. That’s whatever. We just gotta know if this is it. I don’t want to get through with the psychic and find out there’s more shit you haven’t told us about waiting to fuck us.

&gt;Cole: No, that’s it. That’s the last thing I’d scheduled. Drew is gonna meet us there, we’ll get it sorted, and we’ll be done.

&gt;John: Alright then. One last stop.

&gt;Cole: One last stop.

Footage cuts to a quick credits sequence, and picks back up outside of Lydia’s house with the grainy camera.

&gt;Unknown Female voice from behind camera: The rest of them, they’re…

&gt;Unknown Male voice from off camera, doesn’t sound like the large man from earlier footage: Yes, we’re done with them. They will come to no further harm.

&gt;Unknown female: Thank you.

&gt;Unknown male: Don’t thank me yet.

A fucking useless degree, and I absolutely hate it here.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever i voiced concerns, i would either be told to shut the fuck up because ""I'm so lucky to be in uni"" (Which is dumb, i am NOT lucky to be pissing away my money in a field i hate) but I feel overwhelming pressure to finish this useless fucking degree.  


I hate how I look, and the one passion I had in life, fitness, has been ripped away from me from this FUCKING university program. ALL my time goes towards classes I ultimately don't give a shit about, I hate my reflection in the mirror now. I hate my day-to-day life. I hate my campus, and I am slowly growing to resent my own family. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am convinced, at the age of 25, I am a loser for my age. No woman around my age-bracket wants anything to do with me, and i have virtually no friends. 

I am not bitter about my lack of success socially - but I am hell bent on killing myself now. I tried counselling, twice, and both times i got dismissed as ""putting too much pressure on myself, everyone goes through this"". Doesn't do me any good when I go through this in isolation, knowing there are other miserable people like me out there. Like, ok, thanks?

&amp;#x200B;

I am stuck in a rut. I want to kill myself, but there is like that 1-2% of me that wants to hold out for hope. I reach out to randoms on discord and try to make friends, but I honestly feel like my time here is quickly running out. Each semester takes more out of me, I feel it grinding down my soul. 

What do I do man? Dropping out or more time off isn't a choice. I just took 8 months off for an internship - and that is what made me realize just how much i hated my field. This is my semester back, and I am more suicidal than ever. I have an exam today, and all  I can think about is driving my car at 100mph into a wall.

What do i do man"

Growing up, I was never into tech - didn't play video games, tinker around with computers, and so on (I know these are very stereotypical notions of computing but one can't deny that these activities help develop an aptitude/inclination for it). I got into CS because of Math and Cognitive Science, both of which I really love. I wouldn't say Math comes very easy to me; in fact, I have to put in a lot of effort but I do end up enjoying and understanding it. Same goes with CS theory. However, when it comes to practical projects, I'm a complete mess. I can usually code something from scratch but I get confused when using high-level libraries and scaling up my projects. For instance, I'm taking a class on deep learning, and I can work through the math problem sets with ease but now that we're implementing a complete project,  I find myself struggling a lot. I know that practice should make me better but I don't  think I'm seeing any significant improvements in my programming / software development skills even though I've been  programming for  5+ years, and have been doing projects / internships as well. I'm just painfully slow, check every damn line of code, and still run into errors that take me HOURS to decode. I know that as I keep doing more and more, I will get better but seems like the learning curve is too steep for me. And to add to that, I feel like a complete misfit in CS-related classes -- everyone seems to know SO much more. Again, I know exposure is key but it'll take me years to catch up with them and I just feel helpless at this point.

(Just to clarify, I'm not a CS major; I'm Math and Cogs but honestly, it might as well be CS for all intents and purposes)"

What is known within some university communities that many people don't know is how screwed up the Improbable's compensation and hiring system is.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me paint you a picture - most of the grads and interns are from a very few universities in the UK (Imperial, Cambridge, Oxford) so they compete with companies like Google and Facebook for talent.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year a typical intern in Improbable was compensated at a rate of £60,000/year, but suddenly the graduate offers have dropped to £45,000/year - including those of returning interns. That means your graduate offer at Improbable is £15,000/year less than it has been during your internship. It's also rumoured that getting promoted within the company is also a pain in the ass and you shouldn't expect much in compensation.

Improbable might look like a shiny startup, but at this point it looks more like a dysfunctional company with organisational issues. Just wanted to warn any potential applicants."

I was born and live in Eastern Europe. I'm interested in a career in finance (specifically investment banking). 

Although I wish I could study in another country (in USA or Western Europe), I will probably have no other choice but to get my bachelor in my home country. This is because it would be hard for my parents to pay for my rent for 3 years in a country with a high cost of living. However, they said they would be willing to pay for my master degree.

My problem is, the best university of economic studies in my country is ranked around \~800 globally. I know in finance your alma mater usually matters, and I also think it would be much harder for me to get an internship during University in Investment Banking in another country. I live in Romania, and I don't know how developed this field is here.

I could also study Computer Science at the ""oldest and most prestigious engineering school"" in my country (where I could probably learn the mathematics skills needed for finance). I like Computer Science, but I wouldn't be very interested in a career in this field.

Could I study Computer Science and land a job in Investment Banking or some internships in this field during my undergraduate studies?

Thanks for reading this far. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I noticed many companies use the exact same automated process and I have some questions about the latter steps:

**1, Apply for job, attach CV/cover letter**

**2, Add important details (education, name address, contact details etc)**

So far all makes sense, but then:

**3, Add your work history and responsibilities.** This is on every CV, why is it being asked here?

\-Will my application potentially be rejected at this step before even looking at my cv? By whom/what (automated, HR, recruiter)?

\-Are there some kind of automatic checkboxes /conditions I have to have to be considered?

\-I copy my job responsibilities for this section from my CV, in the same order (my most important role first, a 9 month software dev internship in 2018, then my most recent 2019 role as a tour guide).  Will the recruiter see them in the same order I do (last role added appears at the top), assuming I don't tick the 'this is my most recent role' checkbox on anything to maintain my desired order of jobs?

\-Any advice? Is my approach here correct? Am I overthinking this? Many thanks!"

I am considering a transfer but I just can't make the decision yet and want some advice. I'll list the pros and cons

Current School Pros:
-2 weekly D&amp;D groups
-really good Engineering program, like one of the best in the state
-made some good friends in the past couple months who I'd be reluctant to never see again

Current School Cons:
-I am required to take a J-term class and only have four breaks which are about a week long
-$60,000+ estimated debt after graduation
-Can't play with my home D&amp;D group in person, we only find time to play online about once a month, I am a lot closer to these guys than my college groups
-far from my old friend who I am very close to
-far from my previous job which had opportunities for engineering internships which I could take up if I was closer to home
-the school is a religious school and I am not religious, I don't want to party hard or anything but the atmosphere is kinda oppressive and I often feel like I don't fit in because of that

I feel unhappy here and could move to one of a number of colleges closer to where I live that offer my major, but none as good as this one. Please weigh in."

She's verbally and physically abusive to her, toxically manipulative, and possibly worse... if you can even get worse. Since finishing her degree she's been living at poverty level or less and is now facing the prospect of moving back in with her mother just to survive, which worries the fuck out of me. I don't know what her mother's going to be like when she has to be around her full time. My gf can't even move to the states because she can barely afford food for the week due to lack of job opportunities so she has a nice big degree that she can't do a damn thing with. I can't financially help on just an E-3 paycheck, nor have I been dating her long enough to want to make such a big monetary commitment like that.

I have two internship offers and I will detail specifics below. 

Company A:
- Long commute (30-40 min)
- $17/hr 
- Year long internship (January-December/graduation)
- HR analytics/Employment Branding role

Company B:
- Extremely short commute (~5 min)
- $18/hr
- Summer ONLY 
- Product Management role (more interesting to me) 

Both companies are pretty large and offer great opportunities. A has more security and longevity, but B has slightly higher pay and a more interesting and exciting role. Also worth mentioning, if I accept B I currently have no job/internship planned for January-Summer.

This is my first Reddit post after years of learning so sorry if my formatting is awful.

I have been in college for a very long time. (5 years) This is due to my parents starting me in Dual Credit classes in highschool. I got my associates degree at my local community college when I turned 18 and then stayed another year to get my hard math and science classes done. I am now 20 and a ""Junior"" in college I have all my classes done except for my core classes for my major. I've done all my science, math, history English, government etc... and I'm left with all computer and technology classes 

I had a hard time transferring and getting accepted to University because I had too many class credits. Even though my GPA was / 3.6 most universities didnt want someone with tons of credits. My SO is in a similar situation. But we finally found a school and decided to go together.

The university I'm in is mostly criminal justice majors and the school puts all of their resources into them. While my major (computer science) has the worst buildings teachers and resources. 

I had an unfortunate situation both semesters this year of dumb advisors registering me for classes I didn't need and bureaucracy bull shit and I didn't get to take any classes that helped me get closer to finishing my degree.

I took a forced break this semester because my school had dropped me from all my classes due to a computer error. And I couldn't register for any more on my degree plan because they were all full. But fortunately I found a IT internship instead.

So I decided to apply to other schools.
I applied to several top universities for computer science just to see if I could go anywhere else besides this hell of a school. To my surprise I got into one. As soon as I got the letter I was shocked and so happy.

But the longer I thought about this the less sure I was about going. I have bad anxiety and I would have to leave my friends and my SO of 6 years. I would have to live in the middle of one of the major US cities all by myself. I know this school would be amazing for me but I'm not sure if I can go through with it.

I recently graduated from a top undergrad business program in Canada this past year and have been looking for a job in finance for the past couple months. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything yet and I am getting a bit frustrated, so just wanted a bit of advice on what to do next.

Since graduating, I have been networking decently hard and have been getting some interviews as well. I interviewed at three boutique IB shops in Canada and made it to the final round for two, but couldn't land them. I also have been applying/networking for other roles as well, such as corporate finance, fp&amp;a, business development, etc.

While I'm sure that my interview performance has been sub-par, I have tried to learn from each one. I have read through the guides, read relevant posts online, and have mocked with others to get advice on how to improve my performance each time. I've also been a bit unlucky, as recently I went through two processes for business development roles at some large companies (market cap &gt; 20 billion) and made it to the final round for each. However, both times, the already scheduled interviews for the final round were cancelled prior to them happening, as the roles were ""cancelled"".

Each process so far has been taking a couple weeks to a month and now its December and I still have no job. I was wondering if it would help if I were to apply for some pre-experience masters of finance programs (LBS MFA, LSE, Cambridge MPhil Finance, Princeton Mfin, MIT Mfin, Oxford MFE, etc.). I'm sure I wouldn't get into all of these, but I have gotten my CV checked by academic counsellors at some of these programs and they have said I would be a competitive applicant.

For some background information, I have internship experiences at a boutique tech firm and in the finance department of one of Canada's largest charitable organization. My GPA is around a 3.7 ish.

Would these programs help me in my current situation? I really want to pursue a career in finance and would love any advice you guys have for me. Thank you for all the help!"

I have applied to maybe 50 positions from data analysts to software developers, and I have now been rejected from all of them.

I just received my rejection letter from Amazon after my final interview. I was rejected a month after OA from google, and I know I got the answers right, and I was rejected from Microsoft after phone interview.  I don't have any feedback from them and I don't know which area I'm lacking in.

My question is this. What should I do at this point? Should I apply to the same companies I applied to in January? Should I work on projects and build up a portfolio?  Should I go to a bootcamp even though I have the skills already?"

I am currently considering an internship offer at a defense company in southern California, but I'm a bit apprehensive. I'm prior military and I've seen the guys who go into government jobs and never leave, so I guess this is what I'm worried about. Is this a thing for cs? Right now I'm interning part-time with a small (3 full-time employees) company that also tries to get defense contracts, so going to another defense related company makes me nervous.

I also have a possible offer lined up with a more well known company in the consumer side of things, but it's not a sure thing yet.

e6fj9z,7,2019-12-05,How to deal with a difficult PhD advisor?,prc00632,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/e6fj9z/how_to_deal_with_a_difficult_phd_advisor/,"I'm doing a PhD in Europe and I'm in my fourth year. My project is supervised by my professor and a day-to-day advisor.

When I started my PhD, I was very optimistic about it and I had a great relationship with my advisor, who is quite well known in their field. Some people warned me about them, saying that often they are difficult to deal with as they lack skills in communication, and that they had strange conflicts with some scientists and students. I dismissed these warnings as my advisor was very kind to me, and taught me lots of stuff when I started. I assumed that it was the other people who were in the wrong, and perhaps misunderstandings stemmed from the cultural barrier between my advisor and others (my advisor is from outside Europe).

Then things started to slowly turn weird.

While I loved my project and working with my advisor, they started changing. They've put lots of workload on me, like asking me to prepare some materials or to join experiments and analyse data. I was excited to work on many things and learn many techniques. However they said themselves 'this is too much for a PhD student, you should not have so many projects' and yet proceeded to be upset and disappointed with me when I could not manage all the workload.

Then, they started complaining to me about other scientists and students in our group. They would make 'funny' comments, like 'this person is sick for the 10th time', 'this student was really lazy during their internship abroad and did barely any work', 'the professor and I did not reply for a long time to a post doc about their paper, and the post doc proceeded to submit the paper to a journal we did not like, how could they', 'this mini-group has not produced a publication in 5 years, they're doing a really bad job' and so on. At first I was curious to know more about what my advisor thinks of other students and scientists in our group, and it felt good because I thought that they trust me and value my opinion. But with time, I started getting uncomfortable with these comments. Even if they might have been fair, I think that my advisor should not share that sort of information with me. I always thought that I'm so lucky that they like me and that I'm doing a good job, and that they would never make such comments about me or 'ghost me' like they did with other people sometimes. Of course I was wrong.

Things started going downhill when we were writing my first paper. I was doing quite badly with the drafts, as I had no experience with manuscript writing. Eventually we produced a manuscript which was quite good, thanks to my advisor being patient with me and helpful. However, there was a fragment in a paper that claimed something opposite to our results. I did not want to put that in our manuscript, and I told my advisor that we should change that part or remove it, as it does not agree with the data we show. They basically told me that I'm being impolite/disrespectful for trying to change things (I guess this is due to his culture), and they politely told me to shut up and submit. I did, and, long story short, after an extensive referee report we got back we had to rewrite the paper and add more data to it. It exposed that the part I wanted to change was indeed wrong, and it got modified as I originally wanted, which was also strongly supported by my professor. That was also difficult, as the professor ordered me to work on the manuscript while my advisor was absent (my professor literally said: 'do not wait for them'). I was reluctant to do that but did what my professor asked of me. After my advisor came back, I approached them carefully and explained that I modified the manuscript because I had to but that I would like their feedback and I want to work with them on it. My advisor just proceeded to get furious with me, their lips were shaking and their face red, and I was terrified.

My advisor also had 3 master students that had an awful experience. All three of them were having anxiety and health problems, possibly amplified by the way my advisor was treating them, and one of them changed groups.

Now my worst problem is that I got offered a job as an instrument scientist and that I have to graduate by a certain date to be able to start my job on time. My professor and my advisor recommended me to not take the job (it's in my previous post), as they wanted me to get tenure track. Once I was offered the job, I was just given a couple of days to make up my mind. My professor and advisor were both away, and I emailed them explaining everything, and asking them if they think I could graduate by the said date, and I told them that their opinion is very important to me, and if they had time to talk. My professor replied and said congratulations and that everything will be fine and that I can accept (unless they did not read my whole email, which they are known for).

My advisor though did not reply ANYTHING. Not 'congratulations'. Not 'sorry I'm very busy now, can you stretch the deadline until we can talk'. Not 'No, I do not think you are ready to graduate'. Not 'You can do it'. Just nothing. They just ignored me. It was clear to me that my advisor was not too busy to reply to me, as I was ccd in other emails on other topics involving him, and they clearly had time to send emails. My impression is that they simply chose to ignore me. And that is strange, as they wished me good luck before the interview for this job. It feels awful, like they do not support me anymore and do not care what happens to me. I ultimately decided to take the job, because I thought, if my advisor treats me like this and ghosts me, why would I want to graduate later and spend more time in their lab. I even saw my advisor in the lab a few days ago, and they just acted as if nothing happened, and only talked about the research. I don't know what to do, and I feel awful. I know that I will have to talk to my advisor about graduation at some point. I would like to submit my thesis in 5 months. Does anyone have advice on this?"

e6gzry,1,2019-12-05,Can't get over my ex-boyfriend/best friend and I'm afraid I might never see him again.,greendalethrowaway,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/e6gzry/cant_get_over_my_exboyfriendbest_friend_and_im/,"So a little backstory, but I used to be a loser. Still kind of am, but I'm trending upward and I at least have enough self-confidence to not recognize myself as a loser anymore? Overall despite everything 2019 was the best year of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Before this year, I was never in any kind of relationship and was never too popular though I did have my tight-knit group of friends. One of my friends in college wasn't like my usual crowd--he was pretty much better than me in a lot of categories but I was never really jealous of him. If anything he inspired me in a lot of ways and I genuinely always wanted the best for him. Over the past 2 years as we got closer he became my best friend, and we'd do everything together. When I found out he was bi, I realized I actually had a crush on him (didn't know/wouldn't admit I was gay) so I asked him out and he said yes. We dated for a few months, it was great, but I had to graduate and move to NYC for my job while he had to finish school and we mutually decided to break-up (we'd be across the country).

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought about him pretty much every day. We still video-chat each other every other week or so and catch up. He was originally going to be in NYC for a 6-month internship, and I couldn't help but think that that would be the time we rekindle our relationship--at that point we'd be together long enough where we could stick it out while he wrapped up school and then make a decision on where we wanted to live while continuing our careers. I recently found out he's doing the internship in Denver, so that dream kind of went down the toilet. He might visit me for a weekend or I might visit him, but it'd be as friends. In all likelihood he'll work in SF when he graduates next year so if I wanted to date him again I'd have to move there (which would be an absurd decision to move for him when we're not even dating) or wait a few more years and see if he moves on to NYC (not unlikely as his family moved here). 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the smart advice would be to stop talking to him, no contact with your ex, move on, that kind of thing. But I feel like saying that kind of thing is easier when it's not your best friend. How many people can so easily never talk to their best friend again?

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's silly since we didn't even date that long, but we were friends for years. He made me extremely happy, and we just felt right with each other and that I was somebody I'd want to be with for a long time. I get that I'm probably just young and naïve but that doesn't make it hurt any less. Nothing went wrong between us, we just waited too long to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't really talked to him about dating again because we're not in a situation where it's possible. We're just kind of close friends again--I do think we'd date if we were in a situation that allowed it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really asking for advice. I don't really know why I'm bothering to post here anyway. I was just was hoping someone might want to talk about it I guess."

I'm in my last year of my CS degree at university and I'm feeling lost and a bit out of place. I've tried to land internships, but haven't had much success, so with my lack of experience combined with my feelings I'm at a loss of what to do and where to go 

I was thinking of taking the next semester off to read and work on projects, since I have a couple in mind.

But where my real issue lies is that I don't know if I want a career as a software engineer and/or programmer. Like I enjoy coding, but I'm not sure if I want to do it everyday.

Furthermore, there are times where I feel out of place in school, and in class amongst my peers in general. Personality and fit wise I feel I'm a bit different idk if it's just my school, or it's me in general.

I enjoy, tech and coding, but I also enjoy business, understanding business models, how companies grow, understanding how people act, why they act a certain way, and a bit of sociology. For example, I enjoy reading, but I read a lot more business and self help books. I have recently started Principles: Work and Life by Ray Dalio and the next book on my list is Meditation by Marcus Aurelius. I've taken non-Comp Sci courses and have enjoyed them generally. Also I'm an not very creative, definitely not like others who study art or who practice it.

I find that I'm basically a Jack of All Trades (but a Master of None) and because of that I'm floating in no man's land. I'm definitely not good enough to become a good software engineering or coder, and my interest lies also in business and learning how to grow and become a better person.

Sorry for writing such a long post, but does anyone have any career advice for me? Which career path should I take? Or which jobs (in tech/cs if any) should I target?

TLDR: I am in my last year of university and  I feel lost because I don't see myself as a software engineer/ coder so I don't know what career path to take. Any advice?

Additional information:

I'm not sure if Myers Briggs has any useful information, but I did the test 2 years ago. My results showed that I was an INTJ, but the counselor the first two categories were pretty distinct, while for the last two, the T and J edged the F and P by a little bit.

So I completed the research project, and was promised a full time position after their next round of funding and as a stopgap, they gave me another internship at the same rate working on and continuing the implementation of what I was working on during my research - and remotely too (given that Dublin is brutal to find housing in) - for the next 3 months and kept me on.

**The situation:**

So after all that, I got an offer recently for E27k per annum, not including expenses  in $COUNTY. Its still a ""remote"" job but I'll be checking in with the company in person roughly every fortnight.

My hunch says this is enough as a first job, but looking around online I'm definitely finding myself on the lower end of the pay scale, especially compared to the cost of living in Dublin - I am assuming my coworkers that live and work in Dublin are being paid similarly but that seems somewhat low.

The startup is expanding and has won some awards in the space it works in (not naming names - that will reveal the company I'm working for) and while I like the idea of being in on the ground floor of a good startup doing work I find interesting, I have a hunch I'm being lowballed compared to what else is posted here and on Glassdoor.

What do ye think? Is this fair for a new grad? I'm thinking stay for a year and find a better position to move to afterwards but if nothing else, I'd love to hear other people's experiences in situations like this. Has it gone well or all up in flames? More opinions and data points appreciated.

With this in mind, I’m considering the idea of going to get a master’s in game design. Not only will it let me learn a lot more about the development process, but I also want to leverage the degree for interning with a big game development studio/company, which can get my foot in the door with the industry.

e6lque,3,2019-12-05,First job salary negotiation advice,mattgk39,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/e6lque/first_job_salary_negotiation_advice/,"First off, not sure if this is the right sub for this but I figured I'd start here because this will be an EE job.  First some background on me: I went to a school (EE major) that was a 5 year program which required you to complete three 6 month long co-ops (somewhat more than an internship, mostly paid depending on major).  My most recent co-op was at the company I'm interviewing for for a full time EE position.  They are in the power electronics industry, with much of their work being custom high voltage power supplies made for customers in the oil, water, and gas industries.  I concentrated in analog and digital electronics in school.

I originally reached out to my old boss for a recommendation letter as I was looking for jobs in another part of the country, and he asked if I wanted to work at the company because they had an opening.  I said I was interested.  I first interviewed with two HR people, and I said my salary range was $80,000-$85,000 (I know I know I shouldn't have given a  number first).  The interviews went well and they said they would schedule a meeting with my old boss and reach out to me.  A week after, they still hadn't reached out so I sent a follow-up email.  The HR lady replied saying that the salary range was lower than mine ($70,000-$80,000) and asked if I was still interested in meeting with my old boss.  I replied along the lines of ""that't not too far below my range, I'm interested, I'm sure we would be able to work out a compensation package both I and the company would be happy with.

So I met with my boss to go over what I had done after my co-op, and mostly to talk about what exactly the job would entail.  One thing which was exciting but also that stuck out was that I would pretty quickly have to learn a lot of programming.  This is fine as I have experience with Matlab and Python so I'm confident I'd be able to pick up new languages quickly.  When we briefly discussed salary my boss basically said something along the lines of ""$75,000 we could probably do, $80,000 would be more difficult"".  The benefits package seems good, apparently the health insurance is great but obviously that remains to be seen.  When I was pushing for $80,000 he did say that whatever they offered they would also be able to promise me a review that could lead to a raise after some time, though I'm naturally skeptical of this because it seems like a common tactic used by employers.

So what I want is $80,000.  $85,000 is sort of the top of my expectations, $80,000 is what I would be happy with, and $75,000 would be the bare minimum I would accept (and that's really because I need to find a job soon to start paying off loans).  Furthermore my target industry is really small/micro electronics and design.  I would definitely get experience with that in this job, but much of the work would revolve around power electronics.  This job is basically a stepping stone for me so I can go on to achieve my dream job.  At many points throughout the multiple interviews they really were trying to sell me on this job, and I think that my old boss really wants me for this job.

I'm expecting an offer within a few days, but I'm guessing it's probably going to be for $75,000 and I want some advice on how to negotiate so I can get $80,000.  My main arguments would revolve around me previously working there and the fact that I would also be doing a lot of software stuff (based on the meeting with my old boss) that would probably require me to spend some of my own time learning more programming.  I am a very fast learner, dedicated, and hardworking and my old boss knows this (that's also what he wrote about me in my co-op review submitted to my school).  Although I concentrated in electronics, power electronics is a slightly different beast that I knew next to nothing about coming into my co-op.  Yet I was able to pick up the material very quickly and become a productive employee.  I also picked up LTspice very quickly for running simulations (though this was admittedly not that hard considering I had a LOT of experience with PSpice and MultiSim).

I was thinking of countering with something along the lines of ""I'm extremely excited about this offer and working at your company but I would be more comfortable with a salary of $xx,xxx.  As \[old boss's name\] knows from my co-op experience I am dedicated, hard-working, and a fast learner.  I came into my co-op knowing little about power electronics but was able to pick up the material very quickly to become a productive member of the team.  Seeing as this role will also require me to do programming work, my proven learning capabilities will enable me to become productive much more quickly in this role.  I also am very familiar with the work \[company name\] does and already have a working relationship with many of the team members there.  These things combined will allow me to hit the ground running faster and will provide a return on your investment much quicker, and I feel they warrant a salary of $xx,xxx.""

How do you guys think that sounds?  I REALLY want to frame this in a way that is NOT a de facto ultimatum, because I would probably accept $75,000, but I really feel I deserve more.  Also if they offer $75,000 and I want $80,000 should I counter offer with $80,000 or with $82,000 or $83,000?  I also don't want to counter with too much because I don't want to risk getting the offer rescinded.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  I'm wary of giving a location because I don't want the potential employer to see this but it's in the northeast.  $75k-$85k is the market range for entry level EE's here.  The glassdoor estimate for the company for EE's is $75k-$140k.  So $75k is definitely in the range, though from my research it seems to be at the low end of the range."

e6np40,3,2019-12-05,Is reneging returning intern offer for different company worth it?,JenniferLopezFoots,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e6np40/is_reneging_returning_intern_offer_for_different/,"I was fortunate to receive the following internship offers with comparable compensation:

* already accepted: Return intern offer from a Seattle shipping company (NYC) 
* Snap (NYC)
* Oscar Health (NYC)

I worked at the shipping company last summer in Seattle and really enjoyed it. I decided to initially reject the return offer in Seattle because I wanted a different experience for my last internship and opted for a different team. However, I was able to receive a return offer in NYC. I really wanted to be in NYC over the summer, so I decided to accept the offer since I felt that since the shipping company was so big that the internship experience will be very different from last summer's. However, after I had already accepted the offer, I received an internship offer from the other 2 companies in NYC.

A big goal I have for this summer is to experience new things, and I feel like going back to the same company cheats my way out of that (even though I was in a Seattle last summer). I really do want to try other companies to see if I like a different pace and working culture. I'm having a lot of difficulty deciding whether it'd be worth it, considering the possible consequences of reneging an offer from such a large company. I am not too committed to working at any of these companies for full time.

Thanks."

I've only done compsci stuff before, and it was pretty standard (do projects, go to events etc.) but im not sure what the criteron in Econ would be for your first internship since theirs no real way to show your knowledge outside already having an internship.

e6qc70,2,2019-12-05,Data Science: choosing between being paid a lot and better vibe?,ConfusedFreshling,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e6qc70/data_science_choosing_between_being_paid_a_lot/,"Hello guys,

I am in a bit of a pickle regarding my offers. First of all, I am glad to receive any as an international that requires a visa sponsorship. Having a significant job experience in Data and BI when studying + securing the highest grade in my MSc from a top uni helped me to get several offers for a Data Scientist/Analyst roles. All of the roles are aware of my status and willing to proceed immediately.

To provide context, I am based in London and the offers are too.

Right now the choice is between firms A and B.

Firm A offers significantly above the market rate. It is dealing with somehow risky side of finance and is incorporated in Asia, owned by a family in the region. My job description suggests I will eventually progress to AI/ML, and deal with predicting customers' behaviour. At early stages, it will involve a lot of data cleaning and validation, building pipelines, evaluating models etc. The main problem I have is that the industry is a bit dodgy, with practices many would say are really betting (retail investor derivative trading). Plus, I had a neighbour who worked as an analyst for a Middle Eastern family company and she did not like certain cultural aspects of it (although I do not wanna stereotype, quick Glassdoor reviews show that there are similar issues in that firm). It is one year contract.

My spidey sense is tingling on them because they offered me significantly more (like almost 20 grand more) than I was hinting at during my interview, which almost never happens. It really scratches my self-esteem, but activates ""too good to be true"" filter.

Firm B is smaller and younger, offering data vendoring and data analytics services in a very specific finance field. I would expect it to be acquired by the big fish like S&amp;P or Bloomberg in couple of years, but it looks like a good place to work at the moment, with genuinely smart people. More of a startup vibe, but no fake quirky gimmicks + Glassdoor has a few great intern reviews. They are actively expanding at the moment, and the routes to progression are clearer than in the firm A. They are also incorporated internationally, but in the States. The job is more analytical from the get go, with a lot of data validation. Doing AI or ML excercises would probably not be on the plate immediately, although there is a bigger exposure to the dev team and opportuity to brush up on my Django skills. The salary is about the market rate, and they offer a permanent role. 

My eventual career goal is closer to the stuff I would do with the firm B - data vendoring and financial data services. So I feel like a medieval princess choosing between the rich and the pretty suitors. Would anyone be able to give me a word of advice regarding these opportunities?

Sorry for being intentionally opaque. If you want more detail, feel free to DM."
e6qh2b,1604,2019-12-05,To yall about to graduate...,ptitz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/e6qh2b/to_yall_about_to_graduate/,"I graduated with a masters degree in Aerospace back in 2017. I wasn't a particularly stellar student. It took me 8 years to grind through BSc and MSc. I did not have any super impressive internship experience. The one that I did was at a tiny garage startup in Barcelona, and I went there mostly just so I can party through the summer. As I was still grinding through my master thesis I'd receive LinkedIn popups from my former classmates, like ""congratulate Bob, on his new position as a project lead!"". Obviously I was comparing myself to them, and it kinda made me feel shitty.

After graduating, I pretty much took one of the first offers that I've got. I needed the money. But the first project and the company were shit. The next project got cancelled before I even started there. The third one was still a code monkey type of gig. So was the fourth one. So how did I feel about my career - 2 countries, 3 cities, and 4 projects with 2 different contracting agencies later.

Well - what the fuck did I even go to uni for? I could have done the work that I was doing with just the knowledge that I had before I even went to school. Most of my old classmates were more successful than I was. Every time I had some downtime between projects, or just some existential crisis, I'd go on a job hunting binge. Nothing that I was offered was any better than whatever I was doing already.

Then my agency manager hooked me up with a new project. At a company, that unbeknown to them I've been spamming with job applications from before I even finished school, to no avail. Doing the kind of stuff I loved doing. I started there - it was cool. I knew I was still in a sort of a trial, but I thought I was doing OK.

Well today I got a ride home with my boss. As he was driving, he kept asking me if I like my job so far. He kept asking me this question the whole time since I started there. I thought like... well fuck, maybe I don't look enthusiastic enough? But then he went on. Like - hay ptitz, you know your technical lead is about to leave, and he speaks very highly of you. So I'll really need your help when he is gone. Expect to accept more responsibilities. It's hard to find guys like you.

I thought to myself like... shit... Finally... my career is taking off.

So just like all of you guys who never had the best grades. Or the best internships. The ones who never bothered with ""networking"" at school, or doing clubs, or whatever. To all ya immigrants with a weird accent and no family to support them. The ones who are taking too long to finish. Or finished already - and just doing some bullshit gigs to get by.

You know what - fuck it. You probably won't get the best job out of school. You probably won't progress as fast as others. But if you still, after all of that, never lost your drive for engineering.  If you really want something - and you don't just accept doing some boring shit for the rest of your careers. If you don't lose your passion - sooner or later someone will recognize it. Just keep on grinding yall! Step by step. It's a marathon. Have a nice exam session yall, and if you fail - fuck it, better luck next time!"

B.E. Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering

M.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)

Experience: 5.2 years (Firmware development, platform development and RF system design over 2 jobs before &amp; after Masters)

7 months internship (full time internship developing the validation platform for a mid-sized semiconductor company)

Current Job Title: Software Quality Engineer (Small Semiconductor company based in Austin, Texas)

**Current package:**

$93000 (Base pay)

No bonus plan &amp; stocks that are currently worthless (Company has been around for 10+ years but doesn’t want to go public)

**Job Duties:**

Write C code to test out accurate functionality of the hardware, simulator, instructions and communication protocols. Might soon do some performance analysis.

Use Bash shell and Tcl scripting in conjunction with C code. Python on rare occasions.

Analyze test failures, find and file bugs and assist in adding solutions to improve the test suite.

Assist the RTL team with some test automation.

**Complete Situation:**

I have been working at my current small sized company for the past year. On negotiating before joining, I could raise the initial salary from $90k to $92k. No signing bonus or annual bonus. Since I mentioned that I was expecting a much higher pay given my 4 years of prior experience. (2 years before masters &amp; 2 years after), they mentioned that once I spend 6 months in the company, my performance will be evaluated &amp; I’ll get a raise accordingly.

Fast-forward 7 months in &amp; the company is not doing too well. I decide to not ask for a raise until things stabilize. After a month &amp; new funding, everyone in the company got a pay hike to “match industry standard salaries”. I got a hike of $1000 &amp; was told that since I was not with the company for even a year, that’s all that I would get. A few days later, I setup a meeting with my manager &amp; expressed my appreciation for the bonus. But I also mentioned to him that I was promised a review that should lead to a hike 6 months in. I told him that I would wait until I complete a year to approach the topic again. He has always been very accommodating, understanding &amp; is a great Manager. He agreed that it was the right way to approach things.

Since we don’t have official reviews, during a casual talk with my Manager a while back, he mentioned that he got an overall good feedback (apart from me asking a lot of questions at times). I am planning on talking to him about the raise soon &amp; wanted to have a good case to bring to him.

Therefore, here I am, asking you veterans out there for some advice.

Since I joined, I have learnt Tcl &amp; Perl for various projects, expanded myself to help people from other teams when they have technical questions &amp; have generally been very flexible. Have worked with almost every team. I like the work, love working with &amp; learning from my colleagues &amp; love the flexibility of the job. However, I feel that the total compensation is highly inferior to my peers.

**Note:**

Before people say I’m acting entitled, or to do my own research on Glasdoor, Payscale, etc., you should know that I have already done the needful. Being in a smaller semiconductor company, I have compared my company with them &amp; also with the giants. Base salaries, stocks, bonuses, etc. are all dependent on the company, location, current profitability/funding &amp; your individual experience. Hence, I am on this platform, trying to get some personal feedback from you guys. Even just a single line for would be appreciated.

For my current level of experience, am I underpaid? If yes, what would you say would be a good range? (eg. 95k-100k, 100k-105k, etc.)"
e6r2xe,1,2019-12-05,American college sophomore who wants to enlist in the military. What should my path forward be?,21st-Adventurer-Man,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e6r2xe/american_college_sophomore_who_wants_to_enlist_in/,"Ever since I was young, I wanted to be an adventurer/writer, but the irony is that I'm fairly deep into a computer science degree (I'm on track to graduate May 2021, although I'm looking to pick up another major/minor). I had an internship this past summer, and it filled me with existential dread. I really dread my next internship (if I get one). I went into CS because it is a stable field and pays well, but being a code-monkey couldn't be further from what I want to do.

Since third grade, I've been regularly thinking of joining the military- it's something I've wanted to do, but it doesn't really ""fit"" into the traditional CS track of college/internships -&gt; job. Of course, I could always join the military in a technological capacity, but and then I'd be spending all day on a computer all the same, and it seems enlisting has the most ""field"" work.

So, here's my current plan: continue on through college in computer science, while at the same time getting really fit in preparation for maybe enlisting. 

I figure, if I wanted, I could graduate in May 2021 and then enlist with a CS degree (or if I wanted I could join as an officer). Again though- it seems kind of useless going through the motions of a CS degree if I won't end up using it.

I'd appreciate any advice.

edit: I've looked into the AF the most (specifically as a loadmaster, but one of the spec ops sound cool but probably out of my scope), some role in the infantry (Marines or Army), or even a mechanic in a branch (despite having no background in being a mechanic). Am I being too idealistic/romantic?"

e6rtn7,32,2019-12-05,6 figure salary as SWE. For Current and Future CS students,DallasNewGradCS,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/e6rtn7/6_figure_salary_as_swe_for_current_and_future_cs/,"Tl;dr: it's possible for you to get a 100k salary job in Dallas after graduation (equivalent to \~200k in SF). Work hard!

This post is intended to encourage current and future CS students at UTD through my anecdote.

I came to the US 4 years ago after high school to major in Business/Accounting. I never programmed or didn't even know the existence of engineers back then. I took a college assessment to know which major would be a good fit for me and it showed engineering, and hence I took CS1 class at Community College. Since then I was intrigued and fascinated by them although I didn't code outside of classes and didn't work on personal projects. Fast forward I transferred to UTD to pursue BS in CS. I was initially interested in ML and AI, and I created a very simple chatbot similar to Eliza. This is nothing compared to any NLP or ML-powered chatbot but just regular expression to match and return. I got the first internship thanks to this project, but the internship turned out it was creating a facebook chatbot using Google Dialogflow. However, through this internship, I was also exposed to full-stack development as creating a company website. The company didn't have any engineers at the moment, so I was the only engineer there knowing nothing. I became more interested in cloud and infrastructure as I was doing a deployment. I attended AWS workshop held at UTD and luckily I was selected for their internship. The internship itself was nothing fancy and I was working on a throw-away project. Although the experience itself was not that meaningful, I was more exposed to and interested in AWS so I decided to take AWS Solution Architect Certification, and passed it after the internship. I got the third internship through applying online and the experience was really meaningful working in production, the team let me take ownership and with latest tech stack. The fourth internship was through UTD intern fair.

I had 4 internships, all in the Dallas area. The first one was during summer in junior year, the second was during fall in junior year, third was summer in senior year and fourth was fall in senior year. Internship salaries were $12-&gt;$16-&gt;$28-&gt;$23 (I took lower besides third company offered me continuing internship plus full time after graduation because fourth company aligns with what I wanted to do: automation using Golang). Salary of the first and second internship was lower than average in Dallas area. But work for experience first as you are most likely not valuable at that point. At least I was not

When I applied for internships and jobs, I usually applied 100+ over the course of 2-3 months. Finding a job as international student was quite tough. If you are a US citizen or Green Card holder, you are already a step ahead. Yay! I didn't join any school organization nor hackathon. I did the fullest with classes and yielded 3.9+GPA. High GPA is not necessary but deepening knowledge comes with one. You really need to know stuff when you get a job. So try to get knowledge. Don't memorize, having deep understanding sticks you a long time. My biased opinion, the top 3 classes which helped me: Data Structure and Algorithm, Computer Network, Operating System. I can elaborate on this if necessary. let me know.

I accepted an offer, where I'll be working in Dallas. 100k+ base, 10% bonus target, 60k stock over 4 years vesting. Total compensation 125k+ per year. The job title is software engineer but not the application or product side. It's more of DevOps or automation cloud infrastructure, which is rare for fresh graduates. Other offers I received are TC 90k, 86k and others. Those top 3 offers are based in Dallas. Reference: Salary range in Dallas area with 0-1 year of experience is around 70-90k. 

I am inclined to know more and get interests through experience. I strongly recommend you to take one internship and get exposure to the real-world regardless of which the experience might be good or bad. I believe school is a supplement to your knowledge and a great place to learn a lot. However, I don't believe it's necessary, but I don't regret having one (although it's required to have a degree to get work Visa lol). It's your decision about whether college is for you. I have had teammates who dropout college, only went to bootcamp, or self-taught, and they make 100k+, too.

What I would've done differently: join student org, join hackathon, involve in career networking. If you want to get into Application/Product software engineering role in a big company like Google, Facebook, Amazon, you'll need to know data structure and algorithm really well and leadership, hackathon (and networking) are mandatory. I am not the one who can speak well about it.

Conclusions and my life lesson. The path I have had is definitely not optimized, nor such exists. You should follow what you like to do. Foundation is always important. You can't go advanced without one. You should do what you are doing as best as possible. You can't regret your future or you don't know your current decision makes your life good or bad. You are the only one who's responsible to make the decision and make your future good. Here I am not going to make a suggestion such as ""you should definitely attend a hackathon or join student org"". It's up to you. Each person has its own way to expand their knowledge.

I appreciate you reading this, and I hope this helps someone in a good way. If this post sounds I'm bragging, let me know, and I'll delete this ASAP. Ask me anything except for the name of the companies I have worked or will be working :)"

But, yesterday they sent me a reminder to do the assessment. This makes me think that they want me to do the assessment faster. Does it matter how long I take to do it as long as I do it before the due date? Or is it bad if i wait too long?"

I applied to Software Engineering Internship for Google (North America) and got a mail from Google saying that they would like to know more and I was asked to take a snapshot coding which I did. The coding test itself was very elementary and I think I did both the questions correctly (not 100% sure because there were no test cases). I haven't received any update after that at all and it's been already 3 weeks now. I tried contacting Google but no response there as well. Does this mean I have been rejected or should I still have any hope of getting a response?

I applied quite late (in November), can this be a reason and maybe they already have taken all the interns?

P.S I used my referral from Google Summer of Code so I really want to at least get to the interview stage :("

I used to struggle to find my first job, and now I'm a full stack intermediate developer at an unicorn. I've always found posts about people's success stories very helpful.

I think my career trajectory is interesting and probably more normal than most of the success stories you see here. I wasn't one of the few that got into a FANG right away as an intern/new grad. In fact, I struggled immensely.

\- graduated in a STEM, non-CS degree for my bachelor's, then I did a CS master's, but I still couldn't find a job

\- started my CS career at $36k as an intern after I graduated

\- got another internship at a big &amp; promising local company making $50k. Company had financial trouble so I couldn't get a return offer

\- got a job at a no name company for 70k full time - laid off in 1 month because I was ""too junior""

\- then I worked at a F500, and my current company

If you're a junior dev, new grad, or a student, I'd like to help answer questions you may have related to this field."

Currently studying for the CCNA but I really figured I would have something concrete by this time to work off but I can't even get a Helpdesk Job.

Since I am not getting any jobs, perhaps I'm not maximizing my chances of job listings? 

I am currently using the following job boards: Indeed / Dice / Monster / LinkedIn

with the search term of Technical Support / Desktop Support / Helpdesk Support.

Is there other terms I should be using to search for jobs? Even for internships? Should I be applying for jobs that ask for 5+ years of experience when I have none? What about 3? 1? Also, I know that obviously I wouldn't be qualified for a Level 3 IT support so how does a Level 2 differ from a Level 1 which I guess I would have to start out as."

Am I crazy?,cssssstudent,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e6wizq/leaving_tech_for_medicine_am_i_crazy/,"Im a third year computer science student. I have internship experience and a strong gpa and I’m fairly confident that with a little interview prep I could get a job at FAANG or similar company after I graduate. I initially got into cs for the ROI and wlb, but also because I like problem solving and mathematics. After a couple internships I’m not sure this is the industry for me. I am generally not too excited about new technology and do not find a lot of purpose in working to create it, especially at a large company where I contribute so little to the end product. It also struck me that even if I earn enough money to retire at 35, I am still going to want to work on something.

I feel like I would find more meaning in a career in medicine, where I would be working with clients to improve their lives directly. I also like that it isnt tied to HCOL as I don’t plan on living in a city my whole life. 

Financial independence is very important to me and I know from a strictly economic standpoint this decision would not pay off after paying for medical school and the opportunity cost of ~10 years working in tech. However, if I continue to work for a few decades after those 10 years, it seems like it would make more sense to choose a career where I would find more fulfillment. I have also considered entrepreneurship. I know it is involves a lot more uncertainty but can result in a high income and meaningful work. 

Does anybody have experience leaving tech for a career they found more purposeful? Am I crazy to  leave the position I’m in? I see posts all the time from people wishing they went into tech. All advice is appreciated"

I begin this tale now with the full knowledge that I may not be able to finish it. I have hidden myself in a church, for I feel that it cannot enter here, but even as I think this, I can hear it: skittering over stone surfaces, tapping on the walls, tap tap tap. And as I hear these clicks which send shivers through my very marrow, I know I am not long for this world. I shall be brief, then, but where to begin? With my name? That is of no importance. Everyone has a name, most of them the same, all of them meaning nothing. Let me instead say what I was: a renowned professor of folklore and mythology at the renowned Skalborough institute. It was in my very nature to examine the odd, the weird, the unnatural for the purpose of cutting it down to its simplest, most meaningless form: a fact.

 These facts I would soak in conjecture and publish to some acclaim in the academic press. Therefore, when word crossed my desk that the Slavic Studies department secured a grant to create a study abroad program in the Carpathian Mountains, I was quite excited to visit. The Carpathians had always fascinated me ever since, as a young girl, I first unearthed the tale of Count Dracula by Bram Stoker. And though I had done research across all variety of nations and lands, from the East-Asian rice patties to the hills of Kentucky, never once had I strayed into those mythic mountains. I knew nothing of their folk tales, their myths, their local history. All this, then, I would deconstruct like a boy who pins butterflies. The thought excited me to no end.

The trip began pleasantly enough. We were sixteen in number then, though I shudder to think of it now. Since I am hardly a gregarious person, I knew but a few of their names, and yet despite this, their faces shall haunt me for eternity. All of us procured seats upon a plane bound for Budapest, and from there to the village of Escrow. The others were loud and jubilant, but I ignored them altogether. I cared not for them, only for the place itself, with its odd, diverse people and alien traditions. The hours passed idly by on that flight. If I’d known then what I know now, I would have cast myself in some manner from the aircraft the moment we were high enough to ensure my death.

But as it were, the flight was without incident, and we soon took an uncomfortably banal bus trip to the small, backwoods hamlet of Escrow. A lonely place, a desolate place, a land in which bleak despair had fused itself so inexorably with the landscape that one could not bear to look at the settings without feeling the bite of its grim maw. It was a city of inns, farms, and not much else. Some businesses had been in families for generations. Perhaps longer. One got the feeling that this place hadn’t seen significantly change since the great mastodons and mammoths had frequented these bitter pines. The people gave us sallow-eyed waxen looks, as if they were animate corpses: the look of any person who has lived long in both extreme poverty and extreme fear.

The town bordered a dense mountain forest, and yet as we drove by on the flat, dusty road, I saw no evidence of logging or lumber camps. Throughout our first week in the town, we heard no one speak of the gargantuan taiga, nor saw anyone venture into the dense, shadowy sprawl. When one of the faculty inquired as to why this was the case, the villager she interviewed became strangely animated, threatening physical violence in his choppy, staccato tongue, should she dare speak of these woods. All staff members were henceforth discouraged from mentioning the place. But my interest now was piqued. The fervor with which this man had accosted my colleague was the type brought on only by some sort of ancestral fear: by a lie being born of truth, and then being repeated so oft that the two became indistinguishable. With this then, I resolved I would discover for myself the reason for the ancestral apprehension with which the townsfolk viewed the wood.

The Sabbatical meandered on. The land deal was cemented, and an area only 40 minutes from Budapest was purchased for the University. My fellow faculty became accustomed to the natives’ way of life, their foreign tongue, their tasteless food. But I was far from satisfied. For despite my discerning eye for detail, the forest and the fear of it remained as opaque to me as the day I first arrived. I did not share the fascination of my academic brethren for seeing these native people about their work. Their culture did not mystify nor entice me. I find that all people are generally the same, much as all horses are generally the same. The distinctions are evident only to one who sees a single tree in the forest. Very similar, very bland, very… uninteresting. I sought something more, something preternatural. I sought knowledge that would reshape my narrow field. I found it, of course, to my undying regret. If I knew to what extent these horrors would warp the meager mind that sought to know them, I would never have left my den.

One night, I heard some local storytellers surrounding a campfire, their lined and weathered faces wracked with urgency as they relayed their stories to the wide-eyed youngsters. I spoke the native dialect, but poorly, so I found a professor of world languages and beseeched him to translate for me. He did so quietly from afar, as not to disturb the natural flow of the speaker’s tale. And what a tale it was.

He spoke of a group of ancients who peopled these hills long before even their forefathers had even dreamed of fire. Strange folk, who worshipped equally strange deities. One of these deities, whom my colleague described as ‘Fleshmelder,’ was the most powerful of them. To appease this surreal titan, the savage people sacrificed living children like firewood to feed its desire for bloodlust. No accurate description of the thing could be given, for it was said to be flesh but not flesh of Earth.

Then, the Mongols rode in. Even the greatest sorcerers and warriors of the savage mountain gods were slaughtered in battle, and the hungry horde proceeded to sack the town. The Mongols hung the last high priest of Fleshmelder from the arbors of the forest with his own guts. While he hung, the priest levied a horrific curse on them: this savage beast, who was more than a beast, would come for them all to avenge the priest’s wrongful death. This did not deter the savages from their sport, and they hung the old man as they would any other.

However, the next morning, twenty Mongols were found dead with their twenty steeds in a pile of bloody viscera and stinking flesh. The rest of the horde feared it was native retribution, but found no men alive capable of doing this deed. They ran off into the forest to oust whatever thing had done this. The only ones who returned were mad.

So this was the reason that no man would venture into the tranquil trees. Fleshmelder. Hah. But even as I scoffed, my curiosity was more inflamed than ever. What was described here by this old man was a battle, a conflict completely lost to the annals of history. Most myths and legends, I have found, are based at least partially in truth: the crimes and murders of old twisted into the fantasies of the new. What if I, a humble professor of old stories, were to uncover a great historical conflict and present it to the world? I would be a colossus of both legend and history, the great Rhodian academic who would unite two diametrically opposed fields in one great discovery. Publishing just one book would provide me with enough money to live comfortably off for a decade.

But first, I must prove there was some truth to this myth. That it was more than just a tired twist of the tongue meant to force children to clean their rooms. I tried to find someone in the town with a car who would be willing to take me out into the forest, but I came up empty handed. 

Even when I offered them triple the price of any reasonable fare, I got nothing. So, as any apt explorer must, I took matters into my own hands. Late one night, when I was sure no one would bother me or impede my progress, I stole out down one of the poorly kept forest trails into the inky blackness of the pine-barrens. It seems perhaps an unreasonable gamble but not to me. Not then. Some sort of mania had taken possession of my senses, and I knew then, in the atrophied part of my brain not well suited for logic, that I must find this place.  The cool night temperature was still just above freezing, and wolves could be heard howling throughout the misty mountain timbers.  I clutched the .38 caliber revolver I had purchased some weeks back when the baying beasts had grown too loud. Surely I could frighten them off with a few shots, couldn’t I?

It was bitter cold, and the wind whipped my face. The tops of my cheeks went numb, as if by novacaine, and the rest of my face had become as stiff as a mask. Eyes glinted from the shrubbery, staring at me with ravenous hunger. Just as I was beginning to relinquish hope of ever locating any mystical battlefield, I heard a muffled raven’s caw. I turned to look for the source of the noise, and in doing so lost my footing, tumbling down a gulch.

I pulled myself up from the muck, then examined my surroundings.

I was in a giant crater surrounded by the dead.

Their bones were clad in leather and studded armor, their withered fingers reaching desperately at the clay walls of this chasm, their tomb. Their empty eye sockets still somehow seemed to plead with me, their discoverer, for mercy. These bleached and muddy bones were like flies in amber, an eternal testament to the suffering of the damned.

Then there was the loud cawing again. The raven had landed on a human skull, and was cawing belligerently at me. They were bold birds, ravens, possessed of a savage, bestial cunning, not unlike the soldiers of Gheghis Khan they now using as a de facto perch. Nevertheless, in my current excited state, I quickly lost my temper with the thing and swatted violently at it with my arm. My effort succeeding in dislodging the bird, who went flying into the air. It also succeeded in knocking the dead man’s skull from his ancient shoulders, where it bounced lamely over his brethren to land in the middle of the carnage.

Immediately, something changed. Suddenly, I was aware that I was no longer alone in this pit.

Nothing moved. Nothing stirred. But my feeling of sheer, unadulterated terror only hastened in its growth. Something was here, something evil, something old.

Frantically, I pulled myself up the cave wall, madly knocking over ribcages and femurs as I sunk my hands into clay. When at last I wrenched myself from the gulch that seemed like an abyss, I ran, faster than I could ever recall running before, back toward the safety and security of my private little hamlet.

I saw no eyes on this run. Even if I had looked, even if my fear had relented, there would not have been any. The wolves and beasts of the forest surely felt this palpable, creeping horror as I did. How could they not? As I stumbled back down the path into sight of the village, I remember tripping over a wolf skeleton I do not recall having been there before.

As I hurtled down the trail back towards the place I had become so familiar with, I began to relax. Surely here I was safe. The people of this village were skilled shots. Whatever was out there would not trouble me here. My fear gradually gave way to exhaustion. What an evening! I could not wait to make use of my find. Tomorrow, I would gather some locals to help me with my excavation, along with one or two of the less ambitious interns who wouldn’t be tempted to publish anything themselves. And of course, I’d hire several gunmen, too. For security purposes. For now, though, rest. I would need slumber so as not to fall victim to this foolishness again.

I slept fitfully, and had no unpleasant dreams, unless you can say that all that came after was an unpleasant dream. But, for the last time in my life, I slumbered peacefully and well, with not so much as an uncomfortable bump to disturb me.

When I awoke, I found myself possessed of new resolve. After a cup of coffee, I would proceed immediately to my find, telling no one. There I would begin categorizing the bones, listing and enumerating them. Preparing to leap from them into eternal fame.

I put my muddied coat in the wash, gathered some new clothes, and strode briskly out towards the forest’s edge.

When my charisma evaporated.

For, dangling from the arbors, were one score of human bodies, swinging by their guts.

Beneath them, the fleshy pink mush that had once been people, now spread around in a nasty, gory carpet. Heads I saw, arms and legs and genitals and eyes. Men, women and children alike had been dissected and made into a gruesome collage.

I nearly fell to my knees in shock. No. This could not be. I had to go find someone, alert them. But I spent a quarter of an hour hollering, scouring the place for help, and received no answer. There were an awful lot of bodies up there. Had every single citizen been slain?

Outside help. From Budapest. I would go alert the Romanian law. This crime could not go unavenged. I hot-wired a rugged-looking truck, and managed to get it onto a main road, speeding as fast as I could towards help.

And it was on this road that the true horror of the morning awaited me.

As I rocketed along the black asphalt, I saw a figure ahead of me. Perfect, I thought, perhaps I could explain to him what had happened. But as I neared, I noticed more of him. He was soaked in mud, and wore a black woolen coat, much like mine. And as I passed him gradually slowing, he looked up at my window.

It was the face of the old story teller. But not for very long. For even as I looked at it, it began to change. Slowly, at first, but by the time three heartbeats had elapsed, I was staring at a familiar figure. One whom I saw whenever I looked into a mirror. Only, instead of the haughty, proud expression I was so accustomed to wearing, the face gave me a delighted, almost radiant grin.

Ah, it seemed to say. Did you receive my message?

It was then I remembered the full myth of Fleshmelder. Of the dormant god, now risen up, whom with one careless stroke I had awakened, and sent crawling from the earth again. Flesh that was more than flesh. I stared at my own glittering eyes with horror, not knowing what this being would do next, or where it would go. Only that now, a thing that once had terrorized mankind since its infancy had returned to our cold and unprepared earth.

Since my return to the university I have not slept a single night. I scarcely eat and have grown as thin and wiry as a mesh colander. I cannot even drown my sorrow in alcohol like I once could, for I fear that in my inebriation, I shall slip up, give this thing the opportunity it needs to take me unawares. Indeed, I’ve started seeing it almost constantly. At first it was just my dreams, my fantasies and fears, but now my imagination cannot bear the full blame. During a faculty meeting, I became convinced the table we sat at was the Fleshmelder in disguise. In one incident that must have cemented my madness in the minds of my colleagues, I thought it was masquerading as a student in my Introduction to Folktales class, and ran screaming from the hall to barricade myself in my office. Though I apologized profusely for the incident, I’m under close observation from the university staff, who believe me delusional and suicidal after witnessing the deaths of so many friends and co-workers.

On one occasion, I attempted to tell someone else what I witnessed. A Freudian, who was examining me ‘merely as a formality.’ During this cross-examination, there was one moment where I tried to divulge the truth of what had occurred. But I paused. For outside at that moment, I had just heard a raven caw, unearthing memories as black and deep as the damp Carpathian mud that first spat forth those skeletons. So I remained silent, and said not a word.

 

The massacre garnered little media coverage. Since many of the dead were found near weapons and firearms, Romanian police have pinned the slaughter on some sort of fanatic religious caliphate, or rebel right-wing extremists. Amazing, what people will believe. That fascist bullets are responsible for gutting a corpse, or that the macerations that line the crushed skulls of the villagers were the result of knife blades.  

The authorities brought up this theory when questioning me, and I simply neglected to correct them. I had no desire to give my critics more fodder with which to call for my dismissal. And after all, it was a more than adequate cover. Since the events I have described occurred, a slew of violent uprisings and rebellions have plagued the Balkans, resulting in countless deaths. Madness and murder seem to slowly be engulfing the continent—the work of Fleshmelder, I am sure.

 I’ve researched this thing for almost three months, now. I haven’t come up with much; its origins lie firmly in prehistory, and while almost all cultures of note have stories of Shape-Shifters, none describe anything of this magnitude. I had a thought once, alone in my office, wearing the same blouse I’d had on for almost a week, smelling of sweat and cheap food and stale perfume. What if the Fleshmelder was all of it? Every myth, every story, every god ever concocted? After all, it had the power to take on any desirable shape, could kill humans with ease, and in vast quantities.

 And what is more, it erodes the minds of those who it comes in contact with—it drove those Mongols mad, and it seems to have done the same to me. What if, every time scribes spoke of dragons, they were describing this monstrous thing in one of its forms, setting fire to villages for sport? What if instead of God spreading plague amongst the Egyptians, it was Fleshmelder, murdering firstborn sons just to see what the Pharaoh would do? What if every tale and legend I’d ever read had been paying homage to this dark monster? What if the stories I had thought once made us strong, merely asserted our position as prey?  

In my saner moments, I sometimes wonder why the thing hasn’t killed me yet. Why it didn’t kill me as I slept, unarmed in my hut. I have yet to settle upon a satisfactory conclusion. Perhaps it was grateful to me for waking it? It thought I was its friend? That alone was a horrifying thought. Maybe it wanted a more existential revenge for rousing it from slumber. But no. The pain I felt now was a fear of madness, grief and guilt, all emotions no god can truly comprehend.

Those are the emotions of the prey, the dying. The answer I can’t seem to shake is far simpler. All gods desire to be revered and feared. To be sacrificed to, to be worshipped, that they may reap savagery through the hands of their believers. Otherwise they are little more than a dream, an idea. What if Fleshmelder had kept me alive because I was its greatest disciple? I had spent most of my life studying its every move throughout history, until I finally beheld it, this god about which all tales are written. If my theories were sound, then it had chosen me to be its prophet. To speak of it madly, to write long and wax eloquent on its deeds in the forest. So that those few who had knowledge of such things could rise and do their master’s bidding.

But my pen has not until now touched parchment. Even these ramblings will be seen more as a bizarre suicide note than anything else, and that is if I do not burn them, as I yearn to do. To take the monster with me into the abyss. But part of me knows that a thing, once done, can never be undone. No matter how hard I try to conceal, repress what has happened, it will not consent to be buried for long.

This then wasn’t the story of a battle. It was a creation narrative. This was the very earth, the very mountains cleansing themselves of the upright aberration that was mankind. All humanity meeting its end where reality was weakest.

Every movement is a torment for me. My hair is falling out in tufts. The constant clattering of footsteps and branches on windows and floors is excruciating. Which sound will be the last one I hear?

I’ve taken refuge for hours at a time in this church, but it brings me no solace, for I was never the praying sort. And in these, long, winding hours, I envy my dead fellows who died before they could learn what I know now, what those old storytellers in the village had always known. What they had tried so hard to hide in the guise of narrative, to crush, to smother, to destroy. That this life is a cold and empty thing, and we are not wanted by this earth where we live it. No power saves us on that day when some new foe asserts itself above us on this fickle food chain, and like flies we die, one by one by one.

What was that? Has it come for me at last? I pray that is the case, that I may finally have some peace, some sleep, some mercy. But no: it is a car driving by. And so once again I am forced to take matters into my own hands. To draw the battered old .38 that I have never fired. To at long last lend my face to this beast from hell. To explore the depths of this cold, deep, dark, forest. Alone."

I am a fourth-year political science major, and I am thinking of going back to university for a second bachelor's in CS (maybe economics as well?). I regret my major because a lot of social science degrees seem pretty worthless, unless you land internships/co-ops, my school did not offer that, so I regret it. I have always been fascinated with tech start-ups, programming, and computers -- I am slowly trying to understand Python, though it is tricky. I would like to pursue CS, but I am slow at math, and I mean slow, it can take a long time to fully comprehend math problems (I struggled with social statistics as well). I am not sure if CS is for me, and it's definitely not for everyone, it's a bloody difficult major, but career-wise it's fantastic. I have never done calculus before, since I only took the easy class route in HS for math, so I am worried that I will not be able to do it because I am slow at math. I am not sure what to do. I am quite interested in economics, and there is math involved with that too. I was seriously thinking of doing a second bachelor's in CS and Economics (double major). Yet, I am not sure if I can if I am awful at math. If it doesn't work out, I could always do a Master's in Political Science at uWaterloo -- they offer a computer programming course option for public policy too. Also, some MBA's programs offer finance focus with computer programming - I think Microsoft offers internships for MBAs as well, which is pretty cool. Could really use some honest feedback and advice. I am just new to computer programming as well, and it hasn't sinked in just yet.

Do any of you CS majors struggle with math or are slow with math? What are steps that you took to improve your math abilities? Especially calculus and discrete math?"

To give a little background, I took around 6 IT classes in highschool in all different fields from programming, game and app design, database management, networking and security, etc. As a result from these classes, my high school provided cert tests to take and I obtianed the following certs:
• MTA: Database Fundamentals -2018
• MTA: Windows Operating Systems-2018 Fundamentals
• MTA: Security Fundamentals -2018

After my Junior year I got a paid internship for a local business working full time in the summer, then part time during my senior year, and full time after my senior year as a Help desk technician. I did the normal helpdesk thing handling calls and tickets, pushing tickets up to those who were T2's, but I did lots of computer re-imaging and some really light network stuff like resetting a router or creating and running network cables. I worked there for 15 months before eventually going to college.

I was recently hired for my colleges IT department as a T1 help desk handling walk-ins, phone calls, and tickets, as well as really general things like laptop/media device checkouts, printer/copier issues, and troubleshooting professors computer/projector/sound system problems.

I feel that I have a big head start on most people in IT with almost 2 years of job experience in Helpdesk along with 3 decent certs. I was checking out this reddit a fair amount getting an idea of what employers look for in candidates and where I wanna work in IT. My major is IT but I am going to have an emphasis in Networking and Security but I think Cybersecurity Is looking to be more my thing. 

My questions are:
1. Am I being naive or cocky wanting more out of an IT job only being 19 since I already have almost 2 years of job experience and certs
2. I am interested in the A+ cert, but should I wait til my junior/senior year of college slightly before I graduate? I want to progress and keep my momentum going but i feel slightly pigeon holed into waiting 3 more years until i get my degree to really go anywhere in my IT career beyond helpdesk stuff"

On one hand, people say it is really hard, and on the other hand, there are people saying they have 4.0 GPAs and don't think it is managed that well. So, what is the CS program like and do you think that you get a good education?

My main question: what are the job prospects like? How hard is it to get a job at a big tech company like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Uber, etc.? I know these companies will only hire you have you take initiative outside the classroom to work on some other projects. However, if the RU program at Rutgers is really hard, do you have time to work on extra projects outside the classroom? How hard is the program? I'm comparing RU with Arizona State university. At first glance, RU is ranked higher than ASU, but then I see an article like this... [https://qz.com/967985/silicon-valley-companies-like-apple-aapl-hires-the-most-alumni-of-these-10-universities-and-none-of-them-are-in-the-ivy-league/](https://qz.com/967985/silicon-valley-companies-like-apple-aapl-hires-the-most-alumni-of-these-10-universities-and-none-of-them-are-in-the-ivy-league/)

&amp;#x200B;

(I know that getting a job at some big tech company isn't everything and that you can get a really good job at a lesser known company with a nice salary and stuff, but I feel like getting a job at one of those companies is the top of the bar, so I'm aiming for that, but I do know that it isn't everything.)

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to work on the west coast, not in NYC. So, is Rutgers good for getting a job at one of these companies? What about internships? How hard is it to get an internship? RU is in-state for me which is why I'm considering it and want to learn more about it. So, what are your thoughts?"

I graduate this December, and am in the process of finding full-time work. A small company who offered me an intern position last year (which I couldn't accept for reasons) reached out recently regarding a full-time position, one I could start in right after school, and is very close to home. However, although there are several reasons the offer is appealing, the pay is low ($45k-$60k).

The benefits would be:

\- I could live with my parents and save money

\- Work seems very low-stress and easy, so would have time/energy to study Leetcode and apply to other jobs

\- Could probably leave after some months without burning bridges

The negatives are the low pay as mentioned, and the fact that I would be in the company for at least a couple months. And maybe difficulty in studying/applying given how much time I have.

My question is would it be better to take the position and work while studying/applying in the hopes of getting a better job in the future, or just devote all my time to studying/applying and try to get a nicer job sooner?

My parents don't mind me staying at home (my mom would be thrilled) for some time, and living at home means more money to put towards student loans. Another position might pay a lot more, but if the job is in an area with high living costs, would I really be making more? The nature of the work would mean I would probably have time and energy to look at other options, but eh I might just get lazy and complacent also.

Then again, this isn't really a company I would want to stay in long-term, likewise with the work I would be doing (probably just working on their main product, with some sql/tech support). I'm thinking if I grind Leetcode and applying for a month, I might be able to land a better job. But I might not, who knows.

If I don't respond soon, the company will probably start looking at other candidates. And because I was a bum in starting the job-seeking process, I not in the final stages of any other positions. I don't want to commit myself to a situation for a couple months especially if it damages my long-term prospects and goals. But I also don't want to be jobless living with my parents waiting on a ""better"" job for months. 

Given the circumstances, what do y'all think? Thanks for any and all advice."

So it is clear that they expect candidates to spend a significant amount of time to do it (on Glassdoor some claim to have worked for several weeks on a solution).   
Having received an offer just after 2 technical interviews and no assignments from another company, I refused to do any further work on that assignment.

I've done two internships that were pretty much QA and automation this current one is in Python. So I'm just wondering is there any chance me being able to study to cover the knowledge gaps and maybe eventually get an offer? I'm willing to move if I got one that paid enough and covered relocation costs that would incur from breaking a lease. I am hopeful that i will maybe be able to find an internship that would teach me more and have extra hours since I'm in a bad situation atm. Right now I don't have any leads. 

What I know I'm missing so far:
I've gotten to at least interview questions round. I missed a coding questions where they were expecting an answer involving  data structures. I've also gotten dinged badly on questions involving lambdas, and another about reflection which I guess are things  I need to study about because I have no idea what those were and hadn't learned about them in my current classes. At both my internships my mentors have strongly advised me learning AWS also. 

So far my idea of what other things study so far is:
Learning more Python 
Studying a whole bunch of leet code
Doing the CS50 course

Box ($41/hr + 3k stipend) is in Redwood City, which would also allow me to stay at home but that'd an hour+ commute each way everyday, and I don't know much about their internship or the company.

I've never used this language or tech before, so I've had to learn all of it through reading documentation and google, and it takes me a really long time to figure out how to even approach problems. Inevitably when I *do* start tackling them, I just get torn apart on code reviews because I did XYZ instead of ABC or took too long to figure it out and didn't make fast enough progress. I feel like a complete failure and have done nothing bet let down the team. It's really stressing me out about continuing in software dev.

I feel like college didn't prepare me *at all*. I get A's because I'm good at studying and remembering concepts, and pretty good at math. All of my programs in class have been &lt;1000 lines of code, and fairly simple command line stuff that had obvious OOP structure. So I feel completely overwhelmed trying to design the logic for these abstract systems and concepts using complicated API calls and stuff. I feel like all I'm suited to do is hello world's lol.

I'm considering trying to find my way into management since my social skills are tenfold compared to my technical ones. :/"

e7akxz,9,2019-12-07,Anyone declared that they were going to med school at some point but then years later decided not to and has to still face some pressure from Asian parents?,tofu0823,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/e7akxz/anyone_declared_that_they_were_going_to_med/,"Will be giving some context first. The first time I thought of and declared potential med school path was when I took a summer anatomy &amp; physiology course before high school. And of course, my entire Asian family was happy (no one in my family is a medical doctor, though one of my aunts is an NP). During high school, I participated in science-related extracurriculars, took honors and AP-level biology and chemistry classes, and even did a summer internship at a neurology lab where I worked on my own small project and shadowed doctors in the affiliated hospital. In college, I was on the pre-med track majoring in neuroscience and psychology because I decided that I wanted to be a psychiatrist. But my self-esteem suffered a lot; the hard science classes (general chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, etc) were HARD. Yeah that's not news, but many of them made me feel very insecure. I felt like I was not good enough, so I would lose motivation. Though, I did enjoy the neuroscience and psychology classes that I took. I also worked as a scribe from summer after my 3rd year, but the experience didn't feel great as I expected. I realized I just felt whatever about it; I wasn't exactly excited to be at the job, but I wouldn't say I hated it either. And I didn't care whether I learned a lot or not from the job... basically, I thought ""If I learned, cool. If I didn't, then oh well"". I initially planned on going on a post-bacc or an SMP right after undergrad and then apply to med schools because I knew my undergrad GPA is not competitive for med school... but I began questioning why I was doing this in my 4th year. The only answer I could give myself was that it's already my final year and I might as well just finish it for now... I wasn't sure why I wanted to be a doctor, and I wasn't sure if I actually had the motivation. I eventually decided to get a job instead to figure out what I want to do.

I actually do enjoy my current job as a lab tech, but I wish to at least go to grad school by fall 2021. Problem is, I don't know what it is I actually want to do. The bigger issue, however, is my asian mother would REALLY LOVE IT if I went back on the pre-med track and started studying for the MCAT and applying to med school. Actually, she recently found out my friend got a 97% on her MCAT and told me ""if she can do it, you can do it too!"" and keeps trying to get me to think about taking the MCAT. She keeps repeating stories about people she knows whose children gave up pre-med because it was hard and regretted it and stories about people whose children had not-so-competitive GPA yet received excellent MCAT scores and got accepted to med schools. She wants me to at least try studying for and taking the MCAT and applying and see if I get in anywhere. That already is a HUGE amount of time spent, and omg I cannot imagine the amount of suffering I would go through if I'm not dead set on this! And she said that she will financially support me if I end up not getting into any med school and need to go on post-bacc or SMP for a while before reapplying. Well, she keeps telling me that I should take the MCAT some time in spring 2020 when I don't even KNOW if I want to go to med school. She keeps telling me that it would be a waste of my effort and hard work from high school and college if I decide not to go to med school. Sure, I managed to complete all the pre-med classes, but my sanity barely survived. She keeps telling me that I can do it, but honestly, I'm pretty terrified that I will fail and be unhappy at med school because of how I felt taking the science classes in college. Then again, I sometimes get this irrational fear that I will make the wrong choice and/or that I will fail at everything...

To be honest, I want to settle in a career as soon as possible. Not in a rush for anything, just want to be independent and have a good career as soon as I can get that. But I still don't know what it is I want to do and am basically going through some kind of existential crisis... I understand that this kind of post may be more appropriate for a career-related subreddit, but in some sense, I just wanted to know that there is still room for me to find what I want to do... I will honestly be very happy to hear anything out. I'm sorry for the long post, but thank you for coming this far."

First time poster!

I am graduating Spring 2020 with my BS In CS. 

Lol.

Anyways,  I’m from a non target state school. I’ve had two internships here in my hometown (one really small company and another mid size company.) First internship was this past summer and the second is one that I started this fall and am continuing until graduation.

Not sure if I needed to include that much information, but anyways, I am seriously contemplating hiking the Pacific Crest Trail right after graduation! I’ve received my permit, and am really considering doing it once I graduate as everyone says it’s best time.

However, I am nervous about my job prospects once I finish next September/October.  

Will I have difficulty landing something with my background? Should I wait a couple years until I’ve had non internship, full time experience.

Help! 

Thanks!"

Though, generally, the crashes would generally occur while listening to music or watching videos or films. I haven't experienced a crash while gaming. 

The error is almost always on ""ntoskrnl.exe"" as ""IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL"". As to troubleshoot, I reinstalled Windows 10 and got a license for DriverEasy. Updating my drivers hasn't helped the issue, maybe even enhancing it. A special case was upgrading the ""AMD SATA Controllers"", where doing so, the PC would become stuck on the ""spinning loading screen"" forever. In the motherboard, I setup the recommended configuration for my SSD and the SATA controllers were then marked as ""unplugged"". I noticed the SSD would sit at around 57 - 62 C, so I setup the fan configuration on ""Maximum"". Seems like the BSOD would occur even on a normal temperature.

I went to counselling, the counsellor send me to a therapist. I went to therapy; I was always on time, did all my homework. The therapist bailed on me. My psychiatrist wants me to contact him, yet he rarely answers my emails. I have no one to turn to. The counsellor wants to send me to an outpatient program st a day clinic, my mother threw a hissy fit when I told her. So that's no option either, especially since I have an internship scheduled for the time he wanted to send me. But I don't know if I can do it. Or my presentations. Or my exams.

I haven't properly slept in 3 weeks. It's either worries or nightmares that keep me up. It's all too much. Too much. I have headaches all day long, I keep dissociating, I just want to hurt myself so I can escape that feeling of hopelessness for a bit. And not just scratching with a scissor, like I did before. I want to cut deep. I want to draw blood. These thoughts torture me.

I feel so alone. I can't take it anymore. I can't. I'm so so sorry. I've really tried. But as so often, my hardest isn't good enough. Never was."

Major: Intended for CS at all

Stats: 

* 4.0UW/4.5W
* 1570/800s on M2, Phys, 750+ on Lit, USH 
* essentially most rigorous courseload(15 aps taken, 2 4s rest 5s)
* Asian male, Bay area, competitive public

ECs:

* Main EC is taking classes, then TAing at nonprofit that does cs education for underprivileged high schoolers with high impact (like 300/semester take twice-weekly classes), reached a pretty high leadership position this year. (9-12)
* A technical summer internship where I got a glowing extra rec (12)
* Fencing for 3 yrs, vars this yr (10-12)
* Summer mentorship program, did workshops with some professionals in tech, did a service project and got nominal award for it, continue to be mentored (12)
* co-prez of school club related to CS, weekly meetings with hands on projects (11-12)
* \~600hrs volunteered over 2 summers @ my church daycamp (10-11)
* leadership in church youth group, worked on website/manage budget (9-12)
* random hackathons , about 2-3/yr and got recognition at 7 of them (9-12)
* lots of family responsibilities (5 hrs/wk all yr)

Awards: none except Natl AP Scholar, NMSF, school honor society that basically indicates I'm at least top 3.5% in class of 700 (school doesn't formally rank)

Essays: alright, hard to judge though. Supps focused on ""spike"" of bridging disconnect between tech money and low income students through free cs education.  also heavy focus on extenuating circumstances in commonapp essay.

Recs: should also be alright, but no special relationships with teachers. Just classes I did well in and interacted regularly w teachers. Gave teachers some info to include about extenuating circumstances.

Concerning extenuating circumstances: EFC 0, basically did everything @ home including cooking/groceries/bills with a sibling. Widowed absent parent (not around often, like 1mon/yr), live with grandparents, one of which is in later stages of Alz. Pretty much had to look for ec opportunities and get around on my own. Speak on this extensively in apps. Applied to a bunch of scholarships too, as I'll need almost a full ride to afford college

Advice: don't groan, but I put a lot of heart and thought into my essays. I tried to interconnect a lot of the different moving pieces in my life to make a cohesive narrative between the essays, but at the same time I wasn't really trying to paint myself as someone I was not. obviously my situation is unique, but what's been apparent to me so far with the other acceptances I've seen is that Stanford values not only taking advantage of the opportunities available to you, but having a motivation for that and genuinely presenting that. so cliche and I would've rolled my eyes at this just a few months ago, but this is what I believe got me in. 

Accepted: Stanford

Applied: UCs, CSUs, UW"

One more question... I'm hoping for something that pays $17 an hour or more and is full-time. Can be contract, but I'd prefer contracts that are at least 6 months or contract to hire. I know that their are variables based on the person, but with my BS degree and internship is that realistic?  I just see a lot of jobs wanting 3-5 years experience for $17 and up, and I see jobs offering $12-$15 for more entry level stuff.

    There is s that consists of digits from 0 to 9, and an integer k. A substring s[L:R] (where 0 = L = R &lt; sizeof(s) ) is a contiguous group of characters with s.  A substring is called a perfect substring if all of its elements occur exactly k times. 

    For example,  s = 1102021222 and k = 2. Its 6 perfect substrings are:
    
        s[0:1] = 11
        s[0:5] = 110202
        s[1:6] = 102021
        s[2:5] = 0202
        s[7:8] = 22
        s[8:9] = 22

    Calculate the number of perfect substrings in s.

    Function Description
    
    Complete the function perfectSubstring in the editor below. The function must return an integer that represents the number of perfect substrings in the given string.
    
    perfectSubstring has the following parameters:
    
        s: a string where the value of each element s[i] is described by the character at position i (where 0 = i &lt; n).
    
        k: an integer that denotes the required frequency of the substring.

I was able to compile a solution that was correct but it ended up having O(n^3 ) complexity and would not compile very large solutions (the compiler they used would stop after a set period of time). I did not write down my exact solution but the general approach I took was get every substring of size k (starting at index 0), then looped through the substring to check if it was perfect. I would then do the same process every substring of size 2k, then 3k, and so on, then print the results found. The issue was this iterated through s in three separate for loops, which ended being super time consuming. What are some ways I could improve upon performance? I figure the best way to go would be to combine two of the above processes somehow, but I could not figure out how in the time I had."

TL;DR: performed really badly in a couple CS required classes, wondering if I can get into a top grad school."

Salary-wise they're OK 

start up: TC 150k 1st yr, 135k after, location: NC
tier 2 tech company: TC 170k, location: Bay Area. But the wlb is really bad.
Non-tech company: TC 95k, location: TX. Very good wlb and income tax free.

At the same time I also got three internships offers from Google, Facebook and Dropbox. Since I'm an international student, if I'm gonna intern for one more summer, I have to extend my program and graduate in Dec 2020.  

Graduate in May: the earlier, the better. Job market is getting more competitive year by year. 
Graduate in Dec: I have the opportunity to get into FG. Google's winding down full time applications this year and it's very hard to get into Facebook if not an intern return.

I've already had two internships on my resume. So my question is ,is it worth it to intern again? If it is, which should I choose? If not, which offer to choose and should I continue job searching?

Any suggestions are appreciated!"

I'm a PhD student in CS/ML. I have a number of good internships, including an upcoming one with a Big N. 

I really enjoy tech, but I enjoy the meta aspect more: networking, resume reviews, job searching, applications etc. 

Is there a path for me to technical recruiting and sourcing?

I see people regularly complain about bad recruiters who don't understand the tech requirements of a certain job or drop the ball in communication. I feel like there is potentially room for more ""high tech"" recruiters with some understanding of the job requirements. 

Could I start an agency?

Thoughts?"
e7iu6a,1,2019-12-07,I'm a 27 y/o technologically and mathematically inclined business student who has completed all of the core curriculum but am having a hard time figuring out what I want to switch my major to &amp; generally where to go from here,Thadd305,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/e7iu6a/im_a_27_yo_technologically_and_mathematically/,"So several years back after I finished up high school I didn't know what I wanted to do but knew that USF, which is near my hometown, had a good business program and that business seemed like a practical choice for somebody in my position. I declared for marketing but have had second thoughts and am currently working full time as a temp doing chargebacks for what turns out to be a pretty chill company. 

I played video games incessantly for quite a long time but this last year have hardly touched them. I became pretty computer-savvy in the process but all of the screen time has definitely taken its toll on my vision (mildly bothersome floaters, -2.5 prescription) which makes me hesitant to consider something in which I would need to stare at a screen all day. I know that is required of a lot of jobs, including my current one so.

I've always been very good with numbers and have a high attention to detail. I have felt for a long time like I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do and so I've stalled in school as a result but this semester I have finished the last two business classes for my program that aren't electives and need to make a decision to keep moving forward.

If I could go back, I would be a math major but at this point its not part of my program and I worry that I will lose a lot of my credits and that the move could be rather painful. I am going to try and sit down with my advisor next week to get a better picture of what that might look like. But assuming that I stay the business course I need to figure out what I want to do that is not marketing. Here are my considerations..

**Accounting** 

PROS: The most practical choice in terms of me being able to quickly move into a comfortable job, I could learn what I need to learn, do it well, and hopefully find fulfillment outside of work. I feel like I'm playing catch up with my life a bit and this would probably provide the most immediate quality-of-life increase.

CONS: I see it as potentially quite boring, feel like I would be stuck being an accountant forever, pretty much give up on doing something great and changing the world at least through my work. Basically I feel like even if I was the best accountant that's all I would ever be.

**Information Systems in Business**

PROS: Another relatively practical choice which would leverage my high degree of technical proficiency and eye for efficiency. Feel like it's a good major looking towards the future, could prove interesting, and would pair well with something like computer science if I really wanted to kick things up a notch.

CONS: Probably has the highest likelihood of requiring a lot of screen time. Feel like I would have to continue my education whether I liked it or not to be effective. Not sure how much value it would actually add if I did ultimately decide to do something in programming for anything but some of the highest-level jobs.

**Finance**

PROS: It fits well with my skillset and I find it the most interesting. May be able to stay away from screens a bit more than with prior mentions. I feel like I have good bullshit sensors and can see myself being pretty good at evaluating companies/visualizing future trends in the market. Would help me in maximizing the value of my own portfolio as well.

CONS: I am getting a relatively late start and I feel like a lot of the finance majors know early and land lofty internships at a young age and I worry I may not be taken as seriously. I have also read that Finance majors benefit greatly from having a ""large personal network"" of which I am definitely unequipped.

**Management**

PROS: I have a somewhat diverse employment background with experience in sales, customer service, retail, and the service industry &amp; I'm also somewhat androgynous so I feel like I might be able to be a more effective manager of a team by understanding different viewpoints. Maybe the highest chance of putting me in a position for healthy screen habits.

CONS: From what I can tell if you do Management it's almost required to go on and get your MBA, which would be a big commitment from me and I am apprehensive because for one it has taken me a long time to get from my associate's, which I got upon highschool graduation, to this point. Feel like it might not add very much value.

I have until the end of next week to decide about GoDaddy, and my MongoDB is at the beginning of next week, and my Capital One interview is a day before my deadline, so it would be a short window to try to get an offer from either company.

With Godaddy, I was told I would be developing highly scalable micro-services (with Java) that would impact millions of users. Whereas with MongoDB or Capital One, I don’t know what I would be doing or what languages I would be working with (if I even get an offer)."

I've realized in my time in this department that this type of analysis is severely lacking. It would be a great benefit to me, and the department, if I can develop the skillset to begin to help people address these questions using publicly available datasets.   


I am a beginner when it comes to bioinformatics. I've analyzed a bulk rna-seq dataset, but it was with data generated ourselves, and with oversight/guidance from superiors at an internship. I used BASH/UNIX and python based tools such as FastQC and MultiQC, all the way through alignment of reads using hisat2, to generation of gene expression matrices using feature counts, to differential expression tests with deseq2 and visualization of data in R. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not comfortable yet on my own doing these sort of analyses, though I am working to get better. I've found a couple of these sequencing sources here:

[http://dropviz.org/](http://dropviz.org/)

[https://panglaodb.se/index.html](https://panglaodb.se/index.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience using either of these? Do you have a general workflow you can suggest?

&amp;#x200B;

The specific question I am trying to answer right now is: **Where are the various Gaba-A alpha-subunits expressed in the mouse brain?** For those with no background, Gaba-A is a hetero-pentameric ion channel receptor. Gaba-A receptors composed of different subunits have different activities. It has been found that subunit specific compounds have different effects. The ultimate goal is to develop therapeutics with biases for Gaba-A receptors composed of specific subunit combinations that impact pain, without also having sedative or anxiolytic effects seen with traditional benzodiazepines.

My major was more electrical than it was computer science, so I've been taking steps to try and learn a bit more C++ after an internship last summer highlighted some of the areas I could work on.

My thing is, I am not feeling like I'm making much progress going through the book. Maybe I'm not approaching each challenge question right? I am usually able to figure out the answers, but I'm too tempted to look up the solutions sometimes and being disciplined is hard. I've tried adding in some coding challenges from various websites into my regimine too, and am also tempted to look at the solutions sometimes when I know I shouldn't. I've been using C++ Primer as a reference during the challenges I've tried, or tutorialspoint.com. 

I've been thinking about getting a book named Head First Java to try and dip into Java, but I'm not feeling like I've been effectively learning things as well. During my internship, when I knew what was happening within the project and how it all fit together, I was able to code better and learn how to apply everything I knew that way, but it's a little different right now since I'll have about a month and a half to really dig in and prepare before I start full-time.

Does anyone have any self-discipline tips or self-studying tips? I'd appreciate them, and I guess I'm feeling a little discouraged about my progress so far. I do have a passion for learning how to code, but honestly most of what I have done has been in Python and C, so some of the inheritance/OOP stuff can trip me up when I try to tackle C++."

I’ve been reading about a lot of people’s stats and accomplishments and I’m really nervous about my own! 

I come from a very low income area with pretty low test scores, graduation rates, etc. I’m taking the SAT in March but my 10th grade PSAT score was a 1230 (640 English, 590 math). Compared to other people’s scores I feel like that’s pretty low, but it’s a high a score for the school I go to. My most recent PSAT score comes out in a few days so I’ll update when I receive it. 

My weighted gpa:

No weighted classes (my school wouldn’t allow it)
Advanced classes included:

4.2 sophomore year
2 weighted classes

My other two classes have to do with film. 
My school had something called academies which basically offer classes having to do with the career path you’re interested in. I’m in video academy since I’m interested in a film, so I’m taking a Video Broadcasting class this year, I also took a video class last year. My other class is actually an internship at a local organization in my city called “the Digital Nest.” I basically work on film projects for the community, and I’m even entering one of my films in my local film festival. 
Regarding grades: I’m pretty scared I’m going to get my first B in Pre-Calculus this year. Do you guys think that would ruin my chances of getting into these schools?

Extra curricular activities (only listing the ones I’ve been really involved in):

Mock trial - it’s my second year; I’m a second chair defense attorney. 

Student news - I’ve been part of my school student news broadcast since freshman year. I’ve anchored, produced, written, filmed, and have been tech director throughout my three years. 

College club - I’ve been a member since my freshman year, and I’m Vice President this year.

Upward Bound - a summer program for low income students where we spend 6 weeks at California State University Monterey Bay taking a college class for college credit. I participated in this program for two consecutive years.

Ivy League project (exclusive to the two major public high schools in my district) - a program for academically exceptional juniors and seniors at my school. We spent a year fundraising for a 2 week trip to the east coast to visit the Ivy League universities. It was a great experience! 

Girl Scouts - We do a lot of community service such as buying gifts for foster children, food for the homeless, etc. 

Internship - although it’s one of my classes, I consider it an extracurricular as well. I’ve gotten to film, produce, and edit films for my community. I’m also facing the possibility of getting hired to edit podcasts for a client through this internship. 

Sports - I was on the soccer team freshman year and on the tennis team sophomore year. They weren’t really my thing though! 

Community hours: 
Most of my community hours have come from volunteering at my local film festival and volunteering at the digital nest. I have about 200 so far, I don’t actually know the exact amount at the moment lol. 

About me: 
I’m a low income Latina from a low income community. My parents are separated and I live with my mom (single parent). I will be a first generation college student once I get accepted somewhere. I’m hoping to become an editor and/or producer/director for film and television. I know USC is really competitive (about 3% acceptance rate for film program) but it’s my dream school for film. Getting into UCLA would be super great as well! (About 18% acceptance rate). Am I on track to get in?

e7rgzd,4,2019-12-08,How to deal with Asian mother and brother with depression,ebgoodman,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e7rgzd/how_to_deal_with_asian_mother_and_brother_with/,"Tldr how to deal with Asian mother with depression who feels like she wasted her life on her children and brother who has no motivation in life

Hi first post here and sorry about the length of it. I'm a senior in college graduating living at home, and the oldest out of 3 siblings. Me and my siblings are US born and mom is a citizen. However mom isn't comfortable with English. Also parents had us pretty late in life.

Mom always cried a lot and was always regretful of the sacrifices she made for her kids ever since I was very young, however this year it reached the peak. As she had a US citizenship from a previous marriage, she thought that it will be better for my dad's job and the child's future if they are born in the US. The baby has to be reported in the father's family registery in korea, thus my parents would have to be married, however my dad's job will frown on his marriage (he works in religion), so she gave birth in US where that is not required. After we moved back and forth from Korea and US as my mother went to school and had more siblings (grandma helped too however father never visited). When I was in 6th grade, my mother and siblings left Korea and moved to a small town in east coast US where she hated (i was one of the 3 only Asian students in my grade). Then moved to a white majority neighborhood in Southern California after my middle school instead of the many Asian neighborhoods for education and less competition. As she doesn't like driving and scared that she won't stand up in the Asian parent child bragging game, she doesn't leave the house at all unless it is absolutely necessary and has no friends. 

Few years back brother had a suicide attempt and had to be institutionalized. (While I agree he is depressed and addicted to internet, personally I think the school board took everything too far, with mandatory counseling, meetings, grade forgiveness/grade bump; I attended most of these). This year, he dropped out of high school to attend adult school and local community college due to his poor grades and absences. However this semester, found out that he withdrew from all of his classes a while back but never told anyone and still made mom drive to school every day with her bad knee. Basially, he has no motivation in life and will just read articles and watch movies all day locked in his room. 

Because mom wants me to graduate asap and the lease on this house is running out, I'm currently taking 7 classes with 3 labs so I'm usually in school 7:30am-9:30pm. (I changed my major that mom wanted into something more suitable my 2nd semester of 4th yr) Thankfully I have my fridays off and want to spend day/week with friends. However mom keeps crying on how I'm going out too much, spend too much time with friends/hobby, not helping family out as much. Initially my 'hobby' is paying for my gas and books this semester. (Internship and finaicial aid is paying for tuition) While I agree that i do not spend much time on family than I'm used to, I think it's more important to graduate with as less debt as possible, especially if since mom wants a percentage of my salary every paycheck (it's an asian thing).

Mom just cries in front of us, which leads to me and bro trying to avoid her. 
She usually yells/talks/cries/texts about how much she regret her life, having us , etc about 30min/day in front of each of us, and more hours in her room. We would be eating dinner and 10min in she would start sobbing. (So bro don't eat with us now) I would get pages and pages of rants about why I shouldn't have been born at school and she would get more upset if I dont text back asap. When i ask her if we should watch a show or go out for a walk, she says that she know that I'll rather be working on something else and tells me to go away. I have a hard time spending time with her as we don't have a common interest and is now just numb to all her crying. 

Usually my sis is good at listening to her and spending her day next to her, but she's currently going to college away from home. However she calls mom at least 2hrs everyday, usually to cry about how much she misses home and talk to mom (she also has a mom complex and has no friends) After college (1.5 more years) she is planning on following mom and leave the US to become a math teacher in Korea. Her and brother do not get along. 

Mom is also very regretful of our dad as they never got married, but had 3 kids. Because of his work, he has never visited the US. Dad is worried about her and brother. He keeps saying that both need medication, but they refuse it. I think they need therapy, but they refused that too. 

Most of the living expenses comes from mom's stock market exchanges. However because it's an unreliable way of earning money so she has no retirement plan other than a small, rundown apartment in Korea that she hates outside and her children. She also cries about how she should have sold this one stock 10+ years ago almost everyday. Because she made some very bad investments few years ago, we are basically living off of savings. 

So she had wasted 20+ years of her life wanting her children to go to a ""good school"" and all she got back was nothing. She wasted her youth away on raising children in a foreign country and hates herself and everyone for it. Btw even with my current school not being her standard, I've gotten several internships and scholarships. Sis goes to a top 30 US national school majoring in data science 🤷‍♀️

In all, I have 1.5 more years before my mom leaves for Korea again. After that I have to get housing where i have at least one room for mom (so she can live in US during fall and winter) and one more room if my brother is not able to find a job or attend a 4yr university by that time. Having to cover everyone's housing cost right after college in CA is pretty daunting but can't do much about it. 

What i want advice on is how to deal with my mom and brother. I can try to spend more time with family when i dont have classes and leave friends for a while. However I start a new internship soon and will be spending less time at home. I'm also bad at dealing with people crying or emotions in general, and have a hard time relating to anyone."

e7serg,18,2019-12-08,"I have the option of taking a big company internship or a continue working at a ""startup"" as a junior software developer and I am not sure what to do?",MrSteezeMaster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e7serg/i_have_the_option_of_taking_a_big_company/,"A  little bit about me, I am a CS major 3 semesters away from graduation. I have a job lined up starting at the beginning of next year with decent pay as a junior software engineer, I have accepted this job (before I knew I got accepted as an intern). I will be starting this and quitting my current job as a IT help-desk technician as it gives more relevant experience/better pay. 

I just got offered an internship at a very big banking company, I have about a week to accept it or decline it. My current stance is accept it and quit from the junior software developer job when the internship would start which is about 6 months after I would start. 

I just don't know the best move and that is my question entails, my options are to stay at the new job as a junior software engineer and not accept the big internship, or quit from the new job and start the internship in the summer. My pros and cons are, for the new junior software job it is a real job not an internship that I could work until I graduate school to find a new job with real world experience in industry in C# a language I would most like to program with or Python, and on the back-end where I want to be. The other option is to quit and work the internship over the summer with a big banking company that would be a great opportunity to see how a big company works, get some great work experience and have a big company on my resume. However it is an internship I am not sure totally what my role entails or what language in which isn't a huge deal as it such a big company. To me it is opportunity that I cannot pass as it gives me  a really good chance to expand what I want to work in and see where I want to be when I graduate and is a great resume builder. However on the other hand I would be financially set to finish school and get my first year in industry before I graduated as a junior software engineer with a high likely hood of promotion if I perform. The internship could lead to a full time position but this is not guaranteed and I am not guaranteed to get it or like the position it also pays quite a bit more than the other job but is a 10 week internship.

I just don't know what to do, I really want to try all options and work for the big company to build my resume for my graduation but on the other hand the opportunity to work as a employee in industry until graduation being financially set in the language and position I want to be in can be such a great opportunity. I am just seeing what others would do/feedback as this is my first big opportunity in the CS major and am not really sure what to do.

Maybe I am just overthinking things but to me it seems like such a big decision that could impact the rest of my career, so I want to make the best decision possible. Thank you for all your time and feedback and I wish you a great rest of your day or night depending on where you are. If anything doesn't make sense or you want more elaboration let me know, I am going to bed but will check in the morning and answer any question and be looking at the feedback, I really do appreciate anytime spent looking at the post and feedback given everything helps!

In class, I'm learning how to code in different languages like C++ and Java, but I won't have any classes during my time in college that have to do with Game Development. I know coding is a big part of it, but I won't know how to take my coding skills and implement them into making games because I know gaming companies use really specific software and platforms and game engines to create games. I don't want to try to pursue my dream career knowing nothing about it straight out of college. Is there anything else I need to be doing or things I should be considering? I'm trying to land internships at some companies that develop games, but I'm worried that my basic knowledge of C++ won't get me anywhere if employers are looking for people who have game development experience already.

e7vu5a,3,2019-12-08,Passed over for promotion this cycle and considering other potential job offers,onthehorizon123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e7vu5a/passed_over_for_promotion_this_cycle_and/,"I work for a consulting firm - let's call them Company A - and recently found out that I am unable to get the promotion that I had been aiming to get this cycle. My boss's boss recently sent me a message to inform me that the current contract I am supporting was unable to accept a pay increase that would come along with my promotion until this spring. She offered for us to sit down (along with her boss) to talk more specifically about my career goals/aspirations because they want me to feel like I'm supported at the company. I've been with Company A now for about 2.5 years over which this time I've never received a promotion, however I have received about a $15,000 salary increase because of additional experience/qualifications I have received over time. 

I have enjoyed my time at Company A and by no means want to burn any bridges, but I also would like to take my career to the next level. Up to this point in my career I've essentially just been a worker bee and haven't had to manage any people yet. Also, I have been involved in just a few business development work. I've found that typically, in consulting, the fastest way up is to get involved in business development and also do more management of people/teams.

At the same time I have been dipping my toes into the market to see what other opportunities are out there. There is one company - let's call them Company B - I've been talking with where I'd essentially be doing a similar job for the same client just in another division. I'm a bit wary of that division though just from previous experience interacting with them I'm not sure the work would be as interesting as currently. However, I'd also be responsible for designing and running Company B's internship program which would provide me with some managerial experience. Right now I'm at the point where we are entering into salary discussions, however we're both taking things slow which is something we agreed to when we first started talking. 

I'm also in talks with another recruiter who recruits for multiple firms in my area of expertise, but this just started about a week ago and I don't have any leads on actual jobs yet, but there is potential for something more concrete to pop up.

I guess I'm just wondering how people might thinking about and/or navigate this situation. One thing to keep in mind is I have used some training reimbursement from my company this year and if I were to leave now I'd have to pay back about $3500 that I used to cover training expenses. I am going to bring this up in my salary discussions with Company B. I'm also going to have that sit down with my team in Company A to talk about career goals and to get a sense of whether they're serious about promoting me in the spring or whether they're just stringing me along. At some point though I'm going to have to make a decision out of the three options I'm facing:

1. Stay with Company A in hopes of receiving a promotion this spring
2. Move to Company B doing similar, but possibly slightly less interesting work
3. Stay with Company A, reject Company B's offer, and continue searching for other opportunities on the market

Obviously this is my decision to make, but I'm just curious to see how other people would think about this situation. I'm four years into my career and haven't really faced a decision like this before."

Right now, I am planning on doing tech at a BB as my full time job, but I have many hesitations about it. 

I did the summer internship but I felt like I didn’t learn much. I also feel like I can thrive better in a more intense environment since I’m pretty Type A. Thus, I tried to recruit for IB a few months ago and failed miserably. 

The only thing holding me back is that the tech job pays extremely well and it’s only a 9-5 job. Also, my manager from my summer internship said I stand out from the rest of my peers, making me think it might be a little easier to climb higher in the back office ladder. 

Is it worth it to try to move into IB within my BB after two years? Or should I try to rise up in the ranks in back office tech? Is IB really worth giving up my high paying tech job? 

I should also note that I enjoy the idea of making a lot of money and don’t really have hobbies lmaooo which is another reason why I’m unhappy with the tech job.

Thank you for any and all help! 

TL;DR: currently signed a full time offer for a tech job at a bulge bracket. I’ve been pretty unsatisfied with this outcome since I don’t really use my brain in this role, but it pays well and hours are nice. Should I still try to transition into IB?"

Hello everybody, 

I am in a very bad position and I feel so regretful and guilty about everything. About a month ago, I accepted an offer at a consulting firm as a summer intern where I’m set to start early June. 

A few days ago, I received a DUI. I have not been to my court date yet but I’ve been crying/freaking out nonstop. I know I fucked up. This will be a misdemeanor since it is the first offense. I will have my license suspended for a minimum of 6 months but I am going to try to find a good attorney. 

I need advice. In the offer Letter it states that while it is not required I own a car, it is required I have a valid drivers license and credit card. Considering my license will be suspended until July, when the internship starts in June and ends in August, am I going to lose this job? I understand the severity of this incident and I never thought I’d be in this situation. 

This role was my dream job and a chance for me to try out the consulting industry. I am so ashamed and sad. I turned down another offer earlier in the year and told my current employer that I would be leaving in June. 

My question is, will they rescind my offer for having my license be suspended? I would definitely be able to get to any client site via cab/Uber or any means necessary. When should I disclose this information? If this all goes poorly, I will not have a job. I just am in shock. I’m hoping I can receive some advice and am completely aware of any backlash I will receive. I know this was a mistake and I own up to it."

Above is a link to my resume. I'm in school for what is essentially a software engineering degree, however, it's such a small university that I'm labelled as a ""Computer Science"" graduate despite the course load.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to work with a programming team in the development of mobile or desktop applications, but I got a job two years ago as an equivalent Service Desk Technician at a local community college.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not able to take any internships as I live on my own and have to work full time in order to make ends meet, which is another portion to this rut.

&amp;#x200B;

How would I go about proving to employers that I'm capable of entry-level software engineering without any prior experience? I'm developing my own iOS app in Swift, but outside of home-lab stuff, I don't think I'll have any other relevancies on my resume."
e7x3w4,0,2019-12-08,A bit of advice needed for a fellow CS graduate,starLord073,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e7x3w4/a_bit_of_advice_needed_for_a_fellow_cs_graduate/,"Hello everyone. I am at a bit of knot here and thought maybe you guys can help me out.

I am a Computer Science graduate from India that is about to start his career in 6 days as a developer in a good company. I am really happy to start the job but there's something in the back of my head that has a few doubts. So I'm hoping someone out there can answer a few doubts I have.

I've wanted to be a developer and hoped I'll get the job for more than two years now. And I've finally got it. But now I found some interesting thoughts on the back of my head. See the college I studied in like almost all the colleges around here separates us into two group of BI ( Business Intelligence ) and Networks. I dream to one day make atleast some contribution to the world of computer science ( I know that sounds cheesy or whatever but that's me ) . I wanted to make a product that will somehow influence atleast a small group of people. And I wanted to work for myself. ( Cliche dream maybe? ).

So I choose BI. Work my ass off learning the basics of ML, statistics, data analysis, learn a few languages (which I found easy actually ) , did a few projects, scored third in the state in a coding competition, did an internship and worked on a live project with clients. It was hard work and lots of sleepless nights but it was worth it. I landed a job as a software developer in a great company actually and now I'm thinking. Then, I realize something I should've realized a long time ago. 

I have absolutely ZERO creativity.

I can understand almost any algorithm or problem given a good enough time but I realized I can never come up with an idea of my own. And tons of posts on reddit, Stack Overflow and research later I'm thinking maybe I'm better suited as a Networks guy.

I'm good at cyber security, and a very little (almost neglible) amount of hacking and I love just freaking LOVE to know how the web works. I don't understand half of the terminology yet but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to understand it given the proper preperation.

So I have a few options ahead of me now.

1 - Do the developer job which I also LOVE and just try to get better at it.

2 - Do the job, keep working on my other skill set and then choose. (Which I think is best but don't know how to do that)

3 - Don't do the job and concentrate a bit more on the other skill set and then choose one of the two paths. 
 But this would be tough because I'm close to broke and student loans in India are way too much and I think 20 years of education expenses is enough load on my parents who are super happy I finally have a job.

So what do you suggest ?

And hoping a CS professional in either or both fields might see it... What do both of them involve as we dive deeper ?

For reference, I am 22 and still have some years left for education but kinda hard because of the financial status.

PS : Sorry if the English was bad or if the post doesn't belong here. Thank you all in advance if you take time to advise m!"

I'm at a personal and professional juncture and would like to make a career change. I have a decent job as a technical jack-of-all-trades at a large government contractor - I make mid six figures, have the ability to work from home basically whenever, use a somewhat-modern tech stack and like my coworkers. On the flip side it's been a few years since I shipped any production software and I'm spread pretty thin... I work on no fewer than three efforts at any given time ranging from business development efforts to modernization death marches. I also would like to eventually get out of the government contracting space and have a ""real job"" where I use modern tools and cloud infrastructure, ship working software on the regular and don't have to worry about export control, classified data, and the usual headaches that come with the space I'm in now. Stats:

- Late 20s, no college degree (made it pretty far into a CS degree but dropped out to work full time)
- Boatload of agile and technical certifications (AWS, CompTIA, CSM, etc.)
- Traditional development and operational experience and have been working continuously ever since my first internship in high school... I can write full-stack web apps in a half dozen languages, stand up a dev environment, administer Linux boxes, troubleshoot firewall issues, and so forth. On paper I have fifteen years of IT/dev experience though only half of it is full-time.
- My interview/offer rate for government contracting jobs is 100% and I've gotten three such offers this year, but at this point I'm trying to optimize more for personal happiness and job satisfaction than money so I turned them down. My interview/offer rate for private companies is 60%. All jobs have been at a senior level except for one that was at a large startup.
- I interview very well (soft skills, technical discussions, live coding) but would definitely have to brush up on CS fundamentals and brain teaser-type questions since lots of companies seem to ask such questions judging by this sub.

TL;DR I have lots of professional experience and 70% of a college degree. Assuming my goal is to transition into an industry job as quickly as possible where should I invest my spare time? Are HackerRank/TripleByte-type sites the quickest way to get hired? Should I rejigger my resume and start shotgunning applications out while studying interview questions that I need to brush up on? Should I build a side project and list it on my resume? Or should I transfer my college credits and finish my degree up at an online school?

I very much appreciate any advice you all can offer. The only friends I have that don't work in the industry that I do work for FAANG-type companies and I'm not really interested in going that route (except for Netflix... I'd work for them in a heartbeat) so your all's input is very valuable. Thanks for reading!"

Finally got an offer and took it since it was close to graduation and I had no other options (maybe I could've just kept job searching idk). The big thing is: I graduated with a degree in Information Science and Tech and essentially no internships (my biggest regret). In my 4 years, I did no OOP software dev work. Just mostly simple python, HTML/CSS only webdev, game-dev and some NLP. At my school it was known as an easy-mode computer science major. Not that there is anything wrong with the major, but a wide curriculum lacking depth at my school. I know now I should have worked on personal projects during that time instead of playing video games, but I was dumb and here now.

I currently work for an IT consulting company as a software dev specializing in insurance software. The pay is decent (but quite below expectations) but enough to survive on my own. A big problem is for the past 5-6 months I've been working, I have done nothing for work as I have been under ""training"" and on the bench. Another problem is that we use software that essentially generates the code and drag-n-drop UI for the ""development."" I fear this will all hurt me in terms of gaining actual coding work experience and moving on to something better. But since I have had no real work to do at work, I have been using the time apply to other jobs, learning Java, leetcode, and working on personal projects when I have time. 

So, my question is: **should I go for my masters (which I wouldn't be able to start until 1.5 years from now if I am accepted) or focus my efforts in my personal projects and job searching?**

Some things to note: My current employer will not pay for it. I am not in favor of racking up debt, but I would be able to save enough money for it by then on my own, assuming I go to a non-popular state college. I don't have a huge interest in learning more about machine learning, or specialized field at the moment which is what I have read here is the primary reason to get a masters. **I would essentially be using the masters program to learn more about software dev, and take advantage of summer internship opportunities**. The thing is is that I would be putting a lot of attention onto the GRE and getting accepted into a program, while I could be focusing on projects and finding another job. It would also take 3.5 years to get accepted into masters and complete it vs. 3.5 years of potential industry experience. Additionally in case anyone says, do both since there would be a 1.5 year time gap for acceptance, I would not like to sacrifice my soul and burn out. But any advice and opinions are thankfully welcomed!"

e8165j,1,2019-12-08,How to calculate time complexity of this function?,Anthrax97,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/e8165j/how_to_calculate_time_complexity_of_this_function/,"I saw this problem in another post and wanted to give it a try.

&gt; During one of my coding interviews for a software engineering internship, they gave me this question:
&gt; 
&gt; There is s that consists of digits from 0 to 9, and an integer k. A substring s[L:R] (where 0 = L = R &lt; sizeof(s) ) is a contiguous group of characters with s.  A substring is called a perfect substring if all of its elements occur exactly k times. 
&gt; 
&gt; For example,  s = 1102021222 and k = 2. Its 6 perfect substrings are:
&gt; 
&gt;     s[0:1] = 11
&gt;     s[0:5] = 110202
&gt;     s[1:6] = 102021
&gt;     s[2:5] = 0202
&gt;     s[7:8] = 22
&gt;     s[8:9] = 22
&gt; 
&gt; Calculate the number of perfect substrings in s.
&gt; 
&gt; Function Description
&gt; 
&gt; Complete the function perfectSubstring in the editor below. The function must return an integer that represents the number of perfect substrings in the given string.
&gt; 
&gt; perfectSubstring has the following parameters:
&gt; 
&gt;     s: a string where the value of each element s[i] is described by the character at position i (where 0 = i &lt; n).
&gt; 
&gt;     k: an integer that denotes the required frequency of the substring.
&gt; I was able to compile a solution that was correct but it ended up having O(n3 ) complexity and would not compile very large solutions (the compiler they used would stop after a set period of time). I did not write down my exact solution but the general approach I took was get every substring of size k (starting at index 0), then looped through the substring to check if it was perfect. I would then do the same process every substring of size 2k, then 3k, and so on, then print the results found. The issue was this iterated through s in three separate for loops, which ended being super time consuming. What are some ways I could improve upon performance? I figure the best way to go would be to combine two of the above processes somehow, but I could not figure out how in the time I had.

Here is my solution:

    def perfect(s, k):
        l = 0
        r = k
        s_len = len(s) - 1
        perfect_subs = 0
        streak = False
        while l &lt; s_len:
            while r &lt;= s_len:
                sub = s[l:r]
                if streak:
                    count = sub.count(sub[len(sub) - 1])
                    if count &gt; k:
                        streak = False
                        break
                    if count == k:
                        perfect_subs += 1
                        print(sub)
                        r += 1
                    else:
                        r += 1
                else:
                    chars = set(sub)
                    if any(sub.count(i) &gt; k for i in chars):
                        break
                    if all(sub.count(i) == k for i in chars):
                        print(sub)
                        perfect_subs += 1
                        streak = True
                        r += 1
                    else:
                        r += 1
    
            l += 1
            r = l + k

Company A: located in my home city, offer runs Spring 2020 - Summer 2020. Industry is engineering design for power industry. Pay is $20 an hour. Very well established company. They design a lot of products/ devices so there would be great opportunity to learn many different things. The company is well touted and respected in this field, with a long historical standing. If I accept I will be working in Spring and Summer as well. 

Company B: located in a nearby city (few hours away), with this city having a significantly better lifestyle for a young person (rated one of the most desirable places to live in USA in 2019). Summer 2020 only. Industry is consulting engineering, working with the electrical group. Pay is $24 an hour + $1k relocation bonus + $500 stipend for food. The company is decently-respected (not as known as Company A) in the field. Small office, it seems like it would be easy to be fairly independent and on my own here. 

If I choose Company B, I will be in a whole new city so I must pay rent/ food/ utilities. Company A is in my home city so my expenses are paid at home. I've calculated it and including rent/ food, the salary is about the same, with Company A probably topping out to slightly more per hour after considering expenses. 

Now for location, Company B would be way better for a college student to live in, and would give me the opportunity to really be independent since I would be living in a whole new city by myself. Location B is very exciting with a huge college life, social scene, as well as out-doors scene. Location A has its perks (cheaper and good value for your buck) but is a boring, bland city with a weak outdoor scene (parks, lakes, rivers, etc) and I have lived there my entire life. Overall, I think Company A has a bigger name in our field (everyone in electrical engineering design/consulting knows this company).

e82ykw,9,2019-12-08,I don't like my current major but I am too scared to quit it.,alchemicalchemist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e82ykw/i_dont_like_my_current_major_but_i_am_too_scared/,"I am majoring in chemistry because that was the only major that was offered to me by only one university from all the 5 universities that I applied to because the 4 other universities rejected me. I was pretty dumb when I was in high school when it came to making decisions. I just sort of went with the flow. I never really had a clear picture of what I wanted to do. I was pretty good in the sciences and really really good at math and English. However, due to some personal reasons and some pretty big changes that happened to me in my senior year in high school, I really messed up my scores and basically got rid of any possibilities to get to choose what I wanted to study and only take whatever was offered. Only one university accepted me, and they offered me an alternative choice, in the physical sciences so I just went with. In retrospect, I should've turned it down and figured out my issues and maybe retaken some of the courses. 

University started and one semester into it, I knew I cannot build a future in just the sciences. Whatever I kept telling myself was to stop the panic from bubbling up and rationalize my situation because it was too late. It wasn't that I was performing poorly at the courses, I just wasn't happy. Throughout my first year, I got to know about other programs through talking to people and came to know about computer science and what people actually get to do with a degree in it. So I took a beginner course in it which were open to people from all majors and I just enjoyed it wildly, staying up late at night just having fun with the content. The other courses that I deeply enjoyed were calculus 1 &amp; 2. I scored the highest in only these 3 courses out of all the 10 courses I took that year. I should've realized then that I should change majors and take CS, but when I shared it with my parents, they told me to stick with the program I was in. I am not blaming them because I know that they are only looking out for me and don't want me to take a risk by taking CS and realizing in later years that I don't enjoy it. 

Ironically, that is what has ended up happening by sticking with the chemistry major. I have now finished my third year in Environmental Chemistry and I still hate it. I don't know what it is that I don't like, I just can't zero in on it, but I am just not happy no matter how much I try to convince myself that it is a good program. Sure, it is a good program but its just not for me. I even got an internship at a Pharma company, Sanofi, for a year which I started this year in May and will be done with next May. Working here has only made me realize that I am not fit for this kind of work. I am really really grateful to have received this opportunity however. I am able to earn money which I can use to pay off my school debt and network with people. However, having seen what people do here, I realized that I won't actually get to do chemistry even if I go through with my degree. And my GPA isn't too great to get into research. 

However, during this time, I decided to pursue my interest in computer science and math again. I took a few courses through Udemy  in the theory of computer science and linear algebra and for the first time in a while, I got really excited learning something. Things just made sense in a way, that I never felt when I was learning chemistry. It was just learning the logic behind why things were working the way they did that just made me feel really sublime. 

I won't drop out of university, I will finish my degree and get the [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) degree. However, I want to work in the field of computer science. I don't know in what field particularly but I just know that that is what I want to do. 

The reason why I am scared is because of lack of time and money. But mainly time. I cannot spend another 4 years, working towards another degree. Is there another way to get any form of certification? Something that will catch the eye of employers? Or is it just too late for me at this point? If I can just get a foot into the industry I know that I can make it. I am learning python as I found data science to be an interesting field and I would like to do something in that field. If anyone can suggest what I can do in this field that would be great as well. 

I thank you for taking the time to read through this long post! I would really appreciate any help!"

I cannot stay consistent in my work and attendance. 

I am diagnosed with depression and have been on Zoloft since August, and it worked great at first. In the past few weeks I increased my dose to 75 mg but it hasn't helped. 

I am supposed to graduate with my bachelor's this month, but I have missed so many classes and my assignments have mostly been turned in late or of really poor quality, even though I love what I do and have great ideas initially. I can't follow through and neglect all of my work that's due on days my depression hits and I can't bring myself to care enough to get out of bed and complete anything. I write lists of things that are due, write out a schedule, complete maybe a few days of it, then just completely stop because I don't care enough. 

 I dont think I can use any of my professors as job references when I graduate because I've been so inconsistent. I'm ashamed of the work i've turned in and how it reflects on me. 

I lack serious follow through and I don't know how to fix it. I'm not going to be able to hold a full time job like this, I can't even attend my classes 3x a week. I had an internship that I quit halfway through. Long story short, after talking with my school's career center I was allowed to get credit for it still because the work they were having me complete unpaid was illegal. They are no longer allowed to list their internships at my school. Despite this, I just got my eval from them and it's a 25/50. 

I feel so ashamed, I know I can and need to do better than this but I don't know how to care enough to stay consistent. I used to get great grades and great reviews from employers and now my work ethic and discipline is so inconsistent. 

Today I haven't gotten out of bed or eaten. I don't know what to do and I really need some advice on how to turn this around."
e83zip,2,2019-12-08,Dealing with Rude Behavior from a Student (3rd grade),myspacequeen,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/e83zip/dealing_with_rude_behavior_from_a_student_3rd/,"Hi everyone, long time lurker first-time poster.  
I’m currently in school studying early childhood education and will graduate in May.  I just finished up my internship in 3rd grade for the semester and had my first full teach week of 3rd grade this past week. It went fine enough, but on Monday and Tuesday, my most difficult student was beyond rude to me. On Monday she screamed at me because I had to ask her where she put her pre-assessment because I couldn’t find it and I really needed it. I asked her very politely and she immediately resorted to screaming at me. It caught me so off guard and my automatic reaction was to get my mentor and let her know what happened. On Tuesday she really tried to intimidate me and cop an attitude with me. Why? Because my mentor asked me to work with her and some other students on the carpet during writing time so that they’d stay on task. She eventually begrudgingly came to work with me and kept saying “I heard you talking about me with Ms. X, you’re so \[mean\]” or something nasty like that because she said it quietly and wouldn’t say it again when I asked her to repeat what she said. She eventually brought it up again that I was ‘talking about her’ and snapped at me and said: “I know you did so don’t even try to lie to me.” I feel like I should’ve dealt with it differently because I think I’m too nice and explained that I wasn’t talking about her I just agreed to work with her on the carpet. She finally cut the attitude when I told her “I need you to listen to me- I really care about you and I like working with you and I don’t understand why you’re acting like this.”  
I told my mentors the day after and they both said if it happens again I need to take her out in the hallway and be very firm with her and let her know she can’t talk to me like that and that she can’t be disrespectful. I don’t know why but I feel like as of now, I’m way too nervous to do this. But I don’t want her to walk all over me (I don’t think she is but I think I’m being too kind in my current approach).  From the very start, I've gone out of my way to form a strong relationship with her and show her kindness because my mentor let me know she is one of the more difficult students and I know she does like me so it was incredibly upsetting when she was rude to me this past week.

Sorry for the novel but my main question is: How do you become comfortable with addressing rude/difficult students? I feel really scared to be firm and put her in her place. I’d also like to add that she acts this way to everyone and often tells other kids to shut up and will shove past them in the hallway.  I think it scares me because I’m not an official teacher yet and because I’ve never had to deal with something like this before. I'll be back in the same 3rd-grade classroom from January - March and need to have some strategies I can use if this were to happen again with her (or any student for that matter).  3rd grade is scary and I miss last year when I was placed in Kindergarten haha."

I feel university focuses more on the theory such as mathematical proofs, which I had to take in the first and second year, math (had to take a whole year of calculus, linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and statistics. It seems that I know a lot more theory and concepts that my college friends but my programming skills are pretty horrible. I take longer to code simple tasks and my debugging skills aren't very good either. I have to apply for internships this year but I'm really lacking personal projects. The only advantage I have is that I go to the best school in the country, but I'm sure if an employer had to pick between a college student with projects and u university student without any, he would pick the former. With school and my part-time job I'm finding it pretty difficult to find time to build any projects or learn more languages.

I'm looking to apply for an internship related to cybersecurity however I don't have much experience when it comes to programming any security tools/programs. I've taken an introduction to security course but there wasn't a lot of coding involved, mainly just bash scripts that served as brute force tools or kernel programming to make rootkits. The rest of the course involved a lot of theories, concepts, and readings. I want something to help me put my foot in the field. I was thinking of developing a login application of some sort that stored hashed passwords and could check credentials but I'm not sure if that's too trivial. Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm in my 3rd year and I can code in Java, Python, and C. I don't have that much experience with javascript but I do know the difference between safe and unsafe js code, exp. No input sanitization, the opportunity for code injection etc. I don't really have the time to learn more tools or programming languages at the moment with school going on and I'm hoping to build something over the winter break (2 weeks). Any suggestions would be great! Thankyou."

I have a pretty solid background with an internship at a Fortune 100 company last summer developing a full stack app and have recently been offered to work at Motorola. With those sets of experiences plus doing well in school I'm optimistic about finding a full time job next fall. However, lately I have reading into being a teaching assistant and have been seeing a lot of people on LinkedIn who don't have much previous technical experience, and then TA for a computer science class, and get jobs at huge companies (Amazon, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc) following that. I have the opportunity to TA a mid level CS class next semester, and really enjoy teaching and helping people will basic programming. Plus it would add more soft skills and management experience on my resume, but I don't know if it's worth the time and effort to commit to. Has anyone had experience as a teaching assistant for a freshmen/sophomore computer science course and had any large benefits from it? And is there anything else that you would recommend me doing to help portray my soft skills?"

I was planning on making him a gift, but he outgifted me by making me one today (a book I've heard a lot about on dev.to and Reddit, ""The Pragmatic Programmer""), so now I must definitely repay him !

e89m7f,65,2019-12-09,So many hobbies...What to do for a living?,throwaway_9122019,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/e89m7f/so_many_hobbieswhat_to_do_for_a_living/,"Hi everyone.

I'm 24M from a small european country.

I got my major in computer science last year and already have a job related to my major. But I'm not happy with my job right now...

I have also done an internship + some other jobs  both related and unrelated to my major so I have some experience and can compare different working environments/people/tasks etc.

Now I mentioned that I have lots of hobbies. These are:

computers (programming,Linux, video game design, computer security)

photography (photo and video shooting and production/editing)

music (I play guitar and bass(been to bands in the past and also do some audio production/sound designer things)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the thing is that while I do enjoy all of the activies above, I can easily say that I'm not an expert in most of these.

Sure I am well above a beginner's level but I do know that I'm at best intermediate level at these things.

&amp;#x200B;

Computers have always been a hobby for me. I could sit for hours and learn new things at my own pace without feeling tired and while enjoying myself.I think that's the hobby where I could say I have tons of general (and advanced) knowledge on lots of topics. But I'm not an expert in any computer topic (but I am very advanced in some e.g. Linux)

Unfortunately I do not seem to enjoy myself with computer related jobs at all when I work for other people.

I also dislike very much the fact that people with my computer skills are paid a very low salary in my country (I could work as a waiter and make almost the same ammount of money with the tips).

&amp;#x200B;

I like doing photography but I never was able to really shine on platforms like instagram etc and that discourages me. (lack of self-promotional skills)

&amp;#x200B;

I like playing/recording music but I know that I'm not the best musician in the world and feel like I will never catch up with the best of the players I listen to. (+lack of self-promotional skills)

&amp;#x200B;

Based on all the info provided above is there any job/carreer you could recommend for me to follow?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is some extra stuff about me:

&amp;#x200B;

One good thing about me is that I can really quickly grasp and learn some new concept. But after that I kinda struggle to exercise more and focus on to mastering it.

One con of me is that I simply lack the skills to promote myself in general. I'm always shy and quiet and rarely express my opinion/knowledge in public.

&amp;#x200B;

The things I always hated is having to get up early, get stuck in commute, have my stupid manager/supervisor and do what we ask the way we tell you, not being able to eat/talk to phone/or simply slack off without having this constant stressful thought of being watched by another coworker or supervisor.

It's only the times that I get to do things my way that I feel somewhat creative while working....but that's rare...because most of the time I'm not even interested in what I am asked to do at my work.

&amp;#x200B;

I love spending my free time doing my hobbies or reading/viewing videos about them.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really love to have a 'creative' work that I feel ""free"" and that I don't have to work the typical 8hour+ workday. Working from home is also a plus.

I do still live with my parents (I set money aside for the time being).

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me out find something that I will enjoy doing and that will pay my bills as well. I really want to quit my current job as it puts so much stress on me.

Looking forward for your advice.

TL;DR; I love computers,photography,music help me find a 'creative' job that would not be your typical 8hour job.

EDIT: Thank you so much for your replies! Really means a lot to me that you read through all of this!   
Also forgot to mention that I am self taught in both music and photography (and when I started with computers as well)."

e8a8or,0,2019-12-09,Korean American wanting to work in cs after college in Korea,mohaye,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e8a8or/korean_american_wanting_to_work_in_cs_after/,"So I am a korean american currently living in california. I attend UCI for computer science (top 100 in the times if that matters at all, probably not tho). And I am currently a second year. I came to the us when I was 6 years old with my family. I also have an american citizenship now so I dont have to serve the military. There are many reasons why I want to work in korea. This doesn't mean that I want to live there permanently, but I would like to at least live and work for 2-3 years before deciding whether to move back. I want to work right after college, and at the moment I only have a highschool internship at boeing that I did as a 3rd year for the computer science students at my highschool (program to interivew everyone and choose the top 3 to go to boeing and meet up with other students from other highschools). I plan on looking for internships for my 3rd year summer in college so I have something on my resume at least. The main reason why I want to put myself out there and work in korea is: I just love the culture there and even though my pay in US will be cut in half, I'm still willing to work there as long as I am happy doing what I do and living where I am. I don't want to strive to work on big companies like Samsung, LG, Facebook, Daum, Navar or even Kakao. I would ideally like to work on big and upcoming startups because I know and heard that there are multiple apps in korea that recruit programmers whether foreign or native and that those companies are good. (example is 배달의 민족, its a food delivery app thats popular. apps similar to these if that makes sense). I'm fluent in english and korean. But not fluent enough in korean to give a business presentation in front of like a meeting at a company. I took korean school when I came at 6 until i was in 8th grade. So I have no problem communicating with family or friends. I am much more comfortable talking casually with friends and I would say I'm really good communicating if its casually and with people for fun, because this past summer when I visited korea I had no problem having fun with native friends there. However it still is a problem because if I am looking for a tech job it will hold me back. I am also planning on going to study abrod there in a year or two for a semester, so I can truly see how it is and whether I like it or not. But for job/cs career, what do you guys think? I know everyone says us is 100% better programmers, which I 100% agree. But I'm willing to work there just so I can be happy doing what I want to do. Because I thought about living a suburb life in california with a comfortable cs salary, and I realized it isn't for me. I would much rather work in a city-life environment where everyone is around and doing something. Makes the daily life much more ""busy"" and exciting. However New york or la or san fran isnt for me because I'm not used to the ""american"" style vs the ""korean"" style of cities. Even though this post may sound me just talking about how great korea is, I know myself how bad the work style is and what I will be getting myself into. But disregarding all that, what are your guys' opinions/advice and maybe me working in korea? Is it viable? Is it something I can actually do and not have to move back to america after 2-3 years and realizing I probably wasted 2-3 years? Thank you"

I'm currently looking into becoming a private investigator, and the school I went to for my Class D security license offers online courses.

http://www.s2institute.com/content/cep/flpiprogram.php

from what I spoke of them, this is currently the only available option right now, which I don't mind.

my question being is, what else is required in order to get my license?

I know that doing the intern training will prepare me for a CC intern license, which I would then have to find someone to sponsor me for my C license.

I also know that a degree would help but isn't required, but I would like to work towards getting one while I work.

is there anything else I would need before applying for intern training?

also how would I go about on finding a license holder to sponsor?"

I got my first job as a developer in a start up after my master degrees and I feel blue after 2 months in because I think i'm a waste of time for them ... .

I feel like I'm same with an intern, they put me on a new project and they come to check my progress on the project and tell me what to do and how to do.

Every time I push something on our git repository few hours later the CTO will optimize or refactor every line I wrote make me feel stupid or not good enough for this job ... . Sometimes the CTO does that on week end making me feel more shame because I think he wasted his free time because of me ... .

I really like this start up and my team this is why I care about my code quality and what they think about my skills. I really wanted to be a good a developer and maybe in the future wrote some library or other cool stuff with my coworkers but it's seems like my credibility as a developer is already over.

Because of this I have less time to spend on my side project because I work hard until late night for trying to give the best of myself but it's justa failure ... .

Does some people already experimented this ?"

e8bltx,149,2019-12-09,I am riddled with anxiety every day because I’m scared of getting fired again. What do I do?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e8bltx/i_am_riddled_with_anxiety_every_day_because_im/,"It’s almost all I think about any day. The littlest things will make me anxious. Some back story:

I’m a front end web developer. I live in a medium sized city, about 2 hours from a major US city. I’ve been fired from my last 3 jobs and it has riddled me with anxiety. 

1. When I graduated high school, I got a job at a small agency as a developer. I was their first employee, and at 18 that was a lot to handle because immediately i was made everyone’s “superior” that they hired after me. I managed the sales team and dev team. We hired an intern who’s uncle was extremely wealthy. She had a horrible attitude problem and made working with her not fun. After multiple complaints and attempts to talk to her as well as stress from missing a deadline, I eventually snapped and yelled at her. I didn’t swear at her, just yelled. She was so offended by it she complained to the owner and threatened to quit and I then got “laid off” to “protect the company” from her scary uncle. 

2. I was burnt out from the headache that job was and went into IT. I got a job at a local hospital and got fired for being on my phone too much. What was funny was that I was not on my phone any more than anyone else was, in fact we really didn’t have much to do other than be on our phones, but being 19 for whatever reason I was singled out. I will take the blame on that as I shouldn’t have been on my phone at work.

3. Worked at a fortune 50 company in IT. Worked there for 3 months and was fired. Absolutely no idea why. At that point, I was so scared of getting fired I just simply went into work, did my job, and left. My job was in a call center answering IT phone calls. Everyone I closely worked with liked me, never had an issue with anyone. One day on a Thursday I went in, my badge didn’t work, and all my stuff was in a box. They refused to tell me why and to this day I have no idea why I got fired. 

Today, I moved to this new city and am a developer again. I work at another agency and it’s a good job. I like the people I work with. I want to start my own agency one day and this is a great opportunity for me to learn more about how bigger agencies operate. 

However, this agency is going through some “growing pains”. They’ve fired 4 people in the 2 months I’ve been there including the person I replaced. This is not a good feeling. I get super anxious all the time. All day I am riddled with anxiety. It hasn’t gotten to the point where it effects my performance, but I’m terrified I’m doing something wrong always. If my boss messages me in a weird way I freak out. Today I swear she was acting weird and it had freaked me out. I know they will continually bullshit me and act like it’s fine until they fire me because the girl they fired on Friday didn’t even know it was coming. I’ve made attempts to check in and ask how things are and they say i’m doing great but I don’t believe them. The last 2 jobs I had management said how awesome I was doing and then they fired me days or weeks later. 

This is not healthy but I don’t know what to do. I can’t keep sitting here with this much anxiety because i’m scared to get fired. I don’t have any savings because every time I get fired I have to drain whatever savings I have to not be homeless. I finally have paid down the majority of my credit card debt but the idea of having 0 savings and no other income is scary. I don’t know what to do. This whole firing people is a huge red flag."
e8c12a,47,2019-12-09,I met my parent's expectations and I'm still not happy.,atnwin,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/e8c12a/i_met_my_parents_expectations_and_im_still_not/,"There is no light at the end of the tunnel. My immigrant father had always expected more from me. Being valedictorian and having a full-ride scholarship to college wasn't enough since the school wasn't an ivy league. I moved across the country to NY to escape that AP household. The pressure of internships and grades was so overwhelming that I was hospitalized multiple times and even took a semester off. But it didn't matter to my dad, he still held me to the same standard as anyone else and expected I get a well paying job after college. And well paying meant top 10%.

I was senior in college studying computer science when I finally landed a job offer in consulting with an 80k salary which is well above the average annual household income of 50-65k. It still wasn't enough for him. I was still compared to someone else's child who was making 130k. Whenever my dad ran out of people to compare me to, he would always compare me to someone older, someone I can't really compete with. He was disappointed I didn't work for a large technology firm and asked why I didn't do that. Did he think it was a choice where I could just walk into Google? He just couldn't be happy for me. 

5 months after graduating I actually did it. I received a job offer from Amazon as a software engineer with total compensation of 150k. He was happier than I was when I told him and he was excited about how in high school I ""beat everyone"" and now I'm also ""beating everyone"" back home.  I was so angry after the call because I didn't get this job to show off to everyone else but to have a financially stable future. He was happier about bragging to other parents instead of my wellbeing. He was happy for himself, not for me.

It's a rat race. There's always something more these parents will expect out of you. Often times I wouldn't meet those expectations and hate myself, and the few times I did meet them I was still disappointed. More than anything, I just wanted him to be happy for me and the decisions I made in life. Over 22 years, I learned meeting his expectations isn't the way to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone could shed advice, I'd really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Meeting dad's expectations won't make you happy in the end."

I'm wondering what other certification will be good with that on my resume. I've been looking at the MTA 98-349, but I feel like the google cert will be too similar and it would be redundant. I've been looking at possibly the MS-900/MD-100 &amp; MD-101 certs as well. I'm not sure if those would be too redundant or not.


I want to be more well rounded, and I'm currently interested in powershell, the cloud, Windows (server + desktop), and not opposed to learning linux if its in demand. Where should I focus in order to become well-rounded and get a job as soon as I graduate?

I’m kinda confused tho bc most of the internship positions I applied to seemed like they cared more about you knowing object oriented languages as opposed to front end technologies.

e8dsf3,3,2019-12-09,"Don't like my job, but, got an offer from public sector. Take it?",projectblur,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e8dsf3/dont_like_my_job_but_got_an_offer_from_public/,"Background info: I'm currently a college senior graduating in 2 weeks as computer science major. I'm graduating with no debt and with 10k saved.

Ever since I was a freshman, I knew that I wanted to be a programmer. So, last year I took on intern web developer position at public sector agency. The pay is ridiculously well ($24 hr), they were really flexible with my schedule 20 hours school - 20 hours internship, a lot of technologies they were using were pretty outdated, so I revamped majority of their infrastructure. Last week I was offered a full time position at 68k a year, which isn't much taking into account the city that I live in. Along with 2 weeks vacation, 10 paid federal holidays, and medical care package.

Now here is the problem. I have always wanted to move out of my city and move elsewhere, I thought that after my internship concludes, I would pack my stuff apply to jobs and move. I feel like my potential is being held back due to bureaucracy of public sector, many great ideas that me or my colleagues proposed have been rejected by high management, and I don't see room for self growth. Additionally, I have come to realize that I hate coding, I can do the job, but, I simply don't like it. I really want to take on a position within product design or digital marketing, but I'm not sure if companies are willing to train a web developer to perform those duties. My father who is also in tech tells me to stay with the agency for another year or two, for the sake of experience.

I was given time till the end of the year to give in an answer. What are your tips given my situation?"

I’m in Tampa, FL and making $60K salaried a year, which seems pretty standard for the area. My GPA was pretty rough and I had no internships, so I’m happy with where I’m starting. However, my personal goal is to be making at least $100K by the time I’m 30. I turned 24 last week, so I’m hoping that this is reasonable. I was hoping for any advice on how to grow my skills towards this goal. Staying in the area is important to me, so moving to a higher COL area for a higher salary isn’t something I’m looking to do in the future.

To give y’all some relevant information, I’m doing mainly Angular and Spring currently, with a fairly reputable company in the business world. I don’t know anything about the skills employers look for, as this was my first and only interview. However, I’m enjoying both and would be happy to continue with either or both in the future. If any other information would be helpful, please let me know, and thank you for any advice!"

I got 3.88 weighted and 3.73 unweighted GPA, 1370 SAT (720 math 650 reading) 29 ACT

For work experience I had an internship last summer at an engineering business (200+ hours) and I tutor students at my school who struggle with math (1.5 years)

I have been a part of a charity that helps student-athletes who were injured pay their medical bills. I’m a director and have been a part of it for 2 years (80+ hours)

My house income is high enough to not give me any boost for chances of getting in, and I go to an academically prestigious high school in California (same state as Cal Poly and UCSB)

My stats aren’t amazing but aren’t bad, everyone I know who is applying to the same schools as I am have much higher stats than me so I’m curious where I stand. I appreciate any suggestions, thanks!"

Also, I'd heard that this program favoured minorities : as a south American woman, I thought that helped too. But nahh.  Edit: I am not implying here that because I am a minority that I would automatically get in, but simply that it would help, alongside the rest of my application, as per their little disclaimer that encouraged minorities to apply.

I was wondering if some of you had a couple minutes to quickly glance at my cv and tell me what i can improve on it and what type of experience I can add for next year (ie: make an app, get a more technical internship since both of mine were at research labs, etc).

e8h1bb,0,2019-12-09,"Advice for explaining my ""bad"" grades to prospective grad programs?",jambi55,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/e8h1bb/advice_for_explaining_my_bad_grades_to/,"I finished my undergrad degree with a 3.56. Which isn't horrible, but my Major GPA is more like a 3.2 (In Biology).

I have a few Bs, a couple C+s, and several classes I had to retake multiple times. 

I often see ppl giving advice to prospective graduate applicants about being able to explain your bad grades with honest reasons on why you had a bad semester. But how do I do this if my ""bad"" grades are scattered around my degree, so I can't really chalk it up to just one bad semester?

The honest reasons for my grades are:

1) It was a STEM degree, which I had a rough time adjusting to after transitioning from Film.

2) I'm pretty sure I was depressed for a good part of my undergrad career

3) It took me 6 years to figure out a major and get my degree, and I was very burnt out by that point

4) I really didn't know what I wanted to do with my degree, so I was frustrated and felt like I didn't have a direction. This often made me feel apathetic towards my coursework, even my core classes.

I know a lot of these sound like excuses. That's why I'm not sure how to present them to a potential grad program interview/application. I'm smarter than my GPA reflects, and I know I eventually want to get a PhD (Not sure in what yet, but I think I'd like to be in research and academia). 

I am a perfectionist, and my less than stellar GPA is frustrating me. I really just don't want it to be a barrier going forward in my studies.

I have some internships under my belt, hoping to get research experience, and I'm studying hard to get an above average GRE score. 

What else can I do to tell grad programs that I'm a good candidate, despite not having the best grades in my core classes? Am I getting stressed over nothing, or should I be doing more to prove I would be a worthy applicant?"

[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/du9w81/i_kill_monsters_for_an_interdimensional/)

...We’ve got to stop meeting like this.

I was planning to get this part out rapidly, but here I am, late again. Funny how I have enough work ethic to slaughter monsters for a living but not provide regular updates.

Anyways, I’ve decided that I’d like to change directions somewhat with the type of stories I recount here. The past three have all been about the contracts I receive and how I go about them, but that’s far from the only thing I’ve done in this line of work.

I think there’s plenty of interesting stories to tell outside of the actual killing job itself, so let me elaborate and give you a better glimpse into what my working life consists of.

Just as a side note, I did get that meeting with Boss I mentioned at the end of the last part, and it went superbly! He was so appreciative that I was able to complete my tasks despite being given such lackluster information on my targets that he gave me a couple of weeks off of work to sort through and iron out the issues with the reports he was giving me.

I desperately wanted to voice my opinions and tell him that a mandatory vacation won’t be necessary, but I know better than to try and talk back to Boss.

At that point in my life, I dedicated myself entirely to fulfilling contracts and doing schoolwork.

I don’t really have any hobbies or interests to speak of, they’re nothing more than a waste of my time. I used to be a big reader, but ever since I got employed reading reminds me too much of work for me to enjoy it.

It’s hard to get engrossed in a book when you can hear the guttural shrieks of agony and the hissing of my disintegration ability replayed over and over again in your head. Not that I’m really complaining, though. I have all the time in the world to get my job done and make Boss proud, which is all I could really ask for.

I didn’t want to spend a few weeks sleeping until this vacation is over, so I tried to drive around and find somewhere to occupy my time.

I don’t live near many places for young guys like me to hang out, but I tried anyway.

Needless to say, it was a monumental failure.

I found going to the cinema a pricy chore that ultimately left me unsatisfied and annoyed at the lackluster customer service when I bought a bag of popcorn and my drink.

Once I left the theater, I just decided to drive around the town until my gas ran low so I could burn time. It wasn’t a very fun way to spend the day, but it beats being cooped up at home.

I couldn’t help but feel annoyed that this forced sabbatical was taking away from my critically important duty of killing the things that go bump in the night. I know I sound like a broken record, but I still trusted what Boss has planned for me, so I did my best to take it all in stride and come back to work better than ever.

Or, at least that was my game plan. I’ll admit, I didn’t follow my own advice for the first couple of days.

My rigorous workout routine waxed, and my normally airtight diet was gone in the wind, with cheap burgers and gas station hot dogs filling the void it left inside me. As you could imagine, I was completely miserable. Days and days without working made me realize just how meaningless life can get when you don’t have a purpose. If I’m not able to do my job, then what’s the point? That’s all there is to my name, and that’s all there will ever be. I know that sounds grim, but it's the honest truth.

I was like this for maybe a week or two, and it was one of the toughest weeks I’ve had in a while.

Thankfully, I was able to get out of this depressing funk, but not in the way I would ever expect.

It happened around halfway through this sabbatical, and I was feeling as miserable as can be.

I was at a gas station in god knows where, casually pumping gas into my car, snacking on a gas station deli sandwich. It tasted more like rubber than the ham and cheese it was supposed to, but I was long past the point of caring what my food tasted like.

Had it not been for the chilly wind, I might’ve just fallen asleep right then and there. I loved my spiffy army jacket, but it was by no means a warm coat, and the wind cut through my layers like a knife.

Just as the nozzle clicked and stopped pumping gas, I heard the doors of the mart beep open and shut with an electronic click.

Two people exited the mart, one of which, a female, was holding a dark backpack, presumably chock-full of items purchased from the mart.

They both looked at me pumping my gas and strode towards me, looking like they were going to interrogate me for something.

The girl carrying the bag had her hair dyed an eye-searing shade of minty green, which made it hard to focus on the expression she had when she came towards me.

The other figure, a dark-skinned youthful man, had his hands shoved into his worn bright orange puffer jacket pockets, smiling a cocky grin like he was remembering some type of inside joke I wasn’t aware of.

Already I could tell I wasn’t going to like whatever conversation we were going to have. Even before I started working I never really lived for social interaction, I preferred my own company instead. It doesn’t help that I was already in a sour mood to begin with.

“Hey, can we talk for a bit, mate?” Asked the male, his thick British accent making itself apparent.

I closed my fuel door and faced them both, finishing my sandwich with a final, clumsy bite.

“Sure, what’s up.” I said, trying to sound disinterested and dry, hoping he would take the hint and leave me alone.

He motioned to the girl beside him, and she dug out a leather journal from the giant backpack, and my ears perked up in curiosity.

As much as I wish it was, I knew that that journal wasn’t just any nice-looking journal, it was a special one given by Boss to his employees. It looks just like any other, but something in my brain just screamed “*This is my journal. There are many others like it, but this is mine.*” The contents inside were a list of every proxy he hired in ‘this area.’ he said, presumably meaning Canada. I never bothered to ask whether ‘this area’ actually meant out the country or not, but I feel like I knew what he was implying. It wasn’t a small book, either. There was a fair amount of pages on it, so clearly Boss has a preference in who he hires.

The most concerning part of that reveal was trying to figure out how he got his hands on that journal. The easy explanation would be that he’s a fellow employee, but I just wasn’t totally convinced he was. He and the girl beside him lacked the professional &amp; dangerous aura I had come to expect from someone in my line of work.

Up until that point, I hadn’t actually met any co-workers, so I was less than impressed with what I saw.

The man dressed in orange flipped through the book casually, skipping every page until he reached one of the very last pages at the end of the book, then turned it around and showed me the pages, where I saw my own name written in full.

“This is you, right? You’re Jaime Spears?” He asked, exhaling a thick cloud of smoke from the crisp winter air.

There are a few things I regret doing when I first agreed to become a proxy killer, and signing my full name to Boss was one of them. I could’ve just as easily told him some random nickname and gotten the job all the same, but I didn’t think ahead and signed with my real name, meaning that anyone can find me pretty easily, co-worker or not.

“Who’s asking?” I responded, trying to cover my freezing lips with my jacket.

The man smiled and handed the book back over to the green-haired girl, who shoved it back inside the bag.

“Hey, don’t worry about it, mate. I’m a proxy, just like you. We’ve been working for Boss for a couple of years now. You can call me Orion.” He said, dusting off the shoulder of his coat.

I didn’t initially recognize that name from my leather booklet, but afterward, I did end up checking it and sure enough, both he and the girl beside him were right there on the pages. Both were listed with a first name only, which means I had to accept they were more prepared than I was when they first signed up.

“Shit, I forgot the Doritos. Don’t tell him anything yet, I’ll be back in a second.” The green-hair girl said, marching back into the shop to grab what she was apparently missing.

*Was a bag of nacho chips really worth holding off this conversation?* I thought to myself, feeling a little peeved that I had to wait even longer to get this conversation over.

“That’s Amera, my roommate, and proxy partner. She’s kinda scatterbrained, but she’s a hard worker.” Orion said, smiling brightly.

Abandoning us for Doritos didn’t give me the strongest impression, but whatever. I just had to take his word for it.

I stood there and shivered in the cold, but Orion looked completely calm like the frosty breeze wasn’t even there.

“So, how long you been working?” He asked me quietly, briefly eyeing around the gas station, checking for anyone else that could be around us.

“A couple of months.” I said dryly. I didn’t bother asking him the same question because I really didn’t care.

Unfortunately, he didn’t seem to take the hint and continued to talk anyway.

“I knew you were a rookie, but I didn’t think you were *that* new!” He said, sounding like he was vaguely mocking me.

“I’ve been doing jobs for Boss for a couple of years now, but I’ve hardly got any action compared to the others. Hell, I’ve gone on like 1 mission in the last month! And even on those monthly missions, I barely have to try! I just get in and get out!” He said, laughing with a low, throaty chuckle.

*One* mission in a month. Had I still been eating my gas station sandwich I might’ve dropped it out of shock. How in god's name this clown was getting by with such a low amount of hits was

“You go on 1 mission a month? I’ve been doing them bi-weekly at the worst of times, and weekly on busier times. Why would Boss even hire you in the first place?” I stated, hoping to make myself sound mean and get him to start taking his job more seriously.

From what little he said to me, I believe that he isn’t really putting his 100% in it like I was, and I feel that I need to give him a metaphorical kick in the pants to stop him from being lazy.

Orion’s smile dropped off his face and he shot me an expression that was confusion, anger, and curiosity all at once. His eyes squinted and his forehead furrowed.

“Have you been taking our hits?” He said, sounding deadly quiet.

I have no real way to confirm or deny his suspicion, so I was in a tight spot. I’ve never seen or heard of him or Amera before, so I was doubtful.

Before I could give any answer, Amera rushed out of the store, tightly clutching the straps of her backpack.

“Okay, I got everything we need! Now we can talk!” She said, huffing and puffing like she was out of breath.

Orion and I exchanged an uneasy look with each other, but we kept our mouths shut. I already knew he didn’t like me, but that’s not my concern. If Boss has him doing a monthly task in my area compared to my countless tasks, then I struggle to see him as anything other than some mook-a proxy intern if you will. I could tell that his expression was saying *“We’ll talk about this later.”*, and I tried giving him the same message.

Amera noticed us pointing daggers at each other and spoke up.

“C’mon, I was there for like 5 minutes! Have you guys not made *any* small talk?” She questioned, a sly grin stretching across her face.

“Was buying chips really more important than this?” I asked her, looking for a way out of staring at Orion.

She looked at me confused.

“...Buy?” She said, raising an eyebrow at me.

“Did you not go to the store to buy chips?”

She licked her lips for a few seconds, then her eyes lit up.“Ohh, that’s what you meant! No, I stole this.” She said casually, and my breath caught in my throat.

First, they tell me they work once a month and now they’re stealing food from gas stations? With every passing second, I continued to wonder how these two even got hired in the first place. Boss specifically said to me that he’s looking for positive qualities in his employees, which neither of these two had.

“Why are you stealing from a gas station? How do you expect to react when they catch you in the act?” I scolded her, sounding more like a cop than I really intended to.

She lazily shrugged her shoulders.

“Trust me, I’m not getting caught anytime soon.” She said with a wink, nudging her arm to Orion, who couldn’t help but chuckle.

“Yeah, we’re pretty good at our job. Stealing, that is.” He elaborated.

I wanted to say something about their theft habit, but at this point, I had more important conversation topics to dredge through.

“So, what’s up? Why did you two want to talk to me?” I asked them.

“Well, we’re trying to really branch out and meet our fellow co-workers! We’ve been employed for like 3 years now and we’ve only gotten to see a handful of hits. Now that we both have more free time than ever, we can finally do that! Mind if we ask you some questions?” Orion said, sounding excited.

I wasn’t really sure what I was expecting, but an interview wasn’t very high on my imaginary list of my first encounters with my co-workers.

“Sure, I guess. Ask away.” I said nonchalantly.

Orion and Amera shared an excited look, but that quickly faded and turned into one of concern.

“Can we ask for a favor from you?” Amera asked, eyes glued to the ground.

I nodded my head, preparing to accommodate whatever they asked.

“Do..you mind if we bum a ride off of you?” She asked sheepishly, rocking from side to side like her request was particularly embarrassing for her to say.

At first, I was a bit confused because I assumed they drove here on their own, but the gas station was devoid of any cars other than my own.

“You don’t have a car? Did you two walk the whole way here?” I asked, struggling not to laugh over the idea of the two of them walking for god knows how long just to reach a gas station.

Amera’s face flushed and she somehow looked more sheepish and shy than before.

“Stop laughing! It’s cold out here and Orion won’t share any of his powers with me! Please just give us a ride!” She squeaked, hugging herself to try and conceal some level of warmth.

I’ll be honest, talking to these two made me forget they most likely had superpowers in the same way I did. They just seemed..too normal to have them. They didn’t *feel* like proxies to me. Even now I struggle to see Boss choosing them and granting them their own abilities.

Orion’s grin grew wider and he scratched his short curly black hair.

“You know more than anyone that my powers only work through contact! All you had to do was ask me to hug you for it to work.” He said, stretching his arms out wide like he was bracing for when she jumped into his arms to activate his powers, whatever they may be.

“N-no! Stop suggesting lewd things like that.” Amera mumbled, trying to hide her blushing face underneath her black sweater.

“Alright, fine. Get in the car and tell me where you want me to drop you off.” I said, sounding defeated.

Orion shot me a thumbs up and they both walked towards my car, and we all hopped in. Orion leaped into the passenger seat and Amera flopped down on the back seats.

We all buckled up and I entered the location Orion gave me into my GPS and started following the path laid out for me, eager to drop these two off and hopefully never have to speak to them again. Obviously they aren’t as annoying as the creatures I’m tasked to kill on a regular basis, but my antisocial nature was screaming at me to avoid these two.

The address they gave me was an apartment complex situated maybe 20 minutes via drive, which makes the fact that they walked here all the more amusing.

For the first couple of seconds, we all sat in silence, listening to the sounds of my car’s well-worn engine buckling in the snowy roads. It was a surreal type of quiet outside, where no animals dared to make a sound to interrupt the ominous emptiness of the world around us.

Not a single streetlight was present, and no trees stood by us. It was just completely flat snow-covered land surrounding us. I may have been in the car with two other people, but I felt completely alone.

“You mind turning on the radio or something? It’s kinda awkward without something to listen to.” Orion requested.

“No can do, radio’s broken. I have a couple of CDs in my console if you want to choose one.” I suggested.

Most of my CDs were worn old alternative rock bands that kids used to listen to back in the early 2000s. I have no idea what Orion’s music taste is, but it wouldn't surprise me if he turned off a *Blink 182* album.

After a few seconds of flipping through CD cases, he huffed and slammed the console shut.

“Since your music taste is complete garbage, let’s just cut to the chase, okay?” He said, a clear undertone of annoyance in his voice.

Normally I’d try and refute someone disrespecting my music taste, but I really couldn't be bothered to care anymore.

“Sure, whatever. Ask away.”

Orion licked his lips and cleared his throat.

“How did you first get hired as a proxy?” He questioned.

“Summer school.” I said off-handedly, not fully registering the question.

Once he gave me a perplexed glance, I knew I had to elaborate.

“I went to class and it was being overrun by a bunch of monster escapees from Pandemonium. Boss scouted me and hired me based on a bunch of favorable qualities he said he saw in me. Bravery, heroism, etc. Since then, I’ve been working for him. How’s that?”

I was expecting him to be satisfied, but both he and Amera had a look of concern on their faces.

“Jesus, during school? I knew Boss liked to hire young faces, but I didn’t think he’d go that young..” Orion mumbled, sounding deeply troubled.

“Young? I’m 17, and that’s hardly young at all. How old are you two?” I asked.

“20.” They said together.

“Don’t mind him, we’re just not used to working with *kids*.” Amera remarked, and Orion muffled a chuckle.

“Who are you calling kid? I’m like, only a couple of years younger than you. And besides, this ‘kid’ gets more contracts than both of you combined.” I said, hoping that statement stung them both.

Amera was laughing in the back, but Orion gave me a hard sneer.

“Watch your mouth, *pretty boy*. We’ve been in this business longer than you have.” He said, his grin revealing his bright white teeth. He didn’t sound all that upset when I mentioned his lack of contracts compared to me, so I guess he was already over it.

As if being called a kid wasn’t insulting enough, being called pretty boy felt like a slap in the face.

I’m a lot of things, but certainly not *pretty*, at least not enough to be mocked for it.

Amera burst into side-splitting laughter at that nickname and wanted to shrink into my seat and not be anywhere near these two.

“I mean, it’s true! You wanna tell me what kinda eyeliner you wear? Your ‘lashes are longer than mine!” She snickered in between hefty breaths.

I knew she was only trying to give me shit for an innocent laugh, but I couldn’t help but feel a little humiliated. For the record, I do *not* wear eyeliner, and I don’t have long eyelashes.

...Not *that* long at least.

Trying to change the topic, I asked both of them a question.

“How did you two get recruited?”

I waited for their snickering to die down, then they gave me their answer.

“I got recruited before she did, back when I was living in the UK.” Orion elaborated.

“I think I was at the market having myself an early morning jog. I was minding my own business when I happen to spot an older-looking guy sitting by the edge of a dock, just relaxing.

Normally, I wouldn’t have paid him any mind, but that was until this absolutely *massive* eel-looking creature just snapped him up and dragged him under the water like it was the most casual thing in the world. I ran down to the docks, but all I could see was a puddle of red slowly growing bigger. Some wild shit, no?”

The way he phrased the story sounded like he was more focused on the spectacle of it all rather than the fact that he was a witness to a murder.

“I ran off trying to look for someone to help me, but when I started running there was this gross inky black symbol all over the ground. You know what I’m talking about, right?”

The inky black symbol was something my boss liked to tag around people he has his eye on, and at that point, he started paying attention to Orion.

From there, Orion explained that when he opened the door of a community center, he found himself standing in Boss’ office, when Boss propositioned him for the job.

He took it, and the rest is history.

Overall, it was noticeably more mundane than my recruitment story, but I’ve come to believe that mine is just particularly strange among others.

I looked back at Amera, who was munching on handfuls of that precious Doritos bag she stole and decided to ask her a question.

“What about you? What’s your origin?”

She glanced at me and gave me an uneasy look, and she started to chew her food slowly, like each bite was done with careful consideration. Finally, she swallowed her meal.

“I’m sorry, I don’t really want to talk about it.” She said, then continued to stuff her face with nacho chips.

She sounded acutely melancholic with her answer, so whatever her origin may be, it couldn’t be good.

“Let me ask you this: What’s your superpower?” Orion interjected, reaching his hand behind the seat to grab a few chips from Amera’s bag.

I think I could do a good enough job explaining it, but I was feeling flashy and wanted to do something special.

“You got a coin or something?” I asked, which made him dig into his jeans pocket and pluck out a dirt-covered quarter.

Carefully steering my car with one hand, I used my free hand to grasp the coin and dissolve it, turning it into what looked like dart ash.

Orion’s eyes widened in surprise and Amera coughed on her chips.

“Holy shit, you can dissolve things? That’s so cool!” She said between choking on cheesy chip crumbs.

I flicked the remaining ash off my fingers adjusted the collar of my jacket.

“I mean, I guess. I’m sure you have something cooler.” I said, hoping they would both show me their powers.

Orion rubbed his hands together and smiled a mischievous smile.“Say no more! I’ll show you right here what I can do!” He said pridefully.

He shoved his hands back into his pockets and sank back into his seat like he was waiting for something to happen.

The car was silent from then on as we waited for something to happen, which gave me time to check the GPS to see how close I was to the location.

The barren snowy fields were gone and replaced by grey and brown concrete apartment complexes linked with each other,  forming one unappealing block of living quarters.

I could see a closed shopping mall and various stores in the distance, all of their neon signs were as dark as day.

“Do you feel it yet?” Orion asked, avidly awaiting my response.

I tried waving my hand around in the car, looking around my seat, even sniffing the air, but I couldn’t spot any real changes inside the car. I thought he was just baiting me for a reaction and didn’t activate his powers at all.

“What am I supposed to see here? What are you doing?”

“Are you sure you don’t notice anything? Nothing at all?” He said, his sly tone sneaking into his voice.

I waited for something to happen again, but still nothing. It was starting to get stuffy in the car, so I went to crank off the heat but noticed it was already turned off.

“Figured it out?” He said, sounding immensely self-satisfied.

“...You make things hot?” I sighed, sounding thoroughly unimpressed.

I wasn’t sure what to expect with him, but being a glorified air conditioner was not really something I’d picture as being a particularly threatening power to execute monsters with.

I still really trouble to imagine these two (or more so Orion specifically) going on jobs and taking out monsters. I guess that’s why Boss gives him such a light load.

I guess he noticed my lack of excitement because he looked pretty offended.

“Hey, don’t write me off yet! You have no idea how useful this power is?” He cried, pulling out his hand from his jacket pocket and revealing that it was glowing as bright orange as his coat like it was a cartoon kettle overheating.

I mean, I don’t doubt that it can be useful in some situations, but if it works anything like my power, it just seems like a less effective version of what I can do. I’d rather be able to instantly disintegrate something via touch rather than slowly heat something and still require contact.

The GPS told me that I was only 1 kilometer away from the location, so I began to speed up and turn into the parking lot.

“Alright, you’re here. Now get out of my car.”

Orion chuckled and gently punched my shoulder, and I felt the hot sting of his orange-tinted hand. I recoiled in pain and jumped in my seat.

Amera rolled off her seat and grabbed her massive backpack full of stolen snacks.

“Thanks for the ride, mate. I owe ‘ya.” Orion said cheerfully.

I gave him an obligatory smile of acknowledgment and rolled up his window.

Amera tapped me on my shoulder and handed me a slip of paper, with both of their phone numbers written on it.

“Keep those just in case. You don’t know when things can get hairy and you’ll need our help.” She reassured.

I wasn’t planning on calling them any time soon, but I appreciated the offer nonetheless.

I slipped the note into my jacket pocket and Amera hopped out of the door and closed it, and both of them started walking towards the complex.

Just as I was pulling out of the lot, I heard Amera shouting at me.

“Thanks for the ride, pretty boy!”

I white-knuckle gripped the steering wheel as I drove off.

Sorry if my first meeting with my co-workers felt a little mundane, but that was the story in full.

It’s weird to think that these people are just regular people beneath it all.

And I think in retrospect, I owe those two a lot. They may appear incompetent, but those two had quite an effect on me.

Hell, I didn’t even notice that my mood was lifted significantly when I talked to them. They certainly aren’t boring.

e8higj,1,2019-12-09,Interesting situation regarding the interview process (FOLLOW UP),chiddar,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/e8higj/interesting_situation_regarding_the_interview/,"Hello Readers,

So recently my father met a man who told me that he may be able to get me an Internship at EY (Ernst &amp; Young). He wrote down his number on a piece of paper and told my father to have me contact him regarding this. So I did not really believe the situation at all. So two months go by, and I still had the piece of paper on my computer desk... so I was like, WHY NOT!? 

&amp;#x200B;

So I called the number on the piece of paper, come to find out the guy works at an Asset Management company in Midtown NYC! Not only that, but the guy was the President of the company, which makes billions of dollars. So yeah, you can say that I was eager. A couple of calls later and I have scheduled an interview with the company for an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

The building was in the heart of NYC, huge skyscraper, beautiful, full-floor, giant windows, marble floors... it was breathtaking. I was so nervous. I was informed that it would be a 3 part interview with HR, the manager &amp; the CFO. So I went to the interview and crushed it. I'd say a solid 8/10. Sitting in front of people who hold themselves to such high expectations is nerve-racking. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the interview was over I sent the thank you emails accordingly and the HR lady said this: 

""Thank you for the note. Great to meet you as well. We will be in touch about next steps in the next few days. Thanks again for coming in!""

&amp;#x200B;

So I waited about 10 days and I never received an email. So I was going to email them back because I was so eager, but then, unknowingly, my father talked to the man who gave him his phone number (the president of the company) and my father told me this: 

""He said he's trying to get the approval for you. They usually don't hire interns this time of the year.

But he said you did well. They have a budget for a salary so he's going push for more for you.""

&amp;#x200B;

So finding out that I did well made me extremely happy because I was extremely nervous. Although the interview was on November 13th... So I really do not know what to do next. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please, any words of advice will be appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time as well. Enjoy the rest of your day!"
e8i7is,1,2019-12-09,How to introduce remote work?,pariwinkle17,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e8i7is/how_to_introduce_remote_work/,"So I'm currently located in Shiremanstown, PA and I go to Harrisburg Area Community College for Graphic &amp; Interactive Design. I'm finishing up my last year and will be starting my last semester in Spring 2020. Following that I will need to have an internship in Summer 2020 in order to fully graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to work full time at my current job as a digital press operator for $11.50 an hour until I can save up enough money and budget better so I can afford a place of my own. This will happen during the winter and part-time during spring. However, for my internship I'm looking for places in Philadelphia since that's the area I want to pursue.

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at job opportunities that could possibly intern me (and then hopefully keep me) and I found one that accepted remote work. Right now (for the sake of financial reasons) I want to work remote until I can save up enough to move closer to my (future) job. I've found other jobs similar to what I'm looking for if this one doesn't work however I'm unsure if they would be willing to do remote work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've emailed one company so far (the one I know offers remote work for sure) but I'm trying to think of how to discuss my plans to other companies when I email them saying I would not be able to work on site until I have a steady source of income and am sure I'd be able to afford a place on my own.

&amp;#x200B;

So....how do I address that I want to work remotely first then (if they want to keep me) move to Philly on my own so I can be closer and work more on site?"

Apply to these programs—deadlines are coming up. Sure, they’ll help you look “good” for college apps but will also allow you to make peer-to-peer and mentor connections!

Even if you don’t get in, you won’t regret applying. Think of them as (free) practice for college applications—I’ve been able to use my essays for these programs as a basic foundation for my college application supplemental essays.

I applied to MITES/MOSTEC at MIT, SAMS at Carnegie Mellon, and an internship at NASA. Let me know if you have any questions (:

The two programs I applied to focus on serving underrepresented (race, ethnicity, income, geographical location) groups. However, even if you do not fall into this category, there are definitely other opportunities for you!

This company is full of much older people that have an older way of thinking, so I already wasn't excited to work for them and planned to leave within a year. 

The biggest problem is I never really got feedback on what I was doing and didn't get any mentorship because they claimed to not have the manpower to do it. They would give me projects that I would actually contribute to/make progress on, so this just came out of nowhere. I get that it was time for annual reviews but I didn't really get an inkling that something like this was going to happen.

Anyways, how common is this in our industry? They said that their probationary period is roughly 6-9 months for new developers, but this happened after less than that.

Also, should I even put this on my resume? At the most I was going to put it down as an internship.

Background:
-2nd year CS student
-Have a degree in business already
-leaving current full time job
-starting a code bootcamp in January

I am being offered an internship opportunity to help work on a small start up app from a current coworker/friend. 

The app brings in revenue but is certainly not big. There is only 1 dev in the team and both of the owners are the only people working on it.

Would taking this internship be a bad move? Would I miss the opportunity to actually learn software development? I like the stack, but am I gonna sink myself here?"

This is a done deal and I won't be able to change my housing situation... Without giving you the tldr headaches, basically I am going to need a car for 5 months. Here's the pickle.

I am 24 years old and I count as a 'young driver'; rental companies are stupidly anal about their prices (it costs about $1300/mo for youngsters) that's $6500 for 5 months.

I have considered buying. Seems like reliable, safety-checked cars on Kijiji are priced around $5000 right now. But I am scared of the possible services they might need that I won't realize at the time of buying. Also, I think it is going to be quite hard to sell a car when I have a hard deadline to leave, I'll probably have to go a couple of grands lower than what I buy the car for to sell it in a short period of time. That, with taxes and the inevitable old-car service, will get pretty expensive too. My estimation of loss considering service is about ($3000)

Other option is taking over a lease, I have found a few available cars that end a couple of months after my internship termination. Seems to me like the best option. They are newer cars than cars that I can afford to buy so I get a better car overall, cost about $500/mo and with a couple of months over my job termination, my effective pay for 5 months would be about $3500. I might be able to find better deals as I get closer to the date.

P.S. I didn't take insurance into account since it's going to be similar for all options

What are your thoughts? If anyone has similar experience I would appreciate some guidance."

https://preview.redd.it/h65iznh6rr341.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31bf32beab6b28565c1b01104796f6eadeb780e0

## Tl;dr

IFF filed RTIs with various state governments seeking copies of internet shutdown orders issued under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017. Besides Bihar, Rajasthan is the second state to provide us access to internet shutdown orders. Our analysis of the orders reveals that these orders have been issued by Divisional Commissioners who lack authority to suspend telecom services and many orders were issued in circumstances which do not seem to satisfy the public emergency/public safety requirement under the law.

## Public Emergency or Public Safety: The Two Prerequisites

Suspension of telecom services, that includes within its ambit shutting down of mobile internet and broadband internet services, is carried out under the [**Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017**](http://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Suspension%20Rules.pdf), on the “occurrence of public emergency or in the interest of public safety”. The power to suspend telecom services on these grounds can be traced back to section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. The question then arises is what constitutes “public emergency” or “public safety” in the context of the Telegraph Act?

The meaning of these terms was first explained by the Supreme Court in  *Hukam Chand v Union of India (1975)* and reiterated in *PUCL v. Union of India (1997)*. In *Hukam Chand*, the Supreme court observed that the occurrence of a ""public emergency"" is sine qua non for the exercise of powers under Section 5(2), and the competent authority must record its satisfaction as to the existence of such an emergency. Further, an emergency must be a “public emergency” and not any other kind of emergency. In *Hukum Chand*, certain telephones in a hotel in Delhi were being used to facilitate illegal forward trading. The Administrator of Delhi authorised the police to take temporary possession of the telephones on the ground that “public emergency” exists. However, the Supreme Court did not accept that this constitutes a “public emergency”.  Affirming the view adopted in *Hukam Chand,* the Supreme Court further elaborated the meaning of “public emergency"" in *PUCL* as the prevailing of a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting the people at large calling for immediate action. The expression ""public safety"" was defined as the state or condition of freedom from danger or risk for the people at large.

Therefore, the Supreme Court decisions in *Hukum Chand* and *PUCL* make it clear that the conditions or the state of affairs which can be considered a public emergency or in the interest of public safety must affect the community at large, and every disturbance of law and order does not satisfy the public emergency/public safety threshold under Section 5(2).

## Analysis of Internet Shutdown Orders from Rajasthan

**(i) Impermissible sub-delegation of powers**

State action which infringes fundamental rights must conform to the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in *KS Puttaswamy v Union of India (2017 &amp; 2019)***.** The first prong of the proportionality standard requires that the restriction on fundamental rights must be prescribed by law. The most glaring error in the internet shutdown orders from Rajasthan is the sheer disregard for statutory rules that require telecom suspension orders to be issued by the Secretary, Home Department in the case of the State Government, or in unavoidable circumstances, by an officer not below the rank of Joint Secretary.

None of the internet shutdown orders supplied to us have been issued by the competent authority under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. All orders have been issued by Divisional Commissioners. On 2 Sep 2017, the Rajasthan Government had delegated the powers conferred upon the State Home Secretary under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to Divisional Commissioners. On 28 September 2018, the Department of Telecommunications of the Central Government had warned the Rajasthan Government against delegating these powers to Divisional Commissioners and stated that the Rajasthan Government should reconsider its decision to delegate these powers to Divisional Commissioners and ensure that the Rules are followed strictly. Despite this, there are several orders issued by Divisional Commissioners in 2019 suspending telecom services including in the wake of the recent Ayodhya judgement.

**(ii)** **Shutting down criticism of the government by shutting down the internet**

In a constitutional democracy, arbitrary and disproportionate restrictions cannot be placed on the fundamental right to peaceful protest. The internet has transformed the way people organise and agitate against unjust government action. The Arab Spring is a real life example of how the internet and social media have revolutionised the tactics and methodology of collective protest.  In Rajasthan, there have been several instances of Divisional Commissioners imposing internet shutdowns based on mere apprehension of protest or agitation against the government.

For example, on 2 July 2019, the Jaipur Divisional Commissioner issued an order to suspend mobile internet services and social media platforms citing law and order concerns because protestors were demanding the arrest of an alleged sex offendor and compensation for the minor victim. Similarly, in Sikar District when a bandh was called to criticize the conduct of the police in an abduction case, internet services were suspended for 38 hours vaguely citing apprehensions about circulation of rumours.

Suspension of internet services in these cases was a clear attempt to prevent any agitation or protest against the conduct of the police. In light of the proportionality standard, state action must pursue a legitimate aim. Shutting down the internet to prevent criticism of government officials does not constitute a legitimate aim and such misuse of telecom suspension powers goes against the very idea of a State which respects the citizen’s right to peaceful protest.

Further, empirical studies have shown that telecom shutdowns may actually be counterproductive. In a study titled ‘Of Blackouts and Bandhs: The Strategy and Structure of Disconnected Protest in India’, researchers at Stanford University conducted a statistical analysis of network shutdowns in India in 2016 and found that network shutdowns incentivize those forms of violent collective action which tend to be more chaotic and require less communication, coordination and preparation than peaceful demonstrations.

**(iii)** **Telecom shutdowns should be the absolute last resort**

In accordance with the proportionality standard, internet shutdowns are permissible only if the intended objective cannot be achieved through less restrictive alternatives. In July and August 2018, Divisional Commissioners in Rajasthan had suspended mobile internet to prevent the use of unfair means in public service examinations for the recruitment of police constables. Prevention of unfair means in examinations does not amount to a “public emergency” that would impact the community at large by any stretch of the imagination. Similarly, in Sikar district, the Divisional Commissioner suspended access to mobile internet and social media platforms to foil the plans of a few criminals who were hiding and were in contact through WhatsApp. Issuing telecom suspension orders in these circumstances demonstrates complete lack of application of mind since the objectives could have been achieved through less restrictive measurea like the use of signal jammers in the exam halls or targetted blocking of phone numbers of criminals.

## 

## Internet facilitates speech and much more

The government, while exercising its power under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017, should balance the impact of internet shutdowns on fundamental rights of citizens with the need to prevent a public emergency or protect public safety. In *PUCL v Union of India (2013)*, the Supreme Court has held that fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution also include ancillary guarantees which make exercise of those rights meaningful and possible. Widespread and indiscriminate suspension of telecom services can have devastating human, social and economic consequences. In Digital India, access to the internet is an indispensable requirement for access to various other rights such as healthcare, education, livelihood etc. This [**fantastic report**](https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/features/inside-the-internet-shutdown-capital-of-the-world-11575644823381.html) by Asmita Bakshi from the Mint spells out the human cost of internet shutdowns in Rajasthan which deprive Uber drivers of their daily earnings, prevent diagnostic centres from functioning effectively and deny students the opportunity to register for exams. As the use of the internet becomes increasingly impossible to extricate from our day to day activities, there is an urgent need to reconsider and reform a legal regime that allows arbitrary and disproportionate use of technological kill switches.

I am posting this to get advice for my boyfriend. My boyfriend graduated in Spring 2018 with a degree in aerospace engineering.  After a few months of searching, he was able to secure an internship and stayed there for a few months until he and the other interns were let go due to budget cuts. After more searching, he was able to get a position as an actual aerospace engineer at a small company. Unfortunately, he recently was let go from this company due to an incident that he didn't know was considered time theft. I don't want to go into detail about what happened, but it was an honest mistake that he has learned his lesson from. Now he is back on the job market and is very sad and stressed out since he's consistently struggled with finding an engineering position as a new grad.

He believes that he should include the experience he had at that small company on his resume as he thinks some experience is better than none and if asked about the incident, he can word it in a positive light. My opinion is that I think he should start with a clean slate and not include the time at the company since he was there for only two months and was fired also, which will send red flags to other employers. 

Any and all advice will be much appreciated! Thank you :)"

My job isn't ideal and it's been draining me for a while now. I feel stuck and it's making me depressed and I don't know what else to do.

23F, graduated in 2018. Been at this job from November 2018 - now, so it's been a little over one year here. I've been thinking of quitting since six months in. 

My job does not provide 401k, has a mandatory one week break in April, and only has 5 vacation days on top of that. November - January is a really big time for this industry, and in the past month I've had to work 3 days until 8 PM in a row, and 5 days until 10 PM in a row, and have had to come in on a Sunday. The company provided us with $10 dinners on the days we stayed late and paid for uber shares back home. They promised to ""reward"" us somehow, but it seems like bullshit (last year when we first started we had to work late a few times as well, with absolutely no reward). I am part of the design team, which usually gets mistreated the most from the higher ups. No, it's not always like this, but I feel that this info is relevant to paint a picture on work life here. On regular days I work 9  - 6 with a 45 minute commute each way. 

It's my first real job aside from internships and I'm grateful for it, but the reality is: the benefits suck, the PTO sucks, the commute sucks, there is no growth for my position, they promised yearly reviews and didn't do any, there's a high turnover rate and the artistic director I work under is widely hated and doesn't know what he's doing, resulting in me feeling dissatisfied in all of my work... I feel that the longer I work here, the less and less I have to show. My portfolio is mostly the same as when I had graduated. The work I did in school is tremendously better than anything I've accomplished here. This is also not the industry I want to be in or type of work I want to do for the rest of my life.

I've tried to apply for jobs during my current one, but nothing gets done. There's never enough time and I'm always too drained and I think it's really taking a toll on my mental health. I've been to therapy for this but it doesn't seem to work and it's too expensive. It's now been over 6 months since I've been ""trying"" to find a new job and I feel that the longer I stay the worse I feel. I honestly feel stuck and would rather quit, spend my entire days focusing on my portfolio and job searching without having to worry about anything else, and begin a career for a better future. However, everyone has been saying that quitting without having another job already lined up is a really bad idea. On the other hand I'm scared that if I stay here while I look, I'll end up staying here forever. 

I earn 60k at this job salaried (pretax) with no bonus or overtime pay. My take home is $808 weekly. My rent + utilities is 1k monthly, and I save $275 weekly per paycheck. I spend \~$100 on subscriptions monthly for necessary programs such as Adobe CC. The rest is on groceries, shopping, dining out, entertainment, etc. I usually end the month with $0, but don't feel bad because I put the necessary amounts into savings first. I have 6k maxed for my Roth IRA (2019), and 10k in a high yields savings account. 

The first time I looked for employment right out of college, it took me 2.5 months of full time search. If I quit today, coming out with a real job experience, I'm hoping it will taking me around the same time and not too much longer to find another job. 10k would hopefully be enough to sustain me 4 months(?) before I'm out of money if I live this same lifestyle, and I do have parents to fall back on. Are these reasons justified enough to quit?"

Now I have interviews coming up for next summer, and I am going to be asked why I'm not going back to my previous company. I don't want to lie, but I don't know what to say as an explanation"

Total YoE (post school): 3 

Related YoE (post school): 2 

Related YoE including internships and RA: 2y 8m


Education: MS in Embedded

I'm mentioning all 3 because my internships and RA are highly relevant to embedded and I am not sure if they count towards getting better pay. 

I checked the salary guides from the side bar for C++/C developer and Embedded Software developer and the range they suggest is from 45-70k (checked a couple of them). But are these new grad salaries? 

A company that I interviewed with, offered me 42k. Am I being lowballed big time?

I would really love some perspective from the redditors in this subreddit."

The offer details:
Salary: $85k CAD

To be quite honest, it's not as great as I was expecting but I'm not sure what the standard is in Canada. It'll be in a city with a relatively low cost of living. (~$1500/month for a _nice_ 1 bedroom apt)

What are other comparables for new grads? Any thoughts opinions? I'm not real sure how to proceed here."

e8ykwq,0,2019-12-10,"Graduated with unrelated engineering degree, wondering if its worth going back to school for a postbacc/masters in CS to escape current job.",that30yearoldmonster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e8ykwq/graduated_with_unrelated_engineering_degree/,"Hello all and sorry for the long blog post, but I need some advice on escaping my shitty situation.

So I graduated last may with a mostly unrelated to CS bachelor's degree in engineering and I had decent grades (a 3.3 GPA but I bombed freshman and sophomore year so it was mostly As my last two years). I did two internships with the same company, and both of my managers wrote me good reviews and I enjoyed the work so I was just planning on working there when I graduated. Unfortunately, the company started performing really poorly and stopped hiring new graduates my senior year, so working there wasn't an option for me. I applied to jobs consistently throughout my senior year, both online and face to face between my limited network and university career fairs, but I didn't get a single offer until I got an offer for a software engineer position right after I graduated.

So for the record, I don't know any programming besides VBA in excel which I learned at my internship. The company made it seem like I would do a lot of work with data processes and organization, and that I would be designing software functionality for fields closely related to my major, and that there would be ample opportunity for leadership development and for me to learn programming and about computer science in general. It seemed like I would be getting great experience that would allow me to either continue working in fields related to my major, or move on to other software jobs if I wanted so I took the job.

I've been here for 8 months now, and this was far from the truth. I basically only work on writing training courses and documentation for users. I'm not getting good experience for my major or for the software field. It's so mindnumbingly boring that I want to cry because I can't believe that I worked so hard at my engineering degree only to wind up here. I'm not developing any skills or learning anything new, and I'm not gaining any good experience to transfer to other positions. I've spoke to my managers but they don't have anything else for me.

The other problem is the company is very small so there's no room for advancement (I have coworkers with the same job title who've been here 10+ years), they can't afford to develop their employees skills beyond what's necessary for the task at hand, and the company is super strict about filling out time sheets so I can't get away with taking the time to teach myself programming or something else on the job.

The hours are long (7-5), and I live an hour away so I commute two hours a day. I know that there's technically time for me to teach myself programming after work, but I'm just so damn drained when I get home that all I can muster up the energy to do is workout for a bit then go and spend a bit of time with my girlfriend who is the only good thing in my day. The whole situation is just depressing the hell out of me and I feel so beaten and lost.

I realize this company isn't good to stay at, and I've started sending out resumes to other companies but I don't have high hopes because I didn't get any other job offers my entire senior year, and I don't have much of anything to put on my resume in my current stint at this company. 

I'm wondering if going back to school to get a post-baccalaureate certificate in computer science and then a master's degree after that would be viable/a good idea? I'm really worried that I won't be able to find a job after doing this because I don't think post-bacc or masters students will have an easy time finding internships compared to traditional undergraduate students, and if I can't find a job after the masters then I'll be in just as shitty of a situation only 2-3 years older and with a lot of lost money. 

Any advice or general words of encouragement would be appreciate, thanks."

IT SOC Intern - Top 15 accounting firm 

Software Consultant (9months) - Full time at a public sector SaaS company. Here I basically do everything from SYSADM, DBA to hands on securities for our product line. I role as a highly priced product support person with all the bells and whistles etc.

Basically my currently role is limited to the updated growth in a timely manner than most other places would be. Also to mention my actual hands on TECHNICAL aptitude goes as far as SQL, VBScript, XML, and using proprietary products to secure our solution. That’s where I’m at a wall.. Only skills which are transferable are my client interaction and business acumen and those three. Sure I get to own projects solely under a PM and go on sites solo and lead but I haven’t been able to actually broaden my tech knowledge. cloud is ramping up and I don’t even know where to start to join the movement.

With my background and assumed skill level can I move into a role where I’m not behind a disk coding but I’m doing 50/50 but more QA or BA type work?

I interned at IBM and received a return job offer. I also have an offer from another company with ~1000 employees. My issue is, if I work at IBM, I have to move to a city that's 3 hours away. If I work at the smaller company, it'll be 10 minutes away from my current house, rent free. I'd end up getting roughly 15k more from the other company even though it pays less than IBM, simply because I can live at home rather than move out.

While I enjoyed my internship at IBM, it definitely wasn't the greatest job. Would it make a huge difference to my future career whether I worked at IBM vs a smaller/lesser known company for my first job? This company is in the telematics/GPS industry.

Also, I definitely don't want to be working at IBM long term but I don't mind working there for 2 or so years. It's in an area I have no interest in living in long term.

Would always be super tired after high school. Freshman year, did okay. Downhill ever since. Eventually booted to alternative school as a junior. Ruined high school for me. I was never ever a straight-A student, and I ALWAYS had mediocre attendance and middling-to-abysmal grades. No scholarship for this guy. But I'll be damned if I don't graduate high school with a diploma. Seeing as the last trimester just ended, IN THEORY I'll have enough credits to pass this week. But guess who's overslept every day since Thursday or so.

The third problem, my internship. My internship, mind you, is a pretty sweet deal. Twice a month to weekly, every Saturday at around 9 AM. Don't have to do much, 60 dollar weekly stipend. I didn't attend last week partially due to oversleeping. The coordinator said that I can't keep missing so much or he'll have to replace me. So last night I decided to nip it in the bud.

Even if I didn't get any sleep the night before. I was gonna see my friends then too. So I set my alarm (my girlfriend has unplugged it twice and I really wish she'd quit it), but I set it wrong! So it woke me up at 5 AM instead. So whatever, I turn it off and go back to sleep. 7 AM rolls around, time for school. My dad tells me it's time to get up. So okay, I'll be up in a few minutes, even if I miss school I'll surely be ready by 3 for my friends. Shows what I know. I don't actually wake up until 9. PM. Girlfriend rightfully mad at me, family rightfully chewing me out.

Even when I get to sleep at 9 PM I still sleep almost 12 hours. Sleep debt only goes so far, I do this all the time. I'm treading a thin line and have to improve so I can make appointments again instead of sleeping my life away. Now what Reddit? If I stayed on a decent sleep schedule for like a month, that might fix it. But I still sleep a long time when left to my own devices. I complain a lot about there not enough time in the day to do stuff I want so I end up staying up late. That's usually when I find cool stuff on the internet. World of good THAT does me though.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Rant about sleeping through everything, sleep for too long when I do sleep, ruining my life. Long-term problem. Can't sleep less than like 12 hours easily. Stay up too late or not, still sleep all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I've been struggling with this since for like ever, and I have a bit of a brute force solution. That's staying up all night the night before, going to school, staying up as long as I can after that (usually not that long) and then just sleeping long as I can. That usually inverts my schedule so now I'm getting up early but it eventually shifts back to the normal schedule."

They offered 52k annual salary, benefits and 15 days PTO. Should I negotiate salary?

For more details: 
I have a BS in Information Technology and Cybersecurity,
2 internships - 1 of which is Cybersecurity related and no certs.

Because of this I'm a bit hesitant to negotiate, as they know I'm fresh out of college, and I feel I lack the experience to leverage a negotiation. 

I admittedly hoped for at least 60-65k, which I believe to be on the lower end of the industry standard, but maybe that salary is for mid-level cyber work? I'm not sure. I have a couple days before I have to sign off on this. What should I do?

Edit: Thanks for all the replies, you all are helping immensely with my decision making. I'm thinking about asking for 10k more due to my hour long commute, internship experience and having an idea of what the standard is for Connecticut.

Update: If anyone still is following this thread, they said the company is too small to offer me anything in the range of 60-70k, so instead I negotiated for a sign on bonus and an additional 1k increase. They explained the benefits package a bit more in detail to help smooth me over too. I know it's disappointing, but I guess this is to be expected in smaller companies."

Throwaway, here. I'm a fellow/intern on Capitol Hill, and I've recently been offered a job on a Presidential campaign as a field organizer (top 3 Dem candidate). They want me to start right after Christmas. However, I've been trying to get a full time position on Capitol Hill for about a year and a half now. I've sacrificed a lot to get where I am and this would uproot my life completely.

I'm a law school graduate, but I hated legal work and went totally into the policy world. I work as a bartender and a delivery driver as side jobs to make ends meet. But it's been a *long* time coming. It's starting to get embarrassing that I can't secure full-time work on the Hill and if I don't get something soon, I may just have to give up. I'm not in my twenties.

My temporary position is extendable into the future, but I'm unpaid where I'm at. The campaign offers about $4,000 a month + benefits. My temp work *does*, however, offer me a lot more opportunities to secure full time work. Hill interviewers prefer people who are currently in offices, and having dozens of people in the office to assist in networking (*extremely* important in securing Hill work) has been invaluable. Since taking the position, I've been getting far more traction in securing interviews.

In fact, I've made it through two interviews and a writing test for a full-time position on Capitol Hill that would be my dream job. I would manage interns, I would have a policy portfolio, work directly with the Senator, it would offer more pay, tons of advancement opportunities, I could stay in DC, and I would have achieved my dream. However, they won't be finished making a decision until possibly January. If you haven't heard, it's quite crazy here on the Hill--even relatively speaking. 

Thus, I have to choose. Do I take the offer right in front of me? Do I take the chance it brings me back to DC someday, or do I wait to see if I can actually get a job this time?"

I'm a non-traditional Developer who finished Computer Engineering at a college (Seneca College in Toronto, for those who are curious) instead of Computer Science and later on decided to enroll myself in a  Web Development boot camp to get myself into the Development field. After I finished the boot camp I was able to find a job fairly quickly as a Junior Dev. I worked mostly in the LAMP stack and honestly it was just a mess, no version control, no proper coding practices, no Senior Dev, literally my job was just to pump out features and websites with 0 code reviews or any important feedback that would help me improve as a Junior Dev. I stayed there for about a year while applying for other jobs and was able to find myself a better company.

This company was a bit more organized and I actually had Senior Devs I could rely on for advice. They did have working version control with pull requests, Senior Devs would review the requests and give feedback constructive feedback. They weren't working in the tech stack I wanted to, they were using some niche CMS called Kentico and were still doing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery. No React, Angular, Vue and Microsoft Azure for DevOps. 3 Months in the owners of the company change and a bunch of developers got laid off (including me). I decided to take a 6 month break and travel (got really discouraged and was just so tired of the job hunt grind).

Once I got back from my break I went back on the job hunt grind and got hired as a coding instructor part-time to make ends meet. I'm still currently looking for a full-time development position. I am studying algorithms and data structures and also system design interview questions to increase my chances of getting hired but honestly I've been thinking about going back to school and taking Computer Science at a university and getting my degree. I basically want to fill the gaps of knowledge CS majors have that I don't and also do an internship with FANG(Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google). I already did a pros and cons analysis, this is what I could come up with:

**Pros:**  
• Fill the gaps of knowledge traditional Computer Science graduates have over me  
• Gain confidence in my ability as a developer (defeat impostor syndrome)  
• Have a higher chance of getting hired at FANG or any company because of the CS degree  
• I genuinely enjoy going to school and learning so it would be fun for me 

**Cons:**  
• 4 years of school, that means I'll be 30y when I'm ready to finally start my career  
• I come from an average income household so I will have to rely on loans and will incur more debt than I already have  
• Confident in my programming fundamentals so most of the courses I will take will be refreshers instead of learning new concepts

**My ultimate goal is to work at FANG full-time**. With this list in mind I was wondering if I could get some guidance or advice as to what I should do next. If anyone is in a similar position I would love to hear about it and what your approach is to the whole ordeal. 

**TLDR:** Already have professional developer experience but want to get my CS degree to fill my gaps of knowledge and increase my chances of landing a job at FANG or just in general.

Thanks for reading my post, I know it was long!"

(Basically Political Science with a bit of Math, Economics and Statistics). I do not have much formal background in this field as I have worked my way through my bachelors, however I began an Internship in the fall for a City government position. Overall while insightful, this I am now realizing this is not the line of work, specifically in advocacy and legislation, that I want to pursue for the rest of my life. I am interested while I still can, in migrating to the tech field. I've always contemplated working in the industry, took AP CompSci in High school and even have a temp job working as an IT assistant. Right now I'm aiming on focusing on securing a help desk for IT just to get my foot in the door, along with this I want to enroll myself into a Master's Program. I'm going to work on getting certified for CompTIA A+ &amp; Network+ . Ultimately I think a masters is the best bet due to not having a academic background, while also being able to defer my student loans which I cannot afford with my current career. I have the grades to secure something and will take bridge courses to cover myself prior to enrolling. My dilemma is, I do not want to completely disregard my undergraduate degree. I enjoy the concept of having my work affect peoples lives and help the public, I don't mind the bureaucracy, I just no longer have an interest in communications and policy.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is such: Are the available computer science &amp; programmer related jobs in the public sector and if there are what would you suggest I learn to get myself there.

If not, would IT be a better focus?

I want to one day be able to contribute or develop a program that can be used to help people, my current understanding is that IT would not be the best direction to do something like this. But I genuinely want to combine my undergrad degree with something in the tech field to make myself marketable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm open to any suggestions and appreciate the help. I'm not afraid of committing to a long term goal provided the avenue exists."

e9bj0a,50,2019-12-11,Berkeley upperclass(wo)man here who's procrastinating during dead week. Ready to answer questions and give out lame advice! #gobears,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e9bj0a/berkeley_upperclasswoman_here_whos/,"(disclaimer: made a throwaway account for this so I can be more open, so feel free to ask anything, but I'm gonna be offline for a bit to go study for finals)

Hey guys! I know college application time can be… a) stressful, b) exciting, c) mundane, d) nerve-wracking, e) [put your own word here]

...SO I thought it would be fun to give you guys some stuff I learned at Cal, and also what to look forward to in college!

I’m also doing this for me because… finals at Berkeley are next week and um… yeah. I’m losing my shit. Hahaha… :) Anyways.

**I’m not here to say “where you go to school doesn’t matter!” because… it does (who doesn’t want to end up at a school where they will be happy and succeed?), and those posts are bullshit and quite condescending.** It’s normal to be freaking out (as long as you aren’t having serious mental health issues) and feeling all sorts of things. You’re fine.

Before anything else, **HERE’S A REALLY COOL AND INFORMATIVE PAGE:** (!!!!!!!!!!!) https://career.berkeley.edu/Survey/2018Majors (you can edit 2018 to 2017, 2016, etc. in the link to go to different years)—Basically, every year Cal shows where their students go from almost every major. You can see what economics majors, sociology majors, English majors, etc. end up making ($) and where they work and what their job title is, how many end up attending law school and where, etc. Also: a lot of people end up working in a field vastly different from their major, but I think most of us know that this is pretty common.

**Information about Berkeley that you may not know:**
	
1. So, lectures (typically the prerequisite/requirement ones) have discussion sections. These are run by Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs). Depending on how big the lecture is, there can be 4 discussion sections, 16 discussion sections, etc. to choose from. You meet once or twice a week (typically) with a much smaller group of students from that same class where the GSI lectures about the material you just learned. GSIs grade your exams, essays, etc. and hold office hours just like professors do.

2. Classes are big, yeah. My intro classes were anywhere from 100-500 people, and even my electives were around 50-100 people. The biggest I’ve seen is I think 1500-2000 for CS 61A.

3. Use BerkeleyTime: https://www.berkeleytime.com/grades It shows the average grades/grade distribution for each class BY professor. Very very very helpful, more so than ratemyprofessor in some cases.

4. I’ve been here for 4 years and I’ve never had my laptop stolen, been mugged, been robbed, been assaulted, or anything else. And I’m a 21-year-old girl who walks around by herself late at night every week. IT DOES HAPPEN, but not to everybody. Also, there are homeless people here, and they’re pretty well-known (look up the “hell yeah” guy if you’re interested).

5. EVERY UNIVERSITY HAS RESOURCES, CONNECTIONS, ETC. USE THEM!!! Speak to people, make connections, attend networking events and career fairs, join study groups, join clubs. *(Oh yeah, clubs... here we go.)*

6. **Some clubs at Berkeley are harder to get into than MIT** (acceptance rate-wise). Okay, click-bait, but… actually.

(Consulting clubs especially, but business clubs too, and heck, all clubs in general).

For the clubs I have been in I had to usually 1) attend an infosession, 2) talk to the board members, 3) fill out an online application (it usually has multiple essay questions), 4) optional: you might have to demonstrate skills in some kind of exam (such as a copy editing test for the newspaper), 5) if you do hear back, you have to go through 1-2 interviews with some executive board members, 6) acceptance/rejection decision, 7) optional: they might make you attend a workshop.

For some clubs you will have to beat out 50+, 75+, (maybe more), etc. people for a spot. Not for ALL clubs, but for some/most (I actually don’t know, all of the clubs I applied to were super fucking competitive so I thought this was the norm. Applying to them was a flashback to the college application process).

Yeah, clubs here are student-run so they usually end up picking their friends in some cases. But my best advice is just make sure your interview goes well.

Overall, I’m 99% sure this is just a Berkeley thing. My friends at other UCs were like “WTF” when I first told them this.

7. We beat Stanford recently. At football. Guys, I’m… #gobears

8. Dining hall food? C- average. Berkeley food outside of the dining halls? A+.

9. Oh, yeah… housing. (sigh) Blackwell, Clark Kerr, Martinez Commons, Garden Village, and Unit 2 Apartments are the best IMO and from what I have heard. But… they’re very expensive. Off-campus housing is also expensive, but maybe a fraction cheaper. Housing is 100% the worst part about living in Berkeley.

10. The Berkeley alumni network is pretty good. Through LinkedIn, I’ve made a lot of great connections with Berkeley grads who want to help out fellow bears.

11. Just do the Blue Meal Plan. It's the cheapest and the food, as I said, isn't that good. You'll use your flex dollars more at places like the Golden Bear Cafe and Brown's.

12. You will meet the smartest people here.

13. We have the best Facebook meme page. So, if you do end up getting accepted... just another reason to come to Cal.

So, overall, my advice: **Talk to people in the industry and talk to professors. Try everything, even if you think you will hate it (because you might like it or end up with a funny story). TAKE A BUNCH OF UNIQUELY DIFFERENT CLASSES, ESPECIALLY FOR GEs.** This is how people end up finding new interests and how they might end up changing their major or adding a minor.

Last piece of advice: **You end up coming in undeclared**, so don’t put too much pressure on yourself to pick a major right away. Even if you’re intended business, you’re… intended. You aren’t in Haas until you actually go through the application period later (which is also very competitive. I have dozens of friends who were/are business majors, they all had above 3.9s by the end of their sophomore year).

Now, **ADVICE** (this is gonna SUCK I cannot give advice well):

**1) TALK TO PEOPLE: People in the industry specifically, but also advisors and professors. You’ll get a lot of juuuicy info. ;)**

First, a lot of us think we know what we want to do, but I’m not kidding you, 50% of the people that I’ve met here at Cal have changed their path. That doesn’t always mean going from something like theater to chemical engineering (but it does happen), but maybe cognitive science to computer science, sociology to political science, changing their biochemistry focus, going from mathematics to applied mathematics, going from psychology to English, going from business (Haas) to economics, deciding double-majoring is way too much, not doing pre-law anymore, etc. When you get to college, talk to your professors, GSIs, major advisors, etc. and ask questions! But you can start early: do this in high school! I wish I did. Your high school teachers may have good advice and can tell you about where they went to school, how they planned out their career, etc. We depend too much on Reddit to give us advice, when a lot of us (re: me) don’t have real-world experience or know how college admissions even work (which is why I can’t really give advice on “will I get in?” questions).

Furthermore, you’d be surprised who you might end up working or interning under. Not name-dropping companies but for one that you have (definitely) all heard of, I met with the senior manager of [redacted] department who was a sociology major, 3.4 GPA, from a T200 state school, and his first job was working as a software engineer. I was… shook. This was a turning point for me. I started doing coffee chats, LinkedIn messages, cold-emailing, etc. a bunch of managers, workers, etc. at different companies. A girl from a popular music company was a environmental science major, somehow ended up becoming an audio engineer (or sound technician… I don’t know)—something totally unrelated. I went to a film industry networking event. A woman who worked at Pixar in Emeryville (yes, Berkeley is very close to Pixar!!!) as an animator was a literature (? I think?) major, and she even admitted her major helped her maybe 5%.

BASICALLY: What I learned is: **you can get a COMPLETELY different job than what you’re majoring in** **IF**… you: 1) make connections, 2) show that you can do the work (meaning learning these skills on your own), 3) are a pleasure to work with (this was stressed a lot at all the networking events I went to; people would rather hire a nice intern who does the work than a rude/in-it-for-the-money-prestige person who doesn’t care about the company).

I think the most common pattern of this I saw was humanities majors ending up working in IT/tech field, not the other way around. I believe humanities majors often end up working in vastly different fields than what their major intends (such as in film, engineering, IT, design), while tech majors or business majors usually stay in the field.

From personal experience, someone in my immediate family was a social science major but ended up working in software for the rest of their life. I thought this was a very rare case when I was in high school, but it’s honestly super common. So, it happens, and it’s not that surprising to me anymore.

Lastly: Not all, but a lot of managers/execs I have spoken with did not go to T20 schools; they worked their way up.

**PRE-MED ADVICE:** When I attended a medical school (it was joint with some medical masters programs) infosession (with representatives from schools like Johns Hopkins and Yale attending), they said the “name” of the school you attend doesn’t matter (they made a little joke/jab at Berkeley students in it for the prestige). A 3.2 at Berkeley will not put you above a 3.8 from a lesser-known state school, they said this even with grade deflation in mind. It was… harsh for a lot of students sitting there to take in. They said the smartest decision is to go to the school where you will 1) get good grades, obviously, but also 2) make connections and gain experience. IMPORTANT: They also strongly encouraged taking a gap year to do volunteer work, and that this is the path their best applicants take. I never thought of this. [Disclaimer: I have no interest in medical school or getting a MS in those kinds of majors, I went there with two friends just to learn more for fun, so I can’t really answer any specific med school questions, sorry!]

**2) r/chanceme is super super super wrong a lot of the time (because usually high school students are doing it), so don’t be discouraged if you get negative results!**

If you come on r/berkeley, a lot of us refuse to give you a ""chance me"" because we just find it useless and we can't give you an accurate result anyway.

I would actually advise you guys to stop doing chance me’s, especially if you have anxiety or depression, because I’ve seen a lot of students spiral from getting negative feedback. If you can take it, then sure, by all means, post on that sub, but if you don’t think you can handle it, please don’t do it—it’s not worth the stress.

NOW, ADVICE (sorta): Years ago, people on there said I would be rejected from Berkeley because I had only 2 ECs. But I learned that having 2 ECs you care about and put a lot of time into is better than 6 ones you barely have anything to say for. They also said I would be rejected from USC and UMich and UNC… but I got into all (I’m from CA).

And here’s the other thing, it’s not like I had a 4.0 GPA and 31+ ACT—I didn’t, so I didn’t think I would get in either. But I talked to two of the admissions officers at Berkeley later on in my career and they actually really stressed essays. I don’t remember their word-for-word take on essays, but overall just show that you care (vague, I know, but they don’t wanna give away their secrets lol). ALSO ALSO ALSO: **I learned that getting, say, a 25 ACT, for example, is actually very good depending on the area and school district you come from.** Which makes sense I’ve met students here who got in with 23 ACTs and 1200 SATs. Berkeley is actually planning to put less stress on the exams from what I’ve heard, but don’t quote me on that.

...I should really go study for finals FUCK. Good luck in the application process everyone! Also, if you get rejected by your dream school… happened to me too (Vanderbilt… RIP). But you move on, live life.

If you have any questions comment below. I also typed this hella fast so… there might be some (a lot of) mistakes.

I need help.",throwmeaway70918,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e9c8x8/my_stubborn_mom_is_overspending_and_getting_our/,"I want to give on some background about my mom. She is an impulsive buyer and buys anything that pops out as ""5 star reviews, and works 100% guaranteed"". She doesn't know much English and she believes in anything she sees from Facebook ads to YouTube ads with influencers saying it all works out. She had spent over $500 this past week on skin products, vitamins promising weight loss, and a brace promising a better pose on random sites. She also has control over the family on what we get to buy. She gets mad and yells at my dad when we don't have enough money to buy her products. 

I had tried telling my mom that these sites are a scam and the majority are placebo effects but she would not listen. Due to a medical condition that my mom faced earlier in the year, she had to undergo surgery. The hospital denied us from getting financial aid, and so my dad is stuck still trying to pay off her medical bills. Both of my parents work at minimum wage jobs, although my mom does have some regular clients that gives her tips sometimes. This week I glanced over my dad's savings dwindling down due to him transferring them to his checking to pay off all the bills. 

I'm aware that my dad is in an abusive relationship by my mom. She had threatened to trash his name to the ground by telling relatives and our extended family about what he did. My dad was scared of that happening. He thought about divorce and talked to me and my sister about it a few years ago. He didn't go through with it because he's scared of my mom and he feels that divorce would be devastating for my sister and I. My mom has a very traditional view of life as she carried it over from her home country, and had tried arranging marriages, and a career for me. I did not like her judging me on finding my own path and she comes off as racist sometimes on who I hang out with in college.

I'm currently in college with no job, as I'm focusing on school and trying to get internships. I'm living off of my financial aid trying to save as much money as possible for my future. I had tried asking my mom if she can help me pay for my gas going to school but denied telling me that I should get a job and pay for it. Instead, she sometimes asks me for money to pay for her stuff and never pays me back. When I attempt to ask for my money back, she argues to me about her giving me a roof above my head and food is enough to pay back what she owes me.

Friends had told me to try to live through all of this until I graduate, but it's been hard on me since I can't study at all when my mom keeps bothering me about buying and arguments with my mom and dad about bills and money. 

I don't know who to talk to since I'm not too fluent with my secondary language to have someone get through with her. My mom's sister tried helping her, but my mom ended up calling them names and judged how they live their lives as ""toxic"". Our family now only has connections that are either neutral or friendly to my mom. 

I don't know what can I expect from this subreddit as this is my first time doing so. I've been feeling drained from my upcoming finals and my emotions are decreasing, so I want to vent here in hoping getting some advice to mitigate, resolve or whichever.

Here I want to ask, what should I do?"

My Reflection:
I already have an helpdesk job. I got hired in October, which I literally got the next day, after I passed my 1001. Not because of the A+ honestly, but I had an internship with this company for a month and they called me two months later for a Project and now I’ll be onboard with them as a full contract employee starting in January. I have been doing tickets since November, and it feels great, it’s something that I never imagined I would do, mostly because of that call center environment but I already completed 134 tickets for now, and it’s really satisfying. It was my second attempt for the 1001, and I felt really good about it, I feel good about my 1002 now too but for the 1001 it was different! I was looking for a job, I was desperate, I was applying everywhere, I studied a LOT, I went full out. For the 1002, I honestly studied on and off, mainly because of time, and because it was boring haha. But, yeah this chapter is done, I would like to thank this community for their precious advices and now I will share My advice to you, test taker/s. 

Material that I used: Professor Messer videos, I watched all of them! I didn’t read a single book, I just took practice exams such as Mike Myer’s practice tests, which is pretty cool for practice but if you are looking for something close to the real exam; Jason Dion. If I were you, I would use both just for practice, they both have lots of scenarios which will help you in the test, as it’s heavy on that. Finally, when you feel like, you know a lot more than before, watch Messer’s study groups, as a finisher. Trust me, I watched ALL of them, and it’s amazing how I would gain some kind of knowledge from them. I didn’t use his notes just because I made my notes through his study groups which are basically excerpts from his notes. 
EDIT: I also used these two

https://quizlet.com/121417593/comptia-a-certification-exam-windows-command-line-quiz-flash-cards/#

it's basically for command line commands, which I also didn't get many of them but you could get them, who knows.

I didn’t get any path question for Windows, the only things I got were basically, if you move to another version of Windows, is it going to be an in place upgrade or a clean install, for that I studied a chart that Professor Messer shows in one of his study groups, I took a picture of it and memorized it, I only got a question of that. And I also had 3 PBQS, disk management, two helpdesk scenarios, one where you have to approach the client in a certain way, the other one where you have to tell issue,the resolution, and implementation of preventative measure of two tickets.

Good luck!"

I had plans to continue with a master's after my internship, but given the massive opportunity cost (and opportunity itself) I have my doubts.

I would have to move countries if I would accept the offer (~500km from home). The Uni is in my home country and does not require moving. Not single but no plans to live together yet whatsoever.

e9fsat,266,2019-12-11,Why so many jobs want 5+ years of experience and pay like $20 an hour??,ArAMITAS,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/e9fsat/why_so_many_jobs_want_5_years_of_experience_and/,"I just graduated College with my BS in IT and I did a 4 month internship. I keep getting told I should expect minimum 40K a year for my first job, but I'm seeing a lot of companies wanting to pay less then 50K for senior position. I'm also seeing a lot of jobs wanting to pay 12-15 an hour for a B.S. and like 1 year experience.  This is my experience after looking for jobs in Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Atlanta and few other cities. I'm looking at one right know wanting 5 years experience for $18-$20 an hour.  Then I see a job right next wanting to pay like $16 with at least 1 year IT corporate experience being a requirement.

It is discouraging. I see a lot of jobs wanting to pay like 15 or 16 and hour for what I have... I went over to r/personalfinance and asked about how living off or 15-16 is like in Charlotte or Raleigh-Durham area. I got a lot of people telling me I'm selling myself short.

But when I get on indeed or even talked to a recruiter I'm hearing $15 or $16 not this 40K-50K year salary I keep getting told I should expect.

Am I missing something? What are good entry level jobs? I'm mainly looking at Help desk / desktop support type roles

Edit: here is my concern. There isnt much work nearby, relocating is key for me to find good work. I'd say moving to a different city for a 15 an hour job is not ideal. I guess if I could rough it out for a year and then get a raise or get another job that pays more then it could be worth it. $15 is not great, definitely for a 4 year degree in a field that has high demand. I may not be prepared for the higher wage jobs and need the experience tbh. I'm just aware of how little $15 really is and how tight financially it would make me..."

I wanted to get some information about the process and pointers from you guys about how I can find a team with a mutual fit.

My area(s) of interest are primarily in data mining and information retrieval, though I also have interest and experience in data management and backend services.

My notable experience is as follows:

1) Internship at a previous Big N company where I worked on a ~30K-LoC codebase that provided error attribution services for Android apps (parsed error reports and automatically turned them into tickets in the internal tracker software). The project focused a lot of data management and information retrieval; the product that the team provisioned was a suite of datasets, and one of our primary metrics were ""Is the data attributed in a way that the user would find useful?""

2) Project in classes at school that plans a path for a robot to get from point A to point B w.r.t. a set of polygonal obstacles. Robotics isn't my area, but there was a lot of combinatorial data structures, probability theory and linear algebra involved here, and that's the lingua franca in data mining and information retrieval.

3) I'm a CS and Math major, so I have a lot of theory background in probability theory, stochastic processes, and algebra, so I'd be fine if the work gets really mathematical (as it tends to in data analysis.)

I'm ideally looking for a team that maintains a product's search or discovery backend; think I'd be a good fit there, given my split background in large-scale software and data services.

Some questions I had for you guys, specifically with those that know Google's process specifically:

What goes on in Google's, or really any company's, host matching interviews? What, generally, do intern managers consider to see whether or not a prospective intern is a good fit? What kind of scope do the technical questions have, if any? Is there any way to ""study"" or otherwise prepare for them?"

e9gqmn,3,2019-12-11,Advice Regarding Upcoming Networking Meeting,livecaterpillarflesh,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e9gqmn/advice_regarding_upcoming_networking_meeting/,"I (24M) moved across the country this past summer because of a great opportunity my wife received. Since the move, I have had no luck at all finding a decent job. Right now, I am just working in a restaurant while I try to find a better opportunity. I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Political Science and a minor in History. While I was in school, I worked as an intern on a successful US Senate campaign and later in the official Senate office. I greatly enjoyed the constituent services side of the Senate office, such as helping individuals begin the casework process, answering questions constituents had, and just interacting with the constituents in general. I think I became quite skilled at communicating over the phone and in person with constituents, especially the angry and upset ones.

Since my move, I have applied to many state agency positions, tried to reach out to local politicians and political parties, and also applied to various other jobs that don't relate nearly as much. I have received only two interviews, both of which I was eliminated after the first round. I did not hear back from the majority of my applications and attempts to reach out.

Recently, my wife's uncle offered to reach out to a prominent law firm in my new city which he has some loose professional connections with to see if they may be willing to talk with me and connect me with one of their clients or professional connections to potentially get a job. The managing partner of the firm just reached out to me and said he would like to schedule a meeting with me to talk about what sort of job opportunities I am interested in, so he can see if he has any connections that would be beneficial to me.

I have three concerns about my upcoming meeting.  
First, I work day shifts at the restaurant Monday through Friday. How do I go about getting time off to schedule and attend this meeting? We do not get any breaks, and I am working during the hours the law firm is open. Also, even if I can squeeze in the call to schedule the meeting, how do I get the time off for it? My managers don't know I am looking for a better job, and I'm not sure how they would react if I told them. I am certain that they won't give me a day off to go to a networking meeting.  
Second, I am not very experienced when it comes to networking. What should I expect in this type of meeting. I am very concerned I will come across poorly and embarrass my wife's uncle after he did me such a big favor. He does not personally know the individual I will be meeting with, so he secured the meeting for me based strictly off of his professional connections and reputation.  
Third, I don't exactly know how to go about describing what types of jobs I am interested in. I would love to work in the political field, but I am also very open to other opportunities. I enjoy working directly with people either in person or over the phone. How do I say this and elaborate on this in a way that makes sense, shows that I have thought about it, and sounds professional? I assume that the lawyer I am meeting with has many connection throughout the city, but I don't know who those connections are with. I want to be able to share my interests and experiences with him that relate to connections he potentially has.

I appreciate any and all advice anybody has to offer! Thank you all for reading this and helping!"

That's I struggled a bit with this part but then they person interviewing me gave a few hints and let me start over and I was able to complete it just fine. Then he asked me a few more questions and asked if I had any questions about the work I would be doing or the company.

During the question phase it was revealed that they thought I was applying for an internship. I corrected them and then things got awkward. After a bit of a pause on both ends, he asked if I had any more questions. I was put off by the mistake so I didn't really think of anything good to ask.

e9gv75,4,2019-12-11,Is my work environment toxic?,tama9494,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e9gv75/is_my_work_environment_toxic/,"TLDR; First 'real' job. My coworkers never miss an opportunity to hone-in on someone's mistakes. They'll bond over absolutely slam dunking and criticizing colleagues when out of earshot. Inside jokes are just criticisms against others. Is this typical in most work places? Can anyone with similar experience give me advice? has anyone with a similar experience moved on to find new jobs to escape this?

I'll try to keep this brief. I'm 25, I work at a university. I started working here as my first 'real job' when I turned 23. They picked me up after I graduated offered me an awesome opportunity. I wasn't ready to make that much money right after college, and immediately accepted the position. The first month or so was great, and I felt like I could really connect with my coworkers. There are 7 of us in our shared office in total - only one of whom works for a different department. They each make good money, and 4 of the 7 have over 10 years of experience at the university in each other's presence as directors, VP's, etc (if that means anything). I could tell immediately that they were a VERY tight-nit group, and had a lot of respect for each other. I made a great first impression, which lasted until very recently (I've been working here for about 20 months).

Around three weeks in, I started noticing a pattern with the overhead conversations in our office: they *constantly* make extremely edgy and politically incorrect comments about other colleagues from different offices. My boss would then look over at me and smile, as if to say ""yeah, we're all cool here. Don't be afraid to open up, because none of us have a filter. You're safe to say anything you want here."" I actually found that very comforting at first, that they were such open-books.

But 90% of conversations were about other colleagues from out of our office. And my coworkers have absolutely NOTHING good to say about any of them. My coworkers seemed to bond off of each other's negativity over the years, with their absolute hatred for colleagues from different departments,  who are 9 times out of 10 (ostensibly) very sweet and cordial to them.

The very moment a visiting colleague is out of earshot, before the door fully closes behind them, my coworkers flip a switch from sweet and hospitable to absolutely wretched. They throw some of the most offensive shade you could imagine from someone who was seemingly so sweet and cordial in the other person's presence. Things that are so well-thought and offensive, that it's sometimes pretty impressive.

They seldom talk about anything but the flaws of other people - whether coworkers or recent interns, visitors from different buildings just popping in to say hi. Virtually anyone who is not 'in the group' at our office is suspect to being roasted once out of earshot. To the point where I raise my shoulders and brace for the slew of insults, like I've memorized the timing following any phone conversation or visit.

Here's how a typical day usually pans out:

\*My boss picks up the phone, acts sweet towards a colleague.\* ""Oh you too. Have a lovely day! \*hangs up the phone.\* ""That dumb fucking cunt has a PhD? I can't handle all the stupid in this shithole anymore."" My other boss walks in - ""if she asked you to do \[x\] and \[y\] again, I'll fucking stab her in the throat."" \[this happened Monday morning\].

\*A colleague walks in at some point, and asks one of my two bosses for a simple favor, and is ostensibly very grateful and reasonable with what she asks for\* \*colleague leaves the office\* ""That dirty dirty dirty dirty dirty fucking whore. I'm not doing your fucking job for you. Who the fuck does she think she is? I'm busy doing everyone else's fucking job around here, she'll have to wait her turn."" \[also happened on Monday\]

My other coworker today, who's also a director: ""That's why he got fired. Why does he go on? I would kill myself if I were him. Lost his job, is completely incapable of holding a decent job. His wife is always bitching at him over the phone at work. He must hate himself. Why even bother?"" \[happened during lunch today\] Everyone else just bursts out laughing. The poor guy was let go during the holiday season, and they're joking about how he should kill himself because of it.

They'll make fun of a paraplegic colleague and mock her behind her back - ""Let's be real, she's definitely faking it."" ""I wonder if everything works 'down there', y'know? "".

It might sound like they're just blowing off steam, but this is a daily occurrence, and happens literally every time someone from outside the office interacts with them. They'll always find something to talk about. They'll nitpick little mistakes from higher-level administration during meetings and absolutely roast them behind their backs to no end. But what really disgusts me is that they're completely cordial to these people when they're within earshot.

They seem to feed of each other too, and this 'banter' only ever escalates. They never miss an opportunity to hone-in on someone's mistakes. They'll bond over absolutely slam dunking and criticizing people behind their backs. Inside jokes are just criticisms against other people.

I just cannot stand it anymore. It has seriously thrown me off in terms of my health in social situations, both inside and outside of work. Its been like this for a while, and I'm done sticking things out for the paycheck.

Is this normal work banter? Am I just a ""softie?"" Is any of this typical for work environments? and if not, has anyone with a similar experience moved on to find new jobs to escape this?"

Hello once again, a lot has happened over the past few days. Please read the entirety of the following.

Something felt off on the train. When I got on, it was bustling. Single mothers with Tupperware of leftover food barely staying in the paper bags that contain them, as they try to herd their children in good order before the trip home. Young men in their cheap suits commuting home from their internship, unable to get the holidays off. Men that were like me, skin worn 20 years beyond their age, plunging their overgrown fingernails between the seats, looking for spare change so they could eat tonight.

Those men didn’t know I was like them, though. Today I was one of the young men in cheap suits. My sensitive skin still stinging in the cold air from the dollar store razors I used to hack my mangled growth of thick hair some might call a beard. This suit was my prized possession. For some reason I felt like it was my only hope in returning to a normal life, so I made sure to always keep it in pristine condition. In a lot of ways, it felt good to feel confident in the way I looked again. However, in a lot of other ways, it was uncomfortable as shit. I was extremely exhausted after everything that had happened over the past couple of days, so I decided to get some sleep.

When I woke up, the train was empty. I thought maybe I had stayed on too long, I started to panic a bit. I started sweating, my hands trembled as I dug through my pockets to find my ticket. I read the digital letters that run across the screen for the next stop, then down at my ticket. They both read the same stop. I probably did this 5 more times before I started to feel more at ease. Still, the lack of people made me uneasy.

I got up and walked to the front of the car, nothing but trees with sunlight peering through the tops to the east surrounded me. I peeked through the window on the door, into the car in front of me. No one. I paced to the back of the car and did the same, once again, no one. As soon as the panic slowly made a resurgence through my body, starting with the pit in my stomach, a distorted voice blasted over the intercom. The conductor might as well have been speaking mandarin, but as the train slowed to a stop, I assumed that was my queue.

I slowly stepped onto the cracked concrete and looked around. It looked like something out of the movies. Beautiful fauna nearly enveloping this platform that was no bigger than an elementary school classroom. Cracked concrete mirrored in the glass overhang that covered it. I was pulled out of my awing gaze with a voice that barked my name.

“Mr. *****! We’re here to take you to the interview.”

My eyes darted over, and it was two well-dressed men standing in front of a blacked out limo. I immediately figured I was way under-qualified for this fanfare, and begun to think back if I fabricated anything on my resume that would warrant this kind of treatment as I walked towards the vehicle. I climbed into the back, only to be met by the smiling gaze of another man. He was clean shaven, wearing dark shades, and a dark suit. A clean cut military taper and imposing presence made it clear he was a very important man.

“Welcome to your interview.” He smiled.                                             

I really can’t share too much about the remainder of the interview for privacy reasons, but the important thing is… I got the job! Really can’t wait to get started on my new life, it’s only going to go up from here. I read a lot of your guys’ responses today, there’s a lot of interesting theories, and I’ll try to go back and respond to a few today. Unfortunately, all they are is theories. I’ve been in contact with Bryan via email, and he’s hooked me up with everything that’s been going on since I left. The police were contacted while I was away upon discovery of Pas corpse, and they found the street drug “bath salts” (as many of you suggested, kudos) on his body. I suppose honey, TD-14, whatever you want to call it, isn’t real after all. I’m told he was pronounced dead on the scene, died of self-inflicted wounds, which I probably could’ve guessed.

Apparently Danny and a few others haven’t been seen in a while, the consensus among the residents is that they upped and left after being spooked by Pas death, which makes sense to me. I’m still in Virginia at the moment, finishing up some preliminary paperwork before I head back and collect the rest of my belongings. The folk at my new employment were kind enough to arm me with a work laptop before I even started the job.

One thing I will say about Virginia, is it seems so much warmer than North Carolina, even though it’s further north. Maybe I am just in a good area or something, but I’m really not looking forward to going back. In fact, maybe I won’t. Everything I need is right here after all, and going back there really doesn’t sound like something I need right now. It seems really simple, but there’s really more here than it seems on the surface. I suppose that’s kind of the case wherever you are though, right?

This has been a pretty wild ride, with a relatively anticlimactic conclusion. I guess I was just on edge, and it was my time to get out of that situation. I’m sorry to disappoint you all, I know you guys were as anxious as I was to figure out what was going on, but sometimes life is just disappointing by simply being ordinary. The one big takeaway I got from this experience is if you’re in a situation you want to get out of, find an angle and CAPITILIZE. Please read post script.

 

P.S

Chances are you guys are a little disappointed, so if you’ve made it this far, thank you. It really means a lot to me that so many people on the internet cared about me. Additionally, you might not hear from me for a while as I don’t really have any reason to post on this subreddit anymore.

Many of you reached out, and for that I am truly grateful. Over this ordeal, I have seen a lot of stuff no one should ever have to see, so I will seek therapy. Reading your comments was really cool. Even though they turned out to be nothing. Once I was just a homeless man, looked at as a monster. From now on, I am a productive member of society. United we Stand, despite our circumstances.

There is many of you out there like me, or could find yourselves in a similar position at any moment. Humorous thing about life is, it comes at you fast. Everyone goes through their struggles, and those struggles are not to be taken for granted, nor looked down upon by others. You think you’ve got it all figured out, then life hits you with a curve ball. Gone are the simple days of playing basketball and smoking your dad’s cigarettes. Already I feel a sense of relief, a return to relative normality. Very soon I plan on reaching out to my family, and ask for forgiveness. Even though they caused me pain, I know I made mistakes too. My life is too short to go on carrying grudges. Eagerly I await this next chapter in my life. Due to my new outlook on life, I feel so much warmer and brighter. Really, somehow I feel like this never would’ve happened if it wasn’t for you guys. Unable to get here on my own, I needed help from people in my own community. God, I really can’t thank my friend enough.

Ideally, I’d stay in contact with some of you, as your compassion really means a lot to me. Too bad that I have to get back to work. After all of this, I come away with experience and the realization that I am even tougher than I thought. Sometimes in life that’s all you get. Tomorrow will be a better day, I just know it. Everyone always says the grass is greener, right? Goodbye. Over and Out. Don’t take your life for granted. (:"
e9hde7,0,2019-12-11,Operations Internship at Bulge Bracket vs. Finance Internship at Fortune 1000 Company,hellymoe,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/e9hde7/operations_internship_at_bulge_bracket_vs_finance/,"Hey everyone,

I have recently gotten an offer for an operations summer analyst position at a bulge bracket for 2020, as well as an offer for a finance internship at a F1000 company. I'm having some difficulty deciding on the better offer in terms of exit opportunities and career development, so I was hoping to get some insight from others. Both are the same pay.

My main concern is that while I would rather work at the bulge bracket for it's name and prestige, it is still a role within operations, which is not something I would want to work in post graduation. Would anyone have experience or advice on transitioning out of operations or the difficulty to do so?

The F1000 company's job responsibilities are much more finance-oriented and similar to things I'd like to experience, however lacks the ""brand name"" of the bank.

Any thoughts on making a decision in terms of career progression when I am looking for full time positions upon graduation? Thanks!"
e9hels,1,2019-12-11,My longterm BF wants to move out to live separately but continue our relationship so he can “focus on himself”,bergmade,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e9hels/my_longterm_bf_wants_to_move_out_to_live/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for just over two years, and have been living together since we started dating (long story, it just ended up working out that way). He had a gf when we met and was in a miserable situation being stuck living with her, but we fell for each other and so forth. I expressed concerns about him not having a period of healing before we saw each other, but it’s just how things worked out. 
Although it was a rocky start we have had a quite healthy relationship over the past two years. We have moved across the country and back together and  have established a pretty solid life together. The foundation that holds us together is we make a great team and excel when we are together. We even have worked multiple jobs together which has been successful. 
Fast forward to now, I decided I wanted to go back to school full time this past fall. He agreed to help pick up the slack while I pursue my education. Since then our lives have been very different, he works full time while I’m in school full time. We still continue to split bills and all that, things are very fair between us. The change has affected us a lot, primarily because we’re not the “team” we used to be, so things have felt very different with our separate lives. 
He has been battling depression on and off for about ten years. We recently found out that he has a thyroid problem, and the doc said that is playing a huge role in his hormones and depression. Around the same time of his diagnoses he has been struggling with self love (its always been an issue of his, especially bc his last gf really fucked him up). He has improved tremendously since we started dating, but lately he has been working extra hard to do things just for himself, which I encourage. However recently he decided he thinks it would be best if he lived on his own for a while so he can focus on loving himself. He feels this would be healthy for him/us. But he still wants to continue our relationship. 
Given the situation, I am terrified, and honestly hurt. Yes, terrified of paying double the bills and having double responsibility (like i mentioned we’re a great team and help each other a lot). We also have a dog together, share a car, amongst other responsibilities. When I decided to come back to school he had my back and assured he would help pick up the slack. 
Now I’m really trying hard to not be selfish or irrational. I originally suggested I search for an out of state summer internship. He insists he can’t wait that long. It would be very difficult for both of us to pay bills on our own places, and I (really we) am locked into my lease for another 18 months so moving really isn’t an option for me (and frankly, I don’t want to). 
Selfishness aside, I am not sure I can fathom pushing this “rewind” button on our relationship. I’m am very hurt by his decision. I have stood by his side through so many dark mental times, and I am asking him if we can wait until we get a grip on his thyroid health to see how his mental health improves. Ultimately, my biggest concern is if it’s even healthy to stay together at all. For those of you who may think he’s potentially trying to wiggle out of our relationship, I know he is not. He wants to stay together,  and we are both in a lot of pain over this situation. If he truly felt like he should just be alone completely, I’m not sure he could ever admit it to himself. I am weary of pursuing this for many reasons, but ultimately due to his health and capacity. 
If he can’t love himself enough while we are living together and in a relationship, do you think he can while we are living apart? And what about me? I have already suffered a lot with him through his mental state, should I continue to anymore?"

e9hk82,704,2019-12-11,I’m (18F) not interested in a STEM major anymore and I’m scared to tell my parents,Cpt-Casual,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/e9hk82/im_18f_not_interested_in_a_stem_major_anymore_and/,"So I’m just about finished with my first semester at University, and my current major is computer science. Well we took the final for the class, submitted final projects, all that jazz and my overall grade has ended up being a C or C+. Usually this would be fine to pass a class however for this intro class we need a B to move on. Now I already wasn’t a fan from like the third week of school, and now that I have to retake this class I’m just straight up not having a good time, and when looking at the next class it’s basically the same concepts being taught again, and I really don’t want to do this kind of stuff three times. I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data structures and algorithms just aren’t my cup of tea and I’m bored and not performing as well as I had hoped. 

I was looking through what my university had to offer and I saw something I’m really interested in,  creative media and animation. I already draw and I’m teaching myself how to use blender in my free time and that just sounds way more enjoyable as something I could do as a career. Except like the title says, it’s not a STEM major, and ya know the cliche of starving artists...but I really much rather do something I enjoy rather than what I’m being expected to do despite the average pay being less. 
	
I guess I need help with figuring out if this is a risk and/or just something stupid and if I go through with it how do I tell my parents?

Edit: adding some info cause of repetitive replies, no hard feelings yo

So I have done research, I’m okay with the average annual income and I know that it’ll be tough to start out with but it’s that way for almost everyone so I’m expecting it. I’ve been looking into internships, however as far as I’ve seen they are looking for upperclassmen so I plan on using the time now to building up a portfolio and learn as much as I can inside and outside the classroom because i really want to do this. I’m perfectly content with being able to survive comfortably and do something I love. 

I’m currently receiving financial aid, however my parents have said they’d help me pay it back, but they threatened if I failed  I would be on my own. So that’s a sort of double hit. 

Overall, I’m prepping as much as I can for both short term and long term goals.

Edit2: I don’t plan on studying typical art where I sit down and paint, I specifically want to go into 3D modeling/rigging that could be used in animation and games. 

As someone mentioned, a degree isn’t going to guarantee a job in anything, yes there is high demand for different things but I think looking at this like “you’d actually make money in stem” is unfair.  Again,  I realize that it won’t be easy either way, and I’m not in school to have fun, I’m here because I want to learn, I played it safe and went into CS because I already had some experience with programming, but if I’m already feeling burn out and miserable I don’t want to waste all that time and money. 

I’m fully aware of what I’d be getting into both ways."
e9hljl,20,2019-12-11,Software Engineer in Aerospace vs Quantitative Analyst at Bank,teamblindxo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e9hljl/software_engineer_in_aerospace_vs_quantitative/,"Hi everyone, I'm graduating with my bachelors in mathematics and a minor in computer science this month. I'm from the Los Angeles area and currently attend school here.

Out of my offers, I am seriously considering two:

\- Software Engineer at a big aerospace company I previously interned for. Location: Los Angeles. I didn't like my internship work so I interned at another company this summer. However, I interviewed with a great team and I would be working with Javascript/React.

\- Quantitative Analyst at a big bank. Location: smaller city on the East Coast. I have yet to be placed on a team, so I am unsure of the role and technologies I would be working with.

The bank is paying approximately $10k more than the aerospace company. I was previously leaning towards the bank because of the pay and the company reputation. Moving away would also put me out of my comfort zone in Los Angeles. I would probably move out of my childhood home even if I stay in Los Angeles.

However, I'm realizing pay is less of a priority and I'm not sure how I should proceed. My eventual goal is to be a software engineer at a big tech company, and even though there is a negative connotation with aerospace, I can't help but wonder if the software engineer role at the aerospace company would be better for my career.

What are your thoughts?"

I will be graduating with a full time MBA from a top 10 US b-school in May 2020 and have the opportunity to join a Corporate Strategy team at a large tech firm (think Cisco/Intel/IBM/Oracle type)

TC: Base: ~160k, Bonus: ~35K. No RSUs

I have to accept/decline the offer by the end of the year (Dec 2019) but my other option (recruiting for just in time Product Management roles) will likely not start in earnest before Jan/Feb 2020. My primary consideration is: Which of these will set me up for a successful career as a Tech Executive in the long term? [Compensation/Learning/Impact are my priorities]

**Corporate Strategy at a large tech firm:**  
***Pros:***  
1) Extremely well reputed within the company. Completely revamped in the last 5 years with a big focus on individual development and targeted consulting style assignments  
2) Considered to be a pipeline for future org leaders. Opportunity to move into functional/product roles in a couple of years if desired  
3) Exposure to org level big picture strategic thinking (something I don't have professional work experience doing)  
4) Exposure to c-suite  
5) Colleagues are mostly from other top 10 US b-schools  

***Cons:***  
1)TC in the short/medium term is likely to be lower than a PM role in the Bay Area  
2) The company is in a very difficult phase and it is unclear what the future holds  
3) Straying too far away from the technical side of things  

***Unsure:***  
1) How easy will it be to move to Corp Strategy/business strategy roles in other tech firms?  
2) How easy will it be to use my software engineering + Corp Strat experience to move into PM roles in other tech firms?  
3) Unsure what the industry perception of this particular Corp Strategy group is  
4) The team in its current form is only 3-4 years old. There haven't been too many external transitions yet  

**Recruiting for Product Management:**  
***Pros:***  
1) TC likely to be much higher in the short/medium term  
2) Reasonably confident that I will be able to use my software engineering experience + PM internship experience + MBA to get into a PM role (with sufficient preparation)  

***Cons:***  
1) While I am confident of getting a PM job next year, I do not have a PM job now  
2) Will likely never be able to get into a Corporate Strategy role if I don't do it now  
3) Will not get the big picture strategic exposure  
  

Would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you very much for you time."

I had obtained my associate degree in mathematics at a local community college before transferring and it was at the community college that I took my first Co-Sci class and fell in love with coding and the feeling of accomplishment I got from doing it.

But, to be honest, that's all the coding I have experienced, I have just a small amount of HTML and CSS from starting a Udemy course over the summer before classes started again, since then I haven't looked at any web-dev stuff at all. The only coding I have done over the last few months is learning basic data structures like trees and linked lists in C++, and then some theorem proving in ACL2.

I came across an email that said they were looking for a local computer science intern, I didn't (and honestly don't) feel ready for it, however, it is a paid internship and being a 21 year old father, times are tough, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to just apply. I applied and was pretty instantly offered an interview, which I gladly took, and will be conducted tomorrow afternoon.

At first I was just excited that I was even considered for the position because I didn't lie on my resume or anything, but didn't think too much on it because I have a lot of finals coming up and a few projects I needed to get coded. Now the interview is tomorrow and I'm pretty much just scared shit-less that I am going to go embarrass myself.

e9olwl,53,2019-12-12,Should I continue with my IT Career?,moderatenerd,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/e9olwl/should_i_continue_with_my_it_career/,"I've been fired from most of my IT jobs  and I think it's a combination of both working for crappy companies and my lack of skills/not meeting their expectations. I managed to find one stable job for five years, despite graduating with a degree in information systems in 2012 and working in IT ever since.

Here's a little history:

2012- Graduated college with no real IT network or certifications. It took me a year to find any job in IT. I only found out about IT certs in 2017, but held off on taking them b/c I hate tests and had no real idea on which ones to take.

2012-2013- Took various IT gigs that didn't go anywhere. One was PHP internship, one was a shipping/receiving clerk which was also an IT assistant.

2013- took IT assistant role at small furniture company where the manager gave me a shot to modernize their systems and update their computers/website. Once I did that and offered larger projects to streamline their infrastructure they backed off and replaced me with a cousin 9 months later.

2014- Took job at a small startup in Boston where I was QA and technical projects analyst. They hired me for a three month contract and decided not to renew it.

2014-2019- Got a job at a toxic non-profit that always cut corners because they had no money and didn't care at all about technology. I was able to do what I wanted for the most part as long as issues were resolved and computers were updated. In those 5 years I (thought I) learned a lot and automated everything and got vendors to take care of the rest, by 2016 I promoted myself to sysadmin but I was getting bored so I tried applying for other jobs to no avail.

2019- took a job at an MSP, yes I heard the horror stories, but figured it wasn't all that bad and that I could make it work. I figured I could restart my career here. I was hired as a level II technician, but they never saw me as a level II and never really gave me a chance to prove myself. They didn't want me to ""learn on the job,"" and I was fired in two months.

Is this track normal or am I in the wrong field?

Now, I'm in a bind. I have two potential job offers incoming. One for best buy and the other for a non-profit that has money. My self confidence has been pretty much shattered in the past two years. Though the CEO of the MSP did say I know my stuff, and said that I need to apply to in-house positions. So the non-profit seems perfect and pays great ($80K), however, the non-profit while it pays great commute would be killer 2 hrs and $600 a month just to get there and my self confidence has me doubting I could even do the job. Best Buy would pay way less (like $15 hr), be a 10 min commute have more potential for career advancements/promotions and I could possibly jump into other non-technical careers depending on what I like.

EDIT: Wow this blew up. Thanks for all the responses everyone. Some tough love here but I need it desperately. Looks like I've been doing this all wrong I guess and I could have used a mentor or 2 along the way. Never found one IRL that was as passionate about IT as you guys are."

e9u226,2,2019-12-12,Anxiety and video games are ruining my life.,pinkbamboozle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e9u226/anxiety_and_video_games_are_ruining_my_life/,"I want to preface this by saying I am very aware that some people will probably see my situation as still quite fortunate and that I should be more grateful for what I have. I am aware of this and think about it on a daily basis, but unfortunately that doesn't stop the fact that I am still miserable and it's keeping in a permanent state of massive anxiety.

Growing up I had always been the really ""smart"" kid that would get the best grades whilst barely working, as a result I've developed a terrible work ethic, always procrastinating and putting things off to the last minute (which hadn't been an issue and went unnoticed since I still got great grades), I also started to play more and more video games in my free time as a result. I also think I enjoyed that identity so much that I seek to maintain it wherever I go (making of point of leaving things late and barely doing work to show others that I can get away with it) I essentially managed to keep this going all the way through high school and eventually got into a great Ivy League school.

My first semester went well, I went to all my classes, did all the work (though still never did anything optional, no office hours, section, etc) on time and ended the semester with a 3.6. Things started changing my second semester though. I started playing more games and started coming up with excuses to justify me skipping classes, putting off work, thinking ""oh it's not a big deal if I hand it in a day late, I'll just play games tonight..."". This lead to several instances of me missing BIG deadlines, waking up late for an exam, forgetting a cheat sheet we were allowed to prepare in advance, etc. This was a major trigger but ultimately not the biggest source of my current troubles. Missing classes, a deadline, or fucking up an exam would lead to MASSIVE anxiety, to the point where I would be too anxious to simply show up to class as it would make me realize how behind I have become on the class leading to more anxiety etc. I averaged a 2.9 on my second semester. I also started going to sleep extremely late (2am+) which I think I do due to my anxiety since the longer I stay up the longer I ""delay"" the next day's responsibilities. My third (current) semester is essentially looking like a repeat of the second, I am behind on most of my classes, anxious about all of them, have missed deadlines and outright missed some assignments (checking current assignments is also a source of anxiety since it also shows me the ones I missed so I tend to rely on friends that are in the same class for deadline reminders), I also have 1000+ unread e-mails on uni account, also to anxious to read them.

The career path I want to follow is very competitive and a good GPA is must for landing important internships. I had told myself at the end of the previous semester that I was done fucking around and I would take the next semester way more seriously but that clearly hasn't worked. I know the solution is starring me in the face: don't get behind on work, get organised, create a timetable with everything you need to do and work your ass off to bring your grades back up. My anxiety and horrible work habits are making this extremely difficult though.

My parents are aware that my grades aren't as great as they could be but they have no idea about the extent of this.

Every time I contemplate my situation I start panicking at the thought that I won't be able to pursue the career I want, that my parents are going to learn about my declining grades, get mad, that I am a failure and that I am so dumb for letting this happen when all I had to do was keep my first semester's grades going. Even my friends are unaware of this, they just think I'm smart and take courses in which I can barely work and still get good grades.

I'm happy to answer any questions if more info is needed, and I know that there is no easy solution to this, I guess at this point I'm realizing that nothing will change if I don't reach out, and reaching out anonymously is realistically the only thing I'm willing to do. I'm hoping that someone went though something similar and can help walking me through what they had to do to change their path. I need to break the cycle of bad grades -&gt;anxiety -&gt;avoid sources of anxiety (class/work)-&gt;more bad grades.

Also to be clear, I know my story may make it seem like I'm addicted to video games. I honestly doubt this is the case, my procrastination will just as often be spent on reddit/youtube/netflix, and I have no attachment to any particular game, if you told me I could never play games again for the rest of my life it wouldn't be that big a deal to me, it's just a convenient time waster that draws my attention away from what makes me anxious.

Thanks in advance. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated."
e9u58m,6,2019-12-12,"Returning to school soon, looking for financial advice on how to proceed with student loans/using savings.",Haligonita,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/e9u58m/returning_to_school_soon_looking_for_financial/,"Hey all, hoping some of you can give me some genuine advice to help me ease my debt jitters.

My situation:

\-23F, currently living with partner of 2.5 years.

\-I have a diploma in Environmental Engineering Technology from a community college, haven't been able to find a job with it except for a stint in Inside Sales. I've talked to career counselors, had my resume professionally looked at, and applied to dozens of jobs for months - the field seems to be a dead end here. I've also realized that I'm not cut out for the manual labour part of it and am much happier in a warm office solving puzzles than collecting samples on a construction site.

\-No debt, working in a depressing call centre for 15$/hour. $7000 in my chequing account.

\-I have 9.5k in a TFSA with TD e-series index funds.

\-Registered to return to school in January to study Computer Information Systems. I think this degree would be a solid investment given that IT and programming jobs along with business analysis skills are currently very marketable. I've done some programming (Introductory Python, Introduction to Computer Science, a 21 day JavaScript challenge) and I enjoyed it a lot. Considered doing computer science, but I feel like the difficulty and workload would make working while in school too difficult and would prevent me from getting a GPA high enough for scholarships. I would rather work on programming in my own time and do a minor in comp sci to supplement a more well rounded education.

\-I plan on doing co-ops and summer internships to amass as much experience as possible and to offset the school year costs.

\-I also hope to land a waitressing job soon (I have experience) and work on the weekends to make enough to pay my monthly living costs.

\-I pay \~500/month for rent and utilities (my partner is generously taking on more than me). I also pay 110/month for car insurance on an old Pontiac Vibe which I bought outright, and 25/month for my phone bill. Hoping to get the car insurance down by switching to liability only insurance. Considered selling but I will need it for grocery runs. Will be bussing to school to save on gas.

\-Tuition is $9000/year. I will have to do 4 years (5 with co-op) because the university won't accept my community college credits. Not eligible for any entrance scholarships because I'm a transfer student, but also not getting any credits.. It's a rough deal.

I personally have a low risk tolerance so the idea of graduating with $30k in debt is really stressing me out - not sure what the economy will be like when I graduate, and I recognize that I will be losing 4 years of saving for retirement and my entire savings. But if the alternative is a stagnant career, it seems that I have no choice in the long run. A degree seems to be a barrier to entry into so many careers that I figure I should take the plunge if I want a good life and more career satisfaction.

I am looking for advice on it all, but one thing in particular that I am unsure about is how to treat my TFSA during this period. My loans/grants were limited this semester because they take expect me to use my TFSA to pay for my expenses. I would obviously rather keep getting returns on it and use it to pay a chunk when I graduate, but the gov doesn't like that. They did say though that I can apply for an RRSP exemption of 2000/year for each year I've been out of high school (4 years = 8000). I'm wondering it it would be worth it to move my savings into an RRSP to increase my award amount, or if the flexibility of the TFSA is worth keeping it in there. I understand that withdrawing from an RRSP can be a pain because of up front taxing and losing contribution room etc, but it seems unlikely that I will ever max it out anyways so I'm a bit confused about what to do.

I know I don't have a lot to work with, but any tips on how to get myself to a good place when I graduate would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers!"

Since then I've worked at a local IT company with roughly 10 people. I inherited a couple of websites (React/Laravel) and have been building them out since. The other part of my job is doing help desk stuff, installing win 10, replace HDD, driver issues, etc. I've been looking for work because there is no mentorship, deadlines, or guidance of any sort on the development side. I still feel very green as I only learned JS and PHP since starting this job. So my job isn't a full time dev job and I haven't learned really any best practices (Agile Methodology, Unit Tests, Code Review) so I feel dishonest saying I am a dev on my resume/LinkedIn. The worst part is my coworkers don't really give me any respect being far younger than all of them, and I've been told by some ""but youre not really a programmer tho"". 

The flip side of this is listing my current job as ""IT Technician"" and end up getting filtered out of postings. 

TL;DR: New grad (June '19), working at a small local IT company, 50% of my work is making a web app we plan to deploy to some client, the other 50% is help desk tier. Can I list as a dev on LinkedIn?"
e9u80p,1,2019-12-12,Need help making my first career decision,UserNumber357,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e9u80p/need_help_making_my_first_career_decision/,"I am lucky enough to have 2 offers, one from FAANG and one from a fortune 1,000 company. FAANG obviously pays much more but the position and location isn’t as appealing to me (firmware, Bay Area) whereas the other position is within ML/CV in NY.

All of my internship experience is within firmware and I have been trying to move out of it as I feel it is a niche with not many job opportunities where I’d like to live. So even if I take the FAANG offer, I’d be self studying to try to transition into ML/CV. 

So I guess the basis of this whole situation is which person are you more likely to interview down the road:
- FAANG firmware engineer, self studied ML/CV
- ML/CV engineer at a company you haven’t heard of.

Having the money from the more reputable company would obviously be nice, but so would working on more interesting problems in a better location. Thanks"

I got diagnosed and put on medication last year before trying college again and it's been a total change- I'm doing really well, I turn in all my homework (even if it's occasionally late), and I've got a 3.8 GPA. I graduate next fall at 25 and my professors are all assuming that I'm going to grad school since I'm in a STEM field and doing a math minor. They're recommending summer internships and offering recommendation letters and I'm PANICKING y'all. 

I internalized for years that I was terrible at school and it was a pipe dream to have high career ambitions and now I kind of think I want to try????? I'm terrified that I'll fail and waste the time and money. I'm also married and the career move for my husband would put him in offices for his job that are a lot busier and closer to his boss's boss. He's willing to do it if it's something I want but I don't want to put him under a lot more work stress and then fail so that adds a whole layer to the anxiety. If you've gone through grad school please tell me that it's not impossible. My professors now all describe me as hard-working (very new thing for teachers to think about me) and capable. I'm afraid that maybe they're right?  I'm also a woman and don't want to contribute however mildly to the ""women in science aren't as good as men"" even though I know that's not my responsibility personally."
e9vt4k,2,2019-12-12,College Student Looking for Tips to Get Into Embedded Programming,VincentYards,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/e9vt4k/college_student_looking_for_tips_to_get_into/,"Hello!  


TLDR: I would like some tips on how to get into embedded programming using C and preferably a NXP board (any C-based board will do) in order to attain some internships this summer. I said NXP specifically, as it is the board Tesla recommends to learn. High goals, I know haha. Furthermore, I would like some tips on how to set up that board and use it for projects or where to find the needed information. 

I am a CPE student at college. I recently transferred to a university where I just introduced to my first FPGA course using System Verilog. The topic heavily intrigued me and I would like to delve further. 

I have a background in System Verilog, C, and C++. In addition, I have experience using Vivado and the Basys3 board. Lastly, I understand the E&amp;M and circuitry typically seen from a 3rd year CPE student (at my school, this is equivilant to the skills of a 3rd year EE student, as they share a majority of classes).   


PS: I have searched this on this sub reddit and a few others. The recommendations there were not as clear as I hoped; however, if you would like to recommend a post I did not catch, I would be happy to see it.   


Thanks again everyone :)"
e9w160,1,2019-12-12,Should I just self study ?,QuestionYourMorals,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/e9w160/should_i_just_self_study/,"I am currently in a program that pays for my study class, books, and certification test. The catch is each class is about a month to almost 2 months long before you get your voucher code for the test. You also must go in order for the classes. The order is CompTIA IT fundamentals, CompTIA A+, Network+, then Security+. I just ended my IT fundamentals class. Here is when things get kinda stupid.

I am currently a cyber security intern with about a year of experience. I have a security+ book that I haven’t touched and I’m also teaching myself python. This IT fundamentals class was taught using ucertify which is mostly a self study platform anyways. I completed all of the work for the course 3 weeks before the class was even over. My internship had a change in work flow so I ended up missing about 4 classes going to work and training. I emailed my instructor and he told me I was fine and he has no worries.

Today I emailed the lady who hands out the vouchers for taking the the cert test and let her know that I never received my voucher. I was told that it was because I failed the course due to being absent and that I must go through all of the work and get at least an 85%. I notified her that my ucertify shows 100% and the instructor even gave me the certificate showing I completed the class. I am currently waiting on her response but feel like due to the rules I will have to do it all over again. 

I really don’t want to waste my time doing an IT fundamentals class that I finished weeks before my classmates that I failed solely because of attendance regardless of me scoring a 100% on the mastery test. Should I just self study for the security+ leave the program ?"

e9wztg,0,2019-12-12,23 year old in IT looking for a career advice,[deleted],AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/e9wztg/23_year_old_in_it_looking_for_a_career_advice/,"Hello all, I'm a 23 year old who works in IT. I never really had an interest in technology, and only went into it because someone told me to do so because that's where the money is at. I've worked two internships and I had my first full-time job as IT specialist (I'm technically ""IT security"" but all I do is either troubleshoot O365 problems, configure computers or do inventory). I have found that I enjoy throwing the garbage off more than troubleshooting and configuring computers (or tracking inventory). I just got an advanced cloud security certification (Azure Security Engineer) by self studying for 6 months and it made me miserable. The idea, just the idea, that I have to set my own lab, be attached to my phone 24/7 reading about the latest breaches and constantly be spending 30 hours outside of work to be self studying different tech makes gives me a real headache, because it seems like such a huge commitment for something I couldn't care less about. As a result, I'm already thinking about a career change.  


BUT   


I want to give the IT field a chance, by trying out forensics and cyber threat intelligence. The first reason is the functionality of them. I found InfoSec interesting because of the functionality of it. I didn't care for technology, but protecting people's assets that could potentially ruined their life seemed like a meaningful mission. Cyber threat intelligence seems to be more about conducting research and analysis. It's almost like a political analyst but a tech version. Someone who looks at the latest methods, and writes reports. I find that interesting as one of my main interests in college was political science and especially foreign affairs. Cyber threat intel seems to be the closest thing to my interest. Would you advice someone who does well in research, interesting in foreign affairs, and good with technology (but doesn't want to troubleshoot and configure the damn things) to go into cyber threat intel? Another concern I have is hours. Not everyone agrees but I happen to think that work life balance is important, and the last thing I need is to work like a doctor or a banker (I didn't go into those fields for a reason). If I get enough time to have a social life, work out, and do things that give me joy in life (music) then I'm happy. Do you find that this career is more geared toward extremely long hours or are you able to have a life outside of work?

Trying for a full time job at my Zoo!,Thayn973,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/e9x2f7/cover_letter_reviewcritiquesuggestions_trying_for/,"I have been working at the Cincinnati Zoo for two years now as an intern/volunteer/seasonal and a full time position just opened and I want the best shot at getting it. Can you give me some advice/critque r/resumes?

&amp;#x200B;

  

Dear Interpretive Staff,

I am truly excited to apply for a full-time position in the Interpretive department. I’ve worked in a volunteer and seasonal manner for Interpretive for the past two years. I’ve come to truly care for the animals we keep and I believe I have developed a reputation and presence that would fit wonderfully with the rest of the team on a full time basis. All of the experience and training I’ve gained being a seasonal keeper for the past 9 months enables me to start this full time position at full speed, with little initial training and delays for the interpretive staff.  

I have personally learned not only the routines for each building in interpretive, but tried to master how my various mentors wanted them done. I try to actively treat each job with the same level of commitment and enthusiasm that I was taught as an intern and volunteer, and I want to maintain both out of respect for the animals and the team. I have also strived to build my reputation as being reliable and always willing to help; traits I have always believed and seen as strongly important for this department. I think my already stable presence would make the transition easy, since I would not require much if any new training on the husbandry routines for Education, and could quickly get into the regular patterns and leave myself open to focusing other aspects of being a full time keeper, such as Zims use and training routines. 

My time and experience with this department has been nothing but amazing, and with this opportunity I believe it has solidified my confidence that I am definitely the right man for the job. I know this department will scour the interested applicants for only the best person, and will select the applicant who will not only best care for our animals, but also strive to fit in with the team and promote a good dynamic. I hope my time with the department, and the team’s experience with me will speak for me and that you will consider me to become a permanent part of your team. Thank you, and may the best zookeeper win."

Hi everyone,

I am a Computer Engineering (nope not CS lol) student minoring in Econ and I've been lucky enough to receive SDE Intern offers from both JP Morgan in Columbus and Big A in Portland for next summer. But I'm having trouble deciding which one I should choose. I've accepted JPM since they offered really early.

**Big A**

Pros: Great salary, one of the biggest tech companies, name recognition, good company to put on resume for future jobs, Portland seems like an awesome city

Cons: Possible bad WLB, very mixed reviews on their internship program and company culture as a whole

**JP Morgan**

Pros: Apparently is extremely technologically advanced as a company (coming from previous employees), also great name recognition, very competitive salary, close to where I currently live so I would not have to move, interesting because of the econ minor

Cons: mixed reviews on company culture and WLB, not the greatest offers for FT positions, not a tech-focused company like Big A

I am not sure which one is really the better offer and which one would be best for the future. Any advice or thoughts are appreciated!"

2) I am a Mech E sophomore with currently no internships on the table, but a strong set of personal projects that are very aligned with Apple's aesthetic. I am still looking hard for something this summer, but don't expect Apple until quite a bit later (working at Apple is the goal for me)"

Semesters come to an end, and I thought it would be nice to reflect on the new grad job hunt. Statistics are shown below, and if you don't want to read everything, a summary's also below that.
 
[sankey diagram](https://imgur.com/a/AFGaAwi)

 **Statistics:**

Companies applied to: 137

Responses: 37

Hackerranks/Online Assessments: 19

Total Phone Interviews (initial and post-OA): 23

Onsites: 10

Total Offers: 3 (1 return)

Withdrawn Applications: 17

**Summary/Takeaways From my Experience:**

- Keep applying; I didn't receive other offers until late October.

- Leetcode is insanely prevalent in techhubs. I was asked LC style questions in almost every interview.

- Heaps, Tries, and Intervals come up very often. DP does not. I was quite surprised that I ran into 
questions using heaps and tries so frequently. Apart from the typical topics (strings, linked lists, trees, array, graph, etc.), I would definitely spend more time on those topics if I could redo this cycle. I also ran into Merge Intervals (and variants of it) at least 5 times. I was asked a fat 0 dynamic programming questions and spent the most time preparing for it. That being said, my friend was given like triple DP hard questions for his Google interview, so YMMV.

- System Design is just as important as Leetcode - I was asked to explain the structure of one of my projects or a typical sys-design question in many of my interviews and had at least 1 system design round in every onsite, but I didn't have to deeply address topics like scalability or things that are probably more relevant to senior devs. I'd say this is really just Object-Oriented Programming, but I had occasional chances to talk about scalability and real world implications which was cool.

- Career fairs are busted: My response rate at career fairs was considerably higher. (58% vs 21%). I was rejected from Bloomberg from my online application, but got to a final round interview from my career fair.

- Browse /r/cscareerquestions in moderation. I browsed the subreddit almost everyday (to the detriment of my mental health). I saw so many doom and gloom posts, posts from students (some not even in college yet) giving advice as if they were industry veterans (I am guilty of this too, but I try to only answer questions geared towards people like me and give disclaimers when I can), and people just generally shitting on other people/companies not in FAANG (or the reverse of shitting on someone because they want to join a FAANG). I found that noting certain users who were experienced, level-headed and gave good advice/insights was pretty helpful as far as filtering through some of the chaos. (/u/talldean and /u/nutrecht in particular are people who come to mind)

- Take this post with a grain of salt. I'm just some college student who wants to share his experience in recruiting. I am not experienced enough to make judgments on the industry, nor am I some super genius coding whiz. I am honestly a quite below-average student at CMU.

**For context:**

- I am not a Computer Science Major. (Statistics &amp; Machine Learning) Some of the interviews I did reflected this and were more probability/data oriented. My response rate was likely lower than that of a typical CS student at CMU.

- I had 2 internships and a programming instructor job from past years.

- My GPA was OK (3.4). It was enough to pass cutoffs, but I don't think it was anything eye-popping.

I felt that I had a better-than-average recruiting season. However, I also felt that I ran into more obstacles that I had not experienced in previous years- namely, companies only hiring for interns and being rejected because I moved my application too slowly. I know that intern classes fill up too, but this was the first time I've received responses from recruiters that I had performed well on the interview , but was being rejected because there were no more spots. (i.e Redfin)

My preparation involved skimming CTCI (for behavioral and core topics to address), Leetcode, and skimming Competitive Programmer's Handbook. I did not whiteboard or code out any of the practice problems for CTCI; I only looked at the question and thought of the solution in my head to check. I mostly used CPH for Dynamic Programming preparation, which I ended up not being asked at all for the entire cycle.

I began applying at the start of September and sent 137 applications. I applied to almost exclusively tech-hubs (around 10% NYC, 10% Seattle, 70% SF/Bay Area, and 10% other). I had my return offer from Capital One that expired on October 25, but I was surprised to find that I was unable to speedup the process for most companies.

My overall response rate was 27%, but I found a huge difference between shotgunning online applications and going to career fairs. I had an insane 58% response rate from companies I talked to at my school's career fairs, and a lot of these companies didn't even have openings online for new-grad; they recruited almost exclusively from these events.

I was pretty overwhelmed with balancing recruiting and classwork. After around the 2nd week of September, I was getting responses everyday and my schedule quickly filled up. I had an interview (sometimes multiple) everyday from mid-September to late October. I was missing weeks of classes due to onsiting and often scheduled interviews 2-3 weeks in advance because I couldn't do them earlier.

This probably ended up messing up some of my interviews and recruiting. Because I was scheduling so far in advance, my timeline was greatly increased and it resulted in some rejections due to the company being done with new-grad recruiting, my requested location running out of spots, or just being too burnt-out to continue interviewing. Once I had received an offer I was happy with, I didn't want to interview anymore and withdrew the rest of my active applications. My grades had also began to seriously suffer from missing class and I just wanted the season to end. I ended up withdrawing my application from Google, Amazon, Bloomberg, TripAdvisor, Epic, Roblox, and a host of other smaller companies. I felt especially guilty about Bloomberg and Amazon because I had spent so much time on their intermediate interviews to get to their final rounds only to quit.

The Blind 75 List was very efficient as far as studying Leetcode went. I felt pretty comfortable with almost all of my online assessments and interviews. I was unable to finish only 1 leetcode-style coding challenge (although I found that passing hackerranks did not guarantee moving on to the next round; I finished Samsara's in 10 minutes to get ghosted). Of the phone screens and onsites I did not pass, one was due to forgetting the syntax for raising an error in Python, one was due to blanking out on generating permutations, and one was due to being completely stuck and not knowing what data structure to use. (k-sorted array). I also failed a couple of trivia/quiz based hackerranks and failed a non-trivial amount of behaviorals. (if I wasn't feeling it/couldn't make a connection with the recruiter, I usually just completely bombed it)

Of the questions I was asked, the topics I ran into the most were trees and intervals by far. I was also asked a non-trivial amount of strings, linked-list, array, trie, and heap/priority queue based questions. I was asked 0 dynamic programming questions. The system-design I was asked mostly involved designing a simple application/product, (like UML diagrams) although I was often given the opportunity to discuss other things like scalability/parallelism, implications on user experience, real world feasibility, and tradeoffs.

My first onsite was in early October and was with Mastercard(formerly APT). I ended up being so nervous for that interview that I didn't end up with much sleep and ended up completely bombing the first round. I did pretty well the rest of the day, but I already knew in my heart that I had failed, which ironically lifted a lot of the pressure off of me and probably made me perform well on subsequent rounds. I was feeling really bad after that so I ended up taking a couple days off from recruiting after I flew back.

I ended up with 2 offers (not counting return). One was with a late stage startup in LA (Clutter) and the other was a public fintech company in SF (LendingClub). I was very satisfied with both companies (contrary to what I had read online, and was very happy with what I saw in person) so I knew I was going to decide between the 2 of them. In the end, my decision came down to solely personal reasons, so I ended up taking the latter. I wouldn't be surprised if the former became a unicorn in 2020 though and exploded in evaluation.

So that was my recruiting season; I felt like a huge mountain was lifted off my shoulders once I signed. The highlight of recruiting was definitely the hotels and meal reimbursement; delivering $20 worth of boba to my hotel and showering in glorious bathrooms were definitely 10/10 experiences. This process definitely has a lot of luck involved - and I know that it probably doesn't mean much coming from some random person, but if you're struggling and losing hope, I get it. I felt especially awful in October and felt that I was a complete idiot who couldn't hope to pass any onsite. I was watching people I knew secure huge offers from well known companies and I couldn't help but feel jealous and ask why that couldn't be me. The only advice I have in regards to that is to keep applying and that it only takes 1 company. If you applied to 1000 places and get 1 offer that you enjoy, then does it really matter what the results were for the 999 other applications? And also, take /r/cscareerquestions in moderation; my mental state was definitely not helped from religiously browsing the subreddit."

I was on a Skype call with a PI from another lab (and also from another university) discussing whether I should apply to the PhD position they're offering for next year. He told me what new potential projects the lab would be working on and I told him what I've been doing during my internship this fall and what I'm going to do for my Masters thesis.

Here comes the conundrum: I also mentioned a side project that my supervisor would like to carry out in the future where we would apply a methodology (i.e. decoding algorithms) that I would like to use for my thesis as well. 

The PI I was talking to works in a different but still related field (computational neuroscience and motivational factors) and with totally different techniques than mine (cognitive neuroscience with not much computational stuff), but I'm terrified I have ""given away"" the idea for my supervisor's project and someone might ""steal"" it or something.

I'm sorry if this seems like a dumb question. I've started sending applications to PhD positions in the last couple of months but I never had the chance to talk with someone from a lab I would like to work in and I'm unsure if I've broken any unwritten rules with this tendency of mine to talk too much.

And it is my own fault for not doing well on some new requirements this quarter. First some background:

I'm an Information Systems grad (Summer 2018) from a state school. Decent grades, no internships, no prior employment experience. When I was applying for college I almost immediately got a callback from an Indian contracting company in a big tech hub. What sold me was that the client they work with in the area is a big company that'd look great on a resume, so I jumped on the offer. The pay was below average for the area but I could do a lot worse for a first job out of college.

I was on ""the bench"" for a few months until I finally got put on a project that is actually pretty technical (this is definitely not the norm for projects here, so I got kind of lucky). It's basically DevOps but I do a lot of work with cloud architecture and databases, SQL, C#, and Java. 

There are structural problems in the team for sure. Right now onsite it's just me, another guy who's a recent college grad, a lead, and my PM, but we have a large offshore team of like 15 people. Basically all the offshore members are super technical, have years of industry experience, and are thus assigned the majority of the work on the project. When I have technical or code-related issues I generally have to talk to offshore about it because they know the most, and that's pretty inconvenient (we have hour-long evening meetings with offshore every Sun-Thurs, usually I talk with some of them afterwards for help on tasks). But our project itself is generally going well and our clients are happy with the work the team's doing.

Currently though, I've been working on a requirement and it's not going great. The PM is on vacation and so is our immediate client, and the only person I can really work with onsite is my lead. The code I wrote is in production but there's some problems with one of the outputs that only I caught, albeit a few days after the code went live. This output isn't critical but it will be a problem now that the backfill is complete. I told my lead about it and engaged offshore for help on the problem but I still feel horrible about it. It's my code and I should have been watching it like a hawk. This issue and another one where one of our clients reached out to me for help fixing an unrelated bug, me asking for one of the offshore leads for help on it and him being unresponsive, and the client suddenly pushing to get it resolved sooner than the 1-day window we gave, me not responding immediately to him requesting a status update on it because he messaged at 6 PM, and the aforementioned offshore lead getting mad at me for not resolving this/responding earlier is seriously stressing me out. 

I feel like all of these things are totally my fault and I'm not cut out for this industry. I've struggled with depression and anxiety most of my adult life and my anxiety in particular has exploded in the past month. I've got a constant sense of dread that makes me actively fear waking up in the morning. My next performance review is coming up, and I'm sure when my manager comes off vacation and gets caught up to speed he'll at least have me taken off the team if not fired outright (he's said before that I need to ""have more ownership,"" and now that I do and shit is burning around me, I've clearly failed to meet his expectations). I just feel like I'm a deadweight, I've finally been exposed as a fraud and now even our clients are aware, and it's gonna lead to me being canned, our client terminating their contract with us, and me being like blacklisted from the industry or something. Just slightly irrational but that's how I feel.

My financial situation isn't dire. I don't have any debt or loans to pay off. I live with my girlfriend and have enough saved up that I could be unemployed for almost a year. I know I could probably land a job somewhere else. But my depression and intense paranoia keeps manifesting regardless; I'm thinking of suicide almost constantly now. I'm going to meet a therapist tomorrow though.

I guess I just wanted help and advice on what to do in a situation like this. Is work going to be hard to find if I get canned for a performance reason, and my degree isn't actually in CS? Is the shit job I've done so far a sign that I'm not cut out for this field in the first place? 

Sorry for the wall of text."
ea1x09,8,2019-12-13,Keep on failing online assessments - don’t know what to do,laviub,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ea1x09/keep_on_failing_online_assessments_dont_know_what/,"Hi everyone,

It’s that time of the year again when most of us students are applying for summer internships…

I have been applying for internships at consulting companies and big consumer companies and even if most of the times I get invited to take an online assessment I have been failing most of them. 

Now, let me give you a bit of a background about me: I graduated in business administration (bachelors) from a good school in the UK, and now I am doing a masters at one of the top schools in the country where I live. In addition, over time, I have been able to build quite a strong CV - with some really good names on it. 

So, I have realized that when I get to the interview stage, in most cases, I do get an offer. But lately the problem has been getting to those interview stages. In fact, 90% of the times, if not more, I don’t meet the required score to get an interview. 

’ve never thought I was a genius in math, but in most cases I find that I can solve the math problems relatively easily, I mean the maths in these cases is not that complicated. But I keep on failing, am I just too stupid? 

Most recently I failed the tests for P&amp;G, Deloitte, PwC, and some other companies that I can’t remember. I have taken both traditional psychometric assessments as well as those new game-bases ones. 

This is becoming incredibly stressful because, although I know I’m not the smartest out of all applicants, I know I still stand a chance /  I’m smart enough to get a summer internship. 

Has anyone experienced this? what should I do about it?"

Summer Activities: traveled to S. Korea (talked abt in essays!), COSMOS, tech internships/work, visited colleges, hung out with friends 📷  
Essays: Common App 8/10, lots of people overrate theirs but I honestly think mine were pretty good. An essay consultant said of all the clients he's had my essays stood out to him the most and said I was practically a shoo-in. Pushed diversity in my essay theme.  
Why Duke 7/10, focused on interdisciplinary nature of Duke, cliche topic but I think I made it work by spending less time on what it was and more on what it meant to me  
Diversity 7/10, focused on how I was a twin and segued into how I came from the countryside instead of the bay area. ""quirky asf. love it"" -my friend  
Teacher Recommendation: 6/10, ap chem teacher probably a bit above average, really enthusiastic to write my letter but I barely talked in her class lmao  
7/10, ap cs teacher had my older brother and me for a looooong time, absolutely loves me, idk how good his writing skills were though

Ethnicity: Asian (S. Korean)  
Gender: Male  
Income Bracket: &lt;100k  
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): none  


Reflection  
Strengths: perfect test scores, course rigor, class rank, worse school so I stood out more, really pushed diversity as my ""spike"" (doesn't make sense ik), had a personality?  
Weaknesses: asian male stem, no major awards  
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: test scores + essays + ED boost carried me no doubt  


General Comments:  
I've always been mad at the fact I went to an uncompetitive public school compared to schools like Monta Vista or something but it's honestly a blessing in disguise. It's much easier to stand out, especially with the less rigorous classes. The important part: the first part of admissions is region based. Your app first goes to a regional officer and every college wants diversity so they're more inclined to take an insane asian male stem from a region that's uncompetitive than your everyday bay area asian male stem. Otherwise if you're shooting for top colleges, really push the diversity aspect and make sure your personality comes through 📷. For underclassmen I hella recommend doing a summer program (COSMOS UCD represent!) because it definitely made me more extroverted and sure of what I wanted. Best of luck to future applicants and hope to see y'all around :) feel free to ask me any questions"

I am studying for Net+ right now and I will be taking the Net+ exam in the first week of January. My plan is to take and hopefully pass the Net+ exam in the first week of January and then study and take the sec+ exam on my birthday in February. I was wondering what security+ jobs should I be aiming towards and what wage should I be looking for so I do not get screwed over. I have IT experience in the form of a high school summer IT internship (which was 7ish years ago) and a summer IT internship from last summer (They had me doing help desk, networking and teaching me security, however, they also had me doing backup plans in case something goes wrong and well as making budgets for the IT department which I thoroughly, so I'm not sure what to exactly title that on my resume). If I was to get hired by a company I think I would ask for a wage somewhere between $18-20 but I'm not sure if that's too high for someone like me with limited experience. My last internship boss told me I can extremely use him as a reference because I did a really good job. Also, I wouldn't even know what sec+ jobs I would be able to apply for. Oh sorry, I forgot to mention that I am a computer science major who is a junior with a concentration in cybersecurity so getting these certs will actually help me in the future. In your guys' experience, how much would you ask for in an IT job with two certs and limited experience? Thanks for reading this post and commenting."

A few months ago I realized I probably have ADHD. Thanks to a friend who made a joke wondering if I had it because I talked like his friend who has ADHD. After reading more about ADHD (I was fed the stereotypical boy who can't sit still in class narrative) I realized that I should definitely bring it up to my psychiatrist. She agreed. She mentioned that people like me usually go undiagnosed until they enter grad school or something because it becomes more obvious. I'm a high-achieving girl. So, it makes sense no one though to check despite my lengthy history with depression/anxiety.  I felt like I could finally begin to understand myself.

Anyways, I sort of refused to try medications for it for personal reasons. I had taken a lot of anti-depressants in the past when I was going through severe depressive episodes to no avail. My older brother was also given a lot of medications even though in retrospect he needed therapy for complex PTSD. It kind of made me suspicious of psychiatry as a whole.

I'm trying to apply to college now. I graduated high school last year and ended up not going to college because of a lot of stuff that happened last year including a month long hospitalization in May after an attempt. I'm all good now! Thankfully. I've decided to reapply. I have a lot of time in my hands between internships and a couple months ago I was like applying to college will be a breeze since I did it last year and I have a lot of free time. I was WRONG. Literally anything that could distract me at home DID. I would sit in front of my computer and end up doing something totally unrelated and in turn feel awful about not being productive. It's been a struggle.

Finally, after reading and hearing a lot from people personal experiences with medication I decided I wanted to give it a try. So, I got a prescription Wednesday and took my first dose today.

I started tearing up. I cannot believe I ever got through high school without medication. I'm proud of myself. Like holy shit how did you do that when your brain is such a royal mess, but also man, the things I could've done! I think right now as I learn what life with the help of medication is like I will remind myself that just because things could've been different doesn't always mean they would've been better.

I'm so happy. I'm also an amateur photographer with a slow macbook air which drives me nuts bc of the occasional lag in Lightroom. I'm editing some photos now and feeling a lot less frustrated and concentrated. I actually have the bandwidth to pay attention and spend time editing the small details! I'm so excited.

For the first time in my life, I feel like I can have a single thought that does not lead me to another one that ends me up googling the most random thing. I can text like a normal person.

Thank you to all the people who post on here. Obviously, the decision to take medication was my own. If you're considering it talk to a doctor you trust. I'm grateful that I have that privilege of finally getting the help I need.

TLDR; I took my first dose of Adderall this morning and feel an enormous relief. Wondering how on earth I was able to make it through school and get to where I am today unmedicated. I feel great!"

I've been at my current company X for about a year and a half now. They hired me originally as an intern while I was completing my undergrad. (Industrial Engineering) However now I have much greater responsibilities than an intern usually would. Tomorrow I will be participating in commencement for I have graduated this semester! Over the last year and a half I've been working for intern wages and now that I'm graduating I want to ask for a fairly hefty raise, somewhere between 10-15 USD. I'm doing a semester of the masters program in industrial at my UNI to see if that's something that I want to persue and will not be able to work full time next semester. What's nice about my current position is the hours are extremely flexible so they've always been able to work with my school schedule. Being said, company X has been very good to me but now that I have a degree I don't want to work for intern wages anymore. Currently I am in the middle of a huge design project I've been working on for the last 6 months. It's something that I would want to finish before I were to leave company X.

I need to start saving for a few life things such as a house and engagement ring, which is something I do not foresee being possible with my current wage. If company X rejects my request for a raise, what are my options? Find a better paying job and leave my project unfinished for the next intern to finish? Or would it be wiser to stay until it's completed?"
ea7anm,3,2019-12-13,From Uni dropout to Java Web Developer in a year: doable?,SadlyNotAMentat,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ea7anm/from_uni_dropout_to_java_web_developer_in_a_year/,"This is something that probably was asked thousand of times, and I am sorry if that's the case.


Basicly, by the end of 2020 I would like to get entry level job (or at least internship) as Java Web Developer and I would like to get some feedback to judge if my expectations are reasonable.


Programming isn't something I am entirely new to - two years ago I dropped at the beggining of second year in Uni where I was working on getting degree in Computer Science. Most of the focus during the first year was put into maths (linear algebra, statistics, discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis) but there were also algorithms, basics of SQL and C# thrown into the mix (and other, less relevant stuff as well). Depressed student isn't particulary good student and my grades were shit thanks to that, but at least I know some basic stuff and things like loop or class don't sound completely foreign.


Why Java Web Dev? Well, there are plenty of job opportunities in Poland so I think it's good decision to focus on that. Initialy, when I started my degree I was aiming at getting into game dev but I dropped that idea.


But how do I want to achieve what I claim?


First and foremost, bootcamp. I looked around and found one which looks interesting. It starts in late February and ends in late October, with classes every other week (during weekends), 484 working hours overall. OOP in Java, MySQL, Serverlet, JSP, Javascript, jQuery, Spring, Hibernate – that kind of stuff.


Apart from that, working by myself. I looked around at Udemy and got a free course to start with and there's also this big brick called „Thinking in Java, 4th edition” on my desk next to me.


That's it.


I get it, I will have to put tons of work and dedication into this and having full-time job doesn't help. But is it doable? Or do I expect too much from such time period?"

The reason for this is that I am not taking any “legitimate” coding classes. The school I wish to transfer to prefers that transfer students (they admit students as transfers to their second year) don’t take programming classes at cc and instead do it there because I guess a lot of cc students have trouble after transferring.

Instead, I took a class that is an intro to computer science but most of it did not use an actual language but rather something you would teach someone starting off (think SCRATCH) 

The class did a little bit of Python but nothing too extensive. 

I feel that class will be useful once I do start programming because it taught a lot into computational thinking, but I don’t think it really helps me out now. 

I’m going to finish the linear algebra and differential equations next semester, but I’m not sure if that’s marketable right now.

What should I do to apply for internships? Or is this year essentially just ‘lost’ when it comes to that?"

I wanted to add to the list of good news that I have seen in here and want to post my own luck for others to gain inspiration and to keep pushing. I have landed a position as an intern front end developer recently and have been working with a startup company that is fully remote. It is super awesome so far and has boosted my confidence exponentially and I can see a bright future ahead. With that said, I would like to give a bit of my background so you can have an idea of where I started and feel free to send me a message on reddit I will respond to as many as I can.

I am thirty now and I have worked in different fields such as, construction, customer service and the banking industry. I thought I would create a life in the banking industry because I knew how to talk to people and enjoyed helping people… I was wrong.  Easily the worst job I ever dealt with, very toxic staff and manager didn’t help in this situation. I left this job and I didn’t know what to do so I decided college was the way. Joined a local community college that was offering an AAS in Software Development, so I joined that program on September 2018.

I started applying to all software developer jobs in the USA in late July 2019 and when I mean “all” jobs, I mean literally ALL of them, it didn’t matter if it was an internship, contract work, full stack, backend, front end, I applied to it.  I can’t really put an accurate number, but I am confident in saying I applied to at least 700 jobs since July. I got a few hits every now and again one of which was in August I was on the third round with them and if I was invited to the office for the fourth round then I got the job, sadly that wasn’t the case. I didn’t let this deter me I kept coding and learning at my own pace and kept applying to jobs. Then got my Intern job December 2019 :). 

To wrap things up I want to thank others that have posted here with their success stories. It helped me see that I am not so different from others grinding day in and day out trying to land a job or an internship in my case. Again, feel free to contact me I will respond to as much as I can and KEEP GRINDING! 

TL;DR I worked many jobs, went to school for a year as a software developer, applied to a lot of jobs, finally got an offer for a remote internship front end developer."

I wasn't able to go to classes this semester, so started working instead. I found an internship at a startup that mentioned pay $20-$25 an hour and the possibility of working remotely and flexible hours with the possibility of working more, but when I accepted the paperwork stated I was limited to less hours a month and pay was $17 but they could maybe give a raise later on.

I took the offer and started working there hoping to get more coding experience but I never did any coding at all. My mentor had automation testing and showed me the code but had me do other tasks. Since school didn't work out and I still needed a job I just hung onto it for the time being.

Except my mentor ended up putting notice to leave because of better opportunities and subsequently I was told that most of the automation and QA is done and they are going to just hire abunch of people overseas India instead. 

I guess I should have seen the writing on the wall sooner and left as soon as I read the contract that stated less, but besides that I just wonder what else I can do or learn to avoid this in the future ? Maybe apply to different positions? I hope I can find better internships in the future and also eventually get a CS job that I don't have to worry about losing due to outsourcing. I will just keep searching, trying to learn in the meantime I guess."

* I'm a Sophomore CS major and I'm having serious confidence issues.
* I feel ""unworthy"" of all the positions I apply to.
* I want to apply myself by doing research but I don't feel like I'd be of any use to my professors.
* I tried to get a mentor that I could really connect with but I feel like there isn't space for that at my university. I feel like professors are more pre-occupied with research and coursework so it would be asking for a lot.
* My classes bring me a lot of joy and I perform really well in projects, I just don't know how to communicate that to companies. I don't use GitHub but I am working on a personal website.
* Maybe this is an issue of passion. I don't have the ability to exert as much as my peers can into internship preparation.
* I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I don't understand the impact these diagnosis can have on an early career or how to navigate around this hurdle.

This gives me about $800 a month. I plan to put in **at least** $1000 (incl. min payment) a month towards the credit debt. While leaving OSAP and my LOC until I have resolved my credit card debt.

Life is going to be tough 2-3 years until I can get rid of the credit card debt, however I think it's manageable... Am I wrong to think this way? I see people suggesting to file for bankruptcy for $20k credit card debt, am I missing something?

I also should mention I have one year of helpdesk experience and two years of being a computer tech. Thank you in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Im 23 years old, I'm currently working towards:

Bachelors in Computer Information Systems (done in 1 1/2 more years until complete)

Getting an Internship in any it related job (preferably a networking position)

Working on cert (Net+)

What should I do in order to get a good job when I'm done with school?"

Skills

The previous mentioned awards and honors bestowed upon my record were earned through much trial and hard work throughout my schooling career. Along the way, I have acquired the necessary skill sets to become a high functioning worker. I am able to grasp new skills and protocol quickly. My most recent job expanded my knowledge regarding the following: Menu Creation; Preparation; and Execution, Weekly inventory audits of storage areas and kitchen stations, labor budgeting, sanitation and cleanliness of all stations, training new employees, maintaining the correct amounts of material on hand; in my field this was keeping fresh food; and forecasting correct levels of materiel to minimize waste, and finally creating production lists to allow a proper standard of execution.



My strongest ability is being extremely organized and task focused. I'm not sure how to efficiently say it. Thanks for any help you can give."
ead77u,146,2019-12-13,"To all Stanford REA rejects: Stanfurd sucks anyway, here's why other schools (and Berkeley) are better",EconomyRock1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ead77u/to_all_stanford_rea_rejects_stanfurd_sucks_anyway/,"Yes, I applied to stanford as a high school senior. Yes, I got rejected, but thankfully was accepted to Berkeley and spent 4 amazing years there where hatred of stanford was further indoctrinated into me. But no, I'm not just a salty cal graduate - as I write this, I'm actually sitting in my room in the stanford dorms because I'm doing a graduate program here now. As someone who's studied in both schools, I just wanted to give a little overview of what I feel about stanford and berkeley overall, in terms of the undergraduate experience, and in terms of social life and culture.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Berkeley/other schools are better than Stanford**

* Disclaimer: yes I only did my undergrad at one school. But I hang out a lot with undergrads and co-terms at stanford because I went to grad school right after undergrad, so I'm a similar age range to them. I also TA undergrad classes so I'd say I know enough about the undergrad experience at stanford
* One things I was genuinely surprised by when I came to stanford was how people just expected to be handed things and guided through classes. As a TA, I hold office hours and students would come in with questions from the problem set and straight up go ""how do I solve this"" or ""what's the answer for this"". Yes, everyone goes to OHs looking for answers for psets, but usually at cal you and your study group would have at least attempted it, done some work that the TA/GSI can look at and tell you whether you're going in the right direction. Something about stanford creates students that, to put it bluntly, just want to be handheld through classes. I think this attitude is worrisome and doesn't bode well for the rest of your life - in general when facing a problem, it's good to seek help but if you appear with problems and little to no effort on your end at solving them, you're screwing over both yourself and whoever you ask for help. and real soon, people are just not going to help you anymore, and you'll never have learnt the skills to solve problems yourself.
* And the grades reflect that too - the 50th percentile grade for cs61a (intro compsci) at berkeley is a B+. The 50th percentile grade for cs106a (intro compsci at stanford) is an A. 22% of students get an A or A+ in cs61a at berkeley, a whopping 53% get an A or A+ in cs106a at stanford. We used to joke back at cal that all you needed to get an A- at stanfurd was to turn up to class, and honestly that's not that far from the truth. You might think, isn't this good? **No.** One of the things I appreciated most about berkeley was that it surrounded me with people smarter than me, taught me things that I struggled to keep up with and truly pushed me to discover what I could achieve. I think if I had went to stanford for my undergrad, I would have coasted through classes more easily and never had that wake-up call that college gives most freshmen. And that wake-up call is important - it forces you to grow up and learn how to actually be a good student, how to make use of the opportunities you have access to, how to fail and get back up again.
* Stanford is small, at least compared to most public schools. It's large enough to have separate cultures (dorms, clubs, greek life), but most people know most people. At berkeley, as an introvert, I really took comfort in the fact that if I didn't like someone or embarrassed myself in front of someone, I could live the rest of my time at berkeley without ever having to see them again. And cliched as it sounds, when a school is that big, almost everybody can find their community. It won't be easy, it took me almost two years to find my community, but once I did it became one of the best parts of my college experience. Berkeley has many different subcultures - greek life, eecs nerds, political activists, acapella groups, student government, dance groups (so many dance groups...), consulting/business clubs, volunteering, professional frats, board game clubs, cultural clubs, IM sports... the list goes on and on. There's also a kink club by the way, which was one of the most interesting tables I've ever seen on sproul. Stanford has less of all this, just by nature of having a smaller student body and more graduate students than undergraduates. 
* Also, stanford has no football culture. Like, none. I'm not a hardcore football fan, but I went to most home games at Cal because I loved the hype and the atmosphere of the student section more than anything else, even when our team sucked (as it did most of my undergrad) the student section was drunk and ready to bring the hype. I went to a few stanford football games and it was just depressing - turnout was small despite tickets being free, everyone was sitting down and maybe 20% of people knew the cheers? it was pretty sad tbh
* This may not be PC to say, but berkeley was just a lot more diverse. in terms of race, socioeconomic class, majors, even political affiliation (yes! there is a strong conservative population at berkeley fyi). As an international student, I feel like I learnt so much about the US and its complexities and nuances from talking to people of all walks of life at berkeley. Stanford has diversity of course, but it just feels a little more upper-middle class and preppy overall
* Stanford is basically a suburb. There's nothing to eat other than dorm cafeterias at night. It's difficult to leave campus without a car and there's nothing to do in Palo Alto at night anyway. Berkeley is a college town, truly built around the students. There are multiple cheap unhealthy late-night food places (shoutout to asian ghetto), there's karaoke, board game shops, boba places and cinemas all within walking/bussing distance. And SF is a short BART ride away (stanford isn't really close to SF in terms of public transit). When you walk down telegraph or college at midnight, it's hardly ever quiet - there's always places open, people going to or leaving parties, students coming back from a study grind at the library. It's just such a quintessential college town vibe.
* The people. This may be related to just how much bigger a student population Berkeley has, but honestly I like the people at Berkeley more. This is anecdotal of course, but most people I meet here seem to be very preprofessional and focused on getting that amazing internship or job. Everything kinda revolves around that - what classes they take, what clubs they join, what research they do. It's great that they know what they want! But sometimes it feels a little one-dimensional. Like, what do you actually enjoy doing? Surely your goal in life isn't to work for some corporation? Berkeley definitely has that group of people (e.g. haas snakes), but most people just seemed to be trying to find their way through life and figure out what they want to do. And as someone who didn't know what I was doing, that was a lot more comforting to be around. To be able to say ""bruh idk wtf i'm doing with my life"" and get a resounding ""big mood"". And people just seemed to have such a wide, diverse range of interests, from things i've never really thought of before (how culture and identity has a real tangible impact on healthcare outcomes) to people just trying to get that bread (and that $$$ job). 

**Okay fine there are good things about Stanford**

* Housing is a lot better than most public schools and definitely Berkeley. The bay area is expensive to live in but stanford guarantees housing for all 4 years and subsidizes on-campus housing. At berkeley, you usually move out into apartment with friends and tackle the renting market yourself (which is another learning experience at berkeley) after freshman year
* It's safer - there's no homeless population like in the rest of the bay area, and very little crime (except a few cases of sexual assault at parties, which every college has). Definitely feel a lot safer walking/biking home at night.
* Classes are smaller - it can be nice to have more individual attention from the professors/TAs as an undergrad, though I will say I became close friends with many of my profs and GSIs at Berkeley too, so that's not impossible at a large public school

&amp;#x200B;

But if I could go back in time and pick between Berkeley and Stanford for my undergrad, **I would pick Berkeley.** Honestly, no joke. I loved the people at berkeley, the culture and the experiences I had there. I think Berkeley forced me to grow up and mature in so many ways that I'm not sure Stanford would have. Life would have been a lot easier at stanford, but I wonder if I would have been less prepared to face the harshness and rejections and difficulties of the real world. Stanford is a great place and I'm glad to go here for grad school, but I'm really glad I went to berkeley for my undergrad. So if you've been rejected by Stanford REA, maybe this might be a blessing in disguise. Go grind out the rest of your college apps (if you haven't done so already) and wherever you end up, be ready to get the most out of your college experience. Stanford (or Harvard or MIT or Princeton or any other 'top school') is nothing special or godly or untouchable that no other schools can compare - a lot of college is honestly what you make of it. I'm excited for all of you guys that you have four years of undergrad ahead of you, and **GO BEARS!**"

eaf69e,1,2019-12-13,Shit year made worse by awful and blatant bigotry by my classmates. And I just keep falling apart over it.,xxel_psy_congroo,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/eaf69e/shit_year_made_worse_by_awful_and_blatant_bigotry/,"I have just have had a really shit time. My mother died a few months ago, so my family is struggling to deal with that. But in the past couple of weeks I have just fallen apart. 

I’m in college, it is currently exam season and I had 7 exams, and I kept getting so nervous and stressed out I haven’t been able to sleep at all, where I keep having mental breakdowns, where I am crying and vomiting from stress, and all my nerves hurt bc the stress, weather and over work have all triggered my fibro. 

And I am just deeply hurt by my program. I am in a very niche program, in my province there is only one English speaking program of this type, and is a very conservative industry. With an internship being necessary for our licensing. My program has been a fucking mess, we have a program group chat and someone gave an open invite to go to a drag bar. So, I as a drag performer have had issues with non queer patrons being fucking awful such as jumping onto the stage, and grabbing my head price, to which I had to stop my performance and hunt her down to get it back, as well as awful experiences as a patron, from being trans and being told to leave the washroom to having a women w/out permission and knowing me for  2 minutes grabbed my tit bc they wanted to know how binders worked to hitting on a girl and having them be disgusted that I had thought they could’ve been gay, and they went on a very long thing about how it was still gay even if I was a trans man, that my genitalia was disgusting, and that I was just trying to mislead her by calling myself a man.  As well as having dudes but kind of just people more so earlier in transition ogle me when I was with women. All of these events I had no one help me with, so I just did a quick thing to saw, hey these spaces were created to protect queer people, please respect that purpose, be aware, and if you aren’t capable of being in these spaces please educate yourself further, bc these spaces can’t function for their given purpose otherwise hence why many drag bars ban bachelors parties bc they very frequently did this type of shit. 

My program has a bigotry problem. A queer student was sexually assaulted last week, a student called a black student the n word, and got so upset by the fact they were told not to say the n word they punched the black student, when I speak to people outside of my program they will frequently come in and say that oh this is __ deadbame they’re trans, they used to be a women isn’t that neat, frequently misgendering, and for every minority in our program just weird things. 

Add in that the industry is conservative. Where I have had an interview where they asked “si are you like a dyke, a tranny or what?”, and my Chinese friend was very seriously asked if they spoke that Ching Chong language.  So yeah I kind of have to say hey be nice to queer people in queer spaces, bc there is no way given what they do when sober in a professional setting, would they not end up harassing other queer people while in the drag bar. 


They freaked out, that I was straight phobic, discriminating against myself, that if I want a safe space (bc wanting a place that was created for that purpose to be a place where I don’t have to worry about having some one invalidate my identity, or fetishizes it, is such a big ask) I should stay home w my fat friends, I am cruel, Closed minded, and prejudiced towards the straights. That I have absolutely no right to be upset about any of those prior experiences bc it was my job to educate them. 


And then learned that privately they had gone on a very long thing about how bc I have a neurological issue (fibromyalgia it mainly impacts my mobility, and causes chronic pain) I am retarded, that the reason why I am trans and so rabid is bc I am retarded. I had an instance a few years ago where due to being trans in a washroom I was beaten up to the point an ambulance was required, and they were saying that I should’ve died, and the world would’ve been better if I had been killed. During that instance I was sexually assaulted, so they were also saying that I probably enjoyed it, and should be happy that anyone would even be into me. That it was good that I was put in my place. 

They all already work in the industry, with this being a group of about 15 people, out of my very small program where most of our classes are together. so I can’t make a big thing out of it w/out having even more trouble than I already do trying to get work. My professors won’t do anything, where they actually chastised me for swearing, when saying are you fucking kidding me, while talking to them about this. 

And it just gets worse. It makes me question if I want to work in my industry, or even if I want to quit my program. I already felt so shit, that once it happened I have just kept fallen apart, where I just can’t get myself to function. I feel like a mess, everything hurts and I can’t make anything work. I’ve been like this for a week now. And I have no idea what to do about any of this.

TLDR: a lot of my class mates have real issue with minorities, (ex punching a black student bc they had asked to not be called the n word). I had asked them to respect queer spaces bc they were going en masse to a drag bar. I’m upset bc they talked at length privately that they were happy that I had incident was I was beaten and raped, and how they wished I had been killed during that. And I can’t do anything about it."

I have been applying for 2020 summer internships, and while I have gotten a couple interviews, I have not received any offers. However, I have some family connections that would most likely give me an internship at a specific company if I am not able to find one elsewhere. The issue I have is that this company is a big part of the prison–industrial complex, operating for private prisons, and they have done some morally reprehensible things in the past, such as severely overcharging inmates and their families and recording a lot of their communications. 

I would really not prefer this company to be on my resume, as it has received a whole lot of negative press in the past. But if this turns out to be my only option for a summer internship, should I take it? How would future employers see my involvement with this company? Any advice would be appreciated."
eafa25,1,2019-12-13,Struggling with my fearful approach to life,TortoiseTea,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eafa25/struggling_with_my_fearful_approach_to_life/,"I'm sorry this is so long and poorly written, but I need to get EVERYTHING OUT. You don't have to read this, but if you do I'm grateful.


I'm exhausted. My life has plenty of ingredients to be great, but somehow I'm still struggling. I'm 23yo(f). I am currently a second year student in a two year program for a medical career. I'm still living at home. I've always been shy, and currently have no friends but I don't mind too much. 


I just feel like normal life is too difficult for me. The older I get, the harder everything has become. I think I have always had anxiety (or something??) and also feel mildly depressed the last two or three years. I have low self esteem.  I struggle with being social. I push people away. Also I avoid normal tasks like getting gifts for people, phone calls, emails, new responsibilities, business stuff like getting insurance etc. among many other things. I worry daily that I will make a big mistake and my life is about to fall apart due to my lack of competence. 

I'm a very passive person. My current approach to life makes everything difficult, but I'm massively afraid that changing myself or even trying to get therapy right now will somehow cause the disaster I'm trying to avoid. I'm afraid to do anything, really. I'm trying to get through my education and get a job to hopefully give myself some resources to help myself out. But getting there is so hard that I don't know if I'm going to make it. I feel powerless. I keep pretending to be ok. I should be ok. But I'm not. 

Some of the thoughts that run through my head are: What if I lose my internship and everything I've worked for? What if I do (or don't do) something and my mom emotionally rejects me forever? What if I become homeless and penniless for the rest of my life? Basically, I think of the worst possible thing that could happen and then worry that any little thing I do or fail to do will somehow cause it. These feelings just seem to be getting slowly worse. :("
eafb4d,5,2019-12-13,Is it possible to land internships or research opportunities without experience?,Achlynos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eafb4d/is_it_possible_to_land_internships_or_research/,"Hello, this is my first post to Reddit, which should reveal a few things about this particular situation: 

**1.** I am at my wit's end. 

**2.** There is literally no one (that I know) that has an answer to these questions (I have scoured the internet daily for 2+ weeks now), you wonderful forum participators are my last hope. 

(For background, my major is CS). 

In general, this is a 2-fold problem, first of all, I am attending a virtual school (as a late sophomore/early junior) for a variety of reasons: it has a brick and mortar campus, the school itself is selective, and the academics are rigorous. Plus, at the time, I was attending roughly 1.5 years before my set highschool grad year, and there were a lot of significant life changes going on at the time that didn't allow me to transition to campus (I am starting to regret that decision now). 

Though the school itself puts a lot of weight on undergraduate research, the virtual university offers no research opportunities (I've asked multiple times), I live roughly 2+ hours away from the campus itself. I have no other experiences (lots of family commitments); however, I do have decent programming skills (Java, Python, etc.), a love for math, algorithms, self-guided learning, and a decent GPA (3.9). I've been examining internships or REU opportunities. Still, everything seems so out of reach with such a blank resume; if anyone has similar experiences or advice, I would so appreciate it! 

Additionally, are research opportunities in CS careers even that important (i.e., am I stressing over nothing)? Would it be better to finish early and move onto grad school instead (though again with the lack of research experience)? Are there any specialized CS skills that would nullify the lack of experience? 

AGH, so many questions, so little time.

Thank you!"

I've had two internships with a large engineering company, have done well in school. I had a couple chances at internships in the big companies (Google,amazon, twitter) that I lost to what I feel was mainly poor technical interview performance\[  i get nervous :(  \] but other than that I am by all means set up to be pretty competitive in the job market.

&amp;#x200B;

Its my first day of winter break and I want to make the best of it! I'm thinking of taking an online Data Structures and Algorithms class to get a refresher on that stuff, but I was curious if anyone has any recommendations of online courses that I could take that would have a big impact on how i can perform out of the gate in a new job?  Perhaps any skill you notice is consistently lacking in new hires or maybe a useful subject to get some info on (first thing that comes to mind is maybe Tensor Flow)

Since I've gotten the most courage for this crazy adventure from here, I though that maybe It's time to give something back.

I have a Bachelors degree in Television &amp; Audiovisual Media and worked at a local TV station. I made the decision to make the shift in April 2019. Started learning Java on my own, buying e courses from Udemy. 

I quit my job in August and went to a 6 week Boot camp and after that 8 weeks of Internship. The boot camp and internship were a package deal funded by the European Union finances. (sort of a program to get more people into IT). But still the internship was not handed to you, you had to go and search it yourself and may even not get one. I was incredibly lucky (and hard working) to have been chosen to full stack developer internship to a large Bank IT department. Though it was clear from the start, that they could not keep me as an employer later on. So after the internship for weeks I sent out lots of CV-s and motivational letters. Even got one interview and a test job to do at home but didnt get the job.

At this point I was pretty sad because my options were running out. Finally I gave another shot at the banking internship team lead asking him could he recommend me to somewhere. And he did! He recommended me to his former boss and that guy hired me as a paid intern for 2 months and then If im okay, as an employer. Ive been there for two days now.

I wanted to become a Java developer so Ive tried to focus on the Java ecosystem specifically. I have no children, but I do have a mortgage. So basically I had saved up from the last job enough money to last me an year.

Ive been super scared of not knowing enough and not delivering the expectations since the beginning and I still am. But looking back at it to April, Ive managed to somehow get almost excactly where I wanted to be by now.

So if anyone feels like they need to do something similar, I hope this story might help to boost motivation or get ideas on how to do it."

I'm 24, from the UK and I'm considering leaving and setting up a life somewhere else, (temporarily or permanently I'm not sure yet.) The way the country is going makes me feel deeply unsettled and seeing as I don't have any real ties here, why not?

I'm soon to be graduating with a BA in Music (Film Music) and will be starting to look for work in the music / film industry, in the UK and abroad. Whether its an internship or a part-time job just to pay the bills, the thought of moving to another country and embracing a new city and its culture whilst meeting new people really excites me. (Scary, but exciting). I'm keen on Berlin because of the music scene there and I've heard it's fairly cheap? How does one from the UK go about finding a job out there when English is my only language?

I guess this is a call-out to any other Brits who've made the leap of faith to somewhere in Europe or further abroad, I'd love to hear your experiences and/or any advice you can give! At the moment, I'm looking at either Berlin or Amsterdam.

I never had any real world experience, only 1 remote internship for 3 months, but I have worked on side projects.

I'm age 35 years old. Degree in Environmental Engineering from a (Unveristy of Applied Science) in FInland and a MAster of Aquatic Sciences from Unviersity in FInland too.

Now I get that this is not a a psychology forum but be merciful on me as I'm in a very vulnerale state at the moment(Piling some water works.

I have FAILED with these degrees. FAiled as in FAILED: One I lost passion for them, I dont think I even know why they gave me the certifcates, I dont think I deserve them, I dont think they interste me anymore. I'm can't convince employers to hire me, they meet me always with a bit of condesceding attitude. If I like them, I would do a phd. but I dont have that much passion. However, I think the lack of passion is due to the fact that I failed with them or because they are boring and not necessary something inherntly wrong with them. If I was good at what I do I would have opened my own consulting company or becaome a freelance, maybe work in developing nations or something

As time pass applications and competition are fierce, applications easily ignored, my CV is FAR from impressive, I have done interships and worked for free just so that I fill it iwht something and if the Finnish government werent very strict with their laws I proabbaly would have had a lot longer internships. But with the interships, they give you some boring tasks that any Tom Dick and Harry can do, so why pay you for that? ANd then once the term is over they tell you thanks you fuk off.

&amp;#x200B;

I have contacted an old boss and he being supportive he told me, that when I worked with them that I was a good employer, and my degrees are good, I dont have to make new degrees but try to get some new course that are more practical adn you dont have to start over. I hope it is true, unlike what my other boss said(THat my degrees are useless :D)

Anyways, I have failed, failed, failed, failed....I dont know what to do next, weather is engineering worth pursuing. I dont know how good I am with other Engineering braches, the lack of job experince doesnt help...SO I want to know;

1. what kind of jobs are intersting and in demand? How smart and intelligent do I need to be to get into these? I'm average intelligence, nothing special, aybe lower side of the average too
2. How not to waste my life anymore?
3. Should I pursue a new degree in some other branch of Engineering? WEll it be easy because my degrees WEREA LITTLE TOO EASY TO PASS. You cant fail no matter what. Or should I stick with my degrees and try harder
4. Is phd worth it?
5. How to find a direction in my life instead?
6. I like computer programming, machine learning and software devlopments seems EXTREMELY INTERESTING but not sure I would succeed with them? Again a bit less than average
7. Should I pursue finance or just learn some craft like welding, car fixing, carpenatry?

I have failed, failed failed, cant get a job, cant convince an employer, my CVS get ignored, no experince etc...Though I think I understand concepts well, it takes me to long to get something?

Confused, frustrated, scared and terrified

Help a failed engineer out please (Therapy has not helped with these career related stuff)

&amp;#x200B;

Somethings I'm good at or decent

Excel(Including pivt tables, f statments), good with powerpoint, word, electric soldering, good math skills,decent physics but nothing special,  basic of ONLY SYNTAXES of pything, sql, html, css, javascript(know the syntat but cant do anything with them)

My weakness: ANything PRACTICAL, structure, consulting, remediation, advanced concepts, (Putting the pieces together), slightly poor social skills (Basically anything that convince an employer to hire me or that I open my own firm)

&amp;#x200B;

Just note; if I would have been able to work something useful in myfield, and do something important with them, in developed and less devloped nations and actually could find solutions to problems I would be quite happy with what I have got and maybe purue a phdStill like electronics and software eng...though :D

EDIT:::

&amp;#x200B;

Read all the comments, thank you all for the support. I was welling up a lot recently (Well needed to be honest). 2019 was slightly rough year emotionally, times of distress are necessary...Good advice, I'm feeling a lot better after reading all you comments, a lot of wisdom, some nice trolling too :D

I just simply started applying to entry level CS roles as soon as I graduated from my electrical engineering degree, and I made sure to use my capstone experience (door lock facial recognition system using machine learning/computer vision) to help my resume stand out.

I did leetcode when I didn’t have class work (I probably got around 80 questions done in total). I did have internship experience in electrical engineering programming FPGAs for a known aerospace company, but it wasn’t dev work. I don’t even know HTML or SQL or JavaScript.

I have no prior professional experience on my resume relating to CS. In the past 6 months I have put out about 800 applications to New Grad jobs, internships, etc. I have 1-2 phone interviews a week recently, but a lot of them lead nowhere, or they say reach back out to us \~1 month before graduation. Have only had three technical interview.

I was just offered an unpaid internship that will last 3 months, but pay a stipend of $2000 at the end. They expect about 16 hours a week so it barely comes out to be less than minimum IF I stay for the whole duration. I am able to afford no pay for three months, and I will be able to keep up school if I take the internship.

My main question: is this worth it?

It feels like my lack of professional CS experience is what is hindering me getting a job. I believe my resume to be very good compared to my peers. Is a three month long internship going to really help me get a job in the end, or is the slave labor not worth it? If I do take the internship, I will still be applying for jobs, and will take a job offer if one pops up."

What I find most enjoyable is incorporating design patterns into my projects where needed, and also creating classes/functions that abstract away their complex logic for the user. 

I know this is pretty vague, but my experience with front-end programming is that, outside of creating services in Angular, most of the work is straight-forward ""connect the dots"" programming. ""I want to show this to the user when they click this, so on a click event assign this array to this variable instead of this other array,"" etc.

Even the backend work I have been involved with is just ""create this sql query, get the data, return it in an http response.""

I think I could do well on the behavioral questions but I never experienced an interview where I was asked technical questions. Also, I haven't really go too deep into embedded systems as I have only messed around the Arduino and coding in C for certain projects. The job listing required skills were:

\- experience in C/C++ and SQL

\-Experienced in an embedded systems environment. 

\- Familiarity with engine protocols such as CAN preferred (I did not add this to my resume btw)

\- Interest in the automotive and telematics fields (I have experience in automotive as I created an autonomous mechanical robot to navigate through a maze)

I'm a double major I'm music and psychology going to grad school for music therapy. I'm looking for a new laptop since I will be graduating in a year (and bc my refurbished laptop my parents got me for undergrad is black screening and glitching so I'm scared) So I would like an upgrade. Any feedback is helpful!

Total budget and country of purchase: $800 max and U.S

Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. For sure good battery life and best specs for money. 2 in 1 is nice if I can use it for my music or method books when practicing however it's not a necessity. 

How important is weight and thinness to you? Pretty important I want to use it daily in my classes for note taking or internships. If it's 2 in 1 I would even take it when I practice my instrument. 

Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux. Windows 

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A. 13-15

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. I'm going to be using statistic programs like SPSS and excel. Sibelius is a music software I will be using.

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? I don't know anything about gaming. My friend recently bought me Left 4 Dead 2 and Dragon Nest on Steam so I would like to play that. He also got me Minecraft but it wouldn't be the end of the world for me if I can't play all or some of these games. 

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)? Reliable build quality for sure!

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. Overall I just want a laptop that is going to last me through grad school and maybe even further than that! Thank you for your help and time!"

I thought I finally overcame my social anxiety &amp; I thought my life is finally getting better.. until one week ago. 

I haven't been at school for 3 weeks because I was doing an internship. When I got back to school, I realized everyone stopped talking to me, even when I tried to talk to them. I don't know what happened, it's like everyone forgot about me or just isn't interested in talking to me anymore. 

Then I saw a one of my class mates posting a few pictures of all of them together on Instagram. I asked him since when did they start hanging together after school. He told me they've been going out together every weekend since the school year started. I feel so left out now. Some of you might think I should just ask them if I can hang out with them too. But they don't even notice me at school anymore. 

I've been crying my eyes out now &amp; I feel like such a fucking loser again. Why is it so hard to find friends? I never had friends in my entire life. Something is probably wrong with me..

Looking for more opinions, thanks in advance! I want to take those useful classes on personal finance but am the type to feel like every class I take should go to some sort of objective.

I have been trifled with the question of CO-OP. It is obviously very important for initiating a career in CS as it allows you to intern through an established institution such as ConU. 
I was accepted into CS w/ Coop here, but was wondering if McGill BA CS would be more profitable for my future (there's no ability for CO-OP through the BA program). Albeit it has a reputable name outside of Montreal. So, what is more valuable in your opinion?  CO-OP at ConU or McGill BA where I try to find my own internship (dreary process I assume)?"

During my years at UofT I never really did anything extra, got decent grades, went to class, that's about it. Now that I'm about to graduate I realized I'm very behind in terms of my career.

So I'm hoping to get a SWE job (or even an internship) after graduating. My goal would be to get a nice job in the valley and if at all possible, at a big N company, but I'm not so sure about my chances.

I have two questions

1. Is it hard for UofT students to get a job in the valley, or US in general? I have a few friends that went to Waterloo and I can see on LinkedIn that they've gotten tons of internships in huge companies. I know Waterloo has their coop program and I know I should have done something like PEY but what's done is done I guess.

      Also, I'm wondering about the application itself. I know in some applications it says like ""Are you eligible to work in the US"" and ask other questions, I mean technically I'm not but I did a bit of research on Reddit and it seems most Canadians just put ""Yes"" since they can just get a TN visa. So with the whole application I'm not sure how to go about that.

2. I have no experience networking and I realized that I haven't used any of UofT's connections at all. Is there anything that UofT offers that I can use to help me for what I'm trying to do? Anything coming up like a Career fair where some big named companies come and stuff along those lines (I've heard people from Amazong and Microsoft come, is that true?!

As a side note, I was wondering if anyone has any opinions in general on moving to the states for a SWE job (if I get the chance of course). I know the cost of living is a bit higher in a place like California compared to Toronto, but from the job postings I've seen, the pay is considerably higher than here in Canada. Most SWE positions in toronto have some pay around 50-60k while I've seen a few places in Cali (which weren't big N places) with 70k~. I also feel like it would be good in terms of starting my career and networking since I feel like that's where all the big tech stuff is happening and I would have an easier time.

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you :)"

easuyc,265,2019-12-14,Ever feel like you aren't making a difference in engineering?,MackWheldonUS,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/easuyc/ever_feel_like_you_arent_making_a_difference_in/,"From a young engineering student exploring internships and career opportunities to more seasoned engineers, I have a rant about ethics/politics/philosophy/life/engineering.

Growing up I was a natural engineer, really enthusiastic and always building shit in my garage and in my robotics team at school. My parents didn't know anything about engineering but were always supportive and helped me cultivate my interests from a young age. I was a young utopian, really excited to design spaceships/robots/electric cars and what have you. I worked hard in school, got into an elite college, and kept up with my engineering hobbies. 

Now that I have a bit of industry experience under my belt, my tune has started to shift. I've now realized that technical solutions and these cool projects I always dreamed about in my youth *don't matter*. No matter how brilliant of an engineer you are, no matter how ""cool"" the technology you are working on is, at the end of the day, you are serving your corporate master. Your job, at the end of the day, is to optimize the profit-making machines (and build new ones) of a corporation. Whether you are at a massive firm like Raytheon, or a new startup, the bottom line is profit. Whatever cool technology you get to build are just means to that end. 

 Take Apple for example, one of the largest engineering firms on the planet. They have thousands of brilliant software, electrical, and mechanical engineers around the globe working on producing these amazingly intricate swiss watch-like machines. So much technology from so many disciplines are packed into these miniaturized marvels. We as a society spend billions each year optimizing these machines, making them faster, smaller, more aesthetically pleasing and easier to use. But what is the point of all that? To get people to spend as much time on their phones as possible, and generate profits for Apple and the other companies that build software on top of their platform.

I've talked to classmates of mine about this and gotten zero sympathy. The overwhelming attitude is either ""what the fuck are you talking about"" or ""pay me enough and I don't care what the thing is being used for.""

The biggest issues we face as a society, climate change, food scarcity, the rising tide of right-wing ideologues, none of these will be fixed by technology. No matter how many more engineers we throw at the problem, we are stuck. It's a matter of capital, time, and political will.

**So my big question to older engineers is:**

How have you escaped this and managed to find satisfaction in your work? Have you tried anything like Engineers Without Borders, non profit work, research work, etc? Or do you simply treat work as work and try to find meaning from life outside of your 40 hours a week thru hobbies, outreach, family, etc?"

I am looking to apply for internships that will give me experience in operations/sysadmin work as that seems like what I would like to do as a career. The thing is, as a comp sci major all of my classes, advisers, etc are preparing me for programming jobs and data science jobs and there doesn't seem to be a lot of resources for finding IT related jobs instead.  
So what is a typical internship to get for someone that would like to work as a sysadmin? Is there a sysadmin internship or other position that comes first? I have a lot of programming experience and hardware experience, but no experience with enterprise level stuff or a home lab. I see that lots of sysadmins start with help desk jobs or the likes but was looking for more of a hands-on summer internship kind of thing. I know this sounds vague and easily searchable, but I have been having trouble finding places that want a regular IT internship as opposed to a software engineering internship."

I graduated from a good university in September (took summer classes) with a very desirable STEM degree. I don't think I was ready for the course load and as a result I was barely able to graduate with a 2.1 GPA. I haven't taken any extracurriculars or internships because I was too busy studying as much as I could and was barely able to scrape by with a C- in most of my classes.

I was intending to apply to grad school this past fall but my low GPA immediately disqualifies me from any programs, and I'm currently working at a math tutoring agency for children and teens. I don't hate it but at the same time I feel somewhat overqualified and would like to somehow start with an actual career. 

From what I can see, most internship opportunities are given to college students with high GPA's and so I don't see how it's even really possible to get my foot in the door anywhere. I guess I'm just a little frustrated because for the last few years people have been telling me how easy it will be to find a job in my field with this degree but I don't think anyone will hire a college graduate with a low GPA and no experience. 

Any advice would be welcome, I feel like this is a pivotal moment in my life and I'm not doing anything correctly to get started."
eauvt0,1,2019-12-15,Am I giving excuses or is there certain disadvantage of being an older student at a university?,basementmath,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/eauvt0/am_i_giving_excuses_or_is_there_certain/,"Long story short, I didn't get much schooling when I was at the age for college. I went to community college part time and started working full time. Due to some personal and family reasons, I dropped out of college completely after a couple of years, as I tackled on two jobs.

I came back to school at at age of 28 ish. Now I'm 32. Long story short(again), I worked part time while I paid rent and bills and studied my butt off and got into where I go to, known as a public ivy uni as a economics major.

Although I was passionate about economical philosophy and business, I knew that I did not possess any skills or experience to go into business so after I had transferred, I switched my major to mathematics - computer science. I was always not too bad in math, getting mostly A's in lower division math courses with couple of B's.

I struggled immensely in computer science classes, which ate up a lot of my time, required a lot of effort while I was lost, it also ate up my grades in other courses such as math. Upper division math isn't any easier either. I once contemplated whether computer science and software engineering was the right path to me but I kept going and I even landed an internship for an engineering, where I worked on a prototype project that involves software/embedded systems engineering.

Do I like computer science? Yes I do and I do not plan on giving up but I have to put in a lot more work compared to students who have so much more talent and stamina.

There are a lot of times where I would work hard, spend time(since I suck at the subject or perform below avg compared to my peers) I sometimes underperform on exams because I am very tired, my brain stops working, panicking and etc.

I don't flunk out of exams, I just completed a difficult upper div algorithms and I got about B-/B ish grade where there was an exam that I did almost 1 SD better than the rest of the class and the avg.

However, overall, I used to be a star student with 3.7 3.8 term GPA, now I get B/C which is a norm to me. I was in a numerical linear algebra(upper division, fairly difficult) and going into finals, I had solid B with a chance to get B+ or better course grade, I got really tired, I got caught off guard by materials that I thought I had mastered, turned out I didn,t (like variation of what I've seen) etc and got like a C on it

I am passing my classes, sometimes I do about average(B/B-) or do mediocre(C ish but not flunk out or be clueless)

I sometimes feel that there isn't enough time for me or I just don't have energy. My friends who are actually star students here at my university, a lot of them acknowledge my work-ethic and I am praised for that but in reality, with my work-ethic, I get mediocre/okay grades. Is it my age or am I just dumb? The grades I received at my community college translated to my lower division engineering math classes but it didn't at computer science classes and upper division math courses. Feelsbadman

But I'm trying to focus more on gaining experience, I have built network and made friends to learn how to obtain internships and how to prepare for that. I am just concerned about my GPA because where I used to be a 3.7/3.8 GPA student while I worked part time, I've become a 2.7 GPA student and it kinda feelsbad"

I literally have my default tabs set to different job boards and spend most of my time applying to jobs that I am qualified for when I am not working. I am a constant burden on my friends and family and I hate myself for it. My family is full of narcissists and I know that if I ask for help they will hold it over my head for the rest of my life so I dread going to them. I hate myself even more for having to constantly inconvenience my friends when they have their own lives to worry about. It seems like everyone is more successful than me and they haven't even tried. I went to a good school, got a high GPA, and when I am at work I work like a maniac, but I just can't get ahead. I often get ""advice"" from people saying ""why don't you just take an unpaid internship to get more experience"" or ""why don't you hang out a shingle and go into business yourself"" If I had the funds to start my own business, I would have done it years ago, and an unpaid position can't pay for groceries and might actually cut into what few hours I have left at work.

eawcxm,2,2019-12-15,Long Distance Pregnancy Scare,thr0wayaayay,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eawcxm/long_distance_pregnancy_scare/,"I just need to rant about this and we want some advice too. Please help me.

So a week ago, my partner (of one and a half years) and I were having sex and I got really into it and ended up finishing pretty quickly and onto her back. Some things to note: 1) I was wearing a condom. 2) I pulled out before I ejaculated, meaning I'm pretty sure none of it shot into the condom. 3) I took 5 seconds after pulling out and before ejaculating on her back. When I finished, though, she was pretty freaked out because it landed on her lower back. I made sure to check the condom for tears by filling it with water (no leaks), and she showered immediately.

Some background: we met in the freshman year of college and started dating immediately. We love each other very much but because she comes from a conservative family, she's always been worried about her parents finding out about us not only dating but also having sex. Since we're younger and since her parents want her to focus on her studies, she wants to keep it a secret until we've got college stuff, getting an internship, and future prospects to the point where they wouldn't doubt that being in a relationship would either ruin her studies or her future. So far, our fundamental plan is working and we've both maintained good GPAs and have already secured internships for the summer as sophomores. However, my greatest fear is that our she would end up pregnant from our sex and I'd completely wreck our plan for coming out to her parents as a responsible adult.

More background: sometime after the first month of our dating, we both had sex for the first time together (we were both virgins), and I being a complete idiot finished inside her. We had a condom, but I had no idea that it could rip and we never ended up checking it. I ran to the CVS 2 miles away at 3AM to get the plan B. That was probably the worst week of our lives, but I'd also say that we got really close because both of us became were very open about our families and our feelings during that time. Also important, she told me that her family back at home would be very disappointed and in her culture, she'd be treated differently by all of her relatives if they knew anything like this would happen.

Now let me explain the timing:

1. She had her period starting November 9th
2. We have sex twice in those two weeks till Thanksgiving break (nothing happened both of those times, I didn't ejaculate until a minute after pulling out as a precaution, we checked the condom regularly)
3. Thanksgiving break (Nov 22nd-Nov 29th) happens, she's stressing and studying for 6 exams
4. The week after Thanksgiving break, she takes 3 of her exams (she stays up late the nights before each of those)
5. Before her 2nd and 3rd exam on Thursday, she stays up really late studying with a lot of coffee, wakes up and drinks a monster/coke, doesn't eat anything except sugary stuff before her tests, and after dinner she throws up because of how sick she felt
6. Friday, Saturday, she's really busy with her studying/club
7. Sunday, we have our incident I describe in the second paragraph
8. Monday night she stays up for an exam cramming and is really stressed about it. 
9. Tuesday she finishes her tests, but at this point I have an exam on Friday
10. We get drunk on the last night and she gets really hungover and throws up a lot
11. Now, we're separate again for Winter break, and she still hasn't had her period (today is Dec. 15)

I will note that she felt completely fine during her Thanksgiving break. I didn't get a pregnancy test between taking my last exam and driving down to my hometown and being separated, but now I really regret it.

Here are some reasons I don't think I should be worried about pregnancy:

* None of the times we had sex did anything seriously big happen that involved finishing right inside her, except for that last time
* She's been really stressed with exams and her club
* She's been eating really badly because of how little time we've had to make real food. We have both gained a lot of weight this semester.
* Some of the food we've been eating (lots of fast food, sugary snacks, caffeine, alcohol \[only once\], skipping meals) have caused her to throw up in the evenings
* She's not exhibiting any symptoms of pregnancy, except her late period

Here are some reasons I think I have to be worried about pregnancy:

* She's late to her period by a week. She used to always be a week late to her period, but over the summer, she's had them on time. Not sure about now though.

We've talked together about how rationally, we don't have much to worry about because we know we've been careful recently with sex. But with such a late period, we're extremely worried that maybe she is pregnant. We do know that bad diet/high stress from finals can lead to later periods, but her period hasn't been this late in a while now since she had been eating well during the Summer/early school year.

Best case, she gets her period really soon and all of this will blow over...

She's also going to her mom's home country for a month tomorrow. We think that my gf can hold off on giving away any pregnancy signs while she is there with her mom and relatives (signs don't show in a month), but her mom is pretty in tune with her periods. She's worried that if her period is delayed and delayed, her mom will take her to the clinic to get her health checked out and find out she's pregnant. She wants to say that she isn't expecting and that it was probably high stress from exams just a week before.

Worst case: our plan for when she gets back is to visit the nearest abortion clinic and try to resolve this quietly (we'll pay our own money from my job and her job savings), but neither of us are looking forward to that. Absolute worst case: both of our parents find out and shit goes down.

So I want to know what you guys think about the chances of pregnancy are, and what we should plan to do if her period doesn't come. I've thought about a bunch of doomsday predictions from her getting disowned, me getting disowned, or both. We've talked about it and we've promised each other we would stick together and have each other's backs if anything happens.

I just want some certainty for the situation because I'm having a hard time sleeping with how guilty I feel for this whole thing.

Tl,dr  
Sex gone wrong, gf's conservative family, pregnancy scare, and late period. what should I do?"

Worried about fitting in the workplace
u/spaced_out16m
Does anyone else worry if they'll ever fit in the workplace? Especially the introverts with social anxiety? I'm a senior in college and I know I should have had the communication skills pat down by now but I don't and I start an internship next January and am really afraid of how I'll fare socially.

I'm pretty decent at one on one conversations but anything more than that I just prefer to be in the background cause I'm bad at verbally expressing what goes on in my head. Also being an INTJ, I come across as pretty cold and stand offish involuntarily and though I try initially to make a good first impression by mimicking an outgoing and cheerful person, I can't do that for long and fall back into my self.

I'm honestly terrified and this is not an irrational fear because I did have an internship in the summer after my junior year and things weren't great socially. I really don't prefer to be the one doing the talking especially if there's another person with me. There was another intern and she would be the one doing all the talking with the mentors and I would listen unless there was something I really had to say. This resulted in some of the mentors not valuing me at all. They wouldn't take into consideration anything I had to say.

Also I don't know if any of you guys relate to this but sometimes I feel like I have no control over the expressions on my face and it just keeps changing based on the other person's expressions. I've tried so hard to control it but I can't. This is probably another person why people don't take to me. I don't know I just feel really hopeless. I do have valuable inputs but I'm just too paralysed to say them. If I'm too conscious of what I wanna say I end up stuttering. I prefer observing people from a distance and i know it's rude to stare but ughh. That's another reason. I also might have this blank stare from trying to control my expressions. 

Sometimes I just wanna know what people are actually thinking so i dont have to overthink anymore.

My girl went to a club with some friends last night. It’s 1:30 am and i tell my girl i see her jaw clenching in her snapchats. She says I’m good baby. I said get home safe, it’s late.
I go to bed. I wake up at 5am and she hadn’t texted me. I looked at her location because I was genuinely concerned. It was not her home. I text her and she answers! (Why is she awake at 5am)
I FaceTimed her and on the 3rd try she answers,
Having snuck away into a hallway, wearing some dudes shirt. 
She said I’m at my girlfriends, we’ve just been chillin. I saw no one around and said then where is everyone. “Asleep”
I was at this point mega sketched out. Found out that she was not in fact at her girlfriends. More questions. This morning i made her tell me the truth. 

This is her truth: (charlie is her old boss)

I didn’t want to tell you because baby it wasn’t that big of a deal and I know you’d freak out because i know it sounds bad but it really wasn’t, it meant to be harmless.. we went back to Charlie’s house and he gave me a line but it was harmless, I didn’t mean to go behind your back like at all I just wasn’t thinking, so we literally just talked that’s it, for a long time, about the whole internship situation and life and stuff and then we kinda forgot that my car was parked at Sam’s so I slept in his guest bed. I was cold so he gave me a sweatshirt. It was literally just friendly stuff nothing bad at all. I talked about you so much and how I love you so much 

Can you all please tell me how to react to such a situation. She went home from a club with her old boss and i caught her.

I am supposed to take this girl to Hawaii in two weeks with my family, and i think i know what i have to do and it’s gonna suck.


EDIT: she is standing her ground that she slept in the guest bed and talked about me the whole night and showed him the promise ring i gave her 2 days prior.

Prereqs: You are comfortable with programming in general, and you can flesh out your thoughts via code.
Go to codewars.com and do a few of their easiest problems (lv8 and lv7)

### If you can't solve any Leetcode easy just keep revising easy questions. Easy questions do not require any algorithms except linear traversals and the likes. 


# Step 1 - Algo MOOC or book

Just get to solving the actual questions as soon as you can. MOOC take a lot of time to complete and If you know the basic data structures and traversals, start step-2. If you do not know how to solve it (Which will be the case), look it up and upsolve.

I already knew my way around basic data structures and traversals so I stared from step 2. 

For me BFS/DFS is basic while Dijkstra's is not.

I just transferred out of my local CC to a CSU. It took a bit longer then I'd hoped largely due to dicking around too much at the start. None of ny CS courses really focused on any real programming practices or Algo. I just overall feel as though I'm so far behind everyone at all times."

I’m not gonna start apply for jobs until I get both of my certs. Since I’m interested in the security side I was wondering what jobs can I get with the security cert. I have two months of IT internship but I was able to get a reference out of it. Also since I am also interested in hacking what certs can I get for it and what type of job can I get with the hacking cert as well.  My plan is that after I finished completing my Net+ and Security+ certs I would find a job with them and study towards getting my CySA+ and PenTest+ certs. I also should mention that I’m a computer science major with a concentration in cyber security.

The only programming classes I've completed are Programming Fundamentals I &amp; II (which are pretty basic), the rest were core classes. I did take a short ""Front-End Intermediate"" JavaScript course a few years back at Austin Coding Academy which is probably irrelevant.

After recently starting to look into software development careers; hearing how hard it is to find your first job, the difficulty of each interview process, and how seemingly unreliable the job positions are, I'm starting to think maybe this isn't the right career path for me. I do love to work on my own projects in my free time, which is partly why I chose this degree, to learn more and improve my programming ability.

However, recently someone brought up that I should look into something technical support related, which to me actually sounded like a great idea because it's something I believe I'd be very good at and wouldn't mind doing, as it seems like it would be a pretty stress-less type of job.

So, I have a few open ended questions that if anyone could give me any advice whatsoever regarding any of them it would be appreciated.

1. Is questioning whether I should continue on the path of computer programming a sign that maybe it's not the path for me, or is this normal for programming students?
2. Whether I continue this or decide to look into how to get into the technical support industry, is there anything I should be focusing on outside of school (paid or unpaid internships, jobs that I may qualify for that will help me in the future, etc.)

I gave him a $50,000 retainer that was supposed to go towards the bulk of the design costs.

However, he has only used about 15k of that towards paying the subcontractors and has sent me a bill of his office's hourly expenses that essentially wipe out the remaining amount of the retainer I gave him.

I have retained him for about 3 months and in those 3 months we have probably met 5 times for periods of .5hr-2hrs max. He is claiming a ridiculous amount of hours worked and it is such a blatant and brazen attempt at screwing me out of the retainer I gave him.

I know I messed up by giving him a retainer in the first place but what's done is done and I am trying to figure out the best way to dig myself out of this mess. My goal is to try and get the work done with the Architects and MEP contractors because I still need it and the money has already been paid towards them and started.

The bulk of the work at this point should be done by the architect and the engineers. He is just a general contractor and he is billing me double what my contract with the architects and engineers are.

Himself @ $350/hr 97hrs 34k
employee @ $150/hr 10 hrs 1.5k
Assistant @ $75/hr 40 hrs 3k
Intern @ $75/hr 21 hrs 1.5k
total 40k

I will be asking him for a detailed breakdown of all the tasks that were done but beyond that is there anything else I can do to let him know that he will not be getting away from this? Obviously I will need to contact an attorney as well but just wondering is there anything else I can say or ask from him to let him know he will not be getting away with this?

Anyone with anything similar happen to them? Thanks in advance for taking the time to read and answer."

Just humor me by answering a few questions

1) Purely by major name, will data science stop me from getting those coveted FAANG SWE positions

2) If I do data science, how hard is it to enroll in upper-div CS courses

3) I know that people in 1st sem sophomore year get FAANG internships and by default they cant be ""CS"" majors yet, coupled with the fact that I've heard that once you get your first internship (as long as you still learn, don't burnout, etc .)  you have secured a strong future in tech, leads me to believe that major name really doesn't matter. Is this assumption True?

4) What courses do you need to start SWE, I've heard 61B, 70, 170, 61C, what else?

Thanks for answering these questions.

I studied at a low-ranking university whose ranking is &gt;200 in US News for two years. In general, I liked my experience there, although I'd say Computer Science program there was meh. In one of my programming classes, we literally copied and pasted code from a presentation. I was easily able to combine working, studying, and having a life there and had a 4.0 GPA. This university does not have a lot of good networking opportunities with big companies, and it usually all up to you to get connected with the company of your interest.

This Fall, I was accepted for transfer to the university, which is in the top 50 universities of the United States and the world. This university is very well-respected, and it has great networking opportunities. I was very excited and expected to study there to be hard, but not THAT hard. Despite prior programming and internship experience, I struggled in introductory Computer Science class, and I was 0.9 points away from getting a passing grade in the class. I also failed my Discrete Math class and result in my GPA this semester will be around 2.3. I am planning to retake this intro computer science class and discrete math to progress in the degree.

Since it will take longer for me to graduate (roughly three years) and my transcript will include poor grades for these classes, I am worried about how it is going to impact my internship and full-time job search in the future. 

 However, I am wondering whether it makes more sense to go back to my old university and finish my degree under two years with a high GPA. Or do you think the high-ranking university would worth that even with a low GPA?"

ebakfa,1,2019-12-16,Undergraduate Research vs. Internships,Bagpiper513,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ebakfa/undergraduate_research_vs_internships/," I originally posted this in r/computerscience, but it was removed. This is a more appropriate forum.

This summer (2019), I had the opportunity to work as an undergraduate research assistant for 10 weeks as part of my university's REU (research experience for undergraduates) program. I worked on developing an embedded operating system running on the Raspberry Pi 3 B+. I helped port a framebuffer driver from an old version running on the Pi 1 and I ported PowerPC code to the Pi 3 and expanded it. The expanded code was a tool similar to tmux, where a user could open more than one shell at once side-by-side. I was able to get multiplexed output, but I ran out of time to get user input working properly. Oh well, I learned a lot anyways.

I've just applied to an accelerated Master's in Computing program with a concentration in Cyber security at my current school. My research mentor, whom I've taken three classes from, wrote one of my letters of recommendation. I haven't heard back yet from the graduate admissions office, but I'm feeling hopeful. My concern, though, is that while my research was extremely interesting and I felt I learned a lot, I'm afraid I've locked myself into the academic track and am unable to get a software engineering internship in industry. I've sent out many applications and have only heard back from two companies, neither of whom decided to proceed with my candidacy further.

I've decided that if I like my graduate work, I may continue on to a PhD, but I still want to work in R&amp;D in industry. Any suggestions on how to proceed?"
ebason,10,2019-12-16,Toxic mom might not be my mom anymore.,persimmonsareawesome,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/ebason/toxic_mom_might_not_be_my_mom_anymore/,"This is a bit long but I’m trying to sort my thoughts out and thought I’d might as well post it on here. I’m a long time lurker here and I’m on mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird. 

My Chinese mother seemed to love me (21f) until I started high school. I have good memories of her as a child but everything seemed to change. For one, I later realized, she never taught me anything about my changing body and she’d put me down anyway she can and utterly destroyed my self-confidence.  At my graduation ceremony, my friend’s mom agreed to do my make up (which my mom never taught me to do) and as she worked, my mom made remarks like “why bother? It’s not going to make a difference anyway. It’s a waste of your time”. I remember crying as my friends’ mom tried putting the make up on me.  She’d yell at me (for over an hour) for reasons like I spilled something and didn’t notice and wouldn’t stop until I started crying. Once after she made me cry, I tried humming a song to cheer myself up and she yelled at me to get out of the house because she can’t stand my humming. Because of her, I became depressed and anxious and began cutting myself. 

The event that made me the angriest was when she hit my grandma (her own mom). She’s always yelled at grandma and put her down despite grandma cooking for our family and taking care of the kids (usual immigrant grandma things). My mom has this fixation about the floor (Ex. When my baby brother fell down the stairs and hit his head on the floor she checked the floor for damage first despite him crying) and at that time grandma had gone blind in one eye and accidentally spilled some sauce on the ground so my mom hit her. I always felt that my grandma was my real mom and I got angry and yelled at her that if she hit my grandma again, then I’d hit her. She then mocked me and said “Do it, I’ll call the police and they’ll arrest you”. Me being a dumb high school kid didn’t know that’s not how the legal system worked and just cried. 

I chose a university out of province (I’m Canadian) and in my first year, she wouldn’t let my dad give me any money. In my family, my dad is the sole/main provider since she didn’t take school seriously and can’t hold down a job. But like a lot of asian matriarchs, she insisted on controlling the purse strings. My dad has to hide money to give to me to buy things like toothpaste and toilet paper. Thankfully I found a well-paying internship that summer and part time work during the school year after and I’ve been financially independent for the past 2 years. 

Last year, my grandma died. Until the day she died, my mom still yelled at her everyday. Grandma told me that she wants me to have a relationship with my mom and since her passing, I feel like my mom has become nicer to me. So I also tried to mend our relationship and for a while it seemed to work. However, there were still days when she’d slip back into hurting me and every time I’d tell myself that I wouldn’t forgive her but for some reason, I’d find my resolve caving each time she was nice to me again. 

Our family is currently on a cruise and we had what I thought was a small fight over her misplacing her keycard. I yelled at her so maybe I’m also at fault here.  After, we had a dinner reservation and she didn’t show up at the specified time. We waited for an hour, sending my dad, me or my brother to go look for her before ordering.  When we met up with her again, she accused us of “ditching her” and says she can “read minds and feel that we don’t want her there” (true, but we’re trying to have a nice family vacation and wanted everyone to be cordial). I confronted her about her behaviour (at the restaurant, also for trying to “expose” my dad as a terrible person when he’s been the only parent to me for the past 7 years). She told me that some people just don’t click and maybe it’s best we don’t try to keep a relationship. She said that she doesn’t feel the need to keep in contact with me. One thing led to another and I asked her why she wouldn’t admit to “abusing” me (I never know if it’s ok to use this word or not) and she laughed and said it’s not abuse because “we’re in Canada and if [she] did something wrong there would’ve been consequences”. I’m just so very hurt right now and I don’t know what to do. During my teenage years I was so deadset on cutting her out of my life but her being nice to me this past year has made me want to have a mom again. I even found myself thinking what to do if my parents divorced, like who I would go see each holiday so that neither of them are alone. But now I feel more justified in cutting her out again. I really don’t know what to do.

Edit: forgot the main point, silly me. She also said she was willing to legally remove our parent-child connection."
ebbj5a,1,2019-12-16,Should I go back to my old company?,schmalsen,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ebbj5a/should_i_go_back_to_my_old_company/,"I quit my job 2014 and went travelling. I am still abroad but want to settle back in somewhere in Europe. 

A week ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. I am heartbroken but believe it was the right the decision. 

I now have the opportunity to get my old job back. I liked my job, liked my colleagues, was happy to go to work every day. But there were also reasons why I left beside that I wanted to go travelling.

Before I had this opportunity, I planned to become a nurse. I was always scared of that decision but it mostly felt right and I think I will be a good fit for this job. I wanted to do some internships to find out for sure. 

I am extremely tempted to take my old job back but also worried that I get too comfortable and end up doing it for much longer than I actually want.

I am completely puzzled because of the breakup, my living situation is challenging at the moment because I feel like I give people weird vibes (that I met only days ago). I am a bit paranoid that everything I do is strange or stupid.

My last trip before settling down turns out to be not that great for a few reasons, each one really bothering me.

I will have to make this decision in the near future. Any thoughts?

ebe8wl,0,2019-12-16,From medicine to OMSCS,LeonardTonsil,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/ebe8wl/from_medicine_to_omscs/,"Hello,

First of all, sorry if you get a lot of these posts. I am just looking for some guidance on whether this idea that I have of changing carreers and making something out if it is crazy or not.

I am a 25 year old medical student from Mexico who is 2 years away from becoming a physician. Starting next year I will be doing a medical internship in Texas where I will be quite busy and from there on I aspire to do a year of research in my country, which I hope will give me some more free time (I have no idea if that will be the case). This semester, I started an online Mathematics degree which is offered by a federal mexican university, so the degree is valid although I don't know if it would be useful in terms of applying to this OMSCS.

Ideally, I would like to apply to get into this program right after I finish my medical degree, but as of right now I don't have much going on for my application other than the fact that I have started an online degree somewhat related to the masters (which I definitely won't be finishing in the next 2 years). I have also done well in medical school (9.3 out of 10 overall GPA in my university's grading scale) and have some programming experience limited to personal projects.

So... I would like to have some kind of plan to make this happen. I have read that having taken some computer science related classes is a must, and doing so through online college courses is possible, so I will look into that (but I am not sure if I will be able to afford multiple courses). I have also read that having some programming projects to showcase is a good idea, so if possible I will try to get something like that done.

I know going from medicine to computer science sounds kind of... impractical, but I think that it would not be so crazy to try to get into something like medical informatics or would it? I also have a bunch of stuff to learn to be at least somewhat remotely qualified to get into this program, so my question as well is... would it be possible to get the basic qualifications for this purpose in just 2 years? If that is not realistic at all, please let me know.

As for the reasons I want to do this, well... there are plenty. The main ones are that I am really interested in computer science and that thinking of being a real physician for many years to come stresses me out. So, why did I choose medicine initially? Well, all I can say is that it was a not so bright move made by my younger self and that I also wanted to do something ""important"" out of myself but my perception of things has completely changed since then...

Any advise would be really great. Thank you."

It's in a week and I'm really not quite sure what I need for this one, it's different than ones I have had in the past, they haven't even seen my resume lol. I assume if they like the initial intro they'll bring me in and go over all of that. 

I figured I should have a copy of my resume and similar documents handy for reference but otherwise, anything else? I'm not even sure if it's for an official offer either, but one of the top people (lot of people) is making the call so it seems to be something. My main concern is that I'm not sure what I'd be doing there, as I'm aiming to become a security consultant and I really doubt that is along the lines of what I'd be doing here other than maybe some auditig. However, I understand that it is good experience regardless even if it's just network monitoring/call desk stuff if that's even what it would be. So any tips? Thanks!"

***
Sorry for not writing for so long. It just seemed pointless for the longest time. But I guess I have to say goodbye - it'd be impolite to do otherwise.
    
Little by little, I'm beginning to walk.   
    
The strength has been coming back very slowly to me, ounce by ounce. With my poor diet, my body had to cannibalize some muscle tissue in order to heal the wound. It's going to leave an ugly scar, too: right now I have a hole in my side filled to the brim with scar tissue. I can't help but poke it all the time even though it's disgusting.   
    
Of course, I won't be going for any food raids any time soon: I might be able to descend down the rope but to climb back, while carrying a dozen kilos of food on me…That's just impossible. I'll repeat the fate of that old man who couldn't get back inside.   
   
So for the past week, I've been lying in bed in Natasha's apartment. I guess you could say it's become a hospital of sorts.   
   
She takes care of both me and the old man. One boiled potato per day for each of us. She's been boiling them all while using the same pot of water - says it'll make a nice soup when we're out of everything else.     
     
Maxim and other men try to raid the groceries nearby, but each raid gets more difficult than the last - mostly because half of the time somebody doesn't return. They'd taken the guns they'd found in the bandit's hideout, but from what I've been told they're not much use, and the gunshots usually imply that someone is living out their last seconds in terror.     
     
I don't hear much about the outside except for some rumors. Before I was locked inside the apartment complex. But now it feels like the danger lurks right beyond the door's threshold, beyond our windows. It feels like my fortress that used to be the whole building shrunk to fit inside Natasha's apartment. With my limited mobility, I can't feel safe outside her apartment.   
    
We're almost out of food, and I can hear people bickering with each other more and more. It seems to head in a nasty direction, and each time Natasha steps out of her apartment…I fear that she might not return.   
     
She says that crazy things go on outside. Things that just a month or even two weeks ago would make my hair stand up, but now I'm just too tired and exhausted with all this bullshit to react. I feel like the same goes for everyone else in the building.   
    
Natasha says that a mysterious human figure has been spotted right on the very very verge of the forest. It signaled to the observers to come out and follow it and then disappeared in the forest. It seemed impossible for it to be one of the survivors.     
     
On another day, the tenants from one of the apartments started screaming that the voices in their heads were too loud. I'd believe that it was just madness taking if over if it was just one person. But all three of them? That was just very unlikely.    
    
And a few nights before we all woke up from the stampede. Hundreds of legs were rushing from the forest, past our house, and into the town. I could feel the building tremble from vibrations their mighty feet were sending into the ground, and the screeches of many beasts were mixing together, to a point where it was hard to tell which one I'd heard before.   
      
No one dared look out the window. We were all just hoping that they'd all pass and let us continue living on our pointless lives.    
     
After they'd passed, we could hear gunshots firing off in the distance throughout the whole next day. The sounds of shots got the old man quite agitated.      
     
I never managed to get more than a few coherent sentences at a time out of him. It seems that the physical toll on his body as well as whatever guilt he's been feeling has made him lose it bit by bit.    
    
He talked about a place far in the forest. He was confusing things so I'm still not quite sure what it was. In some stories, it's a town and in others - a base in a forest. Sometimes it's a lab and sometimes an archeological dig. It was built by the Soviets…and it 's been there long ago.   
     
But in all stories, one word always came up.    
     
""The Door"".    
    
He worked there as an intern. He says that our entire town was built by the Soviets precisely because of that location. It was a closed-off town, the one that wasn't on any maps - even on the secret ones. Our town was a place where all the scientists and personnel lived. He said that he got his apartment back when he was assigned to the project and was very proud of being a home-owner at a young age.    
   
Whatever they'd been doing there, the higher-ups ended up disappointed with the results, so the project was closed and the town was de-classified even before the fall of the Union. He said that he'd forgotten what he'd seen there until a month ago.   
     
But now, despite decades of abandonment, something was happening there again. Something that unleashed the hordes of these monsters.     
    
As the man himself said it, ""Something on the other side has finally made contact with us…Forty years after we sent out our first signal"".    
     
He didn't elaborate on what the other side was, or where were the beasts coming form in such volume. Soon after, he shut himself off from the world around him and wouldn't talk anymore.   

Two days ago, the mysterious figure was back again. This time I got a good look at it. A long black winter jacket with a hood that obscured its face. A dark spot so clearly visible on the snow. I say ""it"" because despite it looking completely human, I can't accept it as such.   
     
The only thing different was that, on that day, some people followed it into the woods.    
    
I was almost one of them. The voice I'd heard in my head was just too alluring to ignore.    
    
Yesterday, it came back again. And once more, with a wave of its hand, people started crawling out of windows to follow it. Some were just hanging over rails and falling down onto the snow from the second floor, before getting up and following its call, ignoring the cold and broken appendages.    
    
I had to restrain Natasha from following it. It seems that some people are more susceptible to its call…and so she answered it.    
     
I was fighting her for a good five minutes. She didn't hit or bite me - she was just silently pushing with her whole body toward the door, trying to get out of the building and follow it. I was shouting at her, even hitting her to bring her back to her senses, all the while feeling the strength leave my already weakened body. And throughout all that, I could almost feel the creature's waiting gaze, piercing through the solid walls and judgingly looking over Natasha, disapproving that she was making it wait for her.    
    
Finally, it left, and Natasha came back to her senses. I almost burst out crying when I realized that she was back with me - over the last few weeks, she'd become the closest person to me, almost like a sister. To see her back to her senses was a great relief.    
     
But then the chill of cold air passed past us, and with the terror, we realized that we were the only two people left in the apartment. The old man left, and he didn't bother to close the window behind him. Seeing as it was the fifth floor, we didn't risk looking out to see if he survived - we knew the answer.    
    
We simply closed the window.    
    
Today, the mysterious figure, the haunted Pied Piper will undoubtedly return. And this time, we all may fall victim to his call.     
    
So we have to choice but to abandon the ship.   
     
There are no more than ten people left in the building, and we're all ready to leave. We've eaten all the food we've had - no point carrying it on us anymore. We've put on the warmest clothes we had to combat winter, and we've all prepared the makeshift weapons. Some sharpened their brooms, but I decided to stick with my hatchet - I'm still convinced that it's the best weapon I have.    
    
We're leaving in five minutes, and Natasha's pouring potato soup into cups - our last meal in this building.    
     
We don't know where we'll go and far we'll get, but I'm sure of one thing - we'd be safer away from the forest. We might even travel from one building to another - after all, we doubt that people closed their apartments before evacuating. So who knows, we might survive.    
     
We'll head somewhere far away. Away from the military, away from the creatures. I'm sure we'll find the way.    
    
And if in the future I'm not maimed or shot and I finally have a moment to sit down and safely recount what I'd been through, I'll let you all know. So keep your fingers crossed for me, and, hopefully, I'll talk to you soon.

ebhae1,7,2019-12-16,TIFU by provoking a cow and getting lost in the jungle,asturdylamp,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ebhae1/tifu_by_provoking_a_cow_and_getting_lost_in_the/,"This happened not today but around 6 years ago. TL;DR at bottom.

I had just graduated college and was crashing on my brother's couch on the West coast of Mexico. He had an internship and I had nothing to do every day but surf and explore the surrounding area.

I came to really enjoy this small town about a mile in from the coast. There were a few small waterfalls you could jump off and some trails to explore. One day I ran into an Australian backpacker who tells me about some massive waterfalls way into the jungle, about a three hour hike. He said there was a cowboy-type older man who would take me there on horse for a 1000 pesos.

I speak what I consider to be decent Spanish but I found this cowboy very difficult to understand. I guess you could compare it to a non-native English speaker talking to someone from a thick rural Southern accent. He was able to convey to me that he went to the waterfalls just the day before and he would need a few days to recover before he returned (he was probably in his sixties). He showed me film pictures he took of the waterfalls and they looked pretty amazing. I was unable to find anything on the internet about these waterfalls so my interest was certainly peaked.

I said I'd be back in a week or so but I was excited by the idea of these waterfalls and so early the next day, armed with thirty minutes of Google Maps research, a water bottle and a cliff bar, I set out into the jungle.

I followed a stream for about three hours because any water followed uphill will lead to a waterfall, right? Wrong. Eventually I got to a fork in the stream and I realized this waterfall could be up either side or nowhere near where I was. To be honest, I didn't have high hopes of finding the waterfall that day but trekking through the jungle didn't seem to be a bad way to spend the day. I decided that would be a good point to make my way back.

On the way back I noticed a goat path leading away from the stream. I followed it out of curiosity and wound up far from the stream where the jungle broke into an open area you could almost call a meadow. There were a number of cows in this meadow. I happened to notice a calf hanging out in the shade of a tree. It was adorable and I wanted a picture. I only had a GoPro which has a fish eye lens. To get a picture of anything you have to be very close.

So I inch up to this baby cow and somehow didn't see its massive mom eyeing me. If you find an adorable baby animal in the wild know that its mother is probably watching you and waiting to charge. And that's just what this cow did. I turned and ran as fast as my legs would take me. All I could see was the headline in my local paper; *Man last seen in Mexico found in Jungle 10 Years Later Presumably Mauled by Cow.* At the time it felt like this cow was chasing me for a mile but my best guess is the cow chased me for maybe 10-15 seconds and I sprinted as fast as I could for another 45 to be safe. That short amount of time running, not paying attention to my surroundings, was enough for me to get completely disoriented. I had no idea where the goat path was. It was a little after noon and the sun was very high in the sky. I tried to walk in a spiral to find the goat path but a lot of the terrain was hard to pass and I was scared shitless of cows so I avoided any sign of them.

Eventually I found myself making my way through thick brush. I had to admit to myself at this point that I was completely lost in the jungle. I imagined what my brother would think when he came home to a locked apartment and no me. I wished I had told him where I was going.

After about an hour of scratching myself pushing through thick brush I found a small amount of running water. I figured if I followed it it would lead me towards an ocean or a road and for the first time all day I was right. Some time later I found a dirt path which lead me to a cattle gate. I hopped that and eventually made it to a dirt road. Two miles on that and a Corona pick up truck full of the empty 40 oz bottles comes the same direction as me. It wasn't even a hitchhiking situation, they just told me to get in. They drove me out to the main road and dumped me at the bus station. After 45 minutes of waiting a couple of kids come by in another truck and tell me to get in the back. They ran the zipline tours in the area. They gave me a beer and I'll tell you that was the best beer I've ever had in my life.

I ended up exchanging numbers with the kids and befriending them. They dropped me off just after sunset so this was probably around an 11 hour saga. If you take anything from this story never approach a baby cow, moose or bear in the wild. They might be cute, their moms are not!

TL; DR explored the jungle a little too adventurously, found a baby cow, got run off by its mom and disoriented, subsequently got lost in the jungle."

Hi, all! I'm so glad I found this sub to vent a bit about my current career situation. I apologize in advance for the length!

I graduated from a large public university in May 2019, with a 3.99 GPA, departmental valedictorian status, and early graduation by a full year. I attended the main campus of said university for my freshman year, but after the loss of my dad that spring, I moved home to support my mother and sister and attend the university's highly regarded distance learning program. During those at-home years of school, I worked 20+ hours per week as a Run Specialty Associate at a local running specialty store, a job that I absolutely loved and had a deep, intrinsic passion for. In addition to work and school, I also maintained a rigorous distance running training program that netted me top honors at numerous local races and a top-2% finish at the 2019 Boston Marathon. I say this not to humblebrag or anything like that, but rather to give a more holistic picture of who I am / what drives me.

Given my major in International Politics - National Security Studies, I was blessed to land an internship that following summer as a National Security Research Intern at the United States Army War College. I absolutely loved the research and analytical nature of the position, and after contributing to two published academic articles and gaining a close rapport with my internship professor, I was invited back the following summer for another bout of research, data analysis, and writing. This time, I even contributed to a full-length academic book, something of which I am immensely proud.

Having had an eternal passion for aviation, and having earned my pilot's license while still in high school, I always thought I wanted to be a pilot, and was planned to earn a degree mostly as a fallback option. To that end, I pursued additional flight training throughout the summer of 2018, spending about three thousand dollars on earning my instrument rating. However, and thankfully before I spent the $75K+ it takes to become a commercial pilot, I realized that I could never see myself flying professionally, and really didn't enjoy flying as much as I did the \*idea\* of flying. This was a crushing blow to my own psyche, and left me feeling like I had let my childhood self down.

With the prospects of a career in aviation behind me, I threw myself into my academic studies. After taking an incredible intelligence community simulation class, and considering how much I enjoyed my internships, I decided to pursue an analytical career in the US Government / defense industry. Throughout the spring of my one-year-early ""senior"" year and over the following summer, I applied for a host of contractor and government positions. I never heard back from most, but did end up undergoing an extensive testing and interview process for a three-letter government intelligence agency.

Fast-forward to August 2019. After not hearing back from the Agency yet, and feeling increasingly pressured by my mom that I was fast becoming an unsuccessful, stagnant disappointment, I applied for a position as an Internet Marketing Consultant at a startup-style, millennial-to-the-bone company and got the job. I didn't really love the idea of the work, but the shiny exterior and targeted perks (take your pet to work! an in-house barista!) of the company dragged me in. I immediately accepted and moved into my own apartment near the city of the job, about 30 minutes away from my family home.

However, the day after I accepted the internet marketing job and signed my lease, I got a call from an unlisted number: the government intelligence agency was giving me a conditional job offer as an intelligence analyst, my absolute dream job. I figured I would work at the marketing company until my security clearance package went through for the Agency, but then the true nature of the job began to show. Contrary to the presentations I had been given in the interview process, employees received no real benefits, were expected to work 55+ hours per week (plus home study time) for a mediocre salary, had to request permission to use the bathroom and add any time spent doing that to the end of their workday, etc. I submitted my resignation after a little more than a week, and thanks to some digging I had done on the intra-company wiki, applied for and ultimately received a secret $3,000 early-exit package.

For the next couple months, I continued working at the run specialty store job that I had loved so much throughout college, applied like a madman for a host of any job I could get in the local area, and continued to undergo the lengthy background check and security clearance process for my conditional intelligence agency job. Thankfully, my background check and psych evals were conducted and adjudicated much faster than is the norm, but my first polygraph in November was inconclusive; that's a common concurrence, but I'll have to wait until 2020 to even schedule the second poly. Throughout the process, applicants only rarely hear from the Agency, and it is always in the back of your mind that your CJO can be rescinded at any time and for any reason.

In the meantime, I landed a job back in my family's town, working as an Information Reporting Specialist for a nonprofit community development organization. I've now worked here for approximately two weeks; I make decent money ($17/hour), and the 37.5 hour workweek is amazing. However, I have a minor sense of dread at coming into the office every morning. I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing (my predecessor had my job for 20+ years before suddenly and unexpectedly retiring), there is high turnover, and 85% of my coworkers in the organization are women aged 55+; I couldn't feel more out-of-place if I tried.

Right now, to save both a 1+ hour daily commute and over $400 per month, I'm looking to break my lease at my expensive city apartment complex and move back to an apartment owned by grandma in the downtown area of the same town in which I work. It'll be a lot of money to break the lease in the short-term, but it'll save money in the long-term, and I would have to do it anyway if everything with the Agency goes through.

At any rate, I hope I don't sound like I'm whining; I'm very lucky to have a stable job and no debt. At the same time, however, I'm incredibly paranoid that the job offer at my intelligence community dream job will fall through for one reason or another after all of the time, effort, and emotional worth I've put into it, marooning me at this depressing dead-end position forever. In essence, I feel like my life would be over before it even got started, and that's terrifying to me. I have no idea what I would do if that happened.

I cannot see myself working at my current job forever, and although I have a true passion for the run specialty industry in which I still have a (very) part-time weekend foothold, my INTPL - NatSec degree severely limits me in career prospects in that field. Sigh. Life is confusing, man.

Thank you so much for listening, and I welcome your input!"
ebimh7,2,2019-12-16,Could missing the office Christmas dinner impact my office relations? How can I be less nervous when eating around people?,Moltenmelt1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ebimh7/could_missing_the_office_christmas_dinner_impact/,"This is my first job. It started as an internship back in June and they decided to extend me. I’m not incredibly familiar with the terminology but I think that means that I have a part time job? I don’t know if there is a specified date when they will let me go or if they can decide at any time whether to keep me on or not. I am a very anxious person and do not socialize or talk very much. But I try as much as I can. If there is a coworker who is standing next to the entrance when I walk in in the morning, I always say good morning. The same goes for my coworker who I share a room with. I initiate a conversation with her sometimes or ask a question about work or ask her how her weekend was, but we don’t really speak that often. Our computers are situated on completely different sides of the room and our workstations block our sight lines so that helps. I’ve gone to almost all scheduled events and meetings. I didn’t go to a dinner about 2 months ago but that was because around half of the office was staying back. I went to Thanksgiving lunch in the office a few weeks ago, but I felt less nervous because it was in the office and I knew that the safety of my workstation was right around the corner. I didn’t bail out early though. I recently finished my semester at college so I can work 39 hours a week. I have a really bad problem with eating around other people. It makes me very nervous. My coworkers have always been incredibly nice to me and understanding of my college schedule and commitments. I have an almost complete inability to make eye contact with people. I don’t know if I would be able to stand going to the Christmas dinner tommorow at a nearby steakhouse. Only one other person is staying behind. I don’t know if I could sit directly in front of another person not really speaking to people while they converse around me. I panicked and have already said that I can go when my supervisor said that they’d love to have me there. What should I do. Is there any way to lessen my anxiety? Will they think less of me and could it possibly affect my future with this job?"

Not so much as what languages or specific technologies but akin to a beginner programmer should know:
* variables
* loops

While an intermediate programmer might know:
* classes
* OOP
* etc

ebmt3n,1,2019-12-16,Stay or go,throw_it_in_da_trash,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ebmt3n/stay_or_go/,"So, throwaway account for what should be obvious reasons. 

I'm non-traditional student-parent in my thirties. 

For context, I decided to go to college to fulfill a personal goal (first-generation student) and for general intellectual enrichment. I left a good health-care related management career that I was pretty successful in to do this and my thinking was that I would just go back to it after graduating with a humanities degree. While attending school I discovered programming and computer science and my life plans drastically changed. I've found a sense of challenge and excitement in the problems of the field that I didn't even know I was missing and now I'm doing a CS minor and changing careers. 

Also probably significant, I go to a 'target' school and the minor is known to be almost as rigorous as the major. I'd actually switch my major but due to 'credit limits' I physically can't.

My Question:

I recently completed an internship that now has the opportunity to become more. The company is pretty lame and management is a mess. No clear lead or mentor, no code reviews, terrible communication, etc.

On the plus side I can work remotely, the people are mostly nice (if not very helpful), the work is interesting enough for my experience level, and there's plenty of opportunity to take ownership of some of it and institute more of the 'best practices' I expect in better tech companies. 

I was thinking I would quit since there's no real mentorship opportunity for me here and like I said, the company isn't exciting. 

My question is if I should stick it out and try to turn it into something better or if staying could do more damage than harm? I feel like kind of a snob turning my nose up at this situation considering how difficult I see it is for people but I don't know. My endgame is Big N if possible or civic-minded start-ups and organizations like those coming out of Code For America. Any thoughts or advice would be very appreciated or even questions you would be asking yourselves.

Did I get rejected?",melissalynng,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/eboctp/interviewed_for_a_junior_role_later_find_a_job/,"UPDATE: I actually was contacted by the art director and moved forward with the interview process

So I recently interviewed with the art director of a company and the position was posted on Indeed and was specifically hiring a junior designer to help out the director.

The interview was last tuesday and it went really well, she (art director) kept saying I was asking great questions and even complimented my past work.

I sent her a thank you email a couple days later, but I haven't heard back.

Just now I saw a post from the same company, it wasn't the same exact job description, but it was similar enough to boggle my mind. The job title was also slightly different. From what the art director told me, it was just her as far as the design team and she was thinking of taking on a design intern in february.

She also mentioned that she had other candidates to interview.

Am I overthinking or did she just create another job post to get more experienced candidates?

The job search can be so frustrating!!"
eboh0g,1,2019-12-16,Should I learn programming on the side or get a CS degree?,econtena,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eboh0g/should_i_learn_programming_on_the_side_or_get_a/,"I’m already pursuing an economics &amp;amp; accounting degree. I’m barely done with my first quarter of UC, and I have 5 more to go. 

I was kinda rushed to transfer from a community college to a university. As a result, I picked a major that I’m not too certain of, but can somewhat see a future in.

I managed to get an internship at a big 4 accounting firm, but I’m not sure if I see myself doing accounting my whole life.

I have the options of 1) keep on pursuing this Econ and accounting degree and learn how to program on the side by doing projects or 2) go back to community college for a year and transfer to a university as a CS major, would take me three years. Option 1 would have me graduating at 23 while option 2 would have me graduating at 24 or 25.

The thing is, I feel like I’m wasting my life away going back. My dad tells me that I have so much competition with the people who started programming at a young age. He kinda made it seem like I’m too old to learn how to program. I feel like I’d be more happy with a software engineering job. I feel like 10 years from now, everything will be tech, and doing CS would give me job security.

I’m scared of making this change, can I get advice?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if applying to internships at the masters level with no previous internship experience is a hard thing to do/frowned upon by recruiters? I am looking to get into ML/AI engineering, however, I have not managed to get any internships during my undergrad and now I am going straight to a masters degree from undergrad due to that. Do you think my chances will be significantly reduced?

Thank you."

ebphqb,3,2019-12-16,Loser Student Who Needs Help/Advice,BarbarianGlamGnome,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ebphqb/loser_student_who_needs_helpadvice/,"On mobile and dumb so forgive me for my mistakes. I typed this at d&amp;d on the notes app while battling drowe elves.

So I am a first generation college student. And I am new to this sub and lost rn.  I am in my senior year at University.  I have an extra semester because I changed my major at community college from biomed to general studies. I graduated with my associates degree in gen studies and transferred to the local state University and picked a major.  I picked up a minor because I have to be in University for an extra semester anyways and a professor begged me to take it since I loved the material and was naturally good at it I guess.  So I will graduate in December of 2020 (But walk in May 2021 ugh) with a Bachelor’s degree in Business-Finance and a minor in Economics. 

Idk what I should do as my next steps rn but here are my lame student stats. I worry because other students are so much better than me and I have no one to guide me in regards to grad school and if I should do it right away or after working, and if ai could get into a good one. Here we are:

Gpa:  In my state when you transfer, all of the credits have to be accepted (might not fulfil the class requirements or the credit requirements may be diff but all the credits will transfer) and you start with a new gpa.  

At community college I finished with around a 3.5 

At community college I was dealing with alot. Was in a severely abusive household due to a mentall ill and alcoholic mother, a bad eating disorder, being a lonely and autistic kid still with anxiety and depression (might have add and am recently in therapy now to see and stuff), was sexually abused in my first real relationship, was my dad’s therapist when us two were kicked out by my mom and homeless for a whole semester with no heating, packed and moved houses completely within a few days with like no help not once but twice, and I was very suicidal and tried killing myself a few times).   I still should have tried harder and accept my faults. 

At University I have a 4.0 so far (three semesters down and two to go).

Club involvement: Mainly for Circle K International which is an international volunteering club and a part of the Kiwanis family.
- 1st year - Club Secretary (community college)
- 2nd year - Club Secretary (community college) 
- 3rd year - Scrapbook Committee (our scrapbook won at the district convention for our state).  And got elected club treasurer (remember that our terms for officer positions start in april so it’s a bit confusing to pin a year on anything. (University) 
- 4th year. Club treasurer until April but everyone and especially the district treasurer want me to run for the district treasurer position in our state. (University) 

Other club stuff:  At the community college I would help out radio club a handful of times.

Participated in relay for life. 
At University I was somewhat involved in the Relay for Life planning and fundraised a bit on my own page.  Will do so again.

Went to some pride alliance meetings and events when I could. 

Work experience:

1st year college - worked at Dairy Queen for a short time but the season ended in October.

After that I worked for a local small theme park for kids at the snack bar for 3 years and regularly got employee awards and was picked to work at a televised event. (About to finish my third year there because I want to find something else after this season ends, and that scares me but yeah).

And during the summer after Junior year I got a Marketing internship at a solar panel business and did that while working at the theme park. So I worked 7 days a week.

Hobbies/Interests:  
- Pathfinder and D&amp;D
- Magic The Gathering
- Starting to get into painting figurines
- Art and writing/reading
- Lifting (I do it when I can, sometimes I get too busy or depressed for months. But it makes me happy.)
- Learning Electric guitar and soon will also learn Piano. I need to learn basic vocals as well lol.
- Volunteering - Volunteer club lol. 
- Sometimes I lightsaber battle with ultrasaber sabers. 
- Used to go to church before I secretly became Agnostic. 
- Computer/Video games
- Huge Nerd in general.
- Cosplay.

Awards: At community college out of 4 semesters I got deans list 2 times. And presidential list once. One semester I got a c because I legit thought I’d be successfully dead before the final.

Got a public speaking award for the honors public speaking class I took. Big deal for me because I am autistic and went all out on my final presentation. We had an award night and everything.

I got a club officer award at my school. 

At University for each semester I have gotten a deans list award (deans list is the highest one they have here, no presidential). And I have two more semesters to go. At dcon I will likely get state awards for getting members dues paid and such as Treasurer. 

I got a scholarship for 1,000 based on financial need and academic success.

So yeah, that’s my lame stuff. Sorry for being a female nerdy lame person."

Overall, things have not been going that well. I haven't gotten back all my grades yet, but there's a chance i failed one, or maybe even 2 classes out of 4 this semester. That's not really cause it's too hard for me. These past two years in school i just haven't been doing that great and i haven't been involved with stuff really. I don't even understand enough about finance to start looking for internships. 90% of this is cause of mental health stuff that has been better recently. But anyways, i was wondering if i should change my major based on these things

1. I'm not socially awkward but im introverted unless it's my family or really close friends, and i feel like people in finance are almost ALL way more talkative than me. I feel like maybe in ITS it isn't like that as much
2. Wouldn't an IT job be more direct? Honestly i'm not really too familiar or good with most of the software but once i start taking classes and learn it i feel like jobs that are IT related are more direct than stuff like finance/accounting

So I have applied to Stanford, UC Berkeley, and CMU MS program for computer science, but I'm not sure if I have any chance of getting in. I didn't apply to MIT because I'm not really looking to do research much, and also because I know my chances are basically 0 lol. I'm sure my chances at the other top 1 CS schools are very slim, but I wanted to see what you guys thought.

My main concern is my GPA and lack of my name on any research papers, but below are some of the important stats, which you can judge for yourself:

- Cumulative GPA: 3.561
- Major GPA: 3.58
- GRE: 168 Quant, 161 Verbal, 5 Essay (329/340 total)
- 2 internships: data science internship at big financial company and machine learning internship at tech startup
- 3 Strong LoRs (I know this because they heavily implied/directly told me they would write a strong one) from research professor, AI professor, and manager from first internship
- Strong (I think) Statement of Purpose that I ran through 3 different professors, and which I have worked on for 6 months
- Personal Statement for UC Berkeley which I spent like 3 days on because I didn't even know we had to do it until I started the application; however, I think it turned out kind of decently.
- Research experience with my name on a project associated with a published paper, but no name as an author on a paper itself

I know that it is very difficult to judge someone's exact chances, but half of me is telling me I have some chance and the other half is saying that I don't because of my lack of my name on a publication as well as my subpar GPA, considering the GPA of everyone else who applies. Please let me know in your HONEST opinion whether I even have any chances, and if so, how much it is. Also, please don't tell me to try to increase my GPA because I graduate in 2 days. Thanks in advanced!

Note: I also applied to Princeton, Cornell, UMich, UT Austin, Wash U, and UI-UC. However, you don't have to chance me for those if you don't want to."

I am expected to graduate at the end of February, but I currently do not have a job lined up. All my fellow classmates who are graduating with me, or even in May, already have jobs lined up.  

I’m feeling stuck because I am already 4.5 years in to getting this degree, and I am not finding any jobs that I actually want to do. I don’t enjoy coding or designing.

If I even went into an interview for electrical engineering, I don’t think I could portray enthusiasm for the job. I don’t want to lie myself into a career I hate just to pay the bills.

I am starting to feel that I don’t even want to go into a career in the engineering field. I did have an engineering internship early on in my degree, and I HATED it. I felt like I did not add anything into the team of engineers, and I dreaded going in every day.

I am very good in mathematics and that’s the main reason I pursued engineering in the first place. I enjoy solving math problems and writing technical reports.  

I stumbled across an article that does a better job of putting my feelings and emotions into words. He was a graduate in electrical and computer engineering, who ended up becoming a financial analyst. If any of you would like to read the article, it can be found here: [http://www.olin.edu/blog/career-and-graduate-stories/post/what-if-i-don%E2%80%99t-want-be-engineer/](http://www.olin.edu/blog/career-and-graduate-stories/post/what-if-i-don%E2%80%99t-want-be-engineer/)  

I am open to continuing my education, because I am one of those weird ones that loves school. Although I am open to graduate school, I am on the fence because I need to start supporting myself and paying back my loans.

I am looking for advice from anyone who may have found yourself in a similar situation. What did you do and where are you now in life?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a first-year undergraduate student attending UBC with a CS focus, and will hopefully be specializing in combined CS/Stats next year. Like many first years I have very little experience in the field, but regardless would like to get a jump start by seeing what I can do to land a potentially relevant listing over the summer in May 2020.

**Skills I currently have:**

* Very basic working knowledge of Unity and C#
* Working knowledge of Github
* Took two intro-level programming courses so far first term - CPSC 110 &amp; 121, the first one teaches very basic data structures with a learning language, Dr. Racket, and the second one teaches very basic computational theory, I doubt either will really be useful in interviews.

**Skills I expect to Have by the summer:**

* Working knowledge in Python (self-taught)
* Working knowledge in R and Jupyter Notebook (course second term)
* Working knowledge in Java (course second term)

**Projects I expect to have by the summer:**

* Currently working on a platformer game with a team as part of a club, C# and Unity, as a coder
* CS course next term involves creating a working project using Java
* Applied to attend a 24-hour hackathon in January, unsure if accepted yet

Others: I'm expecting to have a GPA of around 80-90% in my courses in this term so far, however of course that is a guess as my final grades aren't out yet.

I have heard that applications open up many months in advance and I am of course constantly on the lookout for opportunities to see what skills are in demand and what employers are looking for.

So my question is - with the skills I have, and the skills I expect to have, is there any chance of me landing even a very basic summer internship anywhere? What kind of things should I be on the lookout for, what course of action should I try to take? What should I be wary of? Any skills you would recommend me to pick up in the coming months?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much for reading so far and helping out a newbie to the field.

Cheers!"

I've also worked as a part time  developer for a research organization at my school since early 2017. The  research organization has offered me a full time position for around  $50k in a low cost of living college town. This is obviously less than I  could be making elsewhere, but one of the benefits of this job is that I  could get a masters degree in CS over the next 2 years or so while for around $1000/semester while working full time. This is common at this job, and they're pretty willing to be accommodating and work around your class schedule. It's also worth nothing that the organization has a very laid back culture, a flexible remote policy, and tons of leave since it's a university job. To be clear, despite the fact that this is technically a research  organization, it's basically a full stack web dev position, and I wouldn't actually be doing research. I don't have any other offers yet, but I'm early in the interview process with a couple of companies and still actively applying elsewhere. My experience at the research organization is my only professional programming experience, though I do have a few personal projects and a non-CS internship in IT audit.

As I mentioned, I'm majoring in management information systems as opposed  to CS. I've taught myself a lot of the common data structures and algorithms that I missed out on in a CS curriculum. I grind LeetCode a decent amount, and can pretty confidently solve easies and some mediums in a reasonable time frame. However, I still worry that my degree in MIS will hold me back compared to CS grads. I'm guessing that a CS masters would help me in that department. I've also just taken a much bigger interest in computer science in my spare time since I've started studying algorithms, and I have a pretty strong desire to learn more about the subject. However, I'd have to live in a small college town that I don't particularly like and make less money than I could elsewhere. I'd like to work in the bay area or LA, which is mostly where I'm applying now.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I wanted to be thorough in explaining my circumstances. Thoughts on whether or not this is worth it?"

I’d appreciate some insight as to whether or not these types of offers usually pan out. Is this practically having a job lined up two and a half years in advance? Or does it carry no weight?

Anything else to know about you:
I am doing my AP Research project on Marxist Film Theory (I love discussing the topic so please ask questions lol), hoping to publish at the end of this year.

Schools: Northeastern, Tufts, Rutgers, UPenn (mega reach LMAO I'm not expecting to get in here), American, Georgetown, Penn State

I worry that my ECs simply aren't impressive. I see y'all out here with big internships at the NYSE and like doing science research and like I feel like I've wasted 3 years of HS and now I'm scraping for anyone who'll take me. I also don't have many ECs nor a spike so I worry I lack any personality.

I've been looking at schools in Boston, so the northeast is really where I'd like to stay but I've also been looking pretty intently at UF, so really east coast. Not looking for a huge party scene but a school with lots of clubs and student interaction is a big plus. Campuses near a city are great, but as long as there are things to do I don't mind either. Boston is my top choice, it's just perfect for me. History, culture, opportunities, good schools, college city, 10/10

As my nanny family was moving, I did a part time internship as a recruiter for a nanny start up before they ceased operations due to lack of funding.  About a month after that, I accepted a full time job offer through an agency as an operations coordinator.  So I guess I'm kind of in the HR path but also still on the outside.  My current placement has told me that they intend to bring me on full time but we all know how that can go.  They dont hire a lot of temps and so I tend to believe them when they say they'd like to bring me on.  The job is okay, it's not terrible and not amazing - I'd call that a win.

However, my old boss from the start up contacted me and asked if I'd be interested in an onboarding coordinator position at the new company shes at.  It's another start-up, so there are worries there.  But I really really loved my internship at our old start up and I'm wondering if this position is similar.  

There are a lot of things to consider: 

Both jobs are within a mile of each other but I live about 50 miles away.  My current job lets me be flexible with my start and end time - I'm not sure if that'd be the case for the other.  

My current job is a well established agency that probably isn't going anywhere. 

The pay here is pretty good, the other position has a range that starts on the lower end and goes to a pretty good amount - I dont think I'd have enough experience to ask for the higher range although I definitely would need that to make the commute worth it.  

There are more free amenities at the other position - gym, cold brew, parking. Typical start up things to get young people excited.  It works on me, lol.  

I guess I'm just not sure how to navigate this as someone who hasn't been in the professional world for more than a few months.  

Should I just interview to find out more information?  Is leaving a contracted job after only a month, not only a horrible thing to do, but going to look awful on a resume that's already a little chaotic?  How would I navigate this with the agency that I'm actually an employee of?  I signed a non compete but that would only be with other recruiting agencies, correct?

I realize that this is all very hypothetical but I'm lost and could use some guidance.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I got an offer from a very dear friend of my father who works on the domain. He is doing like a startup in Dubai and more than once mentioned that after graduation we may be working together. He said that he is not taking me for my technical skills (which ""I will develop with time"") but for my person, because he is in need for someone to trust with the startup to be able to focus on his other business.

His startup seems doing moderately well and in general he is a man with good experience in the domain.
The job he is offering is Full-stack Web Dev. for their website.

I am accepting the offer because where I live there is no prospect for CS grads at all and I am not financially secure at all.

Would you accept that?"
ebz38u,1,2019-12-17,Community college student with a few questions,sliced_bredd,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ebz38u/community_college_student_with_a_few_questions/,"I'm a student in my local community college and am planning to transfer to a state school after 3 semesters here and major in Computer Science. However, on this sub and in other places I have seen lots of people say that a degree on its own likely wont get you anywhere without a portfolio or previous work experience such as internships. So right now, I feel like I'm in a difficult situation. I have programming experience in the following ways:

* I took a high school class on Java. It was paced in a way that we only really got to arrays by the end of the year.
* I also learned a bit of JavaScript through the code.org curriculum in another high school class.
* I have taken 3 high school classes that have forced me to learn the block-based Scratch style of programming, so if you name something that can be done in Scratch, I can probably do it easily by now.
* I have taken a C++ course in my community college that went over all the concepts I already knew and explained how to do them in C++.
* I did a SoloLearn course on Python, but I don't really remember much of it.
* If I was asked to rank the languages I know most, I'd say C++ is my best currently.

So I have the basic concepts of programming drilled into my brain by now (stuff like ""what is a loop"" or ""how can I write nested if statements"") and I'm sick of learning the same stuff over and over again. I decided I wanted to try and learn Python through the Eric Matthes' ""Python Crash Course."" The problem is, it's difficult to force myself to go through the early parts of the book because I already know what all these concepts are and I'm tired of going over the basics. Are there any resources out there (doesn't matter to me the language) that start out assuming the person learning already has a basic understanding of things like loops, arrays, and if statements? If it matters, my goal would be that I'm aiming for an internship as soon as I possibly can."

I joined Upwork to try and get some freelance projects to practice coding and add to my portfolio, but so far I haven't had any of my submissions accepted. I've also started looking at jobs locally, but it seems like anything called ""entry level"" is still way too advanced for me or asking for experience I don't have.

I'm searching for entry-level web development jobs and lot of positions say the minimum education requirement is a Bachelors degree (even seen some with a Masters as a minimum requirement), or they ask for 2-5 years of experience, or they want loads more coding languages and multiple JS libraries.

Even internships tend to require a degree or they want the applicant to be a current student.

I live in NYC, am I just in a really competitive city where the requirements are higher? Or am I lacking understanding of what ""entry level"" actually means?

I'd really appreciate any advice, because I'm starting to feel like I'm not cut out for this :-/"

It started off with me and some friends doing interview prep together and from there we formed a club and got funding from the university. 


To make sure everyone that joined the club was serious and good we had some GPA requirements. No one cared.

It started the buzz when a quant hedge fund funded us too and offered me and some of the other members internships. People in our major found out about it, and we had a lot of people apply.

Long story short most people got rejected. Now the University is coming down on me to ease up our requirements or get rid of them entirely. And said that our club should encourage the love of mathematics not for those that are already good. I ignored them and now people are hating me for this club talking about the lack of women and diversity in the club.

I would be 19 around the time I would hopefully start to apply for jobs, but would anyone take me seriously as a 19 year old applying for jr dev jobs? Maybe an internship would be better to get my foot in the door with work experience?

Where can I get good at reading others coding? When I took my HS course I would do okay with writing my assignments but when helping friends it would take me a bit to decipher what they wrote and what it was doing.

ec1iwe,2,2019-12-17,"Moving from Risk Mgmt to Pen Testing, best path?",midnyht,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ec1iwe/moving_from_risk_mgmt_to_pen_testing_best_path/,"Some background about me...

Transitioned to IT from an accounts payable job, I wanted a change of career and job, so I got an internship an a small company. The small company did some IT contracting work, and I started in helpdesk, then promoted to sysadmin/engineering, working with mostly windows, but other linux/unix OS and appliances as needed, LAN switches/routers/FWs, VPNs, etc.  Then transitioned to a VoIP gig that leveraged a lot of my networking experience for things like traffic shaping, QoS, and other unified communications oriented technologies like softphones and call center scripting, But really increased my softskills gained originally in helpdesk, but also working with executives, engaging with new clients, building business relationships and transitioning organizations from POTS or digital PBXs to VoIP. I recently transitioned to a security consulting gig that was basically an advisor role(was advertised as an security engineer), and through a weird turn of events, had me managing a SOC team while working with things such as the RMF/CSF and other related frameworks, while also working on cloud architecture and building transition roadmaps from on-premise to cloud. There has been a lot in a short time, invaluable experience, good money, but I find myself interested in pentesting/security research.  Aforementioned experience has taken place over a 10 year period.

I have been practicing security on and off the “books”, reading actual books for fun, but this has mostly been as a hobby for the past few years. As such, I have been unsure how to break into the pentesting space without a severe paycut. I am supporting more than myself, so there are income levels that are essential to maintain. I have interviewed at several places for SOC analyst jobs to get my feet wet, and while the feedback I received was positive, the pay ceiling was for the roles were pretty low. I feel like it would be a dream job, to understand and subvert the inner-workings of technology, legally breaking in, and all the while, satisfying the semmaritian complex by helping to empower those with lessons on how I did so.

I feel that my experience has been pulling me more into consulting/management, so part of me wonders if I should stick to that trajectory, since that is where the money is, or invest into going back down the technical route, enduring a paycut, and potentially building my skills to be competitive.  I recognize the industry’s attempt to flood the market with cybersecurity professionals to drive wages down, so a part of me wonders how lucrative working in the exciting pentesting/reversing/exploit development space will be in the next few years. Though because of how hard the field is, that is likely going to keep it lucrative.

A tentative game plan is to start with automating a security lab, using it as a portfolio, write ups and blogs on research, and maybe focus my efforts on replicating research, and eventually building a portfolio of bug bounties and CVEs if I get to that level of skill.

THEN/OR 

Look at joining a firm in a junior pentesting role, and growing within that or branching off as an independent researcher.  I feel like joining a firm in junior role will bootstrap my experience faster, but will be financially impactful for a longer term, where as taking the lab/security research/portfolio/write ups and blogs might be safer, but take a longer time.

Thoughts? Best path, alternatives, not enough info? Any feedback would be helpful, thanks!"

ec2j5q,3,2019-12-17,Has anyone repaired a friendship after recovering from depression?,needtorecover2,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ec2j5q/has_anyone_repaired_a_friendship_after_recovering/,"This is my first post and I’m typing it on my phone, so hopefully it’s not confusing! I’ve struggled with PTSD, depression, and anxiety since I was 10ish and am 26 now. In college, I made “friends” and was so happy to finally not be alone. But realized they weren’t true friends, and someone I considered close is now engaged to a man who sexually assaulted me multiple times and is supported by most of my friends.

Since my abuse, I’ve tried to hide feelings. I recently got my Masters in school counseling and had an amazing supervisor (F30) for 2 years. She opened up to me about her struggles, and we began to get close. I began to trust her and opened up. At the beginning, I downplayed it but then began to reveal my actual struggles. She would tell me how I wouldn’t be alone and would always have her. On my last day of internship, she told me that she would rather have me texting her all day than lying in bed and not talking to anyone.

At the beginning, she was reaching out to me to check in. I began to feel supported and actually was able to open up to my therapist about the extent of my trauma because of this support. She even wrote me a note that said to remember that I can always reach out and will always have a caring friend in her. I trusted her and she became like a big sister to me. She was struggling too at this time as her boyfriend of 4 years broke up with her. But she kept talking to me. I began to text her more, typically multiple times a week. She never said anything about it. She began to seem off when school began but said she was busy.

I began to really struggle around September due to my meds. During this time, I texted about suicidal thoughts. The first weekend in October, I reached out about this and asked if she would be willing to call my psychologist to let him know. She did, but then said that it was the limit of what she can do and she couldn’t support me how I need. Then she said she wasn’t leaving me but needed to take time to focus on her, and would reach out when she was ready.

My therapist was advising me on when to reach out and what to say to repair my friendship. I would wait a few weeks before texting about things like rebalancing our friendship. She never replied to any of these. Over Thanksgiving, I messed up and texted quite a bit. That Tuesday I texted that I had a gift for her (I made her a gift of 365 notes for her 30th birthday and she cried telling me no one had done anything like this before so wanted to do that again). Texted on Thanksgiving to wish her a happy Thanksgiving, as my therapist said to do. My next session was that Monday, and my therapist said to share how my suicidal thoughts are gone now that I changed meds. My friend lost a friend to suicide a few years ago and while she reassured me that she was ok talking about it, it may have gotten to be too much. So I reached out sharing that. I also reached out Monday evening saying it’s been 2 months and asking if she could react to a message so I knew she was alive and ok (have anxiety about people dying after losing 3 family members in less than 3 months). She replied and said she had told me she would contact when she was ready to reach out and I have not respected that. She said she wishes me the best but to please not reach out to her again. I panicked and said I wouldn’t and was trying to give her space, and I hoped she would give me a second chance. 2 days later, I texted explaining that I didn’t realize I shouldn’t text at all and wasn’t trying to disrespect her but I understood now. Then realized she blocked me.

I am so panicked. I was trying to repair the friendship but instead ruined it. My therapist said to now work on getting better to help repair the friendship eventually. Has anyone been able to repair a friendship they ruined due to being too clingy or dependent after recovering from depression?"

I'll keep this short and sweet and keep it frank about my failures.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 and graduated in may with just a degree in math. No internships, no certificates , no minor and a bad gpa. Skip the sob story , those are the facts. Recently got a job paying mediocre with a promise of a salary in a couple months plus id be gaining office experience as well as some accounting exp. 

&amp;#x200B;

My POA is to work this spring and enroll in my local CC for a certificate in IT. I already have some of the courses done and I assume theyd be transferable. These classes are much more concrete and give me skills in SQL , programming languages and general data analysis. Im hoping this will look attractive on my resume but also to help get me into grad school.

I spoke with the grad program coordinator from my uni and she said if I aced classes for a year that I should apply for the grad program I want (stats or DA) and she would vouch for me. I guess Id have to see if the classes I do take from CC would be transferable to my uni and ofc Id have to ace them.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess im wondering what you guys think about my POA. Does it seem like a good move? I feel like a BA in Math didnt prepare me with real world skills and while its a great foundation and shows potential , I need to focus in on the career path I want and that means getting more educated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I feel like I got short changed in the job I recently got. I just have low self esteem when it comes to pumping out personalized resumes and cover letters bc all I have to my name is a math degree and no experiences. Should I continue to shoot my shot anyways?

I'm currently on my last two semesters at NIU, with a double major in CS and stats, as well as a minor in mathematics. I finished a software development internship last summer, and this summer I will hopefully be doing a data science internship with the same company. The only issue I have is that my GPA is currently 3.28, and UIC requires a 3.5 for the program I'm interested in. My question is, should I bother applying? Will the system automatically determine that I don't meet the prerequisites?"

My question is, when do employers generally stop looking at internship applications for summer 2020? I want to know how much more time I have to be sending out applications. 

For some context, I am a junior in college majoring in Statistics &amp; Data Science with a minor in Computer Science. I already have an offer for a return internship with the company I interned for this past summer, but i wanted to try and expand my search because my role would be more pure low level CS when I'm more interested in data mining &amp; analysis."

ec4w9u,1,2019-12-17,I'm a full-time developer working at a big financial institution. What is best for me to do in my free time if I want to change jobs eventually?,javardee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ec4w9u/im_a_fulltime_developer_working_at_a_big/,"Hi everyone,

I started working full-time 6 months ago. I love my job so far, has great benefits, pay, and a ton of time working from home. (only have to go in 2 days max during the week)

Most of my work is done in Java. We work with APIs a ton. This is nice because I'm getting so much experience working with Java. I can confidently say that I'm a proficient Java developer.

However, I really love data science. I also want to work for a tech company at some point.

What should I be doing with my free time? Side projects? Studying CTCI? Learning new languages?

I've been trying to learn iOS development, but I really don't have any motivation to learn something that isn't interesting to me, so I feel like my time would be better spent elsewhere besides learning new languages just for the hell of it.

As of now I only have 2 side projects, one being data science (made me fall in love with the topic) and the other being an Android app. I also had an internship at the same place I'm working now.

Recently I've been tweaking the hell out of my resume, but that's about it.

Thanks!"

I’m transferring to college where I PLANNED to double major Information Systems and Computer Science. But after looking at the debt with that(or just going 4 years in general for a CSE) compared to the little to no debt(after co op jobs) I’d have graduated with only a IS major, suddenly just finishing out the 2 years with an IS major looks better. I’ve been told that CSE is the better degree. I’m also interested in it, but the concept of what Information Systems is actually took me by surprise and that caught my eye as well. I was also told that and Information Systems degree will land me a job and having a decent paying job that I like with no debt seems attractive. With CSE or a double major it seems I would make more starting out, but then I’d have a load of debt to worry about even after intern pay. I was also told after I have a job with anything IT related long enough the degree ultimately becomes irrelevant to employers because I have enough experience and SOME tech degree doesn’t matter what it is. So my question is, knowing that I will enjoy either career because overall administration is interesting to me, should I take the IS route instead or is CS such a bigger degree that I should still take the 4 years and more debt for it?

Thanks for the help guys! Needing people who’ve been around this longer than I have lol."
ec5oq3,15,2019-12-17,Anyone else a long-term temp out there?,unhappypatient,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ec5oq3/anyone_else_a_longterm_temp_out_there/,"On 12/31 my contract is up on the 3rd or 4th longtime job - not including the many small, humiliating 2 weekers, long enough to get a taste of wonderful (at least on the outside) offices and their perks, while making minimum wage. 

I have been here 8 months and watched my boss hire employee after employee; when I asked if he would convert me, he said he wouldn't even consider it till January of this year. That's how low value I am. 

I am in my early 30s. This year another birthday passed and all I could think is - the women I went to school with are settled in long term careers, probably making mid to high 5 figures, and have never been without health insurance. Including girlfriends who temped in my city - in 2012. 

I know my flaws. I come at 10, 10:15, and stay till 6:15-6:30. It's tolerated. No matter how early I wake up - the sick thing is I'm so fucking tired and out of it I just...go slower (and then spend the rest of the morning on bathroom trips once the coffee starts passing through, thanks to IBS. I'm an adult paranoid about being trapped on a subway and pissing myself or worse).  It takes longer just for the glow of the computer while I check weather or email for my eyes to unblur. 

It's ruined my life. I know how fucking weak and stupid I sound. I think so too. My life now revolves around taking a shit and covering my acne in time to come at 10.


That's enough to have rendered me unemployable.

I'm not very attractive; I am a nervous smiler; but unlike the other offices I was in, where the contempt from upper management was open, this one seems to like me enough and more, I have grown attached to my coworkers.

They all know I am a temp (except one or two, I think). It's fucking humiliating. I never told them I still was. That's enough, when these people are in their early 20s, were hired out of college - as one should be, as I never was, losing 10 years to horrible menial jobs, ""self employment"", and grad school in childhood ed (so much unpaid work!) - making 80k a year, at least, if not more. I have no idea how anyone in America becomes employed unless they know a family member or friend, if they don't intern - and internships are even harder to get now than entry level jobs, because they *are* the new entry level job. 


Even when my (young) direct supervisors were happy with my work and knew I worked hard, the actual directors pass me over. If they hire someone, they hire the fresh college grad with less experience who doesn't ask for work more than me, isn't as careful or thorough. But nobody cares if you're a temp - nobody sees. And if you don't get facetime with the upper manager who will ultimately decide if you can be hired (try doing that, as a menial worker) - that's it. 

In the 10 years since I have graduated from college, I'll admit it - I never learned a skill that is valuable enough to make me permanent. I have no master's. I was never trained one, and never got to practice one in a meaningful way, under circumstances where I could see it applied, make mistakes, and learn to solve problems in something ""useful"". 

When I interview for permanent jobs, because my entire resume is  temp work...I wish I could describe the disgust, the absolute confusion, followed by phony smiles of repulsion I receive - from companies that hire temps in droves themselves. Often temps like me, actually. From companies that know they don't want to hire me but an HR person has to seem like they're looking for candidates, who call me in, humiliate me, and then dress me down even when I have the actual experience they're looking for, have used the software, served the function - making minimum wage and being spat in the face every day by the miserable recruiter making a pretty penny off of me. Ironic how many liberal arts majors and fresh-from-college grads are recruiters now. (Or not.) It's the solution out of poverty for the sociology major and English major who has no place else to go - they luck into what is effectively a sales job, and human bodies of desperate, hopeless, discardable people are the product. 

I worked for a year as an intern with no pay part time, just to get office experience; and this is now my third year as a temp. It's felt like 10, psychologically and physically. It might as well be - I know I'm ugly and older and people can tell I'm not fresh from college. 

I never interned, too stupid, too ill, and too poorly performing a student; I took classes in summer and barely stayed afloat during the year. I graduated with a 3.0 and didn't kill myself. Those are the two accomplishments I have to show for my entire worthless existence. *I have never, ever stopped paying for it*, and the mistake only grows costlier with time. I am so far past the deadline where my college degree is fucking useless. 

In 2019, the horrible offices that offered my friends 12/hour in 2012 now offer people like me...14/hour. 15/hour. No benefits. Contracts lasting...three days, two weeks, a month, six months with no hope of conversion. That's when things work out and there's no abuse (I shared a project with one coworker, got blamed for her mistakes, and was fired when she was, despite demonstrating I understood how to use our ERP software). 

Nobody sees me. I watch the electoral debates, I bookmark links on the social divide, on the public option, on millennial downward economic mobility....and the truth is, nobody gives two fucks about the long term unemployed/underemployed. Nobody in the political landscape. I have negative power. Weak and worthless, I cannot even say I am voiceless - the great terrors of my existence and rootlessness in the 21st century as someone who graduated in the recession and never got their professional footing, now viewed as something truly disgusting and useless by hiring companies, broke, terrified, too weak a student, and most importantly, ground to dust mentally and physically during the months I am lucky enough to be employed, unable to retain even brief articles I read...they're don't register as social problems to anyone! 

The fact so many companies have figured out how to completely eliminate whole departments by hiring temps instead, the human link between ""valued"" employees and machine - it doesn't matter! It's PROGRESS. 

When you are a long term temp or an older long-term unemployed (and thus unemployable - human garbage to employers), especially of the ""unskilled"" or lower skilled kind - nobody sees you. Nobody gives a fuck about you. You're bad; you're garbage; if you weren't, you wouldn't be a temp. I think that every day, day after day, and as we draw to the end of the year, the terror and shame holds my heart in a fist and clenches. 

Day after day, even when times are fat, I think of the companies (including the one before this - once again, an ERP software/data management project) where I was fired and 20-somethings fresh out of college were made an offer in six months. My direct manager, who was happy with my work, left the company the week before the contract ended. My direct manager/supervisor, the closest I had to a mentor here, did too. I still have his contact information but...that was my advocate. He requested someone to do the job I am now - basically assist the senior team - and now, I am alone. 

It isn't just the untold and horrible humiliations of chatting up employees (as they are - I'm not!) and befriending them, trying not to think of their six figure salaries and the careers *they've had*, what they know, how they have been mentored, and what they had the power to do - I have to smile and be nice to upper managers who have the utmost contempt for me, go to industry events that have no effect on me...


I drown in a sea of bad faith, fear, and contempt. I have swallowed it and internalized it. How can you not hate people who are employing you under conditions that prove unions are dead, that exist with the understanding you don't deserve the most basic dignities of labor? I smile; I make small talk; but when I am alone...it astounds me. 

All I have to show for my life is a college degree. My great dream was to work for public advocacy - now my dream is a permanent office job with a path and health insurance. Not even that is in the future - I am the sole person responsible for Salesforce in my office. There are no mentors and no teammates to guide me. My function is an afterthought.

 I live in awe of people who had ""stupid"" majors in college and now work for Fortune 500 companies or - more amazingly - got hired in the field of their choice. Creative fields; advocacy. Who are talented and competent. 

I think on some level I never pictured that for myself - I liked studying the work, the successes and accomplishment and writing, of others who were. I wish I could describe how that feels, too.

I have no identity or life apart from being physically ground to dust by work and commuting and all things related to work, really - shopping for work clothes and dress shoes and things that will make me less disgusting-looking to the men in my office; going to my doctor for adult acne for the same (I have not seen a psychiatrist for drugs in a year, because I am on an add-on and have no mental health coverage). It's so silly pursuing healthcare when you think about suicide 24/7 but hey, I have to be employed until I'm actually ready to kill myself right?

If you are a temp you can work 40-60 hours a week and be homeless/starve to death; meanwhile the recruiter who swoops into a company and makes sure nobody but a temp will fill a slot for a job makes a pretty penny off of you, fucking you out of your real salary and the cost of benefits an employee would be provided. 

Every day I think to myself, I generate no revenue, I have no use - to anybody. For you see, as a temp, I've never been important enough to trained to be important enough. I'm so old I wonder if even having another degree will help with that. When I walk through my city and imagine startups and glamorous media companies and prestigious massive multinational investment management/PE firms...I am...filth. 

There is the employed world - the chosen - and then there are people like me, whom ""job creators"" see as actual sentient garbage they deeply resent, temporary pieces of furniture they resent renting at all. 

When I was 19, I seriously thought of hanging myself because I couldn't picture getting through a workday, I was so unhappy and so ill.

Now at 30, smiling into the faces of hiring managers who's withered smiles meet my own with barely-concealed disgust and indifference, I think to myself - in my failures, my weakness, my stupidity, my worthlessness (if only to them - but what's the difference, when these are the people that have power over my entire existence?) - reality has exceeded my worst nightmares. 

And the years pass, and I hope to be hired, or I update my resume fruitlessly, and I take ""x"" pathetic continuing ed course and ask on message boards if this Coursera cert or Udemy cert will make me useful at last (fuck me for being so stupid - ""learn to code"", the voice of God exhorts - and if you're too dumb to teach yourself to code and create a portfolio that will magically let you compete with CS majors,  that's you're fault, moron) knowing as soon as I explain the work was temp, interviewers for jobs - *including temp jobs* - will mentally put my resume in the garbage. 

Nobody sees me. Nobody gives a fuck. I am so ashamed and I carry it with me to every office and among what acquaintances I have left from school - I can't believe I ever shared a plane with these women. If you are unemployed, underemployed or a temp - you learn not to talk about it. Or I don't, because what I'm narrating is a story of how I'm abject human waste, to friends who are lawyers, managers, social workers, and having been settled in their careers for at least five years.

 And if you're out of college for a certain age or can't afford to go and have no valued experience or path to employment -nobody gives a fuck about you, either.


Obama made a great speech about labor, urging Congress to pass it - one of the things he said is, you are not alone. I think of it often, because it was such powerful, emotional delivery, and lie under a beautifully articulated aspiration was so fucking offensive. 

...But you are. In capitalism, you are. Of course you are. In America, people can pay $100,000 in college loans and die owing that amount or more, for jobs that pay $40k, 90% of which will go towards rent, where - as the price of living in the city where your job *is* - you probably live on a fucking futon in a family apt. you split with 5 people. 

 In the sharing economy, in the age of the ""lean office"", where ""trimming the fat"" means enabling the explosion of horrible staffing agencies that exist to get rich off of hopeless pieces of shit like me, pocketing my wages, my benefits, while I'm expected to have a certain software experience, be an expert on sales forecasting reporting (despite never, ever been shown anything but the work to do my own projects - low value, menial - trained shittily instead of being trained to be kept or to acquire transferable skills), and have a college degree to make 15/hour with no health insurance and no retirement benefits - you, temp/contractor - you're alone. Nobody in elected office thinks any of this is a problem at all. You're trash. 

They'll cry and plead and fight one another to suckle Jeff Bezos' cock with tax breaks so he can set gentrification of whatever city he sets up shop into overdrive (and hire temps!) instead. 

Sorry this is a book. I hate myself because these people make me hate myself, and because if I were stronger, less worthless, less stupid, and less **fucking weak** - I would have enrolled in graduate school in the hopes of redeeming the years I blew as an undergrad. Tried to intern, tried to finally gain the degree to be deemed ""useful"". 

Whatever humanity I have to myself simply doesn't matter. I have no life or personality. I have nothing - no close or real relationships. My health is garbage. I have no real interests. I have no valued skills, no talents. This, dicking around on reddit and really just *recovering from work* with passive forms of entertainment - this is what I have.

If you look at a screen all day, trying reading a book for pleasure and still having the energy to clean (and you will, esp. if you live with other shitty people), cook, maintain hygiene, and run adult errands. By 8 the migraine I've held at bay with caffeine sets in and I can't look at text anymore. 

Working cripples you. If you are a low stamina, low energy person - even grinding your ass in a chair all day does you harm. I can't imagine one of those horrible jobs where you're on your feet more than 2 hours...for minimum wage. 

I have no dignity, and no self-respect. Nothing matters when the powers that be tell you year after year and day after day that you are a worthless piece of waste, detritus, flotsam of jetsam, to people that will pay you pennies for your labor, poison your health, waste your time - and then cut you loose. When the same companies sneer at you like you've handed them a wad of feces, when you interview for jobs (if you get that far - CHRIST, the humiliation). 

So much of my free time and mental energy is occupied in the torturous unknowing - will I lose my health insurance this year? Can I afford to cover myself? What will happen to me, since I have no employee benefits and company after company has decided to use my labor and gives TWO FUCKS that I have health insurance or will be told to take a walk and get fucked after they milk me dry for six months? 

Those of you who have English or anthro or history and are even steadily employed as admin in something like a finance office or different from your background - you have no idea how lucky you are. No idea."

While I am passionate about computer science, I question whether I can develop a strong understanding of these technologies if I am only learning them on my own by reading and watching tutorials on the web.

It looks like they’re constantly stressed about projects and never get a chance to destress because they’re on the hook for something. My old manager was awesome and really gave our team a great environment, so I figured he enjoyed the job because he was great at it, but even he mentioned how management stripped him of his passion for CS. He mentioned it’s constant meetings and politics that take you away from the actual problem solving. He mentioned all this while we were having a drink after work.



This worries me because I assumed i’d have to aim for a management position eventually, if I didn’t want to get stagnant in my career. I also figured a management position could be rewarding and result in a net happiness due to feeling needed\important.

The internship's going well and I'm enjoying working in my field. I'm glad to finally have the chance to put my associates and other certifications to use while I work on my bachelors.

Right before Thanksgiving, another IT company in the area messaged me on Indeed asking for a copy of my resume after they had seen I had several CompTIA certifications and relevant experience. After sending the company my resume, they wanted to schedule a phone interview.

Last week I had an in-person interview with the company. I thought I had bombed the interview, but apparently I didn't because they sent me an offer letter literally today. I went in to sign the offer letter and paperwork shortly after. My (tentative) start date is January 2nd.

How do I approach quitting the internship? Taking this new job is a no-brainer since it pays significantly more than any other employment I've ever had. I just have no idea on how to (tactfully) handle this situation."

Hi Everyone,

I'm looking for some advice from people who have come before me and may have been in the same boat when they were my age.

I'm recently turned 23 and in my 2nd year of uni studying a Bachelor of Commerce Majoring in Finance at Macquarie, aiming to graduate 2021. Recently I have thought of doing a double degree and incorporating a Bachelor of Information Technology into my study plan as I've always been really interested in computing. I only have a WAM of around 59 and based on what I have been reading it seems like that will be a struggle to get into any grad roles.

I am currently in a B2B sales role which I'm going on 1.5 years now but honestly, I hate it and I've lost all drive for my job so I would like to change but I don't know what I should try and change into or how to make the change. Is it possible to get into a role within a financial institution or some kind of IT role while I'm still at uni or do I just tough it out and try my hand at summer internships and give grad roles a crack towards the end of my degree/s?

Thank you for your time."

eca8bp,24,2019-12-18,TIFU by telling the head of my course that I (F) was uncomfortable spending my last class with the intern (late 30’s M) due to inappropriate comments and behaviour,geezeraa,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/eca8bp/tifu_by_telling_the_head_of_my_course_that_i_f/,"I am a final year college student and one of my 2 majors (double major) is a very small course where I receive 1-2-1 tuition. This fall semester my classes were taught by an intern, 3 hours a week just me and him in a small office. As this semester is now almost over, he is leaving and this will no longer be an issue beyond today in my eyes. I had other issues with the course this semester which is the reason that I didn’t report this behaviour, as I was lucky to have any of my issues resolved and didn’t want to distract from vital academic changes that were essential to my studies with this type of complaint. 

So from the start of the semester I felt uncomfortable in these classes, from comments such as “you and X (M) student have such a strong sexual connection”, to “ah you’re seeing your boyfriend this weekend? you’ll be much happier on Monday then, less sexual frustration”, to sitting close to me invading my personal space. The issue is that while these comments are obviously inappropriate and made me feel uncomfortable, they aren’t as extreme as harassment and I made the decision myself to not raise it so as to not distract from my studies as I graduate in the coming summer.

On Monday this week I felt that the comment he made and the repeated invasion of my personal space was too much and crossed my personal line of how much I was willing to tolerate and I sent an email on Tuesday saying that I was disappointed that I needed to send the email but that due to inappropriate comments, some of which sexual, and invasions of my personal space made me feel uncomfortable I would not be coming to the final class. I did consider just saying I was ill but I am also aware of how that would have looked and due to the very small size of my course things like that can damage your reputation. When I say invading my personal space, I mean sitting very close to me side by side so our legs are touching and being so close that natural arm movements mean occasional touching simply from being too close. I was getting really frustrated at this invasion, as I have tolerated so much of it this semester and it felt like as it was the penultimate class he was pushing boundaries. He then asked why I was in such a mood today? “Are you on your period or just having a bad day?” I walked out 10 minutes before the end of the class, which I have never done before.

So I sent the email, admittedly not expecting a huge response. I was very concerned about it backfiring on me, which I feel it is now likely to but not in the way I predicted. The head of my course (who I had emailed) asked to meet in person today. She asked me to go through in detail everything that had ever happened as she wrote down everything word for word. I was quite taken aback, as he is leaving this week I don’t want to file a report, I simply didn’t want to put myself back in the uncomfortable situation. She was asking me to define what I meant by him invading my personal space, asking if that meant he touched me. I explained, as above, that it meant sitting close enough that natural movements will involve brushing for example my arm with his as he types on his laptop. She responded, “so he touched you, so he was groping you”. I could see her writing this down and I said that there is a big difference between invading personal space and groping, which in my eyes is more an intentional grab rather than uncomfortably close. She said that I am making a very strong serious allegation here and that I need to be very careful what I am accusing him of as she is taking this very seriously. Now, I am grateful that she is taking it so seriously, however I feel that surely I should have a say as to what extent this all gets blown up. I am content with the fact that he now is leaving for Christmas and I will not be in that same scenario. She explained that she has to take this to the top as if I turn around in a months time and accuse her of not doing anything then her job is on the line. Again, I understand this completely, but I don’t understand why I can’t send an email saying that I do not want to report this or take action so that it is in my writing and no future issues can arise. She continued that as he works in a school the type of allegations I am making are very serious and she has a duty of care to inform his school which would likely lead to legal proceedings in another country. She also asked if we were looking at the same screen/paper, as if so it is totally justified to be sitting so close. I said partly yes and partly no, but even when we were I didn’t feel that it was necessary to be so close and that I have never been in that situation in any of my other 1-2-1 classes. At this point it felt that I wasn’t being believed as I don’t want to pursue it, I don’t even really want it raised to the dean as I don’t want my name to be associated with something like this. It felt to me that as she kept raising everything I was accusing him and in turn the department of, I was already being judged and boxed off as “that girl who makes accusations”, especially the part when she said she feels I will accuse her in a months time of not doing anything. 

I felt upset leaving the conversation, having had to talk her down from physical sexual harassment and groping to inappropriate and uncomfortable. She said she will talk to him and she is interested to hear his version of events, and then she will be raising it first to the dean and then pursuing every avenue. I am grateful that she is taking it so seriously, but I can’t help but feel that she was blowing it out of proportion leaving me looking uncredible. I definitely felt that she didn’t understand me and definitely didn’t understand my opinions on it. So TIFU, I feel that my reputation is shattered and I should have just kept quiet an extra week to avoid all of this unnecessary drama.

TL;DR I told the head of my course I didn’t feel comfortable spending my last class with the intern due to his inappropriate comments and feeling uncomfortable with his repeated invasion of my personal space. She wants to report it within the university and the school he will be returning to next semester, with potential legal action, but I just want to drop it - I only raised it to explain my absence. Now I feel that I am not believed and will have this against my name."

I'm a first-year CS student at a UC and I have a hefty amount of expertise with coding. However, I'm technically an international student since I was born in India and have Indian parents. I'm on an H4, which means I lack an EAD(employment authorization document). This presents a huge problem for me because internships are so key to getting ahead in any field that lacking an internship is risky. Does this mean I'm screwed? Is there no way for me to get an internship? The way I currently see it, my only option is to go the unpaid route, and I think that's comparable to not having an internship."

If you were in my situation, would you delay a graduation for 1 year to do an internship in your home country? 

Or would you just try to get a full-time job or an internship after graduation?

ecaz6n,1,2019-12-18,Hiked to the top of a mountain and jumped off,bababeast99,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ecaz6n/hiked_to_the_top_of_a_mountain_and_jumped_off/,"Just a few months ago, I used to feel like the happiest man alive. As a rising junior in college, I was able to secure an amazing, well-paying internship surrounded by people who inspired me. Every other day before my commute, I shit you not - woke up at 4:45 am and hustled my ass off at the gym, and worked all day after. My parents were so proud of the man I was maturing to be. I was also able to pursue my singing passion on the weekends, and it seemed like my life was set and I was living a dream. 

All throughout my life, I was seen as an unintelligent, lazy piece of shit who got straight Cs and Ds. Growing in a super competitive environment, everyone would say “yooo I’m applying to this ivy school...that ivy school...hey did you hear so-and-so got into this school?” and all this time I was thinking, “damn...and there’s me who’s considering community college because I can’t get into any schools.” My confidence suffered, literally had no self-esteem, and I started cutting people out of my life because I didn’t want to deal with this pressure anymore. No matter how hard I tried to stay organized, everything ended up becoming a disaster. I was diagnosed with ADHD in high school, but medication really suppressed my appetite and fucked with me so I stopped taking it.

Fast forward couple of years, ended up going to a decent state school because of my high SAT score, and I fucking KILLED it there in the beginning! Became the lead face a popular singing group on campus, joined a frat, worked hard, partied hard! Even though there were many ups and downs, at the end of the year I was the guy that everyone wanted to be. It’s a whole different feeling when your perspective changes from “How can I do this to benefit myself?” vs “How can I continue thriving to the point where I’m inspiring other people to be just as amazing as I am?”

Fuck those people who doubted me, last summer like I mentioned earlier, I reached the peak of my personal success. I beat out some of those same snobs who made fun of my insecurities and my lack of success in school. I even began reading books on personal development and changed the entire narrative that I created in my head. It felt like FINALLY - I got to the point where I told myself I am unstoppable and nothing can ever break me down again.

Now, I feel miserable. I’m writing this post at 4:50 am because I am absolutely helpless. 

I’m an all-in or nothing kinda guy, so over the past semester, I quit my singing group because I felt like it distracted from my own personal ventures in music. Those guys were my closest friends and I had some of the greatest memories with them, but our goals didn’t align and I wanted to pursue different genres. Slowly, one by one things started to slip. I stopped hanging with my old gang of friends because I had to live somewhere else this year. Because I’m making beats/singing in my room all day, I am barely a part of my fraternity anymore. I am so invested with music that I sit in my room for hours on end without eating or drinking water. It’s like this hyper-focus that we tend to get when we love something, somehow we just tune everything out. Then, my roommate went through some personal issues so it was literally just me alone in my room, laser focused without getting up till I was as close to perfection as I could. I became better at my craft every single day, but the more invested I was, the more everything around me started collapsing. I started isolating myself, and then suddenly I began realizing... hold up... I’m in the same exact place where I was in high school. No friends, shit grades, but now this time I’m away from my parents and I’m an adult now.

As I write this, I have final exams coming up, which I am not prepared for at all. Will probably average a 2.3 gpa this semester. I eat pizza and fast food most of the time (using all the money I made over the summer) and the gym is basically non-existent. I go days on end without showering. A lot of people remember me from last year as that popular kid who threw insane parties last year, but now I’m socially irrelevant - fuck that, I barely have  friends that I can reach out to. It’s like this chase for perfection and hyper-focus in one area completely ruined the balance of everything. Again it all boils down to organization and time management, neither of which I have. I don’t have any internship lined up and who the hell is going to want to hire me after this semester. It’s gotten to the point where I just want to drop out and make music forever because nothing else satisfies me. I feel like I’ve lost it all... I hiked to the top of a mountain full of pain and struggle all to come crumbling down, and now I find myself in a situation that’s even worse than before.

Is it the way we are wired? Why is it so hard to be fucking consistent with anything? Boutta fail everything this week and spend winter break questioning my life. Maybe this is just a phase and I’ll get over it. Maybe I should stop typing and actually study for my fucking exams...idk man I’m one confused son of a bitch 🤦‍♂️"
eccnia,2,2019-12-18,"I've tried everything and I never thought I'd be the guy who wanted to die/ commit suicide... im 22 and I could use some advice on how to live so I dont have to die. (PLEASE READ MY STORY, it will make more sense)",deathbyalotofpain,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eccnia/ive_tried_everything_and_i_never_thought_id_be/,"I need SERIOUS advice on what to do with my life! I’m too stressed to think clearly… Basically I have depression and anxiety, along with a few chronic health issues which I’ve had for maybe 10 years and im only 22. If you saw me in the streets you wouldn’t be able to tell, since it hasn’t physically crippled me, but the weight of it all has taken my will to live and crippled my mind.

I got diagnosed with depression/anxiety almost 8 months ago and used meds for 6 months and felt like they did nothing for me, so I came off them. I’ve been depressed along time time ( 10 years), but finally sought help since I had a full blown incident that made those around me basically require me to get treatment. (work incident) Regardless coming off was not without side effects despite me tapering off them as you’re supposed to. I feel hopeless. The one thing that was supposed to work didn’t and now im back to where I started with very little will to live. I workout daily, in fact it is my unhealthy obsession. Its the only thing I sort of enjoy doing, but I dont enjoy it anymore. I feel disgusted when I see how big I’ve gotten. I feel disgusted by the vanity of it all and how people stare at me in the gym. and yet I am simultaneously not big enough or lean enough.

Regardless, my relationship with my conservative family is shit. They are part of the reason I moved away from the town they live in and rarely visit during college break, but as you can imagine living alone with this shit isn’t easy, especially when money is tight so I end up thinking I should come visit only to regret my decision within hours of arriving. Ive lived with 5-6 different roommates in the last 4-5 years in my college city and they’ve all been a nightmare. Some smoke inside when asked not to ( i have lung issues), others threaten to kill me if I bring people over, and others are simply just obnoxious and disrespectful of the fact that I have special needs for a quiet and clean environment. Add in that its a high COL city and you see how I feel utterly fucked. 

Generally at this point people would think im the issue but I assure you I am not. I am so jealous of my “friends” who come from loving stable families and dont have to worry about anything. I dont even have real friends since I cant focus on anyone elses issues for longer than 5 minutes to really be a good friend. I try so hard to win their favour though. Yet I feel constantly taken advantage of. And all those people I thought were my friends vanish when I need their help. I cant really expect their help can i? IDK what to do.

Thankfully im in my last semester of college now after wanting to kill myself everyday for the last 5 years and barely scraping by in my classes. I tried to get a good degree and even got an internship in my field but I found it all too much to handle. I dont know if it was due to my personal life or the work itself but i was not in a good place and it became quickly evident to my co-workers. 

So to end this rant, I cant afford my current college city because its high COL yet I need my own space for health wellbeing, I dont have a job lined up for grad, and even if i did im not sure I can handle 9-5 with my mental state, and I dont have any support systems since I have no real close friends or significant others, and my family are conservative religious kooks and my siblings are basically entitled assholes, so i cant move back home without wanting to kill myself just as much when they drag me to prayers and yell at me and dont give me any privacy. Doors have no locks i this house by design. Theres a lot more I could get into but my family life i not good.

HOW DO I BECOME NORMAL AND HAPPY SO I DONT HAVE TO KILL MYSELF?! PLEASE ADVISE ME. IM GROWING INCREASINGLY CLOSE. also therapy is so fuckign expensive which i cant afford right now either...

tldr; chronically ill and clinically depressed/anxious college student cant move back home, and cant stay in current city, and has no support system anywhere. How do I unfuck myself and get on my feet and get happy? (depression meds didn’t work but gave me side effects I still have along with my chronic conditions which dont have any cure). I was also severely bullied growing up and abused physically and emotionally all my life."

I'm an intern for a state ISO. Our datacenter has a badge access system which logs the time of day, the person, which BDO they come from, which terminal they use etc.

These are all outputted into an excel file which I receive partway through the month and have to go through the list confirming each person is supposed to have access to the datacenter via a masterlist of personnel. I can't modify the output of the badge access logs from the source because they're issued by our on-site security contractor. 

This quickly got boring as fuck to do, and took forever, so I thought it would be a good project to write a Python script and automate some of the tedious process. 

Here's my current script - [https://pastebin.com/JvAEAbmR](https://pastebin.com/JvAEAbmR) 

Basically, I haven't really been able to automate anything, just make it way easier to go through the data. What I ideally want is to automatically compare someone's name with the masterlist of personnel and output a ""Yes"" or ""No"" if they're allowed to be in the datacenter. 

So is there a better way to do this? What is your experience with this?

I am in need of advice. So I am a senior studying electrical engineering. I was expected to graduate in December of 2020 only due to one extra course that was only available in the Fall semester (so I was planning to take only one class that fall semester). I talked with my program director and he allowed me to make a substitution for the class so I can graduate on time. I already accepted a internship at a company in a ideal location, my only issue is that it will be just that - a internship and I will be getting paid internship pay ($20 a hour/ Chicago area) when I could be working a full time job and making full time pay.

&amp;#x200B;

So what should I do? I already informed the company of my new graduation date, and they said it was fine- it would not affect my internship. So should I still go through with the internship? Or should I look for a full time job? Is it okay to ask the company if they will be looking to hire me full-time if everything goes well with the internship? 

I just don't want to waste months working at a place if they are not going to be looking to hire me full- time.

At my current level, I'm not sure if this will be taught and I'm almost certain that I won't be able to land an internship until I'm one year away from graduating (I got two more years left once I transfer), but I would like to be prepared.

Do people usually not apply for internships this early? What can I do right now to tackle these unknown challenges and learn more about them? How can I be a good candidate for internship?

Currently, I am learning python from Udemy, and plan on learning iOS swift on there as well.

Resources will be much appreciated!"

My primary goal from a summer internship this year is to learn as much as I can, both hard and soft skills as well as industry knowledge in the tech field. New connections is always a plus, but it's a close second to the above. Pay isn't really much of a priority, but money's nice of course.

I'm aware that the position might not be ideal, for example, it might not provide me with the industry knowledge that I'm looking for. However, I'm not sure what my chances are like for landing another offer for summer 2020. I would like to apply to a few start-ups maybe, but I'm not sure how likely I am to get an offer in the given time frame, and I was hoping the good people of Reddit might answer this concern as well.

Thanks in advance."

This is in Ohio.

I am interning this month and next for college at a computer software company. 

I learned all the ropes and was assigned a project to work on that was overseen by a few senior developers in the company. I would submit the project to the senior devs and they would give me feedback on what was going right and what was going wrong.

Finally when the senior developers were pleased with the project, I was sent to give a presentation to one of the companies small clients.

My boss a guy with 15+ years here came with me to answer some of the business questions that might arise.

I finished the presentation and the clients seemed happy with the project. All of a sudden my boss got up and apologized to the clients. He then said that ""this intern (me) shouldn't have been hired and in fact will no longer be working for us after today. I (my boss) am so sorry to waste your time."" 

This crushed me. The clients went out of the room to talk and I ended up taking one of the side doors and went to my car as I was physically shaking and had to take a good 30 minutes to compose myself.

When I come back inside my boss looks at me and scoffs at me before returning to his office. I found out from one of the senior devs who ended up talking to the clients that they were in fact pleased with the work and effort I put in to it and were unsure of what my boss meant about firing me.

Do I have a case to file an HR complaint against my boss? 

Can he fire me out of the blue with no other issues even though the internship has a contract through the school that provide very clear means for terminating an internship (of which I have broken none)?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: Follow up Question:

If I am indeed fired (by my boss) do I have any recourse legally or through HR? I need an internship as a requirement to get my degree and I would have to push all my classes back at least a semester if I am not able to continue this internship.

Edit 2: I was able to contact my University and they told me to go into my work which I did. My boss ""apologized"" half heartedly and said that I still had my internship. I ended up speaking to the university again after work and they said that they are very sorry about the incident and that they had another internship available if I wanted it. I took it and said my goodbyes to the couple friends I made and will be starting my new internship on Monday."
eckkpl,4,2019-12-18,Atlassian Intern Update,liesfromDAtablecloth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eckkpl/atlassian_intern_update/,"Hello,

I wasn't sure if Atlassian has a certain schedule of when intern applicants usually hear back about their status, or if anyone has already heard back this fall.

In short, I was invited to do a HackerRank challenge, and completed it in September, and have not heard back. I followed up a month later after not hearing back, as well as 3-4 weeks ago, and both times I was told that they were really busy with applicants. My recruiter said she works in a office half way across the globe from the office I applied to, so I imagine it is challenging for her to follow-up with an office she possibly has never contacted. 

Considering this is after a HackerRank, is it safe to say I probably did not make it to the first round of phone interviews by now? There's very few places I would rather work than Atlassian, and was curious if anyone had any advice. Thank you in advance for any insight you may have for someone who is in the process of trying to land an internship this summer."
eckq3p,8,2019-12-18,MIT ($) vs Tepper ($$) vs Foster ($$$),Adorable-Eye,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/eckq3p/mit_vs_tepper_vs_foster/,"Barely two hours since I got the call from MIT and I’m already freaking out.....

Background:
I’m an east coaster in tech looking to (eventually) move back to the west coast and likely stay in tech. I’m from Seattle originally, and could see myself there long-term, but don’t quite feel ready to commit to that yet. And my partner has a job where they could easily transfer to Seattle, but would probably need to change jobs to go anywhere else.
 I’m fortunate to make enough money that an MBA represents a fairly small salary increase for me - I’m mostly interested in going to school because I got a STEM degree undergrad and feel like I lack a lot of business knowledge. Also there’s a part of me that feels pretty ambivalent about working in tech - I love the job but generally hate the environment. Part of me is hoping that I’ll discover some other field while in school that helps me live a life a little more aligned with my values.

Given that, here are my current options:
* MIT - $25k scholarship, only for the first year as far as I can tell. 
* Tepper - $40k Forte fellowship for two years (so $80k total). 
* Foster - $30k Forte scholarship for two years ($60k total), and they offered in-state tuition, which means I would pay just over $5k per year + living expenses.

I’m absolutely torn - on the one hand Foster is clearly the practical choice here, but I don’t love it. The curriculum doesn’t excite me the way MIT and Tepper’s do, and I’m also concerned about the community - with a tiny class size, I just don’t think there will be the resources, opportunities, and network that I want to get out of my MBA, both professionally and socially. I’m also concerned that Foster mostly has a regional reputation, and if I ever wanted to move outside of Seattle I wouldn’t have the network or reputation. On the other hand, I went to an elite school for undergrad, so I kind of have that to fall back on. 

MIT is everything I could ask for - but I just can’t see myself going in to six figure debt and feeling good about it, especially when I have a debt free option (I’ve saved a good amount for school so could cover rent and food for two years between that and internship $$). But it’s MIT - how can I turn that down?

Then there’s Tepper - I love their curriculum, but I cant seem to get excited about the prospect of moving to Pittsburgh. 

So how do you all think about this? How do I weigh the experiences and network of MIT against all of the practical reasons why Foster makes sense? And how do I weigh the freedom of graduating with maximal postgrad options thanks to the MIT brand vs the freedom of graduating with zero debt? And how should I think about Tepper?

Any and all advice appreciated."
ecl3ow,4,2019-12-18,Need some advice...,glorifiedfrett,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/ecl3ow/need_some_advice/,"Hi everyone I am looking for some life advice for the current situation I am in. All feedback is welcome!

I am a 22/M who graduated college this past May with a Business Degree. Shortly after graduating I took a job offer from one of my family members across the country. Fortunately my college girlfriend of a year who graduated the same semester as me lived only a few hours away from my new job. Everything seemed to be working out perfectly and I was happy that my girlfriend and I would be able to stay together after graduating.

From this point on this is where things start to go downhill. I didn't realize that this job I took required more hours than a standard 40 hour a week job. It was normal to have a 60-70/ week with 1 day off. Like I mentioned my girlfriend lived a few hours away and we were planning on spending our weekends together. Since my only day off was Sunday every time I drove out to visit her it felt like an extremely short and rushed trip. I was doing what I had to do to make it work, but she started to become frustrated with the situation we were in. I understood her frustration because the situation really did suck and there was no end in sight. We did this for a few months and ended up having a really sad breakup (she broke up with me). We both wanted to be with each other, but the long distance was killing us and there was no end in sight.

At this point I really started to hate the situation I was in. I was in a random state with no friends working 60-70 hours a week for a company I hated while suffering from a breakup. I worked for another month after the breakup before throwing in the towel and realizing I needed to go back to my home state.

I return to my home state eager to start fresh and get a new job working for a company I actually like. I was also excited to be back with my friends and family after going through this really hard breakup. Unfortunately for me all my friends were busy with there new careers and they put me on the back burner. These were guys that I have been friends with for years and who I have always been there for after tragic life events. It really bothered me that after going through this bad breakup and job experience none of them even cared that I was home or reached out to see how I was doing. I also didn't realize how much I would hate living in my parents house again. My parents are great people, but they have a certain way of doing things and after living on my own in college for 4 years I developed my own independence. Despite having so much change in my life I knew that I needed to find a job to keep my mind occupied. I was pretty confident I would find employment shortly after returning home. I have a degree, internship experience, work experience and I conduct myself rather well. I thought landing a job working for a company I liked would be cake.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been applying for jobs for 3 months now and I cant even get an interview... I am receiving rejection letter after rejection letter and I have become extremely negative towards everything and everyone. To make matters worse my friends are all busy with their lives and still have not reached out to see how I am doing. I have spent everyday these past 3 months stuck inside my house applying for jobs and stressed with my only activity outside of the house being the gym. At first all of this was a shock to me. I went from having tons of friends in college, a great girlfriend, and goals to being alone all day with no friends, no job and an ex girlfriend who has moved on and seems to be happy with life. Now it just seem like this is the new normal.

I feel like my world is completely upside down and this is not what I had visioned after graduating. All my friends seem to be happy with their lives and here I am struggling to find motivation after so much rejection. I say this humbly, but I have always been someone who is ahead of everyone else my age and now that I seem to be behind its killing me. I have not been happy with my life since graduation and for the first time ever I feel somewhat depressed. I have distanced myself from my friends and have not been in contact with my ex girlfriend after breaking up. I am trying my hardest to remain optimistic about the future. I am hoping I get hired after the holiday season passes assuming thats when companies will be looking to hire. I have hit rock bottom and I am fortunate to have a great family, but I am so negative despite what they say my mindset stays the same. 

\- Has anyone been in a similar situation?

\- Are my feeling normal?

\- What is your take on my situation?

\- All feedback is appreciated!"

Graduated at 21. 22 now. CS Bach. C# back end focused. Talented in sql, GUI, learning front end slowly.

They won't be hiring another programmer for a few years at minimum. I'm essentially inheriting his applications and I'm honored to do so. It's daunting. 

I think I'm in a unique position. I went from intern to full-time in two months, and have been a junior since. After six months, I've been working on projects alone for three months now, using git by myself and letting boss review, not being mentored any more.

AFAIK that's not junior engineer right there? Am I wrong? When, if ever, do I ask for a raise?"

eclhko,2,2019-12-18,Question about IT Business Analyst role and the scope of what's typically required of them,PiPstein,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/eclhko/question_about_it_business_analyst_role_and_the/,"I graduated from college about a year ago and while finishing my studies, I was an intern for a company that hired me full time the second I graduated to be an IT Business Analyst. It was a dream scenario for me, as I love working with data and modelling processes and requirements related items and had a steady job right away.

However, the more I've worked here, the more it feels like the scope of my role is WAY more than an IT Business Analyst typically does. I know it depends on the company (and project), but based on what I've researched online, it's way over what it should be.

On a normal day, I'm doing tasks such as the following:

1. Fully managing multiple large software implementation projects as a project manager typically would and acting as the person pulling the data from the old system to transfer over, cleaning up said data, user administration, etc, not just at the requirements gathering and solution analysis phases.
2. Maintaining our new phone systems as they go live, project managing the implementation of said phone system at all of our offices one by one (sometimes two by two), provisioning/configuring the hardware for it, figuring out the old phone system and porting the DIDs, and supporting end users on questions/support they need for it after their offices go live.
3. Planning and designing not just our department budget, but also the technology budget of all of our offices.
4. Creating automation type processes using our software to make data flow easily and more understandable to end users (this makes sense to me for a business analyst, though).
5. Handling 24/7 on call support duties for networks/servers, phones, general support, etc (to be fair, this is going away, as we've started to outsource this). Also, handling support items during the day.
6. Helping other departments with editing videos for training not tech-related.
7. Figuring out our current method of invoicing, contacting all the vendors we want to notify of changes to our process, figuring out how we want to process dept. invoices going forward, tracking costs over time, etc...
8. Database programming (i.e SQL) and report pulling (also makes sense to me as a business analyst, though).
9. API programming for cross system data transfer.
10. General in-person support for our office (one of a few, but people most often come to me).
11. Budget, customer satisfaction ratings, etc reports for other departments.
12. Ordering hardware and software licenses for people, usually specifically related to projects I'm on (i.e phones) but not always just that.

I also had little to no training on how to do any of the above. I've often been thrown into things without a lifejacket. I understand that self-reliance and self-teaching are the most important skills you can have for any job, but sometimes I feel as if I don't do certain projects justice because I'm learning as I go.

And many, many more. I feel like I either underestimated the range of what an IT BA should do, or that the ""other duties as assigned"" part of my job description takes up more of my daily life than my main designated duties do. I'm also very young and new to the industry, and so my inexperience may be clouding my expectations? Can any other BAs weigh in?"
eclkqu,1,2019-12-18,What should be my next move? Am I just screwed?,OoooImmaLilThrowaway,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/eclkqu/what_should_be_my_next_move_am_i_just_screwed/,"Back in April of 2017 I was convicted and adjudicated of a Class-E Felony as a Youthful Offender. \[NEW YORK STATE\]

I was sentenced to five years of felony probation. Despite me being a minor (16) at the time and me being a Youthful Offender, the law in the state I live in allowed individuals to be charged as an adult once they turned 15. So that's what they did.

So late October/early November marked 2.5 years of my sentence so I could petition the court for early termination of my probation. I spoke with my lawyer about this and he said that he wanted me to tell my probation officer about it just so she knew. Today at an appointment with probation, I brought this up with my probation officer and she basically cut me off and told me that for people that were convicted of a crime like mine, (Felony I guess? She didn't specify) that they would not recommend early termination and that it was basically their department policy.

She said that even though they wouldn't recommend it to the court, I absolutely had the right to file a petition with the court. When I got home and I told my lawyer this, he basically told me that I pretty much need probation's support in order for the petition to be approved and that the judge wouldn't go along with it if they didn't, but that he would go over my file and see what he could do and that we'd reconvene after the New Year.

My mother made an interesting point to my lawyer, saying that since I got YO and I was adjudicated, that I was technically really never *convicted* of anything and that maybe there would be some kind exception that could be made.

The attitude that my probation officer gave off was that she wasn't explicitly telling me no, more so that she really didn't care. The line she gave me about it being department policy also kind of gave me the impression that she was lying and that it was (pun intended) a cop-out.

We all know the kind of people that probation officers can be and that generally they don't want to work with you or agree with you, so am I just f\*cked? If the department won't approve my request really the only option I see is to find another department in a different county that will accept my proposition and then transfer to that county, but to say that's a huge pain in the ass is an understatement.

I've done everything that has been asked of me by probation, and have met all the criteria specified to qualify for early termination. I've pretty much worked my ass off for the past 3 years to better myself as a person and as a young adult despite probation making it harder on me at pretty much every turn. I graduated high school pretty much on my own without any help or tutoring, I completed a week-long internship with a local college, I've maintained gainful employment at the same establishment since February of 2016, and I graduated college in May and obtained my Associate's Degree while making the President's List of my College for the last two semesters. I did this under the assumption that after 2.5 years I would at least get my petition reviewed in front of a judge. This is **extremely** disheartening to say the least.

I'm going to meet with my lawyer pretty much ASAP after January 1st so I'll be able to get more clarification but I just wanted to post here and see what everyone's personal experiences were like and if they could offer me advice based on what they've seen, whether they're attorneys, people who have been convicted, or even members of the law enforcement community. Thanks for your time in advance."

I took an equivalent to an A+ course PC Hardware. We built a computer in teams, we read some of the chapters not all were required, we had exams that we were given a study guide the week before to fill out and the Monday before the Wednesday exam we were given the correct answers; then that Wednesday we were given the exam and every one (of 3) was the exact same questions, exact same order. Literally memorized the questions with answers.

I'm thinking of buying a CompTIA A+ Core 1 and 2 study guide and practice exams and try to learn on my own as I didn't learn anything in that class. I'm looking at the ones on Amazon they are CompTIA version. Would they help me figure out troubleshooting and how to figure out steps to go through?

I practice interviews a couple days before each one. I just get really stumped with easy questions. I feel like I need to have a list of questions I need to write down with a flowchart with clarifying questions to get it right.

Hey everyone. I’m currently an **international** student at a US University. Top 20 just undergrad, top 50ishCS department.

I unfortunately switched my major in my junior year to CS. Consequently, I wasn’t able to find an internship during my junior year summer.

Then, I had to take a 2 year leave of absence from school (military duty back home) during senior year with 1 semester left. I’m returning to finish my last semester in Spring 2020. 

I’ve currently applied to masters in CS programs. My goal is to go to a decent school for a MS, get an internship during the summer, and get a job later on.

Given that I won’t have any work experience when I apply to internships during my first semester of my masters, so you think it’ll likely that I’ll land an internship anywhere? Will I even be considered for interviews (esp as an international student)??

I’m planning to really work on side projects and beef up my resume. I have a few friends already in industry who can give me some referrals too. But do I still not stand a chance for getting an internship without work experience as a Master’s student??

It takes the guilt and pain you have experienced in your miserable life and magnifies it, using it as a weapon to hurt you with.

I stand here, within a cell of bone nestled amidst a sea of flames and dancing demons. But I am not alone.

To my left and right, in cages of rusted metal and twisted limbs stand row upon row of the soldiers of man.

Spartan hopilites with their toned bodies and tall spears, tribal Zulu warriors who stand tall with cowhide shields and feathered headdresses. Even those of the newer theatres, British trench troops from the great war, American GIs, German infantry and Russian soldiers from WWII stand side by side, enemies no longer in this place.

They talk, they whisper, they learn the languages of the men and women next to them.

Time has melted the barriers of nation and race that once saw them sin against one another.

The pain of the punishment visited upon them for their transgressions in life has given way to camaraderie and purpose.

The demons pour fourth their cackling laughter, they dance and delight in the torment they are given to indulge in.

But the soldiers only smile. 

They smile and they wait.

Their time is coming again, and neither hell nor heaven will stand against them.

A shopping mall parking lot is not generally the kind of place where momentous events happen.

It’s a transitionary spot, a place for people to come and go. Important things aren’t really centred around them.

But this was anything but a traditional day.

A crack in the pavement grew to a wide split in the earth before the eyes of a hundred distracted shoppers.

Eyes grew wide and cellphones were raised to take video while the split grew larger, revealing depths of plummeting darkness into the belly of the Earth.

It couldn’t be an earthquake, this just wasn’t the area for it, and the ground wasn’t shaking.

It was more like something massive was pushing up from below, trying to break free.

Whispers between enraptured shoppers who had just wanted to leave intermingled with the panicked footsteps of one who hustled to get his car out of the danger zone even as the crack settled and grew no larger.

When the first red arm extended from below, there was no screaming.

It wasn’t the kind of sight a person can process like that, the fear would only come later, when the shock had worn off.

But it didn’t take long.

A mess of scaled, slimy and segmented appendages of a variety of sickly colours poured fourth from the crack. Indescribable creatures crawling into the open air.

The noise of scraping concrete could be heard from miles around with the hard nails of those hands grasping at the tarmac, an acrid stench of sulfur that burnt at the nose erupted forth with a hiss of reddish steam.

Gnashing teeth and whipping tails, so confusing were their proportions, it was honestly difficult to say how many existed, where one ended and the next began.

People fled.

Screams echoed out now, a universal human warning of danger.

But even in the heart of panic and fear, there were those who saw their chance for fame, those who held up their cellphones and recorded whatever they could lay their eyes on, knowing how valuable the footage would be.

A monster stepped forward and raised a taloned limb, intending to strike down one of the filmers, but a greater being stopped it.

Hissing at the smaller monster, the hulking brute turned yellow eyes set above a face containing far too many teeth to the now slightly shaking cellphone.

Recognising this as a viewing window of sorts, the monster addressed the phone rather than the person holding it, speaking around its great teeth in something recognisable as English.

“We seek… asylum.”

&amp;#x200B;

Every world government was in an uproar.

It was happening globally, cracks in the earth, monsters emerging.

In some places, they were instantly hostile, treating any contact with humans as a chance to destroy and rampage. These were quickly put down by local military forces.

Almost equally troublesome were those that weren’t, those that spoke to people and calmly requested political discourse.

Alex Mavor saw the word mentioned several times, that one word he wasn’t quite willing to say.

The ‘D’ word.

He’d wait until they said it, apparently they were talking, but wanted someone with authority.

In this hick town, that meant him.

Bustling into his office, he was attacked with multiple voices, a scatterbrained combination of updates, requests for information, general excitement and that word.

The ‘D’ word.

But eventually, he managed to hustle into the interview room where the… thing… was waiting.

He peered through the glass to the room usually used for interrogating suspected overstayers or border wall jumpers.

According to his secretary, it was ten times that size when it first crawled out from the ground. It had shrunk itself down to fit inside buildings designed for humans.

Now it perched on the chair offered to it, head down without saying a word. Some clueless intern had placed a hot coffee in front of it.

A head that seemed a little too wide for its body, leathery black and red streaks like a red lizard had been scorched on a barbecue. Its proportions and limbs were vaguely humanoid, but… off, ever so slightly. It’s legs were just a little too short, it’s forearms just a little too long.

A pair of black horns tipped forward from behind it’s pointed ears, terminating in tips with red colouration that made it seem like the creature had just finished goring some hapless creature.

Its cohorts were out back, in the detention centre for lack of a better place to put them.

Swallowing down his nerves, Alex opened the door and stepped inside.

The d－ the creature didn’t react to his presence, possibly it had already known he was there.

Alex took a seat and shuffled some papers, a force of habit he had found had something of an effect on guilty foreigners who weren’t supposed to be here. 

But it wasn’t until Alex actually spoke that the creature met his blue eyes with its catlike yellow ones.

“So… you’ve caused quite a mess for me here.”

The creature didn’t smile, with that mouth lined with rows of shark teeth, Alex wasn’t even sure if it *could* smile.

“My name is Alex Mavor, I’m head of immigration control here… but first thing is first.”

He struggled to maintain eye contact.

Even downsized the creature was intimidating, something about the shape of it spoke to a primal part of the human mind, provoking fear even when it wasn’t really doing anything.

“What exactly are you… and where did you come from?”  
Alex went quiet, anticipating response.

For a moment the creature only quietly regarded him, it had remained mostly silent until now, as if under arrest and waiting to speak to a lawyer. Evidently it decided that Alex was senior enough that it could speak to him, and its words were exactly what Alex feared.

“We are demons… and we come from hell.”

Aaaaahh crap, it said it. It said the fucking ‘D’ word just like that.

No denying it now, this was no advanced cosplay or elaborate practical joke, Alex had seen the split in the earth these things had crawled out of and no human machine he knew of could do anything like that.

“Demons from hell… *the* hell? I have about a thousand questions…”

“I will endeavour to answer them.”

The demon’s words were cultured, but its voice rumbled like thunder. It didn’t sound like anything a human could reliably replicate.

“Does this mean that… god… is real?”

Alex almost didn’t need the answer, the demon physically flinched at the mention of the name.

The demon shook its head.

“I’ll not speak of it! Do not ask me of that!”

Wow, OK, dramatic. On to the next point.

“Why are you here?”  
”We are…”

The demon visibly hesitated, it’s eyes narrowing in a way that possibly indicated uncertainty.

“...refugees.”

Alex tried to keep his expression of professional neutrality. Honestly he was silently congratulating himself for remaining this calm for so long.

“Refugees from what?”

“There is… a war in hell. And I am part of the side that is loosing.”

“A war against who? Or is it demons fighting demons?”  
The demon shook its head again, the slow swaying giving the impression the head had quite a bit of mass to it, more than a human head would.

“Demons cannot fight other demons, obedience to the authority is in our nature, we are at war against… another enemy.”

Alex swallowed, following a train of logic in his mind.

What kind of creatures would be waging a war against demons? The answer popped up in his mind and demanded attention.

He silently raised a single finger, pointing at the unseen sky beyond the dimly lit ceiling.

“Is it… are you fighting… them?”

For some reason Alex really didn’t want to say that word either, the new forbidden word of the day.

The ‘A’ word.

But the demon’s next words blew that theory out of the water.

“No… we fight another, a different enemy.”

“Who?”

“I… cannot say.”

Alex frowned, this was getting him nowhere.

“You want asylum from a war, but you can’t tell us who you are fleeing from?”

“That is correct.”

“...well… that makes this conversation a little difficult then doesn’t it?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Over time, the more violent demons were quelled; the peaceful ones remained in the custody of whichever nation they had appeared in.

There were a staggering variety.

Those that appeared in the west were often cloven hooved and goat horned. They had red skin and breathed hellfire.

Those in the east were fang toothed and yellow eyed. Snakes with the heads of human women, oni wielding ancient weapons or claw handed men and women with sunken faces and traditional robes.

In Africa, creatures of darkness with wide eyes and twisted shapes poured fourth.

As if shaped by the culture from which they had came, the tide of refugee demons surged forth.

They all had the same story, a war in hell from which they had fled at the orders of their lord.

And they all refused to tell who the enemy was.

In some places where demons were automatically assumed evil and up to no good, the governments did not hesitate to resort to methods of torture to interrogate.

None of it worked, not even once. 

Demons were not creatures of human flesh and blood, of human weakness. The worst tortures of humanity were nothing to them.

As with all things, time brought equilibrium.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A master stirred in his lair.

The fires that licked at his feet were a comforting embrace, fighting the shadow of truth that now haunted him.

It was over, thousands upon thousands of years of his rule had come crashing down.

The screaming echoed from outside his chamber, it was not the screams of humans being tormented for their sins.

It was the screams of those who would be tormentors, cut down not by those who seek pleasure in torture, but by those who sought only blood and destruction.

The encroaching army didn’t stop to cause more pain as demons would, they didn’t drive in their pokers and laugh at the agony they created.

They killed, and then moved on to the next thing to kill. Time spent causing pain was time not spent killing.

Oceans of demon blood ran over the craggy hellscape of the underworld.

The lord grasped at his sword, feeling the electric force of power running through it.

The flames that clung to the sword blended with the flames of his chamber

It was time.

What little forces he could, he had ordered to do what they had been forbidden to do for an age and bid them escape to live on, anywhere they could.

The lord emerged from his chamber, standing tall and looking down upon the army beating upon his walls.

Humans.

The warriors of a dozen ages and a hundred nations.

Here, Persian chariot riders ran through his armies, cutting down enemies with every swing.

There, a line English longbow archers drew back and loosed volley after volley over their allies and into the heart of the unprepared forces they assailed.

Deadlier still were those holding the guns of the new age of humanity, those who had led the charge.

Weapons that spat fire, that killed in an instant.

They did not cause the same suffering as their predecessor had, their machines of death were refined to perfection. Single, dispassionate shots to the head before moving on, one dead, two dead, three dead, reload.

An army of sinners overthrowing hell.

Wherever they fell, they rose again. What had they to fear? They were already dead.

With a roar to grasp the attention of all in the field of battle, the devil raised his sword and charged.

He had ruled hell for thousands of years.

He would not take this insurrection lying down.

# Not sure what else to include, so if you have any other questions, feel free to comment or message me.

* Classes I've taken
* What went wrong
* What works
* General tips
* Different class structures
* How to approach homework
* How to approach studying for tests


*About me:*

Disclaimer: this is what works for me so far and it might not work for you. I’m not trying to flaunt or be a know-it-all, I know how difficult studying is and I want to share my tips to help, also I’m bored and wanted to type something up. No one will probably care or read this but whatever lol. The point is, if you’re pulling all-nighters to cram before a difficult exam, finish 15 homework assignments before the due date, dedicating 10 hours a day to study, etc. you may need to rethink your studying habits.

**EVERYONE learns differently so keep that in mind as I describe myself. But, if we are similar, maybe this will work better for you.** I have good study habits and discipline from AP classes which is why the transition to college wasn’t as drastic for me. I’m really bad at understanding topics quickly, it takes effort on my own time outside of class to understand stuff. I’m a good test taker when I feel comfortable with the material but I panic quickly if I’m not. I do not work part time or partake in clubs, (Which I'm aware makes things a lot easier for me! But still, time management is key for everyone.) my free time is spent with friends/BF/family, doing stuff I like to do, and relaxing. My hands-on experience so far is from PT food industry job (3 years), 2 FT engineering internships (4 and 8 month), and class projects so I do not abandon everything else for grades!! This is important - hands-on experience is way more valuable than getting good grades. But still, you want to pass your classes!

*What classes (undergrad and one graduate) I’ve taken so far, not including required university-specific classes, labs or workshops (which is the same grade as the class):*

* Dynamics (A-)
* Physics E &amp; M (B+)
* Thermodynamics (B)
* Calc 3 (the rest of the grades are As)
* Differential Equations and Linear Algebra
* Mathematical Methods for Engineering (Graduate)
* Intro to Engineering 1 and 2
* Chemistry
* Statics
* Mechanics of Materials
* Material Science
* Finite Element Analysis
* Intro to Computer Science
* 2 fluffy History Electives

*What “went wrong”:*

Thermo and E&amp;amp;M: I Chegg’d all of my homework without understanding it, didn’t study efficiently,  didn’t do enough practice before tests to understand concepts, all the tests went poorly. Took these in the same semester, they were my first non-A grades.

Dynamics: Didn’t do enough practice before tests to understand concepts so I didn’t feel comfortable on the midterms (but the final went great which is why I got an A- and not a B-something).

*What works:*

It’s important to figure this out because it helps a lot! Find out what type of learner you are and what things you need to be the most productive in. For me:

* **ENVIRONMENT:** I work best in a quiet or silent place with no talking or annoying noises. I listen to lofi lyricless beats since I get easily distracted/annoyed by noises. If I’m doing easy or light work, then I listen to a show or podcast. Time of day doesn’t matter for me, I’ll take what I can get, but I do prefer getting my work done in the morning.
* **COLLABORATION:** I don’t work/study well in groups because I tend to goof off, rely on others and not think as hard. Before passing in homework, I compare it with a friend or two that’s in the same class that also finishes their homework early. We check for discrepancies then talk through them and if we can’t figure it out, we go to office hours. I do light review sessions with a friend or two before exams to touch base and vent if needed. Having a friend or group in your classes is helpful for support (mentally and schoolwork-wise).
* **PACE:** I like to study in longer sessions. Pomodoro doesn’t work for me. I work until I feel like I need a break, maybe like 1-4 hours at a time, depending on the day. I take short breaks to rest my eyes a few times an hour. I like to walk around, shower (it’s a good way to refresh yourself), nap, cook, eat, talk to friends, etc. on my breaks. I don’t like watching videos or browsing social media because I tend to get sucked in. While I prefer to get all my work done in long sessions, I do use the time between classes if possible. These shorter sessions I use more for doing homework, rather than studying for a test.
* **TOOLS:** I use a laptop (Macbook Pro) and tablet (iPad with an Apple Pencil) for all of my work. I keep everything electronic, I don’t use any paper for work. I get PDF versions of textbooks, do homework electronically (printing out if necessary), scan my worksheets and do them, scan my tests, quizzes, etc. I have a digital bullet journal style planner and electronic calendar that I get notifications for.
* **ROUTINE:** Get yourself in the habit of being productive! Set yourself up for success. On my dedicated work days, I have a whole early morning routine to get myself ready for a long day studying (big breakfast, pack lunch/snacks, shower, comfy outfit, at my favorite study spot by 9am). On normal days, I do work at basically the same time period and location whenever possible. Honestly, I really enjoy studying nowadays because it's so routine.

*General tips:*

* **Stay organized.** Have a planner, fill your calendar, whatever works for you.
   * I have a digital planner and calendar on my iPad. EDIT: It is a bullet journal style planner I designed myself in GoodNotes5, and I use Google Calendar as well for notifications. Keep track of assignments due, test dates, quizzes, events, times you aren’t going to do schoolwork, etc. Get in the habit of actually keeping your planner updated! Don’t tell yourself you’ll remember something and don’t need to write it down.
   * I have a monthly (test dates, lab dates, appointments, time away from school, etc) and weekly planner (everything!) that I keep updated.
      * As soon as I get my syllabi, I update the monthly spread. Each week on Sunday, I update the weekly spread (with the monthly spread stuff as well as due dates for the week, plans for office hours, plans with friends, etc).
      * Additionally, I include what tasks I’ll do each day. For example, working on Homework 1 Tuesday, going to office hours Wednesday, finishing Homework 1 Thursday, due date Friday. This makes it easier to spread my workload out appropriately/realistically and to avoid rushing/cramming.
      * When things get hectic, I’ll fill out a daily (hourly) planner. This is a good way for me to make sure I’m maintaining physical and mental health during stressful times.
* **Have a “perfectionist” mindset.**
   * Getting perfect grades isn’t necessary, but having a perfectionist mindset helps you keep your standards high and allows for wiggle room. When you get a homework assignment, exam or quiz back, double check the grading. Sometimes graders DO mess up so you can get points back by bringing it to your professor’s attention. Pay attention to how cascade failures are graded! Even if you get a good grade on something, just double check anyway. Keeping your grade as high as possible when it’s within your control gives you more of a cushion when things get tough.
   * Keep an Excel spreadsheet of your grades with accurate weight percentages. My school uses Blackboard but my professors don’t factor in the different weights, so keeping track of my own helps me stay aware of my grades so I’m not blindsided/surprised.
* **Stay healthy, mentally and physically.** Keeping good physical health will help your mental health too. Get enough sleep, workout, eat healthy, all that. For mental health, don’t forget to include time to relax, hang out with friends/family, do things you enjoy, etc. All of this WILL help you get better grades.
* **Time management!** It allows you more time to relax and do things you want and a lot less time stressing out. Instead of wasting time procrastinating, why not be productive and then you can use your spare time to do that stuff without guilt?
* If you manage your time and avoid procrastination, you should **never need to pull an all-nighter.** Getting some sleep (even if it’s 3 hours) or taking short naps is way better than no sleep. Saving everything until the end and cramming instead of sleeping just isn’t smart (mentally or physically), use the tips in this post to avoid that!
* If you study, study, study with no positive results in your grades, **you are studying inefficiently.** I’ve been there before; I convinced myself I was studying but I was really just listening to shows and scrolling on my phone in front of homework or wasting too much time on note-taking and textbook reading. Hopefully, the tips also help with this.

*Different class structures:*

* Class that focuses on lectures/slides that DON’T get posted online
   * Pay attention during these. Take notes, copy down as much as you can. Don’t worry about organization or being neat, just focus on getting all the information accurately.
* Class that focuses on lectures/slides that DO get posted online
   * I tend to slack off during these, which isn’t really recommended. I do mindless, easy work (like going through my planner, applying to jobs, stuff like that) in these classes while still listening to the lecture, and jot down any information not in the slides. I give my full attention when there’s an example.
* Class that focuses on going through examples
   * Most important thing is getting the full example question and answer. Follow along with the professor as they’re solving and explaining. If something doesn’t make sense or you miss something, jot it down so you can mention it later.

*How to approach homework:*

* **Start early.** Start homework the day you get it because it will give you more time to learn, fix your mistakes, ask for help, etc.
   * The day or soon after you get the homework, do all you can without referencing anyone else or Chegg answers. Don’t spend too much time on tricky questions, just get as much done as you can. The purpose of this is to beat last minute procrastination and rushing, starting something is a good motivator to finish it up.
   * Next, use your textbook as a reference to see if you can figure out more stuff. Write down relevant equations, tricks, bullet points, etc.
   * Next, use Chegg or answer keys to work through stuff - READ THE EXPLANATIONS AND UNDERSTAND THEM. If the answers don’t make sense, don’t write it down.
   * Finally, go to your professors or TA with questions, confirming if your work/understanding is correct, and finish your homework. Each prof is different so this is a good opportunity to connect and get a better feel of their methods, thought process, important points, etc.
   * Optionally, discuss with friends - compare and talk through your answers without copying blindly. Since you’ve been to office hours with questions, you’ll be able to explain the answer to your friend with the same question. Explaining or walking through processes is a good way to solidify the information in your memory. If there are new questions, email or go to office hours again.
* **Keep it neat.** It’ll be easier for graders and easier for you when you’re trying to reference it again in the future.
   * If you need to do some scratch work or do some messy problem solving, do so on a whiteboard or scrap piece of paper. I like using tablets because I don’t have to worry about erasing or wasting paper.
   * Keeping your work neat also prevents silly mistakes like misreading or losing your train of thought.

*How to approach studying for tests:*

* **Start early.** Doing a little every day is easier than squeezing everything in one night. The days or week before a test should be spent doing review and practice, not trying to learn topics from scratch! The timeline depends on your current understanding of the test topics. I start the process at least a week before the exam.
   * First step, figure out what topics/concepts are gonna be on the exam.
   * Make a quick study guide of all the equations and notes you’ll need to solve practice problems, so you’ll spend less time digging around for them.
   * Redo the homeworks…from scratch! Don’t tempt yourself by looking at your answers, really try to work through them. This is a great way to recall and solidify the information.
   * Look back on your homeworks and list of topics to figure out what you do/don’t need to work on.
   * Work on your iffy topics. Do textbook questions, go to office hours, etc.
   * Lastly, do the practice questions and tests your professor gave you for the exam. Go through and correct your mistakes, then work on those.
   * Optionally, make a panic sheet (or cheat sheet if you’re allowed) which is a concise sheet of paper with the essentials.
* **How to approach practice questions:**
   * For complicated questions, write out and explain each step. This is a good way to solidify the material and you can reference back to it if you forget how to solve similar examples.
   * Don’t waste your practice questions by giving up immediately and looking at the answers! Start from least to most relevant to your exam so you utilize the questions to the fullest potential.
   * PRACTICE UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS! If you can't do it on your own, you're not going to be able to during a stressful exam.
* **How to approach practice tests:**
   * Save these for 1-2 days before the exam. Especially if you’re only given one practice test, save it for the very end.
   * Try to make your environment as close to the real thing as possible. Eliminate distractions, set a timer to get a feel of how fast you’ll need to work, do the whole test in one sitting.
   * Check your answers and figure out what you did wrong. Mark your mistakes like a grader would. Focus on practice examples as these mistakes while you’re studying.

ecnmyw,1,2019-12-18,College Internship advice,Domoo98765,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ecnmyw/college_internship_advice/,"Background info,

I am a senior and I am about to graduate next semester

I have over 9 years' worth of experience (internships, part-time jobs, volunteer)  focus on my major.  I am currently taking 18 credits and next semester I'll be talking 17 plus a research grant project that I need to focus my attention on. 

I currently have 4 internships right now, all paid. I wanted to experience corporate, nonprofit,  and academia settings. This would of allow me to figure out what setting I wanted to work 

In October I got a job as an environmental management internship at a corporate which is a  fortune 100.  I thought it would be great however I realized I don't like the setting and task that entails. I guess my values don't a lineup. I know exactly what I want to do. ( Work with communities ordo  research on how to help them). I plan to apply for a Ph.D. for spring2021. 

The pay is well, however, is it worth my stressing 



How do I quit the corporate internship? It's been killing me on how to do it or what's the most professional way to do without burning any bridges.

**Background**

Work experience:

* 5 month engineering internship at large tech company
* 1.25 years as ""CEO"" of a 5 person tech startup that failed
* 1 year as ""CEO"" of (another) 3 person tech startup that was moderately successful but shut down 
* 1 year as a software engineer at a large tech company
* 3 years as a product manager at same tech company

Extra curriculars:

* Work has been my life for the past 6 years.. I don't have much to show here. Is that going to be a major barrier for me? I won a few tech related competitions but I suppose that's not quite ""extra curricular""

Undergrad school/major: NYU / Computer Science, BSc

Other education/coursework: NYU / Computer Science, MSc

Race/nationality: Chinese-American

Sex: F


**Stats**

GMAT Score: N/A (haven't taken yet)

Undergrad GPA: 3.91

Graduate GPA: 4.0


**MBA Info**

Goal of MBA:

* I'd like to become a better product manager - I have lots experience on the technical and UI/UX side but my business skills are informal and self taught (entrepreneurship). I'd like to improve my skills in that dimension. Also for networking opportunities!

Target schools:

* I'm not sure.. what schools do you think I could aim for? :("

The position I'm about to receive is a junior java backend developer. I just did my second interview (technical) from a company in Hamburg, I believe it went quite well and expecting an offer soon. The problem is during my initial interview, when asked for salary range, I said from range of 40-42k €. Which I realized it's quite low for Hamburg (If I'm not wrong). So I have some questions for this. Like is it possible to negotiate for higher salary than the first time I proposed? And how much is actually the average salary for junior java developer in Hamburg? and I want to know how negotiating salary works in Germany in general, like would the company withdraw their offer if I asked higher?

And additional infos: I'm from non-EU country, speaks below intermediate German. I also had internship experience in backend but using Python stacks for 10 months."

I'll start giving some context regarding my background

I got my bachelor's degree in Comp Sci in the US and is currently doing a master's program in Comp Sci also in the US, graduating in Dec 2020. I also participated in an 1 semester exchange program in UniMelb back when I was still dating my wife. They are not world-known level schools like Harvard or MIT but they are good enough to be recognized as good schools by most US employers. I'm planning to start a career in software development in Australia after I graduate (I know it's probably easier to get a job in the US tech industry but there's a series of discussions and reasoning behind this decision and if anyone's interested I can share more on another day). 

I have a 309 Partner (Provisional) visa which works exactly like a PR visa except it is not permanent – it will transition to a PR visa in 2 years after Home Affairs process the application but in the very unlikely event of the application being denied the visa will cease to be valid and I'll have to leave or submit an appeal.

I also have past work and internship experience in the tech industry. I had a part time job as a tech support lead at my undergrad school and a internship this past summer at a small company as a software engineer working full-stack. I will also do another software development internship at a famous tech company (one of FAAMG) in June of 2020.

With that context in mind, I'd like to ask some questions
1. What's Oz's opinion and culture on putting ""future"" internship experience on resume? The next internship I have will really make me stand out as an applicant and also potentially mitigate the lack of ""local experience"".
2. I know a lot of companies only consider applications from PRs and citizens but if I explain the conditions on my visa and that I will get a PR in 2 years are they likely to consider my applications as well?
3. Would it be better for me to apply for a graduate program or a junior development role? I've heard that graduate programs are for people that want to transition to a management role in a few years but I'm really more interested in being on the technical side at the moment.
4. Should I put my exchange experience in the resume? I didn't get a transcript or diploma from UniMelb – the credit transferred back to my US school."

I applied to a company, got to the final round, and was asked to schedule a virtual interview.

I responded that I would like to interview after the winter break, since the only time they listed on the survey was during the finals’ week, and I would be at a country where internet is not very stable during the break.

After writing a note, I also sent the email to the company’s internship email address, and got a response that they would contact me in a few days. This was on 12/10.

However, after that, I did not receive any email from them, so I sent another email on 12/16, but I did not hear back anything.

Should I send another email? I feel like this might be the only chance for me to do something during next summer break."
ect9kn,2,2019-12-19,"A long vent (some swearing but nothing too heavy) about multiple traumas and hard times I went through. Please forgive me if this isn't the correct place to put this, and also forgive my grammar because even though English is my first language I suck at it",BearHugs4Everyone,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ect9kn/a_long_vent_some_swearing_but_nothing_too_heavy/,"I've realized all the trauma I can remember going though as a kid and a LOT of my childhood (I'm 21) is a blank which always worried me then I got to thinking and I want to know how the hell I am not in a freaking mental hospital or heavily medicated. 
I remember my parents constantly fighting when I was really young because my dad never wanted to get up to go to work (he's better at this now) which would also start a fight over money because we were poor. 
My second older sister has always hated and even to this day she does. 
My oldest sister passed away in 2006 or 2007 at the age of 17, she was like a second mother to me and cared for myself and my younger sister. 
I had a bad break down in fourth grade which was a year after my sister passed away because in my reading class we were reading a book that talked about a kid losing his older brother who was younger than 18, I kept my cool for maybe ten minutes but I couldn't continue because I was mentally beating myself up because I didn't go to either day of my sister's funeral. 
I broke down in science class but it was silently since I never got along with my science teacher who to my young mind was always targeting me, I was called upon to read a paragraph in the science book then that's when my teacher had noticed I was crying. 
He asked why I was crying but I couldn't explain it too well since I have bad speech in the first place and when crying hard I can't be understood but the kids at my group even though they bullied me was able to understand me enough to tell my teacher that I was missing my older sister, and instead of taking me outside like every other teacher would he yelled at me to stop crying and read which I did but as soon as I was done he completely ignored me going back to sobbing my little heart out. Eventually it was time to go to English class where the student teacher noticed me and got my teacher who came out then took me up to the guidance counselor who knew what had happened to my sister as she attended the funeral herself. I ended up talking to my other older sister on the phone who was able to calm me down and I after sitting in the guidance counselor's office for a bit longer I was sent back to class but the classes changed where I went back to my home room for math but I was basically left alone for the whole class period until it was time to leave, I am 100% positive that my math/home room teacher kept an eye on me since he is friends my mom and two aunts.

I was bullied badly by my peers and one group actually made fun of me for having a Power Rangers Mystic Force watch on which I had explained that my dead sister had got it for me while at Disney for her Make-A-Wish. Even years after I was bullied until I went to my local vocational school for 10th-12th grade. 
I was bullied outside of school as well to the point where I just stayed inside.
I now have Agoraphobia and multiple other anxiety/panic disorders with trust issues, I am on two meds for every day and I have propranolol for a back up if my two meds don't keep me calm. 

I have been called a monster twice by my 9th grade which he denied and said that I was acting like a monster but my three friends in the class with me even called him out for lying. He never apologized, worst thing is I was literally the perfect student. 

My math teacher from 7th-9th grade was abusive to me as well but in 9th grade he seemed to calm down since I actually put more effort in paying attention. I am actually still afraid of him since one day a substitute opened up the small drawer where the teacher's legs would be at the desk and there was a red multitool in it. 
Last I heard anything about my old teacher is that he's proud of me for graduating high school but again I still fear him and he knows. 

During this time my parents, mainly my mom would yell at me every day before I was bullied. She kept on saying that if I would act more girly and cared about my appearance then I wouldn't be bullied, she would compare me to my three sisters then I would be sent to school crying. I had once asked her ""Why don't you love me for who I am"" which just caused her to yell then sent me to school crying. Now that I'm older I still hate her for it even though she half ass apologized but if she tried to do that shit now a days I would happily rip her a new one. 

My youngest sister went through a long phase where she was an ass and treated me like scum, she had act even made fun of my autism which to this day she will say that she was explaining to her ""friends"" that I had autism which I know is a lie because I had woken my mother up at 4 am to tell her in tears. My younger sister is better now and admits that she was an ass to me, I try to be a good older sister since the living one hates us but the younger sister hasn't fully understood that she knows but doesn't quite understand. 

I have deal with family making fun of me for still liking things like The Power Rangers and acting a bit childish but they have stopped since they found out I was diagnosed with autism, and now they actually don't care. 

Like everyone else I have had fake friends which I was able to cut out of my life and to this day I still hold myself back from beating one up. 

I deal with random anxiety or panic attacks and I end up losing all touch with reality which messes me up badly. 

I went to a special needs college where I put 100% into but I still failed the CVS pharmacy course I was taking because of two reasons. 
1: My Agoraphobia is a lot worse than what we have expected.
2: I couldn't finish the big test since my class laptop stopped working while my teacher was out and she had the key to the other laptops, my personal laptop was trash and all I could do was use MS Paint and Notepad. I couldn't use my cell phone because the website wasn't cellphone friendly and lastly the library had lent out all their laptops for the week so I couldn't get one. 
When I was sent back home since I had zero interest in any of the other courses my family didn't and still don't believe me when I say that I tried my hardest to pass which makes me pissed off because I truly did. 
At my internship at CVS which I was able to be sent home to do at one of my home city's CVS I did what I was told to do, I helped customers as best as I could but yet the main manager wrote stuff down that not even my teacher would tell me. I have since boycotted that CVS which is easy as I have one closer to me and I since I still live with my parents I got them to boycott it as well unless it's 100% necessary for them to go in.

My parents (mainly my dad) and younger sister have made fun of me over multiple things even if it's my mental health. My mom has sat there multiple times and let it happen. 

I was in therapy to help my Agoraphobia but I had to stop since my mom got a job at the local hospital and UPMC AKA real life Umbrella Corporation sucks with mental health coverage. 

I have something else but I'm not going to share because I don't want to start another argument as I'm not in the mood to deal with it, especially after writing this.


I do have a couple of friends who let me vent to them and support me while I do the same to them, I'm close with my one cousin who has her own mental issues and I am slowly getting closer with my younger sister as her depression is getting worse."

The above sounds pretty good I guess. But I feel like I'm stuck. There is no where to go in my current position:there is me, then my boss, and then the Vice Chancellor. I make okay money (nearly 4 times the poverty line for my area). I'm worried though that without guidance and some kind of growth this is the end of the line for me career-wise. I don't want that to be the case; I want to do better for myself and for my family.

I'm not particularly idle in my free time. I've setup pi clusters to get experience cluster computing, and I recently deployed Moodle on AWS as a side job to get experience with those technologies. I'm thinking of building a homelab to get more experience with fiber and other tech. Outside of IT tech, I've worked with electric car systems (and of course battery systems) and alternative energy projects. My latest thing to tinker with has been wearables/IoT.

EDIT: The only cert I have is A+, and I have a bachelors in IT

Any suggestions on what I can do?

# My Background (with some honest personal opinion)

(please don't skip this)

On paper, i am a final year student with 2+ year of experience(internships/training/scholarships/multiple projects/2 apps on play-store)  in Android(java) environment. I also got a google A.A.D. certification this year. My resume would say that apart from android,  i have also got a decent knowledge of data structures,python data analysis, I.O.T,  cloud computing, AI/ml etc . overall a great fresher about to be graduated.

But if i am honest, i would say i am displaying cats as lions. I joined college with enthusiasm for Computer world and an excitement for learning. but i am leaving college with average results in everything. most of the things that i learned/tried were due to my fear of being left out and i don't know if i have interests in them.

&amp;#x200B;

* My math, D.S.  and competitive programming is not good enough to clear even basic interviews .
* I know python enough to implement O.O.P  and i got a scholarship in data analysis , so know  basics of analysis/deep learning/AI/ml , but AI/ml never interested for its math and i never thought of getting deep into Data analysis
* I call myself a developer but I fear that my lack of knowledge of Web development will cause me a hindrance.
* I have spent a long time in android, but still consider my skills as not good and wondering if this is going to be a correct path or not

&amp;#x200B;

Allow me to explain the last 2 points in detail.

**My thoughts on Web development**

* When i did a course in android, my friend did a web dev course, so i always find these 2 as 2 different paths of which i chose the worse.
* After being in native android environment for so long, i find C.S.S./ JavaScript  terrible and web dev  uninteresting. but whenever i try to think of other career options, they are usually around web dev : like designer,  back-end dev, cloud engineer, full stack dev, system/Linux admins, block-chain dev ,AR/V.R. , even AI/ml have things like tensor-flow which uses node.js or something,  A guy with web dev knowledge ends  up with a great knowledge of a lot of things
* I  also find myself (Android developer) as inferior and often times dependent to web devs. As an android dev, i cannot make a complete functional  app because we always have to depend on server devs for making that part. Fire-base is an option, but that's just a black-box provided by google with could be tweaked only upto a certain level( i am pretty sure if a company wants a back-end dev, they would be looking for someone with more knowledge than black box usage)

thus i fear i must start learning at-least about JavaScript

**Android Dev**

This is the part that describes that's most important about myself.

* After learning java basics, i tried to learn about android  by doing a classroom course. i was always lagging and found android intimidating , but the sheer fact that i was designing apps was exciting to me (as games and softwares were the reason why i pursued computer science).
* At the end of course  , i started doing internships , making mini projects , learning things on my own, etc . Basically trying to improve my knowledge while being a college student.
* To this day i am doing the same thing again and again. I received  my Google A.A.D. certification( which i really think i don't deserve) and launched a few apps( which i think are too shitty).
* I didn't kept up with the trends like kotlin ,flutter  design patterns ,etc, because i thought gaining a system knowledge is more important. i rather researched on  sms/call databases, bluetooth,  camera, sensors ,A.A.C., testing etc  But even saying that i ""researched"" on these topics feels like cheating, because all i did was to learn their basics and left going deep as ""why bother? when i will join a company, i will learn about it if needed""
* Ignoring those trends of  kotlin and flutter have started to bite me, but i found them interesting and given a months time, i would be ready to use them flawlessly. As of now i can say that if i join a company having multiple android devs in a team, i could be a good junior dev. i can find things on my own and minimal help. i would just need a little on-boarding for the first few months, then i will be a good recruit.
* But even after all this , i find it scary  pursue any more learning of android and android related technologies on my own.

**More on my experiences**

In all the previous internships that i have done, they were early stage Indian startups having a very low budget. in all of them i ended up being the only android developer making their whole app with my limited knowledge. those were all a limited time period internships due to my college, but after leaving them, i don't feel like i did  made any significant  products.

Thus i have this fear of responsibility , and i really want to work as someone's junior and in a team. unfortunately, i have found that there are a lot of expectations from an android dev and  most of the companies don't have this culture for training and then assigning responsibility  in case of android devs , in India.

These days i am struggling to find a job because of my lack of knowledge of ""trends"" (dagger/mvp-mvvm stuff, **kotlin)** which they don't wanna train for, and thus i am loosing interest

&amp;#x200B;

So tldr: average student with awful DS/programming knowledge , decent but not enough android knowledge, FOMO from web dev , scared from total android responsibility

# Current situation: Choices

Since college is coming to an end, my anxiety levels and fear of outside world has reached an all time high My childhood dreams  of ""leaving an impressive mark on this world"" have been sadly reduced to ""making world a better place with my knowledge and skills"", which got further reduced to ""earning enough to save for retirement and family"".

Out of all the chaos, fear and struggle, i have finally come down to a few options from which i have to choose what i have to do for next  months before graduating in aug 2020 and facing the cruel cruel world.

&amp;#x200B;

**1-  Android dev internship in previous startups**

One of the previous start ups that i interned with might take me back. they will be paying awful salary, no teams, stressing the hell out of me, and expect a high level finished product in return

**2-  Android dev internship/job in new companies**

I will be starting to send out my resumes again to new companies. This time, i am thinking of sending to only app making companies, where there will be seniors whom i could consult for more knowledge . however i feel it would waste a month's time and i  don't think i would be able to find the learning/training environment that i fansy

**3- Learn more Android on my own**

I might as well dedicate the next 6 months learning about android on my own. maybe i can dwelve more into kotlin/dagger/other tools used by the companies. I could start looking for job after graduation and since i would have learned about professional tools , i won't be needing much onboarding time .

But i don't think i can learn anymore stuff on my own. Internet resources are very scarce and a lot of my time is wasted on searching and understanding. its better to learn in companies as they can provide a professional environment , resources and experience ppl

**4- TCS**

This is a very unwanted /backup choice that i hope of never taking .  Indian students would know this name as a big mass recruiting mass firing company that employs freshers. They came to my college too, i got selected and now i have the offer acceptance letter. Now i am supposed to look onto their course packages, give tests and join in Aug2020. if i choose this option, i will end up with both a very awful package and a dispassionate job profile

**5- Learn webdev/blockchain/FOMO stuff**

This is also similar to point 3 , except i am thinking of learning things that i didn't considered before and fear of missing out on them. i will try to create my interest around JavaScript( which is very difficult for me). i just fear this will also end up getting added  to my list of failures aka resume."

TLDR: An Indian doing conversion masters in comp science in UK hopes to get find employment in the UK within 4 months after graduation in Sept 2020. Is that possible and any tips?

It would really be helpful if I can find some guidance. I am a doctor, worked in the clinic and taught in medical school for the past 5 years. I am from India and I am 30 now and I have been very passionate about programming. I self taught myself to code and completed front end, data visualisation and back end certifications from freeCodeCamp. I decided to take the next step by joining MSc CS from an uni in UK. Three months have passed and it has been really good. I have found myself to be quite capable of complex programming to the level of multi threading, SIMD with C++ in my coursework. Have been working on algorithms and data structures for interviews.

Now here's the bad part. I realised that all the graduate programmes in UK don't generally take students who require visa sponsorship. I have applied to a host of them and got rejected mostly citing this reason. Some of the internship positions have responded positively so far. Since I am on the postgraduate scheme, I am not allowed to work till Sept 2020. My Tier 4 visa would expire in Jan 2021. Is it realistic to hope that I could get a company to sponsor my Tier 2 visa and employ me all in 4 months after I graduate in Sept 2020? Any tips or guidance is greatly welcome.

Thank you."

The branch I applied to is in San Diego and I live in Washington DC so the branch manager that was interviewing me said the next step would be for him to start an email with one of his friends from a Maryland branch to set up an in person interview with me and the friend. He said to look out for this in my email in the next couple of hours. I didn’t get any email at all on Monday or Tuesday morning, so about 24 hours after the phone interview I sent a thank you/follow up email to him asking if I should expect the in person interview in Maryland before or after Christmas. That hasn’t elicited a response either and it’s now Thursday, 3 days after the initial phone interview and with Christmas/New Years looming soon. What should I do? Should I send another follow up or just wait? Should I send his secretary an email as I have her email since he cc’d her to set up a time for our initial phone interview?

I am expected to graduate by the end of March and I am super excited. The only issue is, I don’t really know what I want to do when I graduate. I do know that after doing 1.5 years of help desk, I hate it and would love to avoid the troubleshooting/over the phone sort of thing. 

To add a few layers of this, I will be graduating with:

MTA Database Fundamentals (SQL)
CompTIA Trifecta (A+, N+, Sec+), Project+ and Cloud Essentials
3 CIW Certs pertaining to HTML5 CSS3 &amp; UI Design
ITIL 
Linux LPI

My Bachelors in IT
1.5 years of help desk (it was an on campus job at my old college)
1yr of Medical Data Reconciliation (unrelated to IT)
Decent knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, Java

I feel like I have plenty of options due to my certs and the broadness of my degree, the issue is I don’t really know the entryway positions or rather the path to go. I don’t know where I sit because I have certs but no deep experience. 

I have a very strong liking for Front-end Web Development with potential to become fullstack one day. I just dont feel confident in my ability to get through technical interviews and it seems like every job posting I see requires years of experience even at entry level. 

I have some interest in Project management, and I have a pretty decent interest in Cybersecurity as well. I can see myself conducting audits and overall improving security within a company. I just don’t know where to start without undercutting myself (I have the sec+ and Project+ respectively) . 

I also have some interest in the Cloud, but I feel like it’s too far out of reach at this moment. Maybe thats because the Cloud Essentials is the only cert I haven’t obtained at this current moment. 

One more thing to note is that internships do not seem like it will be an option for me. I am moving and will definitely need decent money to survive and a lot of them are seasonal anyways. (This means I will have to wait until the beginning of a next opportunity rather than joining something ongoing). 

I’m really looking for some guidance and I do hope that I have some sort of wiggle room. If anyone can point me to some job roles that you think would fit me, I would really appreciate it. I am also open to personal dms for any more in-depth career advice."

ed1xt5,2,2019-12-19,Applying for summer internships - advice/help needed. (Is this worth it? / Do small or mid-sized companies even do this?),cscareerqthrowaway98,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ed1xt5/applying_for_summer_internships_advicehelp_needed/,"I am a college sophomore. Attending school in Indiana but my home is in the California Bay Area. 

I've been mostly applying to internships in the Bay Area, with the exception of the Big N companies (since Big N companies provide housing, food, and transportation stipends). That way, I have a roof over my head and food on the table (thanks, mom) while I intern without going broke.

Unfortunately. I have not had much luck in applying to Bay Area companies (mostly rejections or ghostings so far). I had two interviews at a Big N but did not do well enough. I was advised to try again at that Big N next year, which I will do. (I am yet to take a data structures and algorithms class - I'll be taking it next semester - and I feel like that class will help me perform better in Big N interviews.)

So, I've decided to widen my horizons and apply to internships at other locations besides the Bay Area. I applied to internships in Los Angeles yesterday and already got two interview offers! 

The thing is, the interviews are for positions that are unpaid. If I accepted the offer, I'd have to pay for my own housing, food, and transportation in LA during the summer, as I have no family in LA I could crash with. 

Is it worth it to consider these offers where I'm only spending and not earning any money all summer? My biggest priority right now is getting good work experience. I'm not too worried about compensation as I have a family that is well-off. At the same time, my family isn't rich and we've been spending a lot of money on medical bills as my grandma is ill. So having to commit to this kind of internship would not be ideal. It's something my dad would likely be hesitant - if not completely against - funding. And I don't blame him, either - it would be very expensive if I took up one of these offers. Is it worth trying to convince my dad to pay for a small apartment, provide some money for food, and fund transportation, though? 

Also...

Should I keep applying to other small/mid-sized companies in other locations with hopes that one will provide a housing/transportation/food stipend and fly me out to the internship location for the summer? Do any small/mid-sized companies even compensate interns like that?"

About to end semester 1 of Junior year. Unweighted GPA from this semester will be about 3.7, weighted will be anywhere from 3.9 to 4.1, but I could be off but multiple tenths of a point.

SAT score is 1340 and I'll be taking it once or twice more to raise it.

In an event I hosted/ran, I raised $2,300 for my local animal shelter. I don't want to give details, in order to stay anonymous, but it was a very unique event, in a good way.

I'm also an Eagle Scout.

Yes, I will be applying early decision. I take pride in my writing ability (although it might not show in this post), so I'm confident about how my college essays will be. I also plan to do a college interview, which I've heard is good to do to increase your odds of getting in.

I also plan to graduate high school a semester early and use that time to work an internship at an information technology/cloud computing company. I've already been told by employees of that company that there's a good chance we can make it happen.

ed3a30,5,2019-12-19,I'm a broken prostitute.,sadnibbahours420,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ed3a30/im_a_broken_prostitute/,"To put it point blank, I'm an underage prostitute, of sorts. I consider it being sex trafficked because I don't stand on a corner and wait for creepy men to ask me, it's an organization of people like me who need a little money and are willing to find it anyway they can. I also don't get to choose who sorts with me. That's not the point though. 

When I started 6th grade, my family was being broken into pieces. My father, who had left before I was two, was engaged to a woman that would verbally abuse me for not being girly. I like having my hair in an afro and not wearing makeup. While her daughter is a plain replica of her, and she wants me to be like that. But I always thought that wouldn't be a problem because I only saw him once a month, for the last weekend. I was very wrong.

One time, we were having an argument (her just yelling at me) about me wanting to leave the house with an afro and sweatshirt. Since for the most time I'm more of a yesman, it came as a shock when I told her off. I told her that I don't really represent her, and at least I had hair to put in an afro. So, she slapped me and told my father that he has to choose over me, his daughter, or her and their three year relationship. He chose her. He drove me home and that's the last time I saw any of them. I never got to tell her that I regret what I told her, or that I cared about my father as well, because she blocked my number from my father's phone. 

So I lived with my mom. But there are some problems with that. One, I'm not her only child. Two, that child is very racist and homophobic. Three, she is an alcoholic and tweaker. I'm half black, and my younger brother always teased me for it. He'd throw me (he's fairly strong)  against the furniture and threaten to curb me. While I'm not personally gay, I'm very open to people being themselves, love wins, and my brother has always berated me for not thinking like him. 

My mother would never stop his constant bullying, unless I fought back, in which she would push me into my room and scream at me for getting the man of the house. I could easily hit her back, or tell at her back, because she is always so weak. Whether it be from booze or whatever she could find. I'd like to also add, she didn't make a lot of money. It was enough for us to have a good under or head, but not already food on our plates. Since my mom cherished her white son, if there want enough food for us all, I suffered the most. 

To add salt to my wounds, my mom's side of the family doesn't accept put my mom had a bi racial daughter, so they haven't exactly cared about me or at least not the way they did my brother. And I only have contact with one person from my father's side of the family, my grandmother. 

She was the light of my life. She fed me whenever I saw her. Got me new clothes because there wasn't budget for that with my mom. I love her, I still do. But around a year and a half ago, she found out that I didn't think there was a god. Since she's heavily Christian, that was a problem. She hasn't stopped caring about me, but she has stopped doing it as much. She wants to see me, but less. And that's it. So she became almost alien like to me. 

My school life hasn't been any better. I've always been bullied for being poor, and having so many not illegal jobs for an underage child. So then, I felt so alone. After an argument with my brother one night, I left the house for a walk. It made me feel better. That wall turned into a well thing, then bi daily, then at one point it became the same thing I did after 'every' meal. Well, on one of those walks, I met a stranger. He told me I was beautiful, and that he thought I might be a good candidate for his business. He said I would be an intern, and if I liked, I would start making money. 

I agreed instantly, because having a stable income is what I've dreamed of. So he told me to meet him there, on that corner we met, at eight the next day, and to pamper up as much as possible. At the time, being eleven, I didn't think much of it. I thought I might be taking pictures with him out something. So I did, I wore my only dress, and makeup from my mom's supply. I didn't even tell my mom where I went, but like she'd care. He told me to get in his car, which looking back was an awful idea, but I did anyway. We drove for almost an hour, I had no clue where I was. He took me inside a house, where he told me another man was waiting for me. 

When I walked in, alone and confused, there was a  mid fifties looking man, on his bed that to me too ""come here baby"". He did awful things to me for what felt like so long, but he wouldn't stop. He left me there, once he was done. I felt numb, not sad, but numb. I knew what he did was wrong, but I will ping know yet just how wrong. The first man came inside, helped me up, too me too his car, and just started driving. I felt dirty, but I said nothing. He broke the I've by telling me I did good. To meet him at the corner every other day. 

That started almost 3 years ago. I see that man still. Sometimes he asks me to wear a little bunny costume for him, or a school girl outfit, but I've gotten over it for the most part. What felt worse is having to take pills afterwards so I don't get pregnant. I feel like a white, to be fair because I am. But I get a decent pay, which is an understatement. You'd be surprised how much people will pay for a young girl like me. 

After all that though, what's put me over edge is seeing another girl. We did a duo performance for a guy. Two things were different though. He looked so young, like only eighteen. And the other girl was my agree when I started. Gwen. Her name was Gwen. She looked as scared as I had felt. We got to talk on the ride, we had time too. It was out of state, she told me that it was her first time. 

Later, the way she cried before he finished in her, I couldn't hold it anymore. It was the first time I cried on job. We held each other,  being silent the whole ride back to the corner. It made me feel so ashamed, and broken. More than my dad, mom, brother, it even grandmother could. That's when I got rock bottom.

Edit: I wrote this in the comments, but I realise you wouldn't see it. To the man I talked to last night, I'm sorry. My boss blocked you because I told you more about what goes on, but he hasn't found this post yet. It was fun taking to you, and I guess sharks are pretty cool."

Soccer - Varsity Player for 3 years, due to my econ class clashing times i could only take a manager role this year; i took the role of manager, taking stats and analyzing game performance with my coach

Worked as a tutor over summer prior to senior year, i focused on helping 7th and 10th grade kids master english and math concepts including algebra ii, graded assignments and gave them customized feedback sheets, as well as led small group tutoring with SHSAT and SAT kids. i focused a lot on the fundamental work and making sure they understood the underlying concept to each question or topic.

I got a 3 month internship at the mta, something i've always wanted the chance of doing. though i helped out at the bus department not subway, it was still surreal. Did mostly data entry, filing, and organization, but was still a great experience.

Volunteered at a soup kitchen for about a 100 hours and also at a NURSERY for about 80 hours.

i also help my brother at home with his schoolwork and translate for mom and dad.

ed6gvu,10,2019-12-20,I can't believe where my life is at right now,froggysaysno,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ed6gvu/i_cant_believe_where_my_life_is_at_right_now/,"To give a perspective. I'm 21 years old. I'm supposed to be a senior in college finishing up my degree. I'm supposed to be getting internships to companies I want to work for. But instead for the past two years I've been struggling to pass any if not all my classes. 

What makes it even more frustrating is that I wasn't like this. From elementary school till the time I received my associate's degree in computer science,  I was making decent grades. I was a 3.75 - 4.00 student, always on top of my work, and studying my ass off for tests. Nowadays ,I can barely scrape by with a C in a class without a load of assistance. I'm confused???

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME ????

I'm even more upset because,  just yesterday I was talking to my academic advisor about switching my major from computer science to math. We were discussing my recent grades from the previous semester. I was put on academic probation because the semester before the last one, I failed every single one of my classes. I only needed to pass one class with a C or better to get out of academic probation . Which I did. So me and her were discussing future goals for the next semester. I got off the phone with her feeling motivated. Only 24 hours later,  I received an email telling my that I'm no longer part of my degree program and that im a ""non-degree student"". This meant that I can lose my dormitory and I have no access to financial aid until my grades improve. 


I'm currently crying my eyes out because I can't afford to commute to and back from my university because I live 3 hours away. I also left the majority of my stuff in my dorm room. If I'm no longer a full time student,  I can lose everything. My parents don't know about this and I don't want them to. I'm broke and currently not working. It's not like I can afford to pay for this myself. 


I honestly feel like cutting/ killing myself. There's no way out for me. I can't ask for help from anyone because they'll either laugh at me  or think I'm stupid"
ed6iwg,1,2019-12-20,Maybe this will work as some kind of therapy. I need some.,grimmycracker,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ed6iwg/maybe_this_will_work_as_some_kind_of_therapy_i/,"I'm a 21 year old from SoCal. I have been dealing with anxiety for a long time. To keep this as short as possible I'll just talk about the things that make life the hardest for me. Which would be the death of my father.

My parents divorced at a young age, so not seeing my dad all the time was normal. But he was always around and just a phone call away. As I was getting older I was starting to look at my dad differently. I was also seeing him less. He went to prison when I was a teenager and nobody would tell me why back then. When he got out, he was moving from place to place, and he seemed ashamed about his actions and would never talk to me directly about it when I did see him. As a young man, I didn't have the courage to confront my dad about those things. Later on, when I was maybe 15, he found a woman he really fell in love with and she basically took care of him. Him now being a convicted felon, she helped him get a truck, she paid for phone bills, she gave him a home, etc.. she did a lot up until the end. I remember, he was back in prison on my 16th birthday, and she called me on his phone to tell me he was on a business trip and couldn't see me like he promised, but I knew without her telling me he was locked up.

Even tho my dad was in prison a few times over some years, I always respected him as my dad and would want to see him. I could tell in his emotions and body language that he just wanted to be a good example for his kids even if he wasn't at times, and he didn't know how to confront himself. I would go see him at his girlfriend's place every so often and have dinner and spend the evening with him and her family. Everything stayed like this up until last November last year in 2018. Basically out of nowhere, my dad starts texting my brother and me that he his homeless and hungry. He was texting us in a mad rage, text after text, that he needed us to send him money, or beg his girlfriend to put food and clothes out for him. I told him I didn't have any money or a job at the time. He kept texting and trying to call us saying he needed more than what some family had sent him. He was mad desperate. He was saying he didn't feel like we loved him. He was saying he wished he wasn't my father, and that we were nothing to him. I didn't know what to do. He was incredibly angry at me for days, texting me every so often that he was sleeping in his truck, and he was going to kill himself and all this other stuff. I eventually went off on him over text for not being grateful some family had sent him some money and I explicitly explained my years worth of resentment towards him that I could never say to his face and asking him questions like why couldn't he provide for me and my siblings like my mom could? Or why didn't he ever talk to me about his problems? Or why didn't he ever teach me anything? We never held a real conversation after that.

The last time I directly heard from my dad was Christmas day, 2018. I sent him a merry Christmas text that day saying I loved him and he sent me back the middle finger emoji with no words. I asked him ""why the finger?"" and got a response the next morning saying something close to ""Merry Christmas I love you guys"". Throughout the year he tried reaching out a couple times through my mom, since I had a new number and he didn't have it. Neither me or my siblings felt we could see him because of how disrespectful he had acted towards us.

On October 26th, 2019, I was waking up pretty late in the morning. My brother was playing xbox in my bedroom. Things were normal. All of a sudden, my brother answers a phone call and starts pacing frantically around the room. He then hung up the phone, looked me in the face with his eyes shaking and said, ""... our dad's dead."" It was the police who called him. They asked us to come sign off his things because we were his only next of kin. He hung himself in his girlfriend's garage. They were broken up at the time so he actually broke into her home. I felt extreme rage for days after his death. I hated myself for never talking to him. I'm more collected now that it has been some time, but as someone who was already dealing with crippling anxiety, this hit incredibly hard. I felt like it was my own depression and anxiety that led me to not seeing or talking to him.

From going through his phone for a few days after he passed, I saw a lot of myself in him. I think he cleared a lot of things out from it. He even took his passcode off, which seemed intentional. I read texts, saw screenshots, notes, photos, youtube history. I noticed the way he deals with his anxiety is a lot like what I do. He will just quit when something is too much, wether it be a job, or a relationship.

I saw he was also obsessed with his girlfriend, which I saw as something I struggle with too. As I have been going through an insanely hard time dealing with a break up between me and a girl I've loved since I was 17. We were off and on for about 3 years. Then tried getting back together a couple times, and ended on some awful terms towards the beginning of this year. I have fantasized about her everyday since, even in moments where I was hanging out with another girl. And I even find myself thinking about her still just as much as I do my dead father. It's a strange fucking situation.

Life has been really tough on me. I went to trade school and have been working as an unpaid intern, and I'm struggling to find a steady job. With that on top of my challenge of getting over a girl, and my dad's passing, life seems not worth it to me at times and I find myself feeling anxious every night before bed. At first I thought my father's suicide would make me realize I need to change and focus more on my mental health, but dealing with depression is like trying to ram your head against a brick wall, just hoping you will one day break through to the other side.

I've noticed it's a little easier to get out of bed for me now, and I don't think of giving up on life every single day. But it's like every other day. I have like one friend I can actually go to and talk about this with who listens, and it's great having that person, but sometimes you feel like trying things out for relief, and that's what I'm doing here. If there's one person out there who actually read all of this, bless you. Don't be afraid to share your thoughts, I kinda need it right now."

edcfo4,3,2019-12-20,How do you pick a field out of college when your experience is broad?,ProfessionalCarrot9,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/edcfo4/how_do_you_pick_a_field_out_of_college_when_your/,"Hi all. I am about to graduate college in the spring and I have a pretty beefy resume. I have a lot of various skills in multiple different areas but you've all heard the phrase Jack of All Trades, Master of None. Here's an overview:

**Soft Skills:** Innovative Thinking, VERY creative, people management, good listener, strong writer (not reddit posts though because this is a mess), public speaking, very diplomatic, great at analyzing situations, very insightful, great at conflict resolution, professional (I would say more professional and with a deeper understanding of what being professional actually means than a majority of my peers), delegation, problem solving, detail oriented, strong believer in values guided leadership

**Weak Points:** Project management because I get lost in the details; I care a lot about the job I’m doing- to the point of anxiety; I am a perfectionist which causes time management problems; I have social anxiety and while I am great at maintaining professional relationships when there is a power dynamic at play- I have a difficult time making friends at work; I am task-oriented and not relationship oriented which makes professions that rely on networking tough for me; and I though I am good at conflict resolution when I have to be- conflict gives me anxiety.

I am actively working on my weaknesses to eliminate them, but these things take time.

**Deeper Overview:**

My passion is sketch comedy and making video content, but if I’m being honest, I'm not funny. It's something that still needs A LOT of work before I could ever make it a viable career. Compared to my peers, I think I'm pretty skilled at video editing- obviously not anywhere near the level of a professional film or tv editor, but I think I could hack it as a competent assistant editor. The problem here being that that isn't really an entry level job. That field requires years of ""paying your dues"" (working in low level positions and working your way up) which for someone who isn't 100% sure this is my path, makes me nervous about committing to. Also, from a quick browse online, it doesn't look like the pay is too great, capping out at around $40,000.

I am also skilled in Business skills like business administration. I served as the Chief Administrative Officer for my sorority (which had around 300 women in the chapter) and was responsible for maintaining the Bylaws, Membership Records and Paperwork, Scheduling visits and appointments for representatives from Headquarters (basically serving as their personal assistant for around a week to two weeks 5 times a year), managing the elections process, and holding the leadership orientation program. After that, I also held an Administration internship for a local business where I worked with basic coding and google scripts to make a spreadsheet organization system. I know very little coding, but I could probably pick it up without much difficulty, honestly.

Beyond this, I started my own (small) business that placed third in my school's business plan competition and received two grants, and I also received a scholarship because of it. Ultimately, I loved the administration part of it, but I’m not excellent with numbers so I had a lot of difficulty with the accounting side and my business model was also incredibly labor intensive which leads me to believe that that is not a long term job.

I also really loved the marketing side of things and enjoyed making graphics and advertisements for my business. I am skilled with graphic design software, though I’m not an excellent artist by any means. I have held a Brand Representative position for a popular social media app that I will be holding again in the spring, and I will also be a brand representative for a second app concurrently in the spring.

edflgv,0,2019-12-20,In over my head building a website,BallMeBlaziken,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/edflgv/in_over_my_head_building_a_website/,"I am junior in college studying computer science.  I currently work part-time at an internship as a full stack developer.  One of my friends reached out to me saying that some of his family friends wanted to hire someone to building a website for their pawn shop (no transactions would actually be performed on the website).

I have no idea what really goes into a website.  I understand I need a domain service as well as a hosting service for, but I am unsure what I give them.  Am I just creating several intertwined html and css files(which I am relatively proficient in)? Or is there more to it.  Im really not sure what exactly im expected to do.  Do I need to create a database or api along with it or is this all way too deep.  It would be very appreciated if anyone could walk me through this or link some resources.

Is there a standard way of organizing the files for a website (literally like specific directories etc.), kinda analogous to how in some class projects weed keep all our code in src, compile it to bin and store libraries in lib.

Lastly, how much should I charge for something like this, I mostly want to do it for the experience but some money would be nice for my time."

edgk7w,3,2019-12-20,Why are pointers important in C/C++ [Interview Question] ?,thesquarerootof1,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/edgk7w/why_are_pointers_important_in_cc_interview/,"Hi guys,

I just graduated as a computer engineer and I've been having a very frustrating job search even though I have an internship from a well known tech company and a good GPA under my belt. As a lot of you know, interview questions can be pretty tough.


Anyway, I had one interview question over the phone in where I was asked ""what are pointers and why are they important ?"" Here was my answer:


Pointers are variables that point to a memory address. They are important because when you create functions, you can not only change the references of the variables but also the values themselves. For example, if I create a swap function and not use pointers, the references would only change, if I were to use pointers, then the values would also change themselves as well...


    void swap(int[] arr, int &amp;a, int &amp;b) { //example why pointers are important
    
      int temp = arr[a];
      arr[a] = arr[b];
      arr[b] = temp;
    
    }


Well, there was my shitty answer. I received a rejection from this company even though I asked them if I got most of the technical questions right and the interviewer said yes. However when I got the rejection, they did not say which questions I did get wrong. I'm trying to analyze to see which questions I got wrong and my pointer answer is a suspect.


So, what is the proper way to answer this question ? Am I wrong here ? If you are interviewing a candidate, would you accept this answer ? Why or why not ?"

My university holds bi-annual career-fairs, but I live quite a ways from school and most of the employers are local (I drive 1.5hrs+ to campus every day) so my work commute would be pretty nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated spring 2019 with a Computer Science degree from a California State School and started applying in August due to the fact that I was traveling. I have no CS work experience, no internships. My senior project is the closest thing I have to that, and I make sure to go in depth on it during interviews. I get maybe 2 interviews per 100 applications. I am a generally a well-liked sociable person and the few in person interviews I get, I show up clean-cut, well dressed and able to answer most of their questions.

I've done plenty of HR phone screenings, and I am always able to hold a conversation and they seem to enjoy talking to me, hearing about my experience and learning about me - but I only move forward maybe 30% of the time. Maybe there is something about my resume that appeals to HR but not hiring mangers? Ive done 3 phone screenings this week, moved on with one.

Technical Interviews - These are what I have been practicing the most, as it seems like every company is going the leetcode style especially since i'm in the Bay Area. Even thought I can program and build applications, I fail these constantly. A lot of times they ask me about things not on my resume or things Ive never heard of or been taught in school. Amazon asked me to write JQuery scripts when Ive never worked with it before. I have been doing multiple problems a day, I can do a lot of the 'easy' ones, few 'mediums' but no 'hards'.

I apply to 20+ jobs a day through Indeed, LinkedIn and StackOverFlow. I apply to any sort of company, I dont care about Big N or whatsoever, my only preference is that I stay in the Bay Area. I have also tried to apply to government jobs through CalCareers with no luck. I apply to all sorts of positions, Full Stack, Back End, Front End, General Software Engineering, QA, Product Management, Data Analyst, Data Science, Data Engineering.... No luck.

I am looking for all sorts of advice, positive/negative appreciated. Rough me up lol

If any clarification on my situation is need please ask

Yale SCEA (**Accepted**)

RD: Harvard (TBD), Stanford (TBD), Columbia (TBD)

Also got into my state UNI w/ a full ride but I would rather not share the name due to privacy reasons (had an internship here so would like to stay lowkey)

Just want to mention I had safeties but after Yale SCEA there are few places I would even consider over Yale (hence the short list)

# Demographics:

African American male from Midwest, uncompetitive public school, Low Middle Class but second gen

# Intended Major:

I applied as computer science intended but if I end up attending Yale I will probably dual major in Comp sci/econ. Talked about my interest in the dual major in my Why Yale supp

# Academics:

Current courseload is: Ap Literature/composition, AP Statistics, AP Calc BC,  AP Government &amp; politics, AP Computer Science Principles (school doesn't offer anything higher), Spanish, and AP Biology (Just took finals maintained a 4.0 uw this sem)

Class Rank: Top 3%, 7/457 if I remember correctly

Reflection: Freshman year didn't really have a plan in mind so I thought it would be okay to not have a perfect 4.0, cleaned up my act and my GPA improved as my courseload got more difficult.

GPA 3.87 UW 4.35 W

# Statistics:

ACT: 33 | 34 Super 

# Awards: 

A lot of my awards were fairly negligible and I believe this was the weakest part of my application

FBLA National Qualifier (11)

Got second place in a statewide stockmarket challenge, 69 total teams competed

# Extracurriculars

(This is in order of how I placed them on the common app)

Paid research internship at flagship state UNI: Summer after Junior year. Worked on an electrical engineering project and presented findings at a research seminar. Didn't receive any publications

Compsci Internship at Local Non-Profit: Summer after Junior year.  Worked on mobile application programming &amp; gave a presentation at the end of the summer. I continued this work throughout the year, trying to get a publication right now actually. 

Played Varsity soccer 11/12. Played but not at the varsity level 9,10

Future Business Leaders of America VP 11/12

Orchestra 9,10,11

I listed more things on the common app but they were fairly negligible (think tutoring)

# MISC

LOR: Good relationship w/ both teachers but if I were to guess what they were:

Physics teacher: 7.5/10

Lang Teacher 8/10

Interview: Went well. It was over the phone so kinda weird I guess. Lol I don't know what else to say

# Reflection

While I believe being an African American from the midwest definitely helped, what I (and many friends) believe got me in was my essays. Personally I'm not the best writer but I believe my common app essay revealed a lot about me to the AO's and presented myself in a way that reflected my personality. I don't feel comfortable sharing them through PMs yet (RD coming up and all) but I can give a brief synopsis over what it was about.

Synopsis: I talked about how coming from an immigrant household I didn't really understand a lot of concepts like investing so I taught myself to trade stocks. Mentioned that I had the stereotypical image of an old white man as a stock trader and learning to trade was my rite of passage into a world of opportunities I didn't think were meant for me as an African American. Talked about combatting stereotypes and how my successes/failures trading shaped my work ethic. If you want to read my essays then pm me and I can send them after rd, I doubt anyone wants to wait that long though lmao. 

Might be forgetting something so if you have any questions just ask

Edit: Thanks for the congratulations"

ediofl,1,2019-12-20,A piece of advice,Granllop,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/ediofl/a_piece_of_advice/,"Hello guys, this is my first thread in Reddit in spite of having been reading you for a long time. I will describe my case a bit and eventually I will ask some questions. I hope my writing is good enough so the reading followed thoroughly! Feel free to ask any questions below or demand more information in order to make a proper statement.

I am a last year student of a Double Major in Business Administration and Law in a Spanish average school (not target) and I have 7/10 marks (mediocre-average). I have combined the 5 years of studies with a part-time job at my parents' business which is related to real estate deals and some investments.
Without making a resume of the thread, I have always been interested in finances so I started investing a long time ago. I wanted to structure all this knowledge and leverage it, so I took the CFA Level I exam two weeks ago.
In the next February, I will make an exchange with Universidad del Pacífico in Peru (which is supposed to be one of the bests of South America) where I will end my studies in July. 
I had an important role in the university creating an event related to Fintech which gathered dozens of attendees, one internship in Private banking (bulge bracket bank) and a summer job in Banco Santander.


Problems I am facing:
My marks are not that great and it seems that even if it was due to other obligations and focuses in things that could be more useful in the job field, it plays a major rule as a cuter of many good internships or junior work opportunities. 
I have no relevant internships in the sector.

I know that some of you will tell me to keep trying and this is what I am going to do, no matter the circumstances. But I would like to know your opinion of my profile: what could I strengthen or if there is something I am missing..? In which countries you perceive I could have better chances?
By the end, I have not still decided if I want a consulting -&gt; industry path or a pure banking-related (corporate finance and PE eventually). Are transitions that difficult between industries? In which industry do you feel more odds for me? I would like to both learn a lot and eventually make a kind of ""impact"" and I do not feel dismissing anything...

During my puberty, I was fond of sciences but eventually chose another career path. At the moment, I am willing to have some work experience before taking a master, but I am starting to plan it. I believe that most of the masters can be redundant and that perhaps, watching and the trends, it would be useful to pursue a computer science one: I have an intermediate knowledge of R and I am introducing C programming every evening; step by step. I do not want to become a quant, nor a coder. However, I do believe that programming and IT will become more and more important to most of the jobs and eventually, the ones that do not know anything about it, will be ""illiterates"". 
Do you think it would be advised?

Eventually, as a Spanish, my main focus is in Europe without despising any other region. I am not fluent in any other language and one day I would like to work in Spain (talking about a 20 years future). In Spain Portuguese is becoming quite important because of Iberoamerican relationships and because many companies blend the Spanish and Portuguese area into on directive...
On the other hand, French is also perceived as important, and many places in Europe use it on a daily basis, especially upper rent countries (Switzerland, Luxembourg...). Which language would you learn?


Thank you to all that have read until down here!"

Wanted to work in the field before I committed to a graduate degree but after realizing now much of the market prefers a graduate degree.

Should I emphasize more on my school experience since my programming knowledge is only involved there? 

My biggest weakness right now is narrowing my resume down. The shortest I've been able to get it is 4 pages. That's including my IT analyst internship, my full time IT job, and all of the skills acquired from my three associates degrees (AS, AA, and then AAS in programming) and my Bachelors in IT.

Possible Destination Countries: China, Taiwan, Korea, Hungary, Romania, Germany, Estonia, Turkey (the bot keeps saying I'm not listing them, there you go)


I am currently on track to graduate with a Bachelors degree in political science (barring failure of my thesis defense) and am heavily considering a move abroad. The vast majority of my work in undergrad has focused on state development, and I'd like to live in the areas that I've studied (Middle East, Eastern Europe/Former Soviet Union, East Asia) in order to gain language knowledge and get out of the US for a bit. DC is too toxic for my taste, as much as I enjoy the friends I've made I just don't know about living here for more than a year after graduation.

I have about 45k in student loan debt at an under 5% interest rate. I'd prefer to pay it off rather than see it grow. The simplest solution for most in my position (or seemingly the quickest?) is to teach English abroad in some East Asian country. I'm okay with this. If it means I can throw money at my loans and pay them mostly down or off within a year or two and live comfortably while doing so, that would be great. The debt honestly feels like a shackle, and while I do have programming experience (5-6 classes, mostly in web and mobile development) I'm hesitant at applying to more jobs because it feels like I can't get abroad without a specific Computer Science degree.

Eastern Europe broadly comes to mind, in large part, not just because its a region I've studied throughout my time in college but I have family in the region. I'd rather not see them, we're not close in terms of a relationship, but I do have a family connection there. I know they'd at least let me sleep on the couch for a week if it came to that. Given that I have taken a few courses in programming and had a programming related internship, my thought process is to basically apply to remote jobs or get tech work in-region and work from there. If I can earn at least 30k USD/yr, I think I can comfortably save up and spend down on my student loans. When talking with a friend in Latvia he said I could earn possibly 24k USD/yr and live in Riga as a programmer, but that seems way too low of a salary. When talking to a colleague on my internship, I was told 28k-30k is normal in the US for recent graduates- considering the benefits of living in the EU I'd take a 4k drop in base salary if that's what I'd be starting out with.

My biggest hurdle in all of this, and another reason for wanting to leave, is that I can't drive due to a visual impairment. This means that while yes, I can live in major US cities, the CoL vs the benefits I'd receive unless I'm in a specific field are kinda moot. Unless I'm in some high paying field, like tech or finance, it feels like I can kiss that dream of living in (insert major city) goodbye. I need to be able to walk, bike, or take public transport to work, and much of the US just doesn't have that on a fundamental level. I do not have an EU citizenship but am able to procure one, my immediate family member refuses to send in the paperwork and keeps asking me to do it for them (as if the consulate would take it...).

Aside from teaching English, I've considered for whatever reason going the digital nomad route and setting up shop in Turkey. I don't know why, but Istanbul has always seemed like an amazing city to visit. Maybe not live there, but visiting and doing work online couldn't be that bad if I can secure work. If I could find an NGO to work with in the region, all the better.

Chiefly what I'd like to hash out is whether A) I'm making a good financial decision here, B) whether it's even possible, and C) whether I'd be better off sticking it out in the US for a few years to try and find some work somewhere. As of now my folks are living in a super rural area of the country with seasonal employment and it's killing me inside since whenever I'm home with them I literally can go weeks without leaving the property.

TL;DR: About to graduate college, unsure whether I should (or even can) leave for NGO work or tech work abroad. English teaching is much more sure of a bet. Not sure if financially it makes sense given my student loan debt which I am ravenous to pay off. I have an intermediate understanding of Mandarin, would be open to teaching English for a year or two if it could take some pressure off things and possibly lead to a good career (after I leave English teaching), and have experience in programming (was on track to get a minor before requirements got fundamentally altered). Ideally by 25-26, barring health concerns with my parents, I want to be set up to live abroad permanently."

My ECs are pretty decent: I did a sport for 4 years; intern to code an app for farmers to help with water conservation; ambassador of Arizona Youth Climate Strike - published their website and had an interview with PBS; Vice President of French Honors Society; One of two high school volunteers at hospital's IT Department; Volunteer at financially struggling library; Youtube filmer and editor and some weaker stuff like NHS.

My essays will be PRETTY GOOD but I am not sure if they will be STELLAR.

So I am currently a CS major at a T20 CS school and I just had some questions regarding how to get my foot in the door when it comes to internships.

So, I came into college with very little coding experience so I'm not expecting to get an internship this upcoming summer. With that being said, I would like to dedicate the summer to teaching myself some skills that would attract the eyes of internship recruiters. 

What kind of skills/technologies would you guys recommend me learning to boost my resume?

So far in school, we've been learning Java and I have been teaching myself some react and even made a simple web app using the Spotify API (I also have a couple of small projects using raspberry pi).

How should I approach things when I do personal projects? I have 3-4 relatively simple projects but nothing super outstanding. Should I focus on doing one ""big"" project or just keep doing a myriad of small things?

Overall, any advice on how I could take my skills to the next level would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!!"

Also, if there are any programs or internships that would be fitting for me. For reference, I live very close to Princeton University. 

Also, I see myself as some sort of STEM major in college.

**Academics:**

I am in all honors classes with 2 AP Classes. (Physics and CSP) Overall, I am not very worried about my academics since I think that they will be strong.

**Sports:**

I am on both track and tennis which I will definitely be varsity by senior year. (I will likely be in varsity tennis much sooner)

**Extracurriculars:**

DECA: I have my regional competition in the first week of January but I think I did well on the regional test. This club is very big in our school, but I would be able to get a leadership position when I am an upperclassman.

Model UN: I have had 3 competitions one being a national conference. I won an outstanding delegate at a local conference but I had no luck with my 2 other conferences. I am going to a few other national competition this year, and I think in the future I can start to win awards. I will very likely be president of this club because the teacher really likes me.

Math Club: Pretty default. We go to local competitions after school every two weeks. This club does not assign leadership positions to my knowledge (I could be wrong)

Debate Club: We participate in policy debates on the local level. However, my main focus in the debate is that I participate in Public Forum debate on the national level. I go to national tournaments such as Harvard, Princeton, Yale, UPenn, etc. I think that I will be able to win the most awards in this activity. 

NJ Science League: This starts in January. We do competitive exams in science in the first week of every month. If you score well you get a prize.

Over the summer, I plan to do volunteering at a local hospital where I would just help doctors and patients. 

I am also planning to start a nonprofit to help underrepresented groups learn public speaking since that is an important skill in the world today. (I think that this aligns with my interest in debate)

I know that extracurriculars are the most important part in the admissions process nowadays so I want to be prepared. Do you guys have any suggestions of anything that I should do? My greatest worry is that some of my extracurriculars such as debate and MUN do not align with my intended major of STEM. Will this hurt my chances?"

So I am a CS student currently taking a year off from uni due to financial hardships, but in the meantime, I work as a junior software engineer at a good tech company in my country. My work at the moment mainly consists of front end development, plus some cross-platform app development using react-native. I really don't want to be solely a front end developer. I am studying backend a lot more right now, but I'm more so or less transitioning to full-stack. So I have goals that somewhat contradict each other: 

* I want to work in interesting stuff and actually feel like I'm making a contribution, not working on one small-time feature for like a year or so
* I want to work at FANG due to the fact I'm just curious about the hype and I wanna see how far can I go working corporally.
* I most likely will get bored with the corporal life, so I wanna create interesting shit that will bring me a source of income. (that's why I'm leaning on full-stack development)
* I wanna learn more about the big picture both technically and at the business side of software development.

As I'm pretty much forced to go back to university next due to my parent's being very unhappy with this year off, but it's been the best decision of my life. Being surrounded but developers a lot better than me and basically making money by learning stuff I like is pretty nice, but I wanna do bigger stuff in the future abroad. As I'm technically a future second-year student I still got some time for internships and stuff. I'm really confused, do I specialise in a very specific niche or be more of a generalist?

And if your so kind, I got 2 more questions:

* Why is web-dev looked down upon? 
* Why are most job/internships posting on fang or in general people call themselves Software Engineers? IMO that's very vague description. As I do front end development and a little bit more, am I a web developer or a software engineer? At this point, I just carry on with the title software engineer as it only sounds better than being called web developer.

Thanks a lot.

Merry Christmas and have a new year, may we all end the leetcode grind and achieve our dreams."

I am a first-year student in Toronto. I am trying to secure a job for the upcoming summer and I am having a quite a lot of anxiety over it. Here is basically what I've tried and done so far:

* My first search was for internships in my field, Computer Science. I immediately ruled that out after looking at several job descriptions, which were clearly meant for upper year students.
* I then decided to try out retail. I was going to apply to EB Games but haven't completed my cover letter yet. Also, a large amount of job postings require previous retail experience, ruling me out
* I have also considered in-university jobs, such as a support assistant, but I was intimidated by the duties/responsibilities.
* Lastly, I have considered tutoring. There are several job postings for that that fit me, but I still feel intimidated by the requirements

So far, retail and the in-university jobs are my main priority. However, I am still stressed out, questioning what I would do if I don't get any jobs lined up. My question is how can I overcome this anxiety and become confident in getting a job?"

I applied for many SWE positions but this was the only interview I got and I just don't know why it was so hard to even get interviewed. So I gave it my best and the whole thing nearly tore me apart. During the interviews, I was super nervous and failed to answer few questions I could have. But the recuiter somehow showed me mercy and gave me the chance.

Actually, I am quite interested in infrastructure and computer systems (more  than implementing product features), so I want to take the internship and the possible career as SRE seriously. I have been thinking of what I can do in the following year so that I can handle the internship (and beyond) there properly. I should have asked such questions during the Q&amp;As of the interviews, but literally I was too nervous and did not think I could make it . I just came here for days and I think it's a good place to look for advices (or it's just that you guys/gals have yet to show your mean sides xD). I 've done some searching and here are some of my ideas:

1. Practice programming in python. I mainly code with C++ and know a little about python. This position may require writing scripts and I think it's a good idea to pick up some python skills.

2. Review concepts in computer networking. I have forgot most things about networks and books like tcp/ip illustrated may help with that, or are there any better idea?

3. Learn courses about Docker and Kubernetes. I found that containers are important in production environment, so I guess I can learn to use it first. (e.g. from this [docker course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/?LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;ranMID=39197&amp;ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-wAu_VXQI9mWphgfkn7c0TA)).

4. Continue with leetcode in case production engineer is not the thing for me and keep a plan B.

This is just the brain storming phase, so I may literally benefit from any sort advice from you guys/gals. Many thanks!!"

I learned how to use version control, unit/integration testing(concept), migration of DLL and fixing the bugs that come along and a lot of research on nuget packages. The reason why my boss terminated me was cause lack of attention to details(he wasn’t wrong).  But I was not doing it purposely it was because i couldn’t understand it was just a huge chunk of knowledge to swallow.

I’ve been extremely fortunate in receiving two internship offers for 2020 after religiously applying since the beginning of the semester. However, these two unfortunately conflict, and I wanted to hear your advice because I didn't anticipate this and also don’t know what to do.

**For context:** Company A is a 10-week out of state summer opportunity for a career path I've been interested in for some time, while Company B is a year-round finance/accounting internship. I received Company A's offer a month before Company B and accepted already because at the time, I only had 2 days to sign + I wasn't sure if I was going to hear back from my other applications (also I really wanted to confirm if that career path was for me).

However, Company B just emailed an offer with a time sensitive deadline, and I understand it would also be an invaluable opportunity since I'd be able to experience business functions throughout the year instead of only summertime.

Do you guys think it’s possible to somehow do both? (Ex. Ask Company B to work spring, end of summer, and fall while taking 10 weeks off during summer to work at Company A). Or will I need to narrow and decide on one offer?:\\ I'm afraid if I renege Company A's offer that they may not accept any of my applications in the future.

Overall, it’s been overwhelming over the past few days in making a decision and I just wanted to hear some additional insight. Thank you for your time reading this!"

edw3qz,5,2019-12-21,How to write an extension letter for internship offer due to waiting for another potential offer.,grunkfist,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/edw3qz/how_to_write_an_extension_letter_for_internship/,"I got an offer for a summer internship to MW as a software engineer and it's a great offer, higher salary than any other internship I've gotten in the past, or offer that I've ever received in my 2 years at college. I still have a year to go to finish so this will probably be my last internship before a full time job.

MW wants my response answer in 10 more days. Meanwhile I got a response from the big G saying they will give me their response within the next 17 days. With the G I don't even have a solid concrete yes or no. I aced all 4 coding rounds and phone-screens and behavioral interviews. The wording on their letter looked like they really like me and are eager to get me in and I feel I would work for them even if their salary is much less because they are only 1 hour commute from where I live with my parents. In my culture we *generally* live with parents until we get married. Meanwhile MW is 3 states away and I'd have to rent an apartment and buy a car for commute and food etc, which I of course can do but I'm speaking strictly about money savings and convenience/comfort.

So I wrote a letter to G and they responded that they cannot expedite their response by Jan 1 to meet the deadline of MW and they suggested that I consider writing a letter to MW asking them to extend their deadline. No problem, I did that a year ago in a previous internship between two other companies. The difference here is I had two offers and needed time to consider which to take, but in this year's case although I feel confident I'll be accepted by G, I don't truthfully have a concrete answer and I don't want to lie saying that I have another offer. How do I word the letter to MW asking for more time if all I'm really waiting for is an offer? It seems unethical to do this.

Some added info, MW is in Massachusetts which is a cold state where I don't have any family or friend, nor would I prefer to live here in the future for a permanent position but I will if that's all I get. With G, they are about the most well-known prestigious companies to work for in software engineering so it would be a great resume boost to list all the things I learn from them as well as their track record for having a good salary to leverage with any future offers, as well as to me one of the most important reasons that I live so close and is an easy commute while living with parents. I'm really looking for how to word the letter asking for more time even though I don't have another offer to consider."

Team A:

A tools and performance team where they build various iOS, MacOS and full stack Web applications to verify functionality for new features. Work varies a lot and there’s big exposure to new technologies all the time. They don’t know if they would have a spot for me post internship but will help me interview with other teams if that’s the case.

Team B:
an embedded team where you work with niche protocols for other engineers to work with, and write system level code that goes into vehicles and write a lot of tests to verify functionality. The skills are quite niche and the work doesn’t touch the internet. They’ve offered their past 3 interns full time positions and according to the manager everyone loves being on the team.

I’m inclined to join team A because they work with much more transferable skills and also not niche technologies despite the higher chance of being hired as a full time. I value job security a lot (international student with sponsorship needs) but I also really want to get my CS career off on a good start with lots of relevant skills rather than niche technologies.

As a perpetually single insecure sadboy with low self-esteem, I wanted to be that too.

So I decided to double major, pursue my research passions, and hit the gym as much as possible. This semester, I took 2 engineering classes from each major, and 1 humanities course. I took 2 of the hardest classes from one major, and 2 of the easier classes from the other, and 1 easy breath course. I also set up an exercise routine and hit the gym around 3-4 days a week. Those 2 hard classes ended up being really fucking hard and I had to sink 30-40 hrs a week on them alone. I also joined a demanding research project and I basically spent my weekends on that. I managed to get the attention of a recruiter at a prestigious software company and she gave me an interview. Unfortunately, I bombed that interview and didn't even make it to second round. Those 3 easy classes? Not very easy once my brain got fried by those hard classes. I started missing/ half assing assignments due to my brain burning out and missing participation points due to pulling all nighters finishing labs for computer architecture. Social life already went out the window by this point, and I didn't see my friends very much. I spent a lot of time doing psets for the first hard class but still failed the midterms because the class was so fucking hard. I started getting insomnia due to anxiety (I used to knock out easily). I even started getting weird digestion problems. Finals week rolled around and I basically lived in the libraries. I even slept there some nights trying to turn in a final paper, extra credit hw to make up for my earlier fuck ups, final projects, and redoing psets to study for finals. 

Fast forward to today, I didn't do well on the final for that hard class despite spending a plurality of my waking hours on it and cranking out that extra credit problem set. I haven't exercised in 2 weeks and I can feel my arms and pecs getting smaller and my belly getting bigger. I still don't have an internship offer, and I'm still heading into 2020 single. 

I'll probably spend Christmas break writing a paper for my research project so I can have something to show to grad schools. My parents are probably gonna call me lazy for my grades, and the professor I do research for is probably gonna think I'm dumb since I didn't do well in the class he himself teaches. At least I finally get to see my friends since I'm no longer holed up in the lab or the library.

TL;DR: Tried to be a god, found out I was only a man. If I didn't have any mental issues before, I'm pretty damn close to having mental issues now. Also, I'm still single, sad, no internship, and my self esteem is shittier than ever. At least I'm turning 21 :D"

ee15zf,826,2019-12-22,"What I wish I knew, A retrospective",fakintheid,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ee15zf/what_i_wish_i_knew_a_retrospective/,"Hi Guys. I have been programming for about 7 years and professionally for about 3. Im still very much learning. Over the years I have kept this list of pointers and such just to reflect back on what I have learned and what I would do differently. I figured I would share it here. Any feedback is appreciated! The basic gist of the whole thing is. I have learned how to learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first started to program I went through many phases. At first you get that IV hit of “Hello, World!” and you feel like a god among men, no longer bound to the same plane of existence of plebs who just use their computer. “wow is it really this easy? I know what I’m doing.” you *think*. 

Then things get a little more complex, you start learning about variables, primitive data types, looping, parsing input and maybe error handling. Quickly you realize just how little you know. It seems daunting, every time you try to write code it seems like you go through the five stages of depression. If that's not enough you start getting introduced to things like object oriented programming, all of it makes sense but you’re not really sure why those things would be THAT helpful, it all gets more confusing. That being said, stick it out and eventually there will be a moment where it all clicks, every programmer I know has said they experienced the click or a series of small clicks that cascaded into an understanding of the fundamentals. Unfortunately after that click you realize how you know even less than you initially thought. I have laid out some tips, tricks, and words of wisdom that I wish I had known during my journey to becoming a software engineer. I have laid it out into three stages (There are more stages but I am still a noob): 

* Greenling, when you’re just starting to stretch the fingers and learn the basics. 
* Advanced Beginner/Hobbyist, you’re competent enough to really screw things up. You can contribute to some open source projects without getting the nerd herd chewing you out. You would be able to get an internship or pass an entry level coding interview.
* Enterprise, You have a job as a developer and can pull your own weight. But remember there is always room to improve. 

**Greenling**

1. Practice every day. 
2. Understand that you’re not going to be making the next facebook right off the bat, realistically you’re going to be reversing strings and sorting numbers.
3. Find someone who can work with you when you get stuck.
4. Get an introduction book and do the exercises at the end of chapters. Try to pick books that focus on fundamentals and avoid books that try to introduce you to UI’s. 
5. After you finish the book go back through the exercises and see if you can do it without reading the chapters. Rinse and repeat. 
6. Avoid using IDE’s when possible. It makes your life more difficult but you'll learn more.
7. Don’t just copy and paste code. Understand what you’re doing. If you don’t understand, ask.
8. If you ask a question to someone and don’t understand their answer, ask again, change the way you ask the question until you understand their answer. 
9. Don’t start out learning with something like Android or IOS programming. They have fancy features that you’ll just have to accept at face value unless you understand what is going on under the hood. 
10. Start with a verbose language like Java because there is less ambiguity. Everything needs to be explicitly written out. No frills or magic.
11. Don’t try to sell anyone anything yet, you’ll over promise and under deliver. 
12. You’re going to stay in this stage for about a year. 

**Advanced Beginner/Hobbyist**

1. Practice every day.
2. Start to do personal projects that can be completed within a week, be realistic. 
3. Don’t be afraid of the command line, it’s vital. 
4. Learn how to use Git.
5. Try new programming languages.
6. Learn to RTFM(Read The Fucking Manual) you’d be amazed at what you can learn by just reading the manual.
7. Stack overflow is an excellent resource but avoid copying and pasting code you don’t understand.
8. Learn to conform to the coding style of the project(such as { on the same line as the function name vs the next line down)
9. When contributing to an open source project realize that people can be very opinionated and will tear you to shreds over a space vs a tab.  
10. Be wary of people who think they know everything and use big confusing terms when trying to explain something simple. If it feels like they are talking down to you, they probably are. Remember that “Algorithm” is just a fancy word for “A step by step solution to a problem in a finite number of steps.” immutable just means non changing.
11. Feel free to reinvent the wheel just because you can. Rewrite a JSON parser, write your own socket server. Break things.
12. Try your hardest to understand object oriented programming. Learn the four pillars. Try to apply them in your personal projects. 
13. Learn how to unit test.
14. Don’t pick a programming language because it's what you know. Most languages can do almost any task. Learn how to choose the right programming language for the job. Don’t use a drill when you need a hammer.
15. Expect to stay in this stage for a 2 or 3 years.

**Enterprise**

1. I called this one enterprise because it sounds fancy. You will quickly find that there are buzzwords being thrown around left and right in the professional world. People are only trying to sound smart or impress management who doesn't know any better. 
2. Learn from your senior team members. Try to take things on that are over your head. 
3. Do not reinvent the wheel at work. Save that for personal projects.
4. Test your code. Nobody likes to get woken up at 3AM because your crappy code failed. 
5. Systems in the corporate world are not beautiful, the are all strung together with digital duck tape. You would be horrified to see the code that runs many critical systems.
6. Never stop learning or you’ll find your skills are out of date.
7. Only do the 5 things that have the highest value. Throw out all the ideas that aren’t awesome. Don’t do something because you “may need it”.
8. Follow ubiquitous standards if there are any. Stuff like 3rd normal form for database design and the frameworks design guidelines from Microsoft for C# code. We are not special. We’re not awesome. We need to get advice from people that really are. Go find the best and follow them.
9. Keep it simple in all that you do. Fight to get rid of all features and have 0 code if you can. If you have 100 lines of code try to make it 50, etc. Build a bicycle, not a space shuttle unless you really need to get to space.
10. Keep your junk loosely coupled – Don’t have a lot of wide scope state, parameters, etc.
11. Keep your libraries, classes and functions cohesive, in short this means they should do one thing, and one thing well.
12. If you can’t find ubiquitous standards then follow prior art. Do things like everyone else is doing them.
13. Understand that there is much more to being a programmer than just writing code. You need to be able to communicate with business partners, gather requirements, come up with flexible solutions for ever changing requirements.
14. You will be expected to provide timeframes and estimates (see the last point in this chain) but you will only be right 30% of the time.  That’s okay.
   1. When talking to technical people, they understand you are making an educated guess and any timeframe or expected approach is subject to change as more unknowns are discovered.
   2. Unknowns (unknown factors) are normal.  If you have to give a timeframe for a project with several unknown factors, don’t be afraid to call them out as you provide a timeframe… then don’t be afraid to push the deadline back when an unknown makes that timeframe unrealistic.
   3. Anyone who tries to take punitive action against you when you extend a timeframe discussed in a and b does not understand the technical aspect and is likely unwilling to learn.  Avoid having these people as managers or product owners. This is also a great interview question: “How does your team handle a developer who is unable to meet a deadline?”
15. This stage is also when you start to figure out what you need to know in order to learn what you don’t know; you are able to pinpoint what you need to learn or know in order to move beyond this stage and into the ranks of the Eternal Neck Beard."

I've been programming for more than eight years now, and school just isn't working for me, since I've researched most of the material in higher level courses before. It's expensive and I'm not learning anything. My plan is to apply for a computer science job to build up some money, before eventually starting a serious business. Unfortunately, I'm not getting offers when interviewing for software engineering jobs. I'm told it's a lack of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**The thing is, I have a lot of personal projects including:**

\- Various game related work. (Game Development, Modding, Design, etc)

\- Writing a scripting language bytecode compiler + runtime.

\- Reverse engineering MIPS assembly code of PlayStation+N64 games into C.

\- Network applications and database solutions. (Both creating my own database software and using pre-built ones like MariaDB, MongoDB, etc)

\- Hacking, CTF, Cybersecurity-related stuff.

\- Video Editing and writing scripts for popular Youtubers.

\- Hardware projects like buying and putting together off the shelf electronics parts, working with microcontrollers, etc.

\- Creating software which renders and allows for modifications to 3D map models for an old game.

These are some highlights I've picked to show how broad my experience is, but more importantly, how I teach myself to research and learn any tool, skill, or technology I need to do a certain task.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the Seattle area, so I've been able to apply to a lot of the big tech companies here, with the most recent one being Microsoft. Unfortunately, my feedback for why I don't get offers goes along the lines of ""lack of experience"". This is hard, I tried internships, I have experience with tiny companies (2-4 employees) and my own personal projects, but I'm not sure what to do. I think my personal projects showcase my abilities more than enough, not to mention I keep up to date with new technologies like WebAssembly, GraphQL, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is, where should my expectations be? I've been mostly focusing on big companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, even smaller but still large places like Starbucks. I've also done TripleByte.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of the possible reasons I think I might not be getting offers:**

\- My expectations are too high, and I shouldn't be expecting to be hired by the largest tech companies on the planet.

\- Maybe I'm not interviewing well. I'm not sure, I generally leave interviews a lot more confident than when I go in, and I think I interview fairly well. However, I could also be interviewing poorly and not know it. For instance, maybe I'm not communicating very well why I'm a good candidate or what my strengths are. I think this is definitely possible.

\- Biases. I'm way younger than the people interviewing me. I honestly don't know how likely this is, but I'd probably consider it not super likely, but not impossible.

\- Maybe it's like this for everyone and I just need to keep pushing through.

\- Am I just getting unlucky?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really have a well defined question of what I'm looking for in responses, but basically I want to hear your thoughts on this situation. Do you think I might be mistaken on anything? Do you have any tips? Should I be applying to smaller companies before places like Microsoft? Thank you for your time =)"

I have a one year internship experience where I mainly worked in Excel but apart from that I taught myself SQL, Python and now trying to get some hands-on with Tableau, PowerBI, etc.

I have been applying for 3 months now but have only been able to land one interview and absolutely nothing else and it's very demotivating.

I have 2.5 years to go, so I guess I am technically a sophomore, but I have only taken CS 1 and there was not a lot of depth in that class, so I learned to create a basic web app using bottle, html/css/js, sqlite, and I spiced it up myself with some bootstrap/jquery.

I have no motivation for side projects even though I have a few on my resume already, but they arent great. My girlfriend works full time and has a school aged daughter that breaks fall on where mine are approximately. We have 1 car as well. The job that I would get would be half going to childcare, other portion of it going to transportation because where we are public transit isn't really an option.

I guess what I am trying to say is that we are hurting for money, and I would like to earn some while I am on my breaks and possibly alongside my coursework when school kicks up again. I would work an internship locally no matter the childcare/transportation costs just for the experience of working there, but I have not heard back from any I have applied to.

Do you guys have any ideas how I can use my computer skills/programming skills to gain even a little money on breaks? Even a few hundred in a month would make a huge difference. (I would prefer programming gigs, but on the hardware side of tech I have my A+ cert from a few years ago and have experience working tech support/jr sys admin).

ee935f,3,2019-12-22,i’m scared of my friend and I don’t know how to cut ties (I pay his rent). Help me!,meee-uuuh,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ee935f/im_scared_of_my_friend_and_i_dont_know_how_to_cut/,"(This is my first post on reddit ever lol. The short version of the story is at the end)

Hello ppl reading this,

My name is Maria (22, F) and I have a very toxic friendship with a guy (21) named Carlos. English isn’t my first language, so maybe there will be some misspelled words. Sorry. 

For you to understand why ending this friendship is so hard, you need to know his backstory. Mother died when he was around 10, grandma died when he was 16. His dad is a major jerk and never cared about him. Actually, the dad tried to murder him once, which is awful. After his grandma died, he lived with his uncle for 2 years. When he turned 18, the uncle basically threw him on the street and said he couldn’t live there anymore. We’re brazilian, so we don’t have the culture of leaving home to go to college. The campuses doesn’t have dorms, so during college we live at home. He was basically homeless, living with the money his mother and grandmother saved for him. After living with a friend of his mom for a while, Carlos found a place to live, sharing a house with a lot of people. It was hard, the people who lived there didn’t respect privacy and were really messy. 

That’s when I met him in 2017. I was Christian and in my house we used to have a church group thing on Thursdays nights. He was friends with a friend, so he came and told his story. We instantly became close, which made my boyfriend very uncomfortable, not because my bf is a jealous and toxic guy (he’s actually adorable and is never jealous of anyone), but because Carlos was very touchy-feely, which is something I personally HATE. I was always trying to make sure he respected my personal space, which was hard in the beginning. After a while, he understood and stoped being like this.

The real problem started a few months ago. He wanted to move from the place he was living and didn’t have money. He’s a intern in a radio station, and it doesn’t pay much. So me and other friends decided to help him with money for rent. Every month we send him some money so he can use his salary to pay other expenses in his life. 

Then, December came. His birthday and the death of his mother. He gets very upset at December. Also, he is already SUPER mentally unstable, so during December things get worse. He wanted to make to birthday parties in two different restaurants: one would be for friends from work and uni, and the other would be for the closest friends from our town. If 5 people went to each restaurant, his meal would be free, so he invited 30 people from his work and uni. Only THREE people showed up. He had to pay for his own meal, it was very expensive and he was a MESS. He sent me voice memos that I WISH I could show you so you would understand why I was so scared. I said that maybe we could celebrate in a different way, like going to the movies or gather our closest friends to play board games. He said: “I spend the whole fucking year trying to save money and I had to spend a lot of money in December already. DONT I DESERVE MY PRESENT? If this happens again tomorrow, you’ll see me so pissed, so pissed that NONE of my ‘friends’ will remain alive”. 

Now... Like I said he’s unstable. ALSO, he spent A LOT of money buying clothes as a gift to himself in December, while me and other friends were paying his rent and always helping him WITH EVERYTHING WE CAN. He’s definitely not grateful and this voice memo was like the last straw. This story is bigger, but I didn’t want to take your time for too long. During the time we were really close, I fed him, I took care of him when he was sick and because I said one thing he didn’t like he called be cold hearted and selfish. And now this. How do I stop being friends with this toxic man? I don’t know how to leave this friend behind because I don’t want to see him suffer... But at the same time, he’s been taking my money and  my sanity away. I hope you can help me. 


Short version: my friend is toxic and not grateful at all. Also, very unstable. Sometimes I’m scared of him. The thing is I pay his rent and also don’t want to see him hurt. What do I do to leave this “friend” behind?"
eeaavj,5,2019-12-22,"In college as a CS freshman now, what can I do to prepare myself and get a job by graduation in 4 YEARS to get into an IT and security career?",beaux-restes,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/eeaavj/in_college_as_a_cs_freshman_now_what_can_i_do_to/,"I scoured reddit for and this subreddit for various tips on breaking into the industry, but I haven't read much on getting internships or experience in IT in particular as much as tips for software engineers and web developers. 

I used to work in IT as a help desk technician where I worked with active directories, remote desktop support in Linux and Windows, software installing etc. I was recently let go of though because there wasn't going to be much more to do for me, especially since I was a new hire and still needed to learn just a little bit more. I'm not sure if that would be relevant on my experience in getting a better job next time around though. Currently, I have a friend who works as a system administrator for the CS department here who's also a freshman like me and he's referred me to his supervisor but I haven't heard back yet.

Aside from that, I'm taking this winter break now to work on a few personal programming projects like a Discord bot (teaching myself Javascript right now) and possibly a Gameboy Advanced Emulator. And I also purchased a Udemy course on Ethical Hacking which I've yet to complete through. 

And next semester I'll be participating in a Hackathon with a team who's working on building a security tool involved with man-in-the-middle attacks, which I think should be relevant and an interesting project to take on. 

The reason why I'm already wary on guaranteeing in getting a job when I graduate is I'd like to get a head start in the industry and also pay off my loans as soon as I can since my family is extremely low income. What more can I do to build experience and increase my chances of getting a job by graduation aside from help desk jobs and focusing on internships?

Edit: sorry for the caps on 4 years, didn't mean any emphasis, just autocorrect"
eeadjz,344,2019-12-22,"Strangers began recognizing me, and it turned my life upside down",Odd_directions,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eeadjz/strangers_began_recognizing_me_and_it_turned_my/,"My name is Ronald S. Moss. I’m a forty-five-year-old senior accountant employed by a large corporation in Washington, D.C. I’m the kind of person that never had a midlife crisis because my life was always the same. There weren’t any distinguishable phases. My hair loss started after graduation and soon after my internship turned into a full-time job I began gaining weight. Before I knew it I turned into a shadow of a person trapped inside a sweaty casual business suit. The saddest part is that I enjoyed my life. I liked the small talk with my colleagues in the bistro – my only social interactions – and I felt at ease doing my job inside of my small cubicle. No one disturbed me and I didn’t disturb anyone in return. At home – a small apartment in a pretty nice neighborhood – I always ate some fast food I bought on the drive home and watched television until bedtime. It was an easy life and it wasn’t likely to change. A tiny part of me fantasized about getting in shape and marry, but after I turned forty, I kind of gave up on those fantasies ever materializing.

I didn’t think much of the first incident that was out of place. A young man approached me while I was sitting by myself at Burger King having lunch. He looked perfectly normal for a man his age, so I didn’t feel threatened by him.

“Hi”, he said with a kind smile on his face. “Have a nice day!”

Although it was unusual for someone to do this, especially toward someone as uninteresting as myself, I didn’t mind the gesture and said you too. Then, as soon as he had walked past me and I was about to take a bite out of my burger, he leaned in from behind and held his smartphone in front of my face.

“Just a quick selfie.”

I could see my look of surprise behind my thick glasses in his display, holding the burger like an idiot in front of me, and his smiling face next to mine. There was no time to react. He took the picture and left with a thank you. When I turned around he was gone. I shrugged it off as some kind of new trend among young people, perhaps a new meme or prank or whatever they call it these days. I went on with my day as usual and the rest of that month passed by without any further incidents. 

It wasn’t until one and a half months later, sometime in December, that the next thing occurred. I was ordering my food in the drive-in when the cashier, a man my age, suddenly addressed me by my name:

“Have a nice day, Ronald!”

I was too taken aback to ask him how in the world he knew my name. Instead, I just said thank you and drove away. After thinking about it, I concluded that we probably met somewhere and I simply forgot. Maybe, I thought, we went to university together. Still, I usually didn’t forget a face and my gut feeling told me I hadn’t seen that man before. This bothered me for the rest of the evening, but the next day I didn’t think much of it. 

A few weeks after this, around Christmas, I began noticing that some people, usually young people, were staring at me. At first, I thought that I had spilled something on my shirt or that I had forgotten to zip my pants, but there was nothing unusual with my appearance. I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why they kept looking at me. While buying food at the grocery store, for example, a married couple, pulling a stroller in front of them, kept following me around and whispering as they watched me grab a bag of hot dogs. As soon as I looked back at them, they quickly shy away and went down another aisle. There was also an increase in strangers wishing me a merry Christmas, some of which also mysteriously knew my name. All of these incidents happened often enough to make me question it, but rare enough for it to maybe just be random coincidences.

It stopped for a while. During that time, something else happened that changed my routines quite a bit. It was our office’s New Year’s Eve Party, and as usual, during these kinds of ballyhoos, I didn’t have that much fun. I walked around making some small talk and wishing people a happy new year, trying to blend in and waiting for the midnight celebrations so that I could go home without drawing attention to myself. 

Everything was going as expected until close to midnight. We had moved up to the roof to watch the fireworks when this woman came out of nowhere and asked me to lit her cigarette. I hadn’t seen her before, but that wasn’t surprising. A lot of people had brought their friends. I didn’t have a lighter since I didn’t smoke, so I had to tell her sorry and to ask someone else. She disappeared and I thought I would never see her again. After a few moments, however, she returned. Her cigarette had been lit. She gave me a glass of champagne that she had picked from a tray and struck a conversation with me. *She must be drunk*. It wasn’t a derogatory thought, I didn’t hold her potential intoxication against her, it was just the only explanation I could think of as to why she would ever speak to someone like me.

I entertained the conversation to the best of my abilities. She introduced herself as O.

“O?” I asked, a bit surprised.

“Yes, O.”

“Oh…”

We laughed. I corrected my glasses, trying to hide how nervous she made me feel, and asked her who she knew at the party. She said she was a friend of a friend to someone who worked at my company. I was happy to hear that since I had feared that she was one of my colleague's girlfriends. She was in her late twenties, a bit too young for a man my age perhaps, but the attention she gave me made me forget any such qualms.

She stood beside me as we counted down to the new year and then, to my bewildered surprise, she kissed me on my cheek. I didn’t know how to react, I just fumbled with my words and blushed like a schoolboy. The conversation felt awkward for a little while but soon returned to normal. I stayed way longer than I had intended to at the party chatting with this woman and before we said our goodbyes she asked if she could have my number. 

Next weekend, we went on our first date – the first date I had been on since a catastrophic blind date my mother forced upon me before she had given up the idea of grandchildren – and we had sex at my place later the same evening. I wasn’t a virgin, but since it had been almost twenty years since last time it almost felt like I lost my virginity again. O, as she still insisted on calling herself, was a lot more experienced than me as far as I could tell. I won’t go into details, but the sex was wild and it wasn’t thanks to me.

We kept seeing each other regularly and after a few more dates we became boyfriend and girlfriend. I couldn’t believe my luck. O was, as they say, way out of my league. It baffled me that I had been content with my life as it had been. I hadn’t even been alive, just a corporate zombie doing the same boring thing every day. O visited me a few days a week and we spent most weekends together at my place. She still lived with her parents, she told me, and didn’t want me to meet her folks until maybe after a year. She wanted to be completely sure we would work out as a couple before she involved them. I sympathized with that, and, frankly, I didn’t feel like meeting her parents too quickly anyway. I would feel out of place in their presence given the quite significant age gap between me and their daughter.

A few months passed by during which I walked on clouds. I didn’t think about the occasional guy staring at me or secretly taking pictures of me with their phones. It was nothing more than background noise that I didn’t pay any attention to. The summer approached, and I thought it would be the happiest summer of my life. In early spring, however, there was another incident that I simply couldn’t ignore. A girl with blue hair, black lipstick, and a leather jacket spoke to me at the gas station.

“Hey, Ronald!”

“Y-yes?” 

I was just about to get into my car.

“Oh my God, I can’t believe it’s you!”

Given the prior incidents, her reaction made me suspicious.

“Who are you?” I said. “Are you a friend of O?”

“I was just wondering–“ She went through her purse and picked up a small piece of paper and a pen. “Could I get your autograph, please?”

“My autograph?!” I said. “What for?” I was annoyed at this strange unwanted attention, and I didn’t mind making that clear to her. “Do I know you?”

“No, of course not.” She laughed. “So you don’t want to–“

“No!” I yelled. “Why are you doing this, who are you people?!”

“You’re right,” she said. “I shouldn’t have asked, I’m sorry.”

She walked away from me, seemingly ashamed of herself.

“Hey, lady!” I still wanted answers to my questions. “How do you know my name?!”

She didn’t respond. I got into my car, angry, and drove home. I called O and told her about what had happened and about the other things as well. She calmed me down, as always when I felt stressed, and convinced me that it was just a bunch of coincidences and that the lady must have been crazy or a prankster.

“But how did she know my name?”

“Listen, Ron,” she said. “People do these kinds of pranks all the time. They get your name from social media. There was probably some jerk filming everything from afar. I once saw a clip on YouTube where a guy looked up people in his area on social media and pretended to guess everything about them. It’s really creepy, I know. They use people's open Facebook and Instagram profiles against them. People really should care more about their privacy, you know?”

“Well, I’m deactivating my Facebook account *tonight*. Who do these kids think they are?”

Things returned to normal, or at least to what had recently become normal for me. My relationship with O had changed a great deal for me, not just my mood but my appearance as well. She always wanted me to be the best I could be and encouraged me to buy new hair products, new clothes, and even a new car. Since I never bought anything expensive, I had a lot of money saved. It felt good to finally get a reason to use them. As expected, my habits slowly changed as well. We ate out more often and we even went to a bar for drinks a few times. Other than this my life didn’t change much, but I still felt as if I had been reborn.

I was having lunch, thinking about suggesting a trip to Europe with O, when I overheard someone behind me saying my name. It was a group of teenagers talking. I didn’t turn around to face them, but they got my attention.

“I agree,” one of them said. “I think O should leave him alone. I mean, I understand that he’s at a better place now and I’m happy for him, I really am, but a small part of me misses the old Ronald.”

“Yeah, totally, but–“

I stopped listening. *What the fuck?* I was consumed with a rage that was only made stronger by my confusion.

“Hey!” I stood up and pointed at them. “What is going *on*?”

“Oh, shit, it’s Ronald!”

One of them reached for his phone at took a picture.

“Stop that!” I said. “I demand to know–“

They got up from their seats in a hurry to get away from me.

“No!” I leaped forward and grabbed the one who had taken my picture. “You’re not going to escape this time.”

Everyone in the restaurant looked at me.

“Leave them alone!” someone said.

“It’s not what it looks like, they’re–“

“Let me go, man”, the boy said.

I tried to calm myself down. “Please, just tell me what this is all about, why does everyone know who I am?”

The boy anxiously looked back at his friends who stood at the entrance, filming us with their phones.

“Look,” he said in a whisper, “you’re big on the dark web.”

I blinked in confusion. *The what?* I was just about to ask about it when one of the employees laid her hands on my arm.

“Let him go,” she said. “Sir, you have to let the boy go or we will call the police.”

I did as she told me and he immediately ran away.

“I’m the one who’ll call the police,” I said.

I talked to O about this when I got home, and she agreed that it was time to go to the authorities. However, I didn’t know what to tell them. I googled the dark web, but it didn’t make much sense to me. I learned that I had to use something called Tor, but I wasn’t tech-savvy enough to figure out how to use it properly. O didn’t know either. I googled all the combinations of words, including my name, that I could think of but nothing showed up. O continued to push the idea that it was some kind of elaborate prank, but I felt that it was something bigger than that. 

“These people are stalking me,” I said. “Doesn’t it bother you that they know about our relationship? About you? I mean, they were talking about us, about you and me!”

“Yeah?” she said, surprised. “What did they say about me?”

“They indicated that you had changed me somehow. One of the boys said something about liking the *old* me.”

“Those people are sick,” she said, a bit more upset.

“No kidding!” I said. “But seriously, what did he mean? ‘You’re big on the dark web.’ It makes me furious.”

“Relax, baby, they’re annoying, for sure, but at least they aren’t threatening you. They seem to like you. You know what I think?”

“No, what?” I looked at her, hoping for a theory that made sense.

“I think you might have a secret fan club.”

*A secret fan club?* I couldn’t believe that. I was a nobody. And yet, it did help make sense of the incidents.

I did my best to explain my problem to the police officer I talked to down at the station, but as expected it didn’t go that well. I had no evidence to show them, only a few anecdotes. 

“Do you feel threatened?”

I hesitated. “N-no, not exactly threatened, but they're violating my privacy, you know, my integrity. That can’t be legal, right?”

I asked them to search for my name on the dark web, but in the end, I got the feeling that they would prioritize more pressing matters than my weird story.

I tried to avoid people and public places as much as I could, and as soon as someone looked at me I responded in anger by flipping my finger or telling them off. Some of them were probably innocent, but how was I supposed to know? 

This continued for some time. I considered myself lucky to have O at my side. She kept me sane. We lay awake late at night, joking about me, of all people, having a fan club. It felt good to be able to laugh about it, but anxiety still took a hold of me right before I drifted off to sleep. I heard that boy’s words echoing in my mind: *A small part of me misses the old Ronald.*

During the following months, the incidents decreased. This ought to have made me happy, but instead, it made my anxiety worse. Didn’t they like me anymore? It was a ridiculous thought, but it entered my mind more and more often and for each time a stranger *did* look at me or took a picture of me, I felt less and less angry. It was a slow process, but eventually, I began looking at myself differently in the mirror. I inspected myself, trying to figure out if I had changed too much or too little. I joked about it with O, not wanting her to know how much it bothered me that no one had asked for my autograph in several weeks, and she told me that I should try and hit the gym. She wasn’t serious, she had responded in jest, but a week later I had bought my first gym card. I had never felt so motivated to lose weight in my entire life. And yet, it didn’t seem to help. No matter how much weight I lost, or how much muscles I built, my fans – as I had begun calling them in my head – didn’t increase.

“I don’t think they like this new me,” I said to O. “I think that boy at Burger King was right. They miss the old Ronald. After all, that was the man they fell for in the first place.”

“My God,” O said, “listen to yourself!”

“I-I know,” I said, shaking my head at my vanity.

“You’re letting these people get to you! You are doing fine. This is the healthiest you’ve been your entire life. If they want you to stop eating healthy and working out, they don’t truly care about you.”

“I guess,” I said. “I just wish I could figure out how to access the dark web so that I could see what they’re saying about me. If I just knew what to do–“

“No, baby, you’re doing great! Maybe they just want you to stop caring about them, you know, maybe that will do the trick?”

I told her I would stop paying attention to them, but just a few days later I was back in my old suit. O didn’t take it well and it led to our first serious fight. It felt like everything was falling apart around me. I lived like my old self for a month, but it didn’t help either. One day, I saw the blue-haired lady who had approached me at the gas station. I ran up to her.

“Hey!” I said.

“Oh, Ronald,” she said. “I’m sorry for that time I–“

I could see that she wasn’t happy to see me.

“It’s okay,” I said. “I just want to ask you something.“

“I really have to go,” she said, “I’m late for an interview.”

“It will just take a second,” I pleaded.

“Sorry,” she said and walked away from me.

“Wait!” I yelled. “I just want to know! Hello?! What do you want me to do?! Why don’t you like me anymore!”

She disappeared around a corner. I stood there for a while, in the middle of the sidewalk, hating myself for being rejected by her like that. I became obsessed with getting the attention of my fan club and for one or two weeks I did everything I came to think of. I even bought an aloha shirt. But nothing worked. O was unhappy about all of this, and fearing I would lose her I put the fancy suit back on and promised her I wasn’t going to do any more ridiculous stunts to get attention from all of those crazy people online. 

My anger toward the fan club slowly returned, and I thought things were going back to normal with O, but for some reason, she still wasn’t happy with me. I couldn’t figure it out. Perhaps, I thought, the damage my earlier behavior had caused was too extensive to be fixed. But then, one night in bed, she said something that made me uneasy.

“Maybe you *did* change too much.” She wasn’t angry when she said it, it was more like a thought she accidentally said aloud.

“What do you mean, baby?”

“I think they just want you to be *yourself*. Before, you tried too hard to be like your old self and it just didn’t feel genuine, you know?”

“What are you talking about, baby, I thought you said I shouldn’t care about those people anymore.”

“Exactly, that’s what I’m talking about, *that’s* what they want!”

“But baby,” I said, “I don’t know how to be that guy anymore. It feels like I’m acting whatever I do!”

“Just be yourself, Ron.”

“But I don’t know who I am anymore!”

It was a nightmare. Each day felt like going on stage unprepared. The audience could be anyone. My relationship with O got worse and worse. She didn’t come to visit me as often as before, made excuses to cancel our plans and instigated fights for things she didn’t use to care about. It all culminated at my place one late night after we had been to a karaoke bar. In one last, desperate attempt at getting back my fans, I had drunkenly begun singing *Mamma Mia*. They booed me off the stage. At least one person knew my name.

“Go home, Ronald, you’re drunk!”

He was one of them, how else could he have known?

At home, O expressed how unhappy she was with how I had behaved. I tried to tell her I was sorry, but it just made everything worse. In the end, she broke up with me. 

“You used to be better than this,” she told me with contempt in her eyes. “I’m leaving you!”

She stormed out of my apartment. I sat down on my bed and was just about to cry my eyes out, finally releasing all of the emotions I had kept inside for so long, when I noticed that O had forgotten har laptop on my desk. I don’t know what drove me to check it out – a gut feeling I guess – and what I found made my blood freeze. She had a Tor window opened in the background. The title on the page she was on was: Random Ronald’s fan club. *Random Ronald?* There were pictures and videos of me all over the page, going as far back as two years.

O returned. She didn’t say a word, just slammed the computer shut and walked toward the door again.

“You were one of them?” I asked. “Please tell me you found that page after you–“

She stopped in her tracks and looked at me, still not talking.

“B-baby?”

“Does it really matter?” she asked, and then she left.

I called in sick the next day and stayed at home for more than a week. When I finally went outside, it was as a broken man. My life was turned upside down. I had gone from being a happy nobody to an unhappy nobody. I went from contemplating suicide to planning it. O had broken my heart, but she had also given me something that I had never had before: a thirst for love. It would never be satisfied. I mindlessly walked through the city. A mental numbness – some kind of brain fog – clouded my thoughts. The world didn’t just feel different, it looked different too. It was grayer, somehow, with a bluish nuance I hadn’t noticed before. 

I stepped out of my car at the top of a parking building. I had hoped to be alone, but there were a couple of kids skating on the roof. I considered waiting until they left, but in the end, I decided it didn’t matter if they were there or not. It was a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight. I walked to the edge of the roof. The city buzzed with life beneath me. I took one step forward and stared down. Soon, I thought, I would lay dead down there.

“Ronald, is it you?”

I was just about to jump, but stopped and turned around. One of the kids, a black teenage girl, stood behind me with a piece of paper in her hand. She looked at me nervously.

“What?” I said.

“Could I have your autograph?”

I stepped away from the edge and wrote my name on her piece of paper. She smiled at me.

“Cool,” she said. ”Um,” she carefully searched for the right words to use. “You always inspired me to be a better person.”

“Uh, thanks,” I said.

“What are you doing here, anyway?”

“Just watching the view,” I said and felt a smile appear on my face. “I’ll return to my car now.”

Maybe it wasn’t all for nothing, I thought as I drove back [home](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/)."

However, I think I will go to Kelley instead due to in-state with my dad and scholarships giving half ride.

Pokémon Master Ash Ketchum travelled the world to become the Pokémon League champion. He said, ""I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was. I know it is my destiny!"" Was he truly the ""master"" he called himself? Unfortunately, Ash failed to win the Pokémon League in the Kanto region. His overwhelming passion and beliefs in himself led him to be naive and close-minded about his Pokémon's condition, like his Pikachu, battle after battle. Sadly, the passionate mentality of Ash Ketchum reflected my general mindset when I failed to uphold other people's opinions in my internship for Republican Congressman Mike Bishop of Michigan's 8th Congressional District as a lone Democrat.

Before my internship, I never questioned my discomfort with the Republican Party. On every position, I was solidly liberal, ranging from social to fiscal issues. Soon, I was to realize that neither political side is ""right"" and realized that my political journey was beginning. In my internship, I had to go door-to-door to try to convince voters to re-elect Congressman Bishop. I progressed along the onerous process of political identification during conversation after conversation. I contained myself in a shell that was encapsulated with Democratic ideals. My bias resembled the incompetence of Ash Ketchum's mind as he let Pikachu stumble in battle, loss after loss.

The unfortunate truth started to arise as I needed to be acquainted with conservative principles, for I knew none. I had difficulty explaining to voters my message with a weak background on conservative politics. In presidential debates, candidates hid behind a podium while directing and toning their message by speaking about themselves more than the concern of voters. I tried to be like Ketchum by displaying humor while aggressively pitching Congressman Bishop just like Ash did in the League. I wasn't expecting what happened next. I was slammed with a freight train of rejections after rejections as the voters laughed me off. Weren't logic and reason my most potent weapons in a debate or conversation? Why couldn't I transcend my ignorance? These questions persisted as I continuously wandered into an endless odyssey leaving the pieces of the puzzle unexplained.

Nearly 100 houses later, I started panting in frustration as I couldn't grasp each voter's unique psyche. I felt like I was Ash in the Pokémon League just seeing Pikachu falter again and again. I glimpsed at myself and started rooting out the source. I was a hermit in my own kingdom of thoughts and emotions guarded by my closeted mindset, as if I were my own League champion. Luckily, my quest to remedy the past didn't end like Ash's. I realized the plethora of issues - their healthcare, taxes, and the economy - consuming the electorates' minds as they struggled to pay bills. When I started listening to the voters, I started understanding their perspective, whether I agreed or not, while indirectly appealing to them. During my conversations with an individual, I understood that it wasn't just about introducing myself, but rather about allowing the individual to lead the conversation. Eventually, I started to understand both liberal and conservative policies by observing various perspectives. By blending both conservative and liberal policies, my conversations with voters helped voters capture the entire picture rather than just one part of the picture.

A story usually ends with an uncomfortable or a powerful and meaningful ending. When Ash Ketchum failed to defeat the Pokémon League champion, Ketchum fell to his knees and realized the very mistake I made. Ash Ketchum pushed his Pokémon in his frivolous pursuit for the Championship without realizing that his Pokémon had feelings. Unlike Ash, I still have a chance to utilize what I've conquered-my close-minded attitude-so that I can discover and make the best of my opportunities. Luckily, my story hasn't come to a close like Ketchum's. As I wake up every morning, my journey has rejuvenated to a new beginning."

So I’m currently going to a community college in NYC. My original plan was to transfer this coming spring  to an unknown 4 year school in the city that has a pretty “good” CS program and then work my ass off to hopefully get an internship by my senior year and go on from there.

Recently I realized that if I wait, get my GPA higher and then finish getting my associates, I could transfer to a known school that has recruiters which I think would  give me better possibilities career wise. The only thing is that I would have to wait from half a year to a maybe a whole year because of how the the college process works. However I recently started learning coding through FreeCodeCamp and CodeAcademy, so I would put that time to good use.

So my question is would it be worth it to wait and get my associates first, then transfer by the end of next year? Or should I transfer now while I still have the option to?"

* Stanford (REA)
* University of Michigan Engineering (withdrew before decision)
* several UC's (still waiting, most likely going to withdraw)

**Demographics:**

* East Asian male
* Competitive private school in California
* No hooks

**Intended majors:**

* For Stanford: music, physics, and math

**Academics:**

SAT: 1550 (750 RW, 800 M)

SAT II:

* Math II: 800
* Physics: 790
* Chemistry: 800
* Spanish: 730

Class rank: none, but my counselor told my parents that I'm in the top 3 or 4 out of my class of 60+ kids

UW/W GPA: 3.96/4 UW, 4.72/5 W (impossible to get a 5/5 at my school, so I don't know what the maximum actually is)

Coursework:

* 7 AP's taken before senior year, score in parentheses: calculus BC (5), physics C mechanics (5), English lang (5), Spanish lang (5), music theory (5), chemistry (4), physics C E&amp;M (5)
* Took as many honors/advanced/AP courses as possible (half of my courses sophomore year and all courses from junior/senior year)

**Extracurriculars:**

* Music composition - this is definitely the ""spike"" in my application; I've been composing music since 7th grade and have devoted a lot of time to it. I scored a film that my friend directed and was currently writing an original musical with several other friends. I've also had various performances of my pieces at school and at a summer program in Berklee.
* Head of music club
* Choir (grade 11-12) - we won superior rating at 3 choral festivals last year and will be going on tour in Europe this year
* Musical - not a major EC; landed several support roles in various shows across all 4 years
* Piano - been playing since age 5, but didn't do much with it
* Internship at a major film composer's studio for 2 summers
* Took a course at Stanford Summer Arts Institute related to music and technology
* Tutoring - been a math tutor since freshman year and volunteered to be a chemistry tutor junior year, also selected by the language department to be a Spanish tutor junior year
* Various senior leadership positions for which we had to submit an application junior year:
   * Head of math club
   * Head of a committee that organizes weekly school events for the student body
   * Head of fitness center
* Varsity baseball (left field)

**Awards:**

* Scored a film that won ""Best Music Score” at a Chinese film festival and ""Best Film Overall"" at an international film festival in Asia (not going to specify here for privacy)
* Cum laude society
* Qualified for US National Chemistry Olympiad
* Gold Award for National Spanish Exam (only took the level 2 exam)
* Several school awards in math, Spanish, physics, and music
* AP Scholar with Distinction

**Letters of recommendation:**

* Counselor: 9/10 - because I go to a small school, our counselors really get to know us, so I was pretty close with my counselor
* Math teacher: 9 or 10/10 - had him for multivariable calculus junior year and as an advisor sophomore year; we shared many interests in math and music and were able to bond over the two years
* Spanish teacher: 8 or 9/10 - had her for AP Spanish junior year; she spoke highly of me with my parents
* Music teacher: 9 or 10/10 - been working with him since freshman year

**Essays/supplements:**

* Common app: wrote about how music composition liberated me from my once self-conscious self and how it is reflected in everyday life; worked really hard on this one, so probably 9/10
* Intellectual vitality: wrote about how applying math to other areas (such as music) made me realize the value of creativity; transitions from beginning to end are smooth and tie nicely to my final message 9/10
* Note to roommate: the central theme is conversation and its function in my life, but I also managed to slip in some of my interests along the way (such as what food I like), 8/10
* What matters to you: wrote about how I learned to be honest with myself through playing baseball; I really liked the version I used for the UC's, which was longer and more detailed, but because of the word limit, I had to shorten this and omit some content, 8/10

Conclusion: My stats definitely made me a competitive applicant, but music composition was probably what stood out to the AO's (I submitted an art portfolio in composition, if that matters). I didn't have any crazy awards or research like many  other kids applying to HYPSM, although I don't think it matters that much as long as you are genuine and personal in your essays. Also, for top schools with very low acceptance rates, you need a little bit of luck on your side. Hope this helped!

EDIT: Forgot about the interview. I interviewed with an alumnus at a coffee shop, so it was pretty chill. I wouldn't say it went too well, as there were awkward moments here and there, but I handled most of the questions pretty well and talked a lot about music and baseball. He also shared some of his experience with baseball, which I think helped us relate to each other more. Toward the end, though, he asked me about video games and told me that his son played a lot of Fortnite (yep, you heard that right); interpret that as you may. The interview lasted about an hour.

My undergraduate degree is in Information Technology. I have experience in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, and have a publication in this field.

What kind of work might an intern of my profile be expected to do? I plan on working on a couple of projects on financial modeling, as machine learning featured prominently in my interview.

I'd appreciate any help about the nature of work that goes on in IBs in technology, what a quant or strats person might do, what a developer role is like, and any pointers on what to familiarize myself with before starting."

Unfortunately, I couldn't prepare for this year's GRE. I'm hoping to do it early next year(2020) and apply for spring batches. 

However, people have suggested me not to go for spring and wait for 2021 fall. I find that little late. The reason being less opportunities in terms of part-time jobs in campus and other things. 

My only concern is I want to have a job as soon as I graduate to apply for OPT since I'm an international student. Is it difficult for a CS graduate? Do internships during graduate studies and jobs post graduation difficult? I mean, I'll only have 90 days post graduation to find a job.

I  wish to recruit some remote virtual assistants for marketing my  tutoring business. I am looking for interns or people on a performance  basis because we are a lean-startup who cannot employ a full-time  employee or hire contractors for specific jobs every time. I am looking  for people with basic computer skills so that I can mentor them on  getting clients and converting those clients to customers.

My questions are, according to you

1,  Which is the best website to find talented interns or performance marketers for my job on the internet?

2,  What is the best method to hire them?

3, Which is the best city/place/country to hire people from?

I have already done these

1, Posted on Facebook Jobs, Fiverr, Freelancer.

My methodology of hiring people

1, I ask people who replied to my recruitment ad to send their CV and cover letter explaining why they are the best  
2, Interview them through Skype

Optional : A skill test for computer skills/English skills or sales skills.

Thank you."

eelggi,2,2019-12-23,Is my career over at 23?,ProfuseGloom,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/eelggi/is_my_career_over_at_23/,"I'm a Computer Science graduate from a Tier 2 University in India. I completed my 4 year under-graduation study with a CGPA of 6.4/10 around July 2019. This CGPA is the poison that killed my career. My career plan was to do my MS at a top University in the States. But after analysing my profile and the University I studied in, that was highly unlikely and I have to settle for a top 50 University which was again fine by me. Turns out even these Universities don't accept my CGPA. In some cases where Universities consider last 60 credit hours, my CGPA is around 7.1/10 since I have shown upward improvement in the latter semesters. I have done 3 mini projects and 2 major projects, 1 at college and 1 at an Internship. I have done 2 internships so far and have a total of 3 months of work experience. I am currently working at the company I recently interned in. It's a small product based startup that deals with Full Stack Development and Machine Learning. Apart from that I have won a College level competition, participated in multiple hackathons, done numerous online courses, and also published 2 research papers, one national and other international. I am currently grinding Leetcode and other coding platforms.

Well this sums up my profile, yet I know that I won't be accepted in any of these Universities because of that one negative factor that is the GPA. I really don't know how to improve my chances because so far my internet research tells me it's impossible to improve and my career is practically doomed since this grade won't land me top jobs and won't help me get a good University. Honestly a bit of background about the University, I know I shouldn't be blaming Universities in my SOP but since it's Reddit I don't think I care much. This University is known for its marks deflation, improper evaluation, scamming, money for marks schemes, etc. Pretty much known for destroying careers of most students (including mine). Think about it, evaluation is so strict that the batch topper's CGPA is only 8.7/10.
The people who have been placed are mostly in dead-end hectic service based jobs. I didn't see that to be much of a priority because my aim for to apply for Universities. This University does not encourage open minded learning, does not encourage internships, not gave us time to do one during semester breaks. Maximum time allowed was only 10 days.

But now it seems like my decisions have gone haywire and I'm stuck in a pit I cannot come out of. I present you an example about someone whose career ended before it even started. I have been severely depressed for a while and my family has been burdened by it. I really don't know what to do hence this is kind of like my last attempt to fix myself before I completely give up on life. So hey Reddit! Any advice?"

My SO took a week off and will be spending her week with family and friends, most of my coworkers took the week off so I am at the office with one other person today who is taking next week off, and most of my family took the week off as well. I have to go to work. 

I have noticed that I have become really envious of them and their time off. Almost to the point of not wanting to talk to them because I don't want to hear about all the fun things they got to do while I was stuck pushing paper at my desk in the office. 

I had a really tough semester juggling grad school, an internship, work, and trying to maintain relationships. I feel like I worked really hard and deserved a break yet to do so would mean losing pay which would just add stress. 

I am not normally a very jealous person and I have noticed this has taken a very negative toll on me. I spent all weekend ruminating about how I have to go to work when everyone else does not. So instead of enjoying my weekend as I should have, I spent it sulking.  

What can I do to improve? This isn't healthy and I want to nip it in the bud ASAP but to also learn how to handle it in the future."
eenz1b,8,2019-12-23,Real World Engineering,KevinKell1023,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/eenz1b/real_world_engineering/,"So here is my problem:

I’m in my junior year as a Mechanical Engineering student and I’m doing what I would consider to be fairly well. My gpa is good (a little under a 3.8) and I’m building a pretty strong resume. I’m part of our schools FSAE group and I’m designing a part on the car this year. Last year I got an internship with a good company that paid well and this fall I interviewed with a hydraulics company that also pays well.

My problem is that I dont think I’m a good engineer at all. In the few moments I have been asked to apply school knowledge to real world situations I feel like I flounder. I didn’t come into college with a strong background in working with any sort of machine or a knowledge about computers and through my extra circulars in school it becomes extremely apparent to me all the time how many details I seem to overlook while my classmates don’t (tolerance issues, machinability of designed parts, etc.).

My internship last summer was not super designed based or anything like that, but my lack for technical knowledge was kind of apparent at times and I think it showed to my employer. Even though everything on my resume is true, sometimes I feel like I’m lying to these companies I apply for internships for because I know I don’t know as much as they think I do. I have also debated grad school cause my gpa is good for it, but I’m worried I’d get there and be way out of my depth. I feel like I’m just good at getting decent grades, not learning and applying the material I get in class. Not really sure which way to go at this point. Not really sure if I’m set up to be a good engineer someday....thoughts?"
eeogno,2,2019-12-23,When should I email my recruiter?,timeshore,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eeogno/when_should_i_email_my_recruiter/,"So for a bit of background, I've been interviewing with a company for about 7 weeks now:

11/5 - Finished HackerRank

12/3 - First Phone Interview (Passed)

12/18 - Second Phone Interview (Passed)

So the recruiter told me that the process is the HackerRank, the two phone interviews, and then a final decision on their part on whether or not to extend an offer. For contexts sake, I go to a top-20, private CS school, have done an internship at a relatively high tier company last summer (not FANG, but kinda close), and applied here due to it being close to where I live.

My recruiter told me the feedback I got for my first interview was great, and that they would be scheduling a second one for me, which I completed last Wednesday. I answered the question with the most optimal solution, ensuring that I explained all the tidbits of the algorithm, along with runtime and space-time complexity, as well as multiple test cases, and I think I hit it out of the park. There was ample time for thoughtful questions, and the interviewer was very friendly.

Now, I'm kind of worried that I might not have gotten an offer because the time it took between the first interview and the confirmation for the second interview was so short (within the same day), and I was wondering if, and when, it would be a good idea to email my recruiter saying whats up.

Edit: My recruiter took a look at my LinkedIn an hour after my final interview (don't know if this is important or not.)"

I’ve been kind of lurking on this reddit for resources + advice, and I’m really happy to be making my first post here. @ mods, if this kind of post isn’t allowed, you can go ahead and take it down!

Some background: I had no computer science experience a year ago. Took my first CS course in college last fall and then my second this fall after deciding I liked CS more than my original major after all.

Anyways, I started all my personal projects / resume building in September. Started recruiting for summer internships in October, did a few interviews and one onsite, got on offer on Dec 12. I start in June and will be making a solid $8000 per month, which is more than I could’ve ever dreamed for my first internship. EDIT / disclaimer: I'm based in the Bay Area where rent is really high, and I'd also be commuting for work; this info can affect the hourly rate in your offer.

Just wanted to be another ray of hope out there for those that are also learning programming languages / looking for jobs. I know that mine is only an internship and not a full time, but changing careers this late in the game (I’m a senior in college) was really scary for me so I know what some of y’all are going through. I mean, that’s why we’re all on this reddit right? To learn programming through a community? Just keep on learning and challenging yourself, you can definitely do it.

Anyways, thank you so much r/learnprogramming ! I’ve learned a lot through my courses, but also through y’all (especially for personal projects)!

Other things that might be helpful stats for y’all!

Languages I am somewhat proficient / confident at: Python, Java
** The coding challenge I did for my company / offer was done completely in Python.

Personal projects done: developed an app for people to log their food intake (JavaScript, React Native)"

I got in touch my my boss from my most recent co-op (6 month long internship) for a recommendation letter and he mentioned that the company has an open position I should apply for.  So far I've have 4 interviews and they all went REALLY well.  My first interview was with their recruiter over the phone, about 45 minutes.  It's probably one of the best interviews I've ever had, in terms of how well I think I did.  The recruiter said I'd definitely be a good fit.  My second interview was with a an HR lady, about 10-15 minutes, and it also went well.  My third interview I came in, took a comprehension test, spoke with the HR lady, and talked with my old boss.  All of them went well and I got the impression that they really wanted me.  My fourth and most recent interview was  Wednesday's ago (so the Wednesday before last Wednesday) and it was with another manager, and I also took an ""electrical test"" which was just basic circuit questions like ""what's the voltage at this point?"" and ""what is this electrical component"" that was really easy.  My interview with the other manager went really well too, and he also said he thinks I'd be a good fit.  I also spoke for about 5 minutes with another engineer, and she also said I'd be a good fit and that my resume was impressive.  Anyway, I haven't heard anything back since.  I was a little late on sending a thank you to the other manager (6 days).  I also emailed my old boss on Friday of last week asking for an update and again confirming my interest in the position, and haven't gotten a response.  Should I call/email the HR lady today?  Or should I wait until the end of the holidays?  Is it typical to wait more than a week for a job offer, or at least a rejection, after an interview?

eepl4j,1,2019-12-23,Getting screwed; what do?,deusmas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eepl4j/getting_screwed_what_do/,"Programming has been a hobby of mine for about 15 years. I love it and am much better than average at it. I worked as a programmer full time for 4 years doing basic office automation stuff for the NSA and Loved it but I made a huge mistake in defending my work from an attack by my commanding officer while a two star general who was super impressed asked me about it for 2 hours when I was only allowed to talk for 5 minutes ‾\_(ツ)_/‾ 

So I was like piece I'm out of here time to study chemistry I did that for 3 years finished school and started looking for work in the area for a guy with a bachelors in chemistry...... I applied for all three job opening that year and never heard one word from any of them(each had hundreds of applicants, one of them was my professor )

So I started looking for work as a programmer, applied for tons of jobs, got 0 interviews(I guess chemistry does not look to good on a programmers resume) So I started college again this time for software but only had money for an associates I did super well I was even asked to be substitute teacher before I had graduated :D. One of my teachers works at a local company( 500 feet from my apartment) that makes sorting robots, that sounds like fun so I applied to the one and only open position. I hear nothing for a few months and I was getting super depressed so I ask my teacher for a tour so I can get to know some people.  

Every-one liked me and I asked if I could come shadow for some experience. I was given a few small tasks, super basic file manipulation, a backup client, a golang script to format and dd an image to a bunch of usb drives... 

I finished them all the first week. I gave them to the lead dev and he was floored other than a few house style rules I got it all perfect. They gave me an offer for an internship @ $17.88, that I took. That was 7 months ago.

My first month I was assigned a low priority task to find a bug in the network code. I found tons, so I redesigned the network so that It would be self managing, self healing, simpler and cheaper. Management was super impressed but I messed with one of the old guys from across the ponds baby.........................

Next I was asked refactored our automatic diagnostic, It would fail under just about any edgecase. It would give different results if ran back to back. It would contradict itself constantly. Now it doesn't; now it works perfectly and handles every edge case we could think of. This product had been broken for years we get customer complaints all the time.

Well at this point my boss tells me I can work on whatever I want. At a meeting I learn that the guy that got the job I applied for was assigned to build a prototype object classification ai..... that sounds fun. Plus it would give me a good chance to show off! so over the weekend I learned how to implement googles mobilnetV2 and built a proof of concept, that gets like %75 accuracy. They seemed impressed but %75 was not going to cut it.....

Well fast forward two months and I have a complete automatic training pipeline in place. I set it up so we could train anyone to build data sets with nothing more than a NES controller, Those datasets are then automatic added to a database. Then a training ground running in a docker container somewhere on the the network grabs the dataset from the database and trains a model up and saves the result to the database.

Then I abstracted all of the neural networks hyper parameter into a format similar to DNA consisting of one chromosome per filter block. I made it so I could save and load the DNA as a JSON object to and from the database. Then I wrote a few subroutines that introduce small random changes to the parameters, I called this mutation and modeled it after how real DNA works. I have substitution, addition, subtraction, and duplication events. I then made a system that lets me take two AiDNA and breed them to get new baby AIs that are automatically trained, evaluated and ranked. I then put that into a loop that makes ten babies and then trains and ranks them and then takes the best two and breeds them to get 10 more babies; and so on forever saving all the best performers for later use. Today a candidate made it to 98% with 1/3 the nodes as the original. This surpasses the customer spec, and was done completely autonomously. That single ai is worth 30K! 

Everyone else I work with is at home with their families in the houses they own making 100K+ salary with tons of benefits. I get no benefits, no PTO, no sick days, no holidays, my family and I live in government housing because I make $36,000/year. I am super salty about it. I LOVE my work, I have great supportive coworkers, My manger rocks...... But the pay is terrible. My company pays welders helpers more than me! They just hold things in place and sweep! This year we had record profits and next year looks even better.

I have a few questions First ""Do I own my work or do they?"" I never signed anything giving over any rights. There is nothing in my job description about actually producing anything. It said I was here to learn nothing more. No one has ever written even one line of my project. I have direct control over the git repo where it lives. 

Could I sell it to someone else?

Can I hold the source hostage as a bartering chip to get hired? should I?

Should I just open source it and publish and hope I get a job from there?

Should I keep putting %110 into it and trust that I will be rewarded? The people around me seem very ethical?

Should I give %30 because that is what I am paid, and spend most of my work time looking for other jobs/.

Should I just quit and go back on welfare? I have about the same amount of money now as before, but I don't have free time with my kids like before."

I am torn about staying or going. The opportunity is neat, but the idea of tearing up my roots here to go to a random town for this job makes me so fuckin apprehensive.

Salesforce (SWE): San Francisco office, \~8k/mo, housing (double) or 6k stipend, probably working on Java backend

FB (Production Engineer): Seattle office, 8k/mo, housing (single) or 1.2k/mo stipend, team match in April

\- F is just so famous (bIg fOUr amirite) but SF seems like a reputable company too

\- No team information about FB's PE, but from the brochure they have some pretty interesting projects. Also I would be able to go to onsite interview for SWE full time positions after the internship (at least that's what they said).

\- SF has ranked top for ""best place to work"", not sure about work life balance in FB.

\- Both claimed to have a very high return rate (\~80%)

\- Also free lunch in FB but not in SF (why)

Please share your insight on the two companies. Which would be the better option in terms of future career growth? Which is more friendly to international hires (immigration and the sort)? Any advice would be appreciated!

Literally anything that remotely relates to coding or math would fit the bill, but probably some sort of junior developer role or an internship is all im really qualified for. Heres my resume, let me know what you think: https://i.imgur.com/LMWhs70.png

Some additional thoughts:

* I start classes online at Different State University in Spring 2020, should I have Different State University on my resume at all at this point or should I wait till Ive actually started classes. Also should I specify that im attending the university online?

* At Big Manufacturing Company I learned how to use Python, Javascript, and the Django web framework with no prior knowledge and I think it might be worth mentioning, to prove I can pick things up quickly

* I know it probably doesnt look good that Ive only been at Phone Repair Company for a month and am already looking for a new job. But it doesnt pay very much and I have some moral concerns about some stuff that goes on there.

* At Phone Repair Company they wanted me to work on some of their existing software in a sort of consultant role in addition to the 40 hrs a week that i work in quality. Ive been teaching myself C# and the .NET framework, but I havent made any meaningful contributions yet and Im not confident enough in my knowledge to talk about it in an interview. But should I make a mention of it in some way?
* I have 3 lines of empty space at the bottom of the resume that could use filling up

I currently take Zoloft, which has helped a lot with my depression, but I still feel angry and anxious all the time and lately it’s been getting worse. Most recently I’ve been having:

-constant chest pain from anxiety 
-swallow anxiety (fear of choking on my food), which makes eating difficult
-fear that my friends will leave me or secretly hate me 
-feelings that none of my friends care about me or that they want me to be unhappy, which subsequently leads to me lashing out at them and increases my anxiety of losing my friends

I’m about to start my final semester of undergraduate and I have an internship for the semester, which has been adding a whole new list of fears and worries to my plate. Right now I’m home for winter break and staying with my parents. I have a good relationship with my parents and they are very helpful and supportive, but they can also be very nosy and overbearing and don’t give me much space, which does not help my anger problems atm.

eewza0,2,2019-12-24,"I'm not sure what I want to do at this point after my two Associates, some advice?",Psychatix,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/eewza0/im_not_sure_what_i_want_to_do_at_this_point_after/,"I just got my Associates in Science in Engineering Technology, after already getting my Associates in Arts degree. I'm not sure what to do now. To be honest I never figured out what to do in Engineering. I like tinkering with stuff, I like learning how something works, I like figuring out why something isn't working and fixing it. I enjoy doing AUTOCAD a bit, I had to take that for for the degree, and I did 3 years of SolidWorks back in high school, even got some certificate from the school for the Engineering course. Expired now, but if it was important I could easily do it again.

I'm stressed now because I'm 24, been in college since i was 18. I only have two associates degrees, and I feel like I should've been working on a Bachelors already or I should now. Student Loans scare me because if something goes awry, I'm not as committed to the engineering field, or it becomes too much for me, now I""m in debt with no chance at paying that off with a simple delivery job. I passed my AS degree with a 3.3 gpa, but I wasn't really TAUGHT anything? The professor was hardly hands on, or even around, a lot of self taught classes and left to our own devices. I prefer having assignments every week, getting a grade every week so I feel like I""m improving an dprogressing.

I've thought about going for a third Associates in 3D drafting and design, which I believe is called Manufacturing Design, but I'm being told a third associates is a waste of time. We had a woman at our state college (community college that is now called a state college for whatever reason) get a job at an aerospace company and she had 3 associates. One in Arts, one in Engineering Technology, and one in 3D drafting, so that's why I thought about going for that.

I'm thinking of a Bachelor's in Engineering Technology, but I'm behind on math. My next step would be Pre-Calculus, so I'm not sure how far behind I am on math. At the moment I've paid for everything with Pell Grant , but Pell Grant obviously won't cover an entire Bachelor's degree. IIRC Engineering Technology is the general engineering degree and requires little math. This one required no math classes, the ASsociates. I'm not sure what field of Engineering I'd like to go into, I don't have a preference really. One that doesn't require a metric shit ton of math would be nice, maybe no more than Calculus 1.

I was told by others that I should now get certificates and try to find an internship somewhere. I've thought about that, and I've leaned more towards doing that. I've had professors tell me that jobs will require experience, that you obviously don't have since you need experience to get a job and a job to get experience, etc the vicious cycle, but certificates were the middle ground. You might have no experience but you have the right certification in the right areas, that equates enough to experience for employers to consider you.

To top it off, if I go for a Bachelor's, I have to try and find something online. My car won't make the drive to the state university several times a week and back. My community college right now is fighting to get a 4 year degree in the engineering field, what specifically escapes my mind atm. So worse comes to worse thats an option in the future, but I don't want to wait. I""ll admit I have these degrees, but I feel like I could have done more with my life by now, and I feel as though I've wasted too much time just fucking around. I want to get serious now. Also need to work on a better resume, I just have a basic one you could google or make in Word. I'm not sure what one for engineering, or an internship, or one for 3D drafting would look like. For drafting I believe it's a portfolio at that point, not just a resume.

Another option is a Bachelor's in Business, but I'm not sure how much that'll help me after getting it. Combined with an ASsociates in Engineering Technology, probably more than a third associates I'd surmise. 

I'm not expecting answers to my problems, but advice to help me lean towards what I really should do at this point? I'm lost, I don't now if a third associates is worth it, throw my chips on the table with the Student Loan and Bachelors in Engineering Technology, or go for certificates and look for an internship (which I""ll be doing regardless of my decision)."
eezvbg,7,2019-12-24,"How to express myself without feeling ashamed, and say no without feeling bad",RipForFire,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/eezvbg/how_to_express_myself_without_feeling_ashamed_and/,"Dear people of Reddit,

When  I lost my dog in February, I was devastated. I never really got the  time to say goodbye. This resulted in me going down a dark path: self  harm, suicide thoughts and 1 attempt, I stopped with school so I can  work on myself. I was no longer the happy guy that was looking at a  bright future. I started seeing a social work and a psychologist. Both  of them tried everything they knew to get me to cheer up. They asked me  how I was feeling, what I needed. And 95% of the times my answer would  be nothing, I needed nothing. After a while I got therapy, to reduce the  pain that I got from my dog. This improved my life in a good way. I  continued my school, started to perform better at work, got a promotion  out of it.

Since I barely say no, I  was always there for people when they needed me. I was always looking  out for people. I was feeling really bad whenever I had to say no to  someone. Putting others first and me second. Like always. This gave me a  satisfied feeling. This caused me to not get enough time to process my  own feelings and thoughts.  Which caused allot of stress, cause I had to  make time for a lot of people.

So  in September, I met my (ex)boyfriend. We talked and after a month or  something we decided to meet. After this we started to see each other  like every weekend. Forward 1 month and we both agreed to an relation.  Keep in mind, this was my very first every relation. We continued to see  each other every weekend, which was for me a way to relax and forget  about all the stress, that I had from: work, school, internship, my  family. He helped me with working on the image that I had of myself.  Eventually I was proud of myself whenever I was talking about him. We  talked also about learning to say no and look at myself.

Fast  forward to last Sunday, when I was about to go home. My train wouldn't  arrive for at least 20 mins. So we decided to take a seat and talk about  the stress factors, and what I needed to change in order to not fall  back into that dark path. At that point I broke, like fully. I was  looking into nothing, my eyes turned black and all that I could think of  was suicide. My boyfriend notices this, and he tried to calm me down.  This didn't work cause I was fighting with my own feelings. Trying to  get the suicide out of my head. After a while I calmed down, but still  didn't want to look at my boyfriend, cause I was ashamed. After 2 hours  or so, he decided that he really needed to go, cause he had to work the  next day. He said take care and walked off. At that point I broke down  again, in full tears cause I had the opportunity to cry without me  feeling ashamed.

The next day,  while riding the bus to internship. I decided to write down my feelings  and what my opinion was towards our relation. I told him, that I'm not  sure to continue like this, if I keep breaking down when something bad  happens. This can be loosing someone that I care about, or just having  to change my way of living, in order to be proud of myself and perform  better. At the end of the day, while I was working, he sends me a text  back, saying that what I said was correct. He also said that he wanted  me to be proud of myself and that I can do more than that I think of  myself. He also said that he wanted to stay friends and maybe give our  relation another try when I feel better.

I  went to the back of the store, cause I got so mad at myself, that I  punched the wall a couple of times and gave my phone a flying lesson.  After a while I got up and continued working. When my  colleagues asked  what was wrong, I told them and yet again I broke. I didn't leave the  office for a solid hour, just crying and thinking about that dark path  once again. A  colleague/ girlfriend, stayed with me trying everything  she could to get that idea out of my head. She succeeded more than the  social work and psychologist. But I was still mad at myself. I don't  know why, but in my head the best idea was to ignore my colleagues. So I  decided to do that. A couple hours later I broke free of my bad  thoughts, and realized what I did to my colleagues and friends. I was  feeling super super bad.

All of  this because I can't say no, cant talk about the way I feel and thinking  personally that I'm just a flop that is just to weak to handle life.  How can I say no without it giving me a bad feeling. How can I decide  what I need and not just look at others. How to express myself without  me feeling ashamed.

Tnx"

They wanted a third interview because they weren't sure after the first two (I've come to this conclusion after reading several posts here and on Quora). 
I really want this but am pretty nervous have have mixed feelings about my third interview. I think the interviewer wanted a more optimized solution. 
Also, it's almost the end of December and even if I do make it to host matching, I think my chances are pretty slim according to some posts I've read. 

I have a couple of questions,
1. I was contacted by the recruiter specifically for Google Singapore, so I'm not sure how the host matching will be done( given that I pass the third interview) since I've heard that we're needed to fill our preferred locations.

2. It's the holiday season and I am not sure how long should I wait for the third interview result.

3. This is not the first time I'm interviewing for Google. I was contacted by a different recruiter a few months ago for SWE Intern at Google India. I did not get through the 2 Hangouts interviews. My current recruiter said it was a close call last time and Google Singapore is hiring so we'd like you to interview again.

I am not sure if writing this will help me in anyway. But I just wanted to let this out because I have been imagining the worst and I really want this:)

Also, I have a offer from Microsoft India which I'll have to accept once I get the interim offer letter in about 1-2 weeks. (I interned there this summer and got a reinternship offer.)"

I was a mess that week and decided to cancel the interview, I wasn't graduating on time and my psyche was at an all-time low so it just didn't feel worth the effort. I wanted to focus on classes instead but doing that still felt awful. Fast forward to now and I just feel lost, I did awful this semester and my GPA is now down to a 2.85, I still have no internship experience and the 3.0 feels unobtainable.

I ended up working 40 hours a week serving tables for four years just to make ends meet, pay for classes, etc. I never had the chance to get an internship because I was always retaking classes or dealing with family stuff on long breaks and so it got pretty discouraging watching my friends get offers and stuff.

Things can happen y’all. You don’t need an internship to land your first job and it’s okay to serve tables and work other shitty jobs. Employers will see who you really are! Just be genuine, work hard and keep your head down.

&amp;nbsp;

If any of these statements sound familiar, then this is the post for you:

* I decided to become a CS major because it makes money and programming seems kinda cool, I guess
* I hate all of my classes and don't find them relevant
* I have little motivation to learn things / study programming outside of the things that personally interest me
* I'm not all that smart, and honestly, I don't really want to work all that hard
* I don't want to be a programmer for the rest of my life

&amp;nbsp;

If you're not one of these people, then that's fine too! One of my best friends works at a FAANG - we have different life goals and I'm really happy for their success. I'll eventually try to end up there, but if it never happens, then I won't be upset.

&amp;nbsp;

So when I started college, I did nothing the summer of my Freshman year - I worked at a local library making $10 an hour. Very impressive, I know. I didn't even know that freshman could apply for internships, and I barely knew anything more advanced than basic recursion.

&amp;nbsp;

Sophomore year was much the same. I sucked at programming. I needed help in all my classes, mainly because I had no understanding of why anything mattered and how it was actually used in the real world. But somehow, due complete luck, I got an internship with a bank.

&amp;nbsp;

I literally have no idea how or why, to be completely honest. I didn't deserve it - and that's not me being modest (slightly off-topic, but I genuinely think interviews were easier back in 2016). But, here's the thing. That internship actually was amazing in terms of professional growth, despite the fact that I maybe worked 15 hours a week on a 40-hour salary. I finally understood why and how the basic stuff we were taught in class worked, and I was able to try and put things together and start creating new things of my own.

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, I'm sure some of you are thinking I'm about to tell you the story of my Leetcode montage and how I managed to work at Google the next year. Well, I didn't.

&amp;nbsp;

I worked at another bank for the next summer.

&amp;nbsp;

But here's the thing. I was a much more competent programmer. My classes in college were still useless, but I was learning on-the-job and I was getting surprisingly adept at making things. I still had a somewhat meh internship, but I accomplished a couple of neat things and I was able to get a return offer for a much cooler city due to sheer dumb luck and pretty aggressive networking.

&amp;nbsp;

So I took it. Yes, indeed, I worked at a bank again. But see, before I accepted that offer, I actually started a bit of Leetcode. I got ridiculously lucky with the OA and made it to a phone screen with a FAANG (due to my friend's referral), which I promptly failed in the most miserable way. I said to myself, ""well whatever, I just suck at programming, and just be thankful the bank worked out."" 

&amp;nbsp;

So I spent all of last summer (2019) working there. Another meh internship, so I tried to do some interview prep and a bit of Leetcode when I could force myself to practice. I think Firecode is actually a lot better at gently encouraging you to work at it - I honestly find Leetcode pretty discouraging.

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short - I didn't, but I kinda did. Now, look, this is a success story, so let me explain. I made it to a few onsites, one being Amazon (they have the easiest interview process I think out of all of them - I still didn't end up working for them, lol). I don't know what happened at one of the onsites, because I genuinely thought I aced it, but I was rejected and that was okay because there's always next year.

&amp;nbsp;

However, there was one company that did give me an offer, which ended up being a 33% raise over the company I interned with.

&amp;nbsp;

So in short, if you'll excuse the rambling nature of this, I got really lucky. I worked hard, and I managed to leverage my degree into a good, stable job that pays well, in a really fun city, and if I can do it so can you. Not everyone will work at Google their freshman year, and not everyone can grind their way to Lyft off of one summer of practice. But you can succeed, and you should be proud of where you are. If your best is a stable, well-paying job, then that's better than most of the people in the USA, and you need to keep that in perspective."

Couple of questions. Keep in mind I'm in Germany.

I have an internship coming up at a Next10 Audit Company in Transaction Advisory Services. It will mostly consist of financial due diligence and data analytics (python, R).
The plan afterwards would be to grind my grades up (not bad but not really great atm) and use some contacts I gained through networking to land another M&amp;A related internship at one of the Big4 - due to the nature of my contacts, probably FDD once again albeit Valuation would also be a possibility.  This would all happen while I'm doing my Bachelors, other internships I'd like to complete during a gap year or during my masters.

Thing is, long(ish) term I'd like to get into ""proper"" M&amp;A Consulting at one of the B4 (heard they offer more humane work hours in that area, IB isn't a possibility and I'm not really considering a M&amp;A Boutique) - not really looking to crunch excel and data all day at the office, I'd actually like to have client contact and travel time as long as I'm young. But I count myself lucky to get some TAS/Big Data expierence considering my CV up to this point. Would this background be enough? What alternative internships could be beneficial? Any tips and tricks?

Cheers guys and enjoy your hard earned holidays."

I have about 7 grand saved up and a car that runs good. I have a B.S. in IT and want to move to either Charlotte or Raleigh-Durham area. 

First, I am not thinking about getting up and leaving right this instant. I just graduated and its the holidays so things will pick up in January. I live in FL and have ""Will Self-Relocate"" on my resume. For anyone in IT, some more info would be that I have a 4 month internship and I'm studying for the A+ cert. I am mainly looking at Help desk / desktop support type roles for entry level experience. There are a ton of jobs in both cities so I am positive in time I will get something.   


Call me crazy or whatever you want, but I really want to move out of this state bad. I have a few connections in FL that havent lead to anything yet and I really am not even wanting to find work here. I am almost concerned I will get a job offer in FL. That may seem crazy, but I really want to leave and the longer I am here the more likely something will turn up and a connection will send in my resume. So I feel like ""logic"" or whatever, tells me to not ignore the connections in FL, but my heart is telling me to leave.  I have friends who want me to stay and are putting pressure on me to focus my job search locally, but again, I want to move up north. NC have so many job opportunities in my field of interest.   


I guess Im posting this, because I have thought about just leaving for NC sometime early next year if a job offer doesnt come my way. I feel like that may be crazy, I dont know... I just am thinking that being local would really help me a lot. I am concerned that my current location will cause me to lose on several opportunities.   


I mean, if I had 7-8 grand and moved that money could last me several months. I could get a retail job or something while I waited for something to turn up. I guess I dont know how I would find roommates if I dont have proof of income? that could be tricky.  My biggest fear is running out of all my money and being forced to head back home ""defeated"". Getting a job before moving is preferable.   


I have wanted to move up north for years and worry the longer I stay in FL the more my friends and connections will shove jobs in FL in my face. I worry about getting a job and feeling stuck in my hometown or generally just in my state. I need to be patient to see what happens in January, but I thought about having a set date to move with or without a job.   


Thoughts? Any in IT have any thoughts on my situation? Advice?"

efaiqy,6,2019-12-24,"Chances of getting into a Liberal Arts College, transferring from Canada",trailblaze322,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/efaiqy/chances_of_getting_into_a_liberal_arts_college/,"Hello friends,

I'm an Indian-born male who lives in Canada and currently study Computer Science at Western University. I'm looking to get into some top liberal arts colleges in the US, although I know its unlikely even for those who have high grades (which I don't), I wanted to hear some thoughts.

* During my freshman year I struggled with mental health due to a relationship and almost dropped out so I got an 62% that year which is essentially a 1.3 or so GPA
* Sophomore year (half way through it right now), I'm back and got a 3.0 GPA this semester (didn't know about these colleges until now), and will aim higher for next semester. So I think by end of sophomore year I'll have around 1.9 or 2.0 GPA...
* I also had a 91% avg in high school or a 3.7 GPA
* I've built two startups, one of which was invited out to YCombinator in San Fran to interview for some venture capital
* I'm a leader in 2 clubs on campus and a Software Developer in another
* I interned at Accenture during my freshman summer

My ideal places are: Harvey Mudd, Ponoma, Claremont McKenna, Williams, Amherst. But I'm also more than happy to go to a less notable school like Middlebury or Colby or Bates or what have you. Since I'm a CS student, I'm looking to get a general CS education alongside some philosophy, psychology, politics, and economics. 

My main reason for transferring is **people**, my current school isn't so great, most people are just optimizing for jobs, not learning and as much as I see some merits in those ideologies from a job security standpoint, I'm **quite a bit** more, ""entrepreneurial"" and free handed with my life, so I want to be around people who are extremely intelligent and more open minded and not worried about jobs too much so they focus on new, fun, and innovative things. My second reason is the networks and opportunities. When it comes to opportunities like internships, travel, etc. all the aforementioned colleges have companies and organizations come to them and recruit personally. These companies **want** these students. At my current school, this is not the case, I want to be in a place where such opportunities are abundant, I'm getting a truly substantial education and meeting a wealth of brilliant people.

Honest thoughts much appreciated, if you have any other ideas that fit my mould that I've not mentioned, please share them! I'm open to hearing about things outside of Liberal Arts Colleges as well!"

In early May was the first time I felt *truly* depressed. This was back in Canada, where I went to visit some of my friends there. It honestly felt like a dream: Ever since my dad passed away back in 2012 I kinda ""lost"" my family with it. I'd like to blame all of that on my family, but I can't say I've been trying too hard to get them back.

A few years later I got into Twitch, and it was a place where I felt truly accepted: I've always been an outsider, but on Twitch, I felt like I could really be me. I've 'travelled' a lot around Twitch but there's a few communities where I've settled. I've grown really close to these people, to the point where I like to call them ""my actual family."" Anyway, earlier this year I decided I'd go visit them, I ""had the money"" and there was a meetup planned where we could all hang out. As I said, it felt like a dream, it had been a long time since I felt *so* at home. Skip to the next day, I wake up, and next thing I know I'm sitting in the shower crying about the fact this is a life I might never have.

The reason I was ""able"" to go to Canada in May was because I didn't have uni. But I was supposed to. I was supposed to fix an internship for that half year, the next thing on my study schedule. However, for the past two years, there's just been a lot of times where I've been sabotaging myself. Looking for this internship was one of those, I kept postponing it until the moment where I was too late. No internship, meaning I can't do anything for the next half year. But hey, I had a fair amount of tests I had to retake because I failed them (guess what, I postponed studying for them, or working on them), so I just told my family ""I had chosen to take this half year to retake those tests I had failed previously,"" not mentioning I had just not searched for an internship.

Anyway, I came to talk with some friends for Canada and they were talking about a Twitch meetup happening in May. At first I was joking I would come, but at some point I was just thinking ""Why not? I don't have uni right now -"" I didn't have to redo my tests until June ""- I have the money, I might as well go."" So I went to Canada, had the meetup, feel completely depressed the next day. I should mention the crying wasn't just the only thing at that point. My feeling depressed is something I would describe as how you feel when you're sick, completely tired, and just feel like crying, except there was no way to get better, because ""I wasn't actually sick"" (physically, I guess).

I managed to get myself better before the flight back, took it, and ""slept the rest off."" At this point I had quit my job: I had a Saturday-job on the side, and quit this in April, because I wasn't feeling it anymore, and it would save me from taking time off for my Canada-trip. I promised myself I would look for a job after I came back, but I never did. I started spending basically all my time on Twitch, because that's where I felt good. Basically all streamers I follow are ET (timezone), 6 hours behind me in CET: Hey, I don't really have a job anyway, why not just adjust my sleep schedule to ET, and be able to watch more streams. So, that's what I did.

Not much really happened then, I was feeling great spending all my time at those streams, and didn't really see a problem. Problems started when uni started again back in September. I had to start retaking my project I did late 2018 (the semester *before* the internship), I had failed it because of not having written a proper ""justification report,"" (you basically write down *what* you did, when, and describe how all these things show you should pass), because (surprise!) I had started on my report way too late. Anyway, the first 7 weeks were fine, I only had 1 class per week, in the afternoons, so it would still work with my ET sleep schedule.

Then, by now almost two months ago. I got sick. Actually sick (question mark?). It was the week *before* I would have to go full-time on the project. (First 8 weeks are preparation). Anyway, I felt terrible stomach cramps and nausea. I went to my General Practitioner to have it checked out. He suggest some nausea-medicine: didn't help. Checked for parasites, found possible ""badly behaving"" bacteria, got antibiotics: didn't help. Tested for gluten allergy through blood tests, stopped consuming dairy to see if I might be lactose intolerant: didn't help. I went to my GP again, and I'm now scheduled for intestinal examination at the hospital, to see if there's something there.

However, I've started to think that this might be a mental thing. Over these past few weeks I've been feeling depressed several times (since May it happened a few times, but at most twice a month, these weeks at least twice a week). I tried to fix my sleep schedule, but I just lie awake with my thoughts at a thousand miles an hour. I kept thinking it would just fix itself, but what if it doesn't?

I think I'm at the point where I might need professional help. However, the way it works here is you have to go to your GP, they can send you through to a mental health professional. But this requires me to go to my GP and talk about all of this. I'm not sure I'm ready to do that: Once I say that, it's *real*, and I don't want it to be.

I've spent way too much typing this out and it might've been one of the hardest things I've done in a long time. I'm pretty sure I need professional help, but as I said, I don't know if I'm ready for it. Does anyone have any advice on how to ""become ready,"" for this."

For a 4 month stay I needed a so called mkv visum. I fulfilled all the requirements expected from me before I left. 

When I arrived I needed to fulfill five steps for the immigration department . They were pretty easy except the 4th and 5th step. So I did those immediately at my arrival. I needed to upload the right documents, pay some fee at the ministry etc. At my home country I got a visum for 90 days and at arrival I would get a stamp that's legal for the first 30. For the remaining 60 days I needed to go to another ministry to get the other stamp. The requirement for the stamp was that I got it within the first 30 days( before the other stamp expires) 

Well I fucked up, I already got a reply from the department for the extended period after the first 90 days. They said they would get back to me within 60 days and I thought that it was all sorted.
I'm leaving next week and just remembered about the stamp. So I went there and they wouldn't help me the only thing they said is your illegal here go away!

- Investigate new ways to automate deployments, canary analysis, and rollbacks.

Merry Christmas!",itrickletap9,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/efcyla/i_just_realized_my_mom_is_a_narcissistic_my/,"I'm so sorry if this is going to be long and rambly but I just need to vent and talk all of this out. 

So, I'm currently a junior in college and am home for winter break. My brother came home like two days after I did from Seattle where he recently got a job as a software engineer at Oracle. The first two days I was here were fine, everyone treats me nice and pampers me and everything is all happy and dandy. Its just me, my mom, and my dad at home btw. 

BUT as soon as my brother comes home, everyone forgets about me, especially my mom. Every conversation is pointed towards my brother, who is now viewed so highly because of his new job, new city and new life. He literally always becomes to center of attention every time he comes home. My mom and dad constantly keep asking him questions about his new everything, which is fine, I understand it's exciting and I'm happy for him too. The thing is, I am feeling forgotten and blend into the background now. 

I guess the story really starts the very next morning after he comes home. I was eating cereal and my dad tells me I overdrafted my checking account again. Oops, sorry, it was an honest mistake. I had done it twice in the past over the span of about 3 ish years. My dad was annoyed because they charge $35 for overdraft fee and rightfully so and I accepted the mistake. Also, about a month ago I lost my phone while hiking with my friends. My friends and I spent an hour looking around for it. It was a dangerous trek because we got way off of the trail on the way up and we decided we couldn't risk spending more time looking for it since it was starting to get dark and we still had an hour to go back down. It broke my heart because it was an honest mistake and this is the second phone I have lost due to hiking. The first one way about a year ago and I fell into the edge of a waterfall and it got water damaged. Anyways, I did everything I could in the moment, and my friends told me ""your parents would understand you leaving it rather than risking your safety"" which I didn't believe but there wasn't much else I could do. Since then I have been using my friend's old iPhone 6 that is isn't unlocked so I can't really text/call without Wifi or data. I didn't explain the details of that story to them at the time because I was preparing for finals and really stressed about school and I know this would just put an extra stress on them and myself. So, I didn't tell them until I came home.

Anyways, after my dad told me about my bank account and he left, my mom stayed in the kitchen and just continued scolding me about all the mistakes I'm making and listing them all out and making me feel like shit about everything. They were both mistakes and I accept it and did what I could to try to fix it. I did the best I could in the midst of finals seasons and the semester ending. Then she mentioned that my dad spent over $500 getting my tires replaced last month (??) because they needed to get replaced. This pissed me off because I was like what does that have to do with the bank overdraft or phone thing? The tires needed to get replaced and he did it? I didn't break them or something? It's not my fault they had to get replaced. I argued back and said to stop adding on more things on top of my head that don't make sense to the actual issue at hand. She then proceeded to say I was unappreciative of the money they spend on me, I only bring problems into the house, and overall I'm a burden on them. Okay cool thanks mom nice hospitality after coming home after so long. My mom has a bad habit of bringing up old shit to pile on top of new shit to fuel her rage towards me so it was a familiar but sad thing to do to me. 

After all this, I was just plain upset. I went to my room and just stayed in there working on applications and leetcode. Meanwhile, I could hear her acting all happy and laughing with my brother in the living room as if everything was normal. May I just mention that my brother has shattered and broken several phones in his past, made of a lot of financial fuck ups, and in fact, he bumped a curb which screwed up his aligning and that is what prompted my dad to get his and my tires replaced in the first place. He isn't perfect at all. I am a lot more responsible than him in terms of external duties and he is actually pretty immature in that sense. My parents used to say that about me alot when he caused problems. 

So I just kept getting more and more upset in my room. I started crying pretty heavily at one point because I noticed my mom never scolds my brother anymore, just me. I can't believe she called me a burden but then continues to pamper and spoil my brother. It sucks because I have never been treated as an equal to him, I am always second place, especially ever since he visits home from college, work, and now seattle. I am doing the same major he did in college, same college, and am currently on track to do just as well as him, so why I am treated so badly? I'm not going to be here for much longer. Winter break is my longest break now. I most likely won't be here this summer for an internship, or the year after, and who knows when I will come home after that. Why am  I still treated like a child and get blamed for tiny things?

Later, my mom came into my room and found me crying because I was just so hurt that this is the treatment I always get. She sarcastically and insensitively asks ""oh, did you find out about your grades???"" She knows I had been extremely stressed about my grades near the end of the semester and that was just fucking rude of her to say. After that I just snap and say everything that had been on my mind. About how she treats my brother so nicely when he comes home but then treats me like shit, called me a burden, and then I said that it seems like she only loves him and not me.  I went off basically and screamed and yelled in tears. Probably not the best approach to explain how I feel but I couldn't take it anymore. She then screamed at me back and said that I am undeserving and disrespectful and not to call her mom anymore. And then my dad took me away and tried to console me but my dad isn't the best at making me feel better. He told me he loved me no matter what though which was nice. 

Ever since then I have just been so upset and keep feeling like crying every so often. I have just been cooped up in my room by myself while I can hear my mom and brother talking to each other like everything is all normal. I was talking to my cousin and she told me that basically it seems like whenever brother comes home, she gains the confidence to yell at me and use me as a scapegoat to release whatever tension she may have about other things. And it does feel like that because before he came home, she knew about my phone thing but wasn't being THAT mean about it. But then suddenly when he comes home and my dad mentions the overdraft, that's her chance to yell about everything to me. And it doesn't bother her if I go into my room and don't come out because my brother is always in the living room and giving her company basically. She has a supporter with her so she doesn't feel guilty about what she said or what she's doing to me. It's a gang mentality. My brother normally treats me like shit too but hasn't been too much because I think he figured there was already some tension between my mom and I. (the fight happened while he was out that night). I don't think she feels guilty about it at all. Or has tried to understand how I feel. 

Lastly, just wanted to mention this part because I think it goes with the gang mentality thing they have going on. I decided I wanted to start running again and training for a half marathon with my friend who is already a great runner and has ran a half marathon before. We signed up for a half marathon a while ago for March and we figured out my training schedule and stuff. She suggested I get the garmin forerunner 35 which she has been using for a few years now. I trust her because running is her entire life, she has been doing it for a young age and she's essentially coaching/training with me. I looked into the watch and I was like okay cool it looks simple and nice enough to keep track of what I would like and its not too expensive. My mom was asking me if I wanted anything for christmas a few weeks back so I suggested that and she agreed it would be a good thing. 

After I came home my mom was talking to me about the watch and asked if I wanted that one or a better garmin with more features and I was like nah I want this simple one and she also mentioned she was going to get the same one for my brother too. I already knew that would be a bad idea because my brother is so critical of literally anything that is my idea or basically any new thing he doesn't know about. I knew he would think the watch is stupid and useless. The morning before I was having the cereal, they were talking about it in the living room and my brother was like ""mom, don't get the watch for me, i don't need that. Real runners don't run with watches"". And then I was like, ""have you ever met a real runner? Because my friend who actually runs at the collegiate level recommended to me. you aren't a real runner."" (i didn't say it like that exactly but you get the idea). and he like was ""okay well maybe they do, but still I dont need it. I don't like to run with things on me"". okay cool good 4 u. Then immediately after that, my mom says to me ""when two people are talking, don't talk in the middle. we were having a conversation, you don't need to come in and give your opinion"". Which is whatever. She always tells me things like that. But I was like I know you guys were talking but the watch was my idea and I wanted to explain why it could be a good thing. whatever. So then shortly after that was when the cereal yelling event occured, and then the fight after that. And so it kind of makes sense that I was so fed up with how she treats me.

Literally as I was writing this, I heard my mom and brother talking in the living room again. They are talking about the watch again and it sounds like they both did ""research"" on it. I'm not sure what my brother was saying about it because I couldn't hear well, but I already know his viewpoint on watches and stuff like this anyways. He believes his opinion is superior with anything so no wonder he wouldn't open up his mind to see the benefits of it. He thinks that running with nothing at all is what real, genuine runners do! we don't need technology because we are animals! real runners just go out into nature and run! Any research he may have done on it is probably just like ""it keeps track of steps? thats fucking stupid. oh it keeps track of mileage? ...useless! who would buy this shit"" something along the lines of that. Then I heard my mom's opinion on it and she was like ""yeah I read an article where this women was using it to keep track of her activity but then slowly became obsessed with it and it ruined her life"". I also heard from her ""yeah it's for people who are lazy and have trouble keeping up with a schedule"". So basically they were shit talking this thing I asked for to help me achieve a goal and that apparently makes me lazy, undisciplined, and not a real runner. Of course my mom suddenly changes her opinion of it as soon as she learns about what my brother thinks of it... But she will probably still get it anyways just for my sake while she keeps these ""opinions"" of it inside. It just hurt to hear them gossiping about it the night before.

Sorry this was super long. I'm mentally drained and exhausted from constantly being the scapegoat and my mom and my brother ganging up on me in every scenario. She has rarely ever treated me equal to him. I apparently shouldn't speak when the two of them are talking, because my opinion doesn't matter, only theirs do. I'm always second place. No one has asked me about how my semester at school went, no one has taken a single interest in my life, no one asks me anything in fact. Every conversation is about my brother or something that he brings up. Oh, and half time I can't chime in or I'm being nosy and its a 2 person conversation. My presence literally doesn't matter to them, whether I'm in my room or not, they wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I might as well go back to school because this is not the way I wanted to spend my winter break. I hate this toxic fucking environment. I hate that my mom treats my brother like a king and me like a slave. I hate that she called me a burden and a money waster and unappreciative and undeserving and disrespectful. All the while my brother is such a great and important and honorable person! (even tho he has been actually extremely disrespectful to my parents many times n the past). Why is it always like this for me? Why am I not treated as important? Even back when he was in college and I was in high school, we got this same treatment. Every conversation was about him and his cool new college life and my boring high school life didn't matter suddenly. I'm just hurt and this is the worst christmas ever. I don't deserve this kind of treatment from my family. I deserve to come home to a loving supportive family after one of my toughest semester but nah, I'm just a burden. 

Thank you for reading my rant and if anyone wants to cheer me up or give me advice please do so. I'm in such a terrible mood. :("

It's good to see you again, spending all of 2019 together is a good feel and a good and you're a good and everyone's a good - 

Well. Almost everyone. There's some of you that aren't awesome, that aren't acting like the Human Mr. Rogers knew you could be, and aren't acting cash money. You know who you are....

&amp;#x200B;

...and if you don't, well. The odds are they're most likely on Zephyr Station 8.

===================================================

A/N: Whole chapter posted here in the spirit of CRIMMIS.

= = = = = = = = =

&amp;#x200B;

  

The podium was envied - not because it was a position of power, or of attention, or of control. That’s usually the person *behind* the podium, but in this case nobody envied Glenn - his job actually had *responsibility*, and as we all know that is to be shunned at every opportunity. 

No, the podium was envied for the simple fact that as a construction of wood, wiring and glass it couldn’t and didn’t have to deal with the bullshit that was currently going down. Said bullshit was, of course, the ChristmaHanukKwanzStice party planning meeting. Last Year’s processing of skippers was on-par in terms of metrics; both in quantity of humans sent to the stars and quality/originality of complaints levied against staff. The resulting pre and post-flashbang Holiday Cards were printed and shipped out to various family members, government offices and fellow Zephyr Stations, and the almost unanimous feedback was “eh, pretty decent. I’ve seen worse.”

After said feedback (and the regrowing of his retinas no less than 5 times) Glenn was determined to do better this year. 

“-And so, with the professionals hired this year we will *not* have a raffle for Santa or his helpers.” Glenn “Silk” Abramson said, taking a sip out of his ‘this might not just be coffee’ mug, pressing the indicator on his podium to move to the next slide. “-however, you are all free to dress up as you see fit-”

A wave of hands went up.

“-as long as it’s holiday themed-”

A few hands went down.

“-*winter* holiday themed-”

A few more hands went down, and Glenn eyed the remaining troublemakers.

“-a *federally recognized* winter holiday-”

A few more hands went down with audible pouting. Good, good. Now to kill the creativity and holiday spirit in the rest.

“-without sexual innuendo-”

Almost all the rest of the hands went down. All but one - but it belonged to Mike, so Glenn decided to head it off at the pass.

“-save for Mike, who will wear last year’s costume.”

The chorus of gasps and verbal outrage washed over Glenn “The warp is taking me” Abramson, warming his soul more than the half-drunk cup of ‘hot whiskey’ brand coffee ever could. He leaned back slightly, gripping the podium as he dared to let a smile break across his stubble-laden face.

The red indicator light he saw through his closed eyes caused him to instantly frown. Looking up he locked eyes with the Jornissian … cohort, the viewscreen bolted to the back of the amphitheater showing a writhing mass of scales and tails, every so often the writhing mass was intermittently broken up with the garish colors of hand-picked terrible christmas sweaters. A couple-dozen eyes stared at him intently, furiously boring a hole into his being as they pressed the button as one, in unison, dozens and dozens of fingers methodically pumping up and down and-

Glenn shook his head, knocking the mental image just loose enough so his hind-brain monkey could rip it out of the wall and throw it into the void. He *still* had phantom muscle soreness from last year’s New Years party, and the memories never truly faded…

“Hashtag Team Pinchpot, what.” Glenn said, tapping the indicator light to turn it off and let the Jornissians have their say.

“\[Stationmaster Glenn, will you allow us to participate in this year’s festivities?\]” A Blue-sweatered Jornissian said, lowering it’s head to stare more intently at the shared camera. 

“You don’t even know what we’re doing-”

“\[…so?\]” Bluesweater Longbody said, looking at their colleagues. “\[Is… is that a problem?\]”

“Just. No. Just. So Management got together and figured out an office Stealing Santa-”

Indicator Light.

With a sigh born out of years of longing for a government pension to finally fully vest, Glenn clicked the indicator, the Dorarizin screen finally unmuting much to the *rippling growls* of everyone present at that particular remote part of the station. A muzzle popped up from the apparently communal desk, and for a brief moment Glenn pondered what that particular Dorarizin was doing under the others.

His brain-monkey, with an animalistic shriek, launched itself at that particular memory and beat it into submission.

The body-less muzzle split it’s lips with grinning teeth, “\[Stationmaster, you just said that there would be no amateur Holiday Alpha. If that is not the case, we vote for you aga-\]”

“NO.” Glenn said, a little too loudly into the mic, the pop of feedback causing the Humans to jump a bit. “No. Not again - I *still* owe Lenscrafters back pay on my new eyes.” He said, aggressively pointing at the Dorarizin screen. “And I only get the shitty 20/20 base rejuv plan. Look. Stealing Santa is a gift exchange on the 24th, nothing more. No Dress-ups. No Moose Horns. *No children*.”

The speaking-muzzle paused for a moment, a broad tongue sticking out in a blep before *rows of rippling teeth* pulled it back in. “\[-but it is the Holiday Alpha.\]”

“No. It’s just about the holid- It’s. Santa - *fuck you should know this by now*.” Glenn ‘Did nobody read the pamphlets anymore’ Abramson said, growling into his cup.

“Aww, but we want storytime-”

“Mike your elf costume is now your standard work outfit.”

Mike cut his mockery short, quickly looking around his local group. “He can’t do that… he can’t do that, right? Right?”

Shrugs were all that he received, and Glenn continued. “Santa gives gifts to all the good boys, girls and attack helicopters across the Solar System-”

The third indicator light flicked on, but Glenn ignored it. “-and so the gift exchange takes it’s name from that legend. On the 24th of this month, Management is going to provide gifts-”

The third indicator light somehow turned on *brighter*, and yet was still ignored. “-and everyone will pick a random one, and then we’ll do a round of trading-”

The third indicator light turned off, which immediately gave Glenn chills. Looking up, he saw the Karnakian flock looking *incredibly happy about something*. A cold pit of fear opened up in Glenn’s gut as the unmute indicator somehow *turned off by itself*. “\[Hello Brother Stationmaster Glenn\~!\]”

“How… how did you do that? You shouldn’t be able to un-mute yourself at all from over there.” Glenn murmured in confusion as a touk-wearing Karnakian got a little too close to the camera. 

“\[It is a Holidaysmas Miracle!\]”

“That - that’s not how this works, that’s not how-”

“\[Then the stars are in alignment! Bretheren, can we participate by providing the gifts ourselves?\]”

Glenn shook his head **no** as hard as he could, individual vertebrae popping with the motion. “Absolutely-”

The vid screen muted again, the Karnakian delegation getting *unreasonably* animated over the cutoff answer, individual touk-poms wiggling in excitement.

“-**NOT**. Fuckdamnit!” Glenn growled, angrily fingering his button-

His brain-monkey screeched as it launched itself at yet another memory with zealous fervor. 

\-but to seemingly no avail. “Listen. LISTEN. We’ve picked out some nice approved gifts, they don’t go over a 20GRC limit, you *can’t* just-”

“\[Stationmaster, if the Karnakian delegation is planning on giving your staff gifts could we participate as well?\]”

Glenn continued to aggressively finger his podium, upper body shaking with the effort. “*Listen here team constantly beeping, you can’t do this to me I have diplomatic immunity-*”

“\[I mean that’s not a *no*\-\]” Hashtag Team Pinchpot said, musing out loud.

“\[Oooh, do you think \[Asuka\] would mind sharing? That’s a lot of vigor-\]” An unknown Dorarizin female said, before with the crackling of wood and the breaking of glass, Glenn’s whole fist went through the top of the podium.

The podium’s controls were utterly destroyed, and with the pop of broken circuits the vidscreens shut off. 

It’s problems were over now. 

It was still envied.

= = = = =

For the Xenos, getting the actual list of gifts and participants was the easy part; Human encryption was almost at-par with the galactic community once standards were shared, but the inexorable momentum of forcing password changes once every 30 days caused some very obvious permutations of “password12345”, and biometric locks were passed with frightening ease considering that their species left bits of themselves, well, *everywhere*. The target Humans were divvied up by lottery, and in the end each “lucky” soul on Zephyr Station 8 had a group of 3-5 xenos pooling their resources together to get them something nice from the list of approved gifts. Well. Nic**er**. 

The list was really a *guideline*, after all.

When this was made known to the “lucky” souls on Zephyr Station 8, they started to drop some very pointed hints for their alien friends as to what makes a good gift, what size of diamond-studded sequin jacket would fit them, and the fact that Disco was never coming back so you may as well not buy those floating sparkleballs and instead invest in something more useful, like desert-pattern-camo automatic underwater basket weavers. 

None of this was lost on Stationmaster Glenn ‘Why, God’ Abramson, who at every turn attempted to assert his official authority over a voluntary non-work function and reign in some of the enthusiasm, backroom dealing and outright material theft.

This went about as well as you’d expect.

= = = = = 

The 24th was greeted with anticipation, joy and wonderment by many Humans of many ages, most of which were on Earth or one of her colonies and far away from the radiating dread that was pouring from Glenn ‘My Ancestors weep’ Abramson. The fact that what should have been a bunch of minor holiday parties with a manager and his or her subordinates had turned into an all-hands, station-wide Festival that took up the *entire* ballroom of Deck Q-25 and at least half of the neighboring Aggrograg training summit and Arblebees’ Deli was not lost on him, nor was the fact that he had utterly lost control of how the day would go and who would start off with what gift. 

His concerns had been ignored for the past few days, and so it seemed that he was the only one to comprehend two things:

1) Not breaking this party up into smaller, cohesive groups meant that there were well over 200 gifts to exchange. And steal. At once. Multiple times.

2) The station was going to be totally run by automated subroutines and xenos volunteers, which really meant that they were all replaceable and that his suffering was for naught. *That this was a strand-type career-*

“\[Good morning, \[Glenn\]! How are you doing today?\]” Rgrezneh-of-Hrzgarenm / Sheila said, *far* too happily. 

“All is lost.”

“\[Aaah, it *is* Tuesday.\]” The Dorarizin nodded slightly, tilting her head as she did so. “\[I was hoping to run into you before we started - I wanted to thank you for \[Mike\]’s costume. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed-\]”

“You are the *only one* who has thoroughly enjoyed anything about that man or his body, and I would appreciate it if you kept those dark memories to yourself.” Glenn grumpily replied, stepping around the massive xenos to make his way to one of the double-door entrances to the ballroom. “I’m already dreading… this…”

The doors slid open on silent hinges showing a wide-open ballroom. Arranged throughout the ballroom floor were little islands of presents, surrounded by multiple human-appropriate snack and drink tables. Seating was provided around each gift island, and even that was colored in festive reds, whites and greens. Milling about were a majority of the remaining Human staff, weaving in and out of their corresponding gift-giving xenos “santas”. Hanging from the ceiling were the corresponding and appropriate banners in multiple human and xenos languages - all of them wishing a Happy Festive Season and/or the return of Sun, the Sun, to these darkened lands.

Glenn squinted at the last one… one of the Norwegians must’ve got time at the printer. He turned to Sheila, who was unfortunately still talking. “This seems normal.” He interrupted.

“\[Oh? We did do some research - Myself and \[Starburst\] and \[OHGODWHY\].” As Sheila said each name, the corresponding Jornissian and Karnakian turned and waved, making their way over to the entrance. “\[It’s good news to know that the instructions we reviewed were-\]”

“No. I mean. Nothing’s on fire.” Glenn said, tentatively sticking his head fully into the room to look around. “There’s… nothing *wrong*.”

“\[Is there supposed to be?\]” Sheila said, crouching down to properly speak to someone of Glenn’s height. 

“I don’t…know anymore. I just don’t know.”

“\[What don’t you know, Station-Patron? Is it a riddle? *I love riddles-\]”* OHGODWHY / Tr’Grakz the Karnakian said, starting to get reasonably unreasonably happy as his bullet-train of thought left the station and made a hard left on a straight track.

“\[Is everything to his liking?\]” Starburst, nee Shpressnrek said, clasping her hands together in mild concern. “\[He’s doing that *thing* with the full-body shaking-\]”

“It’s *fine*. Fine. It’s just a nervous disor- tic, is all.” Glenn said, straightening up and walking forward, checking the artificial christmas trees as he went for the PAVN. “It’ll be fine, it’s just like the kessel run back home.”

“YO!” 

Glenn turned to see Jessica standing up on her tiptoes, her hand waving enthusiastically over the body of a ducking Karnakian. “OVER HERE\~”

Glenn looked to his escort, who seemed to be encouraging him over to that location. With a mental shrug he walked over to one of the many, many piles of identically-wrapped presents, each individual box or orb seeming to blend into the ones beside it with a dizzying, shifting pattern of hard-light “wrapping paper”. As he got closer he realized he had to avert his eyes or be mesmerized; a few of his other colleagues had fallen prey to whatever siren song would have claimed him, much to the mild-and-growing concern of the xenos nearby. Holding a hand up to act as a blinder he made his way to Jessica, who was wearing *incredibly festive* sunglasses at night so she could so she could not watch the weave of lies that the mesmerizing presents were beaming to everybody present. 

“Ayy this is fuckin’ awesome, isn’t it?” The American said, grinning from ear to ear. “Free swag, good food, time off-”

“Technically this is off the clock,” Glenn said, flinching as the memetic hazard of wrapping paper splashed into his vision every so often as the crowd around him shifted, “So there’s no pay-”

“Bah. Stop being Scrooge! We were just waiting for you to get in, so we’re gonna start soon I think!” Jessica said, as a ripple of commands worked it’s way through the implants of the xenos present. Before he could protest further, Glenn found himself being ushered to one of the nearby seats that at first, second or third glance absolutely did not fit him at all. 

“Um.” He said, as Starburst coiled herself up loosely infront of him. “Where… am I sitting?”

The Jornissian opened her arms and Glenn exhaled, deep and slow. 

Of course.

“I’ll stand.”

“\[No you won’t!\]” OHGODWHY said, gently pushing him forward with his bodyweight. “\[You’ll block out the cameras-\]”

“Wait, *cameras*\-”

“\[Not important!\]” Tr’Grakz said, smiling with pure joy and anticipation as Glenn lost balance, tipping over into the waiting arms of the Jornissian, who was soon joined by the Dorarizin in an impromptu “sit on my lap of infinite length” seating arrangement. “\[I’m running the festivities today-\]”

“OHGODWHY-”

“\[Yes? Anyway, as Stationmaster you get the honor of opening the first gift!\]” Tr’Grakz crowed, camera drones suddenly zooming in from various hidden positions to focus on Glenn and Glenn alone. 

“No, Listen I neeuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhh-” Glenn droned as a hefty present was thrust into his lap, the pulsating and rippling effects of the Hard-Light wrapping paper unwillingly hijacking his train of thought, mesmerizing him utterly. The colors, the patterns - what did they *mean*, Mason? He started to see, to *know*, as the lotus of all knowledge bloomed before him, the galaxy unfolding in his very mind-

There was a clawed tap and the light turned off. Glenn’s eyes refocused and he scrunched his face up, his brain rebooting.

“…What.”

“\[Next year, not so many Holiday Lights.\]” Starburst stage-whispered to OHGODWHY, the Karnakian nodding sagely. With a frown he pressed a very obvious button on the container, the numetal shrinking and warping to reveal-

“-Um. Thank you?” Glenn said, holding up a solid lead crystal tumbler set, inlaid with gold, precious gems and alloys. There was what seemed to be engraved filigree at points, whole interlocking plates of metal studded and ordained with details upon details. Depictions from various human stories littered every inch of every open crystal fragment, and as the light caught them they blazed with inner fire.

It was the most thoughtful gift he’d ever gotten. It was the most *expensive* one, too. He sat there, a bit dumbfounded, as Tr’Grakz began to dance in place nervously. 

“\[Ah… ah… *NEXT!*\]” He said, quickly picking up and thrusting another present into another human’s hands. The process continued, but Glenn could not tell you how long he remained in a stupor - the gift, *this* gift, was incredible, and as he got lost in admiring it, a small, hairy, extraordinarily old and ape-like part of his brain gently tapped on his shoulder and whispered an indisputable fact into his ear:

*He was not worthy of this gift*.

‘Oh hello guilt, nice to meet you again.’ Glenn thought as he held his gift in his lap, looking up for the first time in many minutes to lock eyes with his other crewmates. The same look was plastered on their faces - yes, jokingly asking for a Faberge-egg back massager was fun, but to actually *get* one is… is…

It’s too much. It’s ***wrong***. 

“I uh-” Glenn started, looking around questioningly. The monkey part of his brain, grown strong from yeeting thoughts into the void, had assumed direct control. The important thing was not that he got a gift, no, it was that he got *rid* of the gift-that-he-was-not-worthy-to-have. Cause if he kept it then the other monkey who most definitely did exist and *was* worthy of the gift would take it from him and then *that would be bad*. He locked eyes with Jessica who was gently caressing a *perfect* faux-mahogany stock Gyrojet, every bit of it carved with intricate designs. Her hands didn’t really *touch* the weapon; they shook with the timidity of a master holding something of legend and realizing they were not worthy, giving it the hoverhand treatment all nerds give their prom dates when they’re 16. 

However, Glenn didn’t have that problem; he was *not* a gun aficionado. He nodded at her.

She nodded back.

He nodded more insistently.

She nodded back - 

*Damnit*, she didn’t have ESP. 

“G-give.” Glenn said, lifting up his own drink set. Jessica looked at him, confusedly, letting out a low-pitched and defensive *reeee* as she clutched the rifle.

“\[Stationmaster, is there a problem with your gift?\]” OHGODWHY said, leaning in far too closely for anyone’s comfort. Starburst shifted under him, and he used the momentum to wobble to his feet. “I… I steal from you!” He said, loudly and in the silence of an echoing ballroom.

“B-but-”

“\[Stationmaster, that is *not* necess-\]”

Glenn rounded on the Karnakian, crazy and desperate fury in his eyes. “This is Stealing Santa, and *I can’t be caught with this-*”

With determination he stepped through the coils of his seat, holding the probably-as-costly-as-his-yearly-salary drink set out to the American. “I’m stealing your gun.”

“SHALL FUCKING NOT-”

“*Prison Rules, Bitch*.” Glenn hissed, slav-squatting before the technician and her xenos-group-santa-seating who were giving him *very* sour looks. “And ***no*** stealbacks-”

“This- MUH RIGHTS-” Jessica cried as the drink set was placed in her lap, the weapon (after a little bit of wrestling) was wrested from her grip. With a growl she stood up, cradling the expensive set in her arms. “You CUNT. Fine, uh…-”

There was a look in her eyes as Glenn stepped back, the ape in his brain admiring his handywork. 

That look was not one to see what gift they wanted, no. That look was the look of the ape in *her* mind, looking for the perfect target. The person who had a gift that was perfect for them. The person who would cherish it for the rest of their days.

The person to hurt. 

“O-OI! YOU!” Jessica crowed, pointing to one of the interns who was holding out an *incredibly fancy* robe. “I’M STEALING THAT.”

The intern let out a low-pitched *reeee* noise that only got louder as Jessica stomped over, wielding the crystal drink tumbler set less as a family heirloom and more like a set of clubs to perform a beatdown with.

Glenn nodded in approval, up until the point that the gun was slowly tugged from his grip.

= = = = = 

Shpressnrek did not approve of this Festival custom. And sure, that might have made her sound “speciest” in some circles of the galnet, but the honest truth was that in *every* culture there are some things that you respect as theirs, some things that you ignore, and some things that you wholesale steal and make your own. It took multiple days of designing, 3 trips to 5 different nanofabricators and a favor to get a few things quantum-shipped to complete this drink set for their resident functioning alcoholic, and he just… he just *stole something* that Shpressnrek was almost certain he didn’t want and didn’t care for. The point was that each one of the warm-cuddles would get something custom-made for them as an appreciation for having a mostly professional work environment, and then they’d all have snacks.

Shpressnrek wanted to have snacks.

Shpressnrek did *not* want to have what was currently going on, which seemed to be a rippling, low-decibel screech that was passing from warm-cuddle to warm-cuddle as perfect gifts were exchanged for… less than perfect ones. This would, of course, not do - so after a few minutes of implant-to-implant conversation, it was decided by democratic vote (the best kind of vote) that if theft was the name of the game, then they would steal from the warm-cuddles. 

Just for tonight. Just to re-wrap and re-gift them again.

And so Shpressnrek found herself gently tugging on the antique weapon that was stolen from Eagle-screm by Astral-projecting-out-of-his-body-because-he’s-done-with-everything, with the goal of reuniting it with Eagle-screm’s group of species for damage-repair, re-wrapping and regifting.

“\[Hey! NO. I NEED THIS.\]” Astral-projecting-out-of-his-body-because-he’s- yanno what, let’s just go with Glenn - said, gripping the rifle in all the ways that gun safety disapproves of, but Kobain thought was pretty cool. 

“&lt;No, no-&gt;” Shpressnrek cooed, softly, trying to turn the barrel away from the warm-cuddle. “&lt;Let’s not, ok? You’re safe, don’t worry-&gt;”

“\[*That’s what they want you to think-*\]” Glenn hissed, wrapping his legs around Shpressnrek’s arm and torso as he attempted to wrestle the firearm out of her grip. “\[But then you’re in Manitoba and the trees start speaking first nation and-\]”

Whatever he was going to say was lost, as with a *thak* the ***apparently chambered*** weapon went off, the gyojet micromissile exiting the rifle and slamming into a digital christmas “tree”, causing it to spark and pop as it exploded in a beautiful, vibrant, *blinding* but ultimately harmless light show. 

“\[GUN GRABBER!\]” The hypocrite-formerly-known-as-Glenn yelled as he was shaken a little too firmly loose from his grip, landing with an audible *oof* on the cold metallic floor. 

“\[THREE PERCENT!\]” Someone else yelled from across the ballroom, as all hell broke loose.

= = = = =

‘&lt;The problem,&gt;’ mused Shpressnrek as she ducked behind an overturned table, her colleagues lobbing chunks of fruitcake at problem warm-cuddles as they assaulted her position, ‘&lt;is that war has changed.&gt;’

She dared to peek her head over the barricade as the current wave of thralls died down, trying to eye the battlefield and come up with a plan. Once the tree exploded some warm-cuddles thought they were under attack, some thought that their trees just *did that* and wanted to recreate it, and some of the more prescient ones apparently realized “it” was beginning, whatever *it* was, and started to exacerbate the situation. Shell in coil, striding across the ballroom-battlefield was a warm-cuddle instigator with an omni-directional pool noodle atop a robot ‘\[unicorn\]’, penta-monocle flipping through various visible spectrums as his self-replenishing caffeine drip gave him a manageable overdose of their aqua vitae. The fact that he had single-handedly stopped 4 separate waves of senate gift-teams was not the real issue, no.

The real issue was that he was in an elf costume the entire time. He *radiated* a powerful chaotic energy, and Shpressnrek ducked before they made eye contact.

Astral-Projecting Glenn had snapped out of whatever issue had possessed him to *steal a gift* during such a festive occasion and had joined the resistance, muttering something about ‘establishing dominance’, taking a little perverse glee in winging a ball of hardened \[stollen\] or \[christmas\] cake at anyone who came nearby, especially ‘that intern asok’ which seemed to be *everyone*. His zeal was burning through their ammunition, and according to the comms chatter not only were the other senate-gift giving teams pinned down by holiday cheer, but station security had deemed this little incident “within acceptable parameters”.

Shpressnrek made a note to *never* let a computer program manage security ever again in lieu of a sapient. 

“&lt;So, I’m out of ideas. Anyone?&gt;” Shpressnrek shrugged, tossing another balled lump of confectionary to Rgrezneh, who performed a gentle underhand toss against a human wearing a trashcan as some sort of armor, knocking the wind out of him and causing him to fall on his back.

“\[Nah. I for one *like* what’s going on - he’s just becoming so *dominant*, yanno? I didn’t know he had this in him, but after getting serious about his career and now establishing a micro-empire\~\]” Rgrezneh made the Dorarizin equivalent of a sensual purr, which gave every human within earshot the absolute piss-shivers. 

“\[Micro-empires are *illegal*, \[Rgrezneh\]. You know this-\]” Tr’Grakz chided, rolling a Holiday Ham like a bowling ball, knocking a human down at the legs with *flavor*. 

“\[I know, I know. It’s more that he’s taking initiative than anything else -\]”

“&lt;*Please*.&gt;” Shpressnrek sighed exasperatedly, Pinching and stroking the side of her hood in a self-soothing gesture as she made a mental note of the time. “&lt;We’ve been at war for the past 5 hours. This has gone on long enough, this ballroom suddenly is a battlefield-&gt;”

“\[Wait.\]”

“&lt;Absolutely ignoring you, *you started this*.&gt;” Shpressnrek stated matter-of-factly as Glenn suddenly turned towards the Jornissian, red eyes wide in realization.

“\[Say that again.\]” He said.

“&lt;What, that the ballroom is a battlefield?&gt;”

“\[Yeah. Yeah! YEAH yeah yeah -\]”

And Glenn stood up as he pointed at Mike the TurboElf, because he had a sudden *epiphany*.

But **He** was the man in the back, and yelled “\[EVERYONE ATTACK\]”, and it turned into a ballroom blitz.

And the Dorarizin in the corner, well very few ignored her, cause she’s attracted to the passionate one.

And the elf on the horses back was ready to crack and he raised his noodle to the sky

And the she-wolf in the corner really couldn’t get any hornier-

\- She did some things to that elf that’d make you blush if you tried.

And now you have that song stuck in your head just like me. 

That’s my gift to you. 

Merry Christmas."
efdhlw,5,2019-12-25,New Grad confused between 2 offers,odinreloaded,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/efdhlw/new_grad_confused_between_2_offers/,"As the title suggests I have two offers in-hand and I am really confused about which one to accept. One of the offers is from a financial company ([https://www.enfusionsystems.com/](https://www.enfusionsystems.com/)) based out of Chicago. I have been trying to look for videos/images of their software since I wasn't shown a working one during the interviews. I don't really have a lot of knowledge in this domain and since I haven't been able to find or see the software/website I would be working on I don't really know what to expect.

The other offer is from a company I have worked as an intern at ([https://www.peapoddigitallabs.com/home](https://www.peapoddigitallabs.com/home)) in Quincy, MA. I enjoyed my time here as an intern and was looking forward to going back and work here. I was talking to one of the current employees yesterday and was told that the work has reduced quite a lot and people are free during the sprints as well. This is something I had noticed during my internship as well but I always found some work by digging through the backlog for myself. But I do understand this domain, my work and what is expected of me in this company.

At Enfusion I would be working on React.js whereas I would work on Vue + Angular.js at Peapod.

As a new grad, I do want to learn in these initial years into the industry but there are a few concerns I feel about joining Enfusion. The glassdoor reviews for Enfusion do point a few concerns, 1. They log your computer usage, someone was suggesting they even log your keystrokes. (source: glassdoor) 2. Long working hours, people have suggested (on glassdoor) that working until 11 is sometimes expected (8 am to 6 pm are the working hours mentioned in my offer letter as well) 3. No work from home allowed.

The cons of Peapod would be that I wouldn't get a lot of work when I should be working and learning as much as I can.

I do want work and I wish to learn a lot in these early years in the industry but I don't wish to spend all my time at work since I do not intend to be at any of these companies for more than a year or so ( I messed up one of the three rounds at Amazon and was pretty close to making it there. I wish to move towards the west coast sooner).

The compensation isn't a factor since offers from both the companies are pretty much comparable when we factor in the living expenses.

I would really appreciate any help in making the decision."
efdyax,16,2019-12-25,Austin or Denver?,tman159,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/efdyax/austin_or_denver/,"I graduated this month and I’ve got two job offers to choose from. One is in Denver, where I’m currently located, and the other is in Austin.


#Denver
In Denver, I’d be doing android app development as an intern for 3 or 4 months and then moving to full time. I know it isn’t conventional but they wouldn’t budge on making me a full time employee.

- Start at $27 an hour and move to ~$85k
- Close to were I am currently living
- I am more interested interested in mobile apps than network security systems
- Title: Associate Android Developer

#Austin
In Austin I’d be doing work for a small company that makes network security systems. My coworkers here would be quite a bit older than me and most have lots of experience in this field.

- $77k base
- $4k relocation 
- Yearly bonus and raise
- Title: Software Engineer


They have about the same benefits, except Austin does not have 401k match.

Right now I am leaning towards Austin just because they are offering a full time job instead of just an internship. Which should I choose? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I am a 25 year old female. I work properly while I'm at the office and am moderately interested in my work (am not very passionate about it). I tend to get double minded about things and get stuck sometimes but I try to do my office work properly as the office is paying me for it. While researching for projects, I make a mental note of going back and reading more about ML concepts (which I could not due to shortage of time at office) and strengthening my CS (Computer Science) fundamentals. But when I get home, I do nothing to improve myself intellectually. I binge watch Netflix shows or YouTube videos, eat, take a shower, talk to people and go to sleep. I think that's mostly because I set out to do something with the attitude that it can't be done and escape from it. But I work properly at office because I have an incentive. Even if I do sit to do something at home, I don't give my 100% to it thinking that I will not understand it or it's too difficult. I have a list of activities that I want to do e.g., learning a language, reading Manga, working on personal projects etc. but I don't even do them.

From all this, I have deduced that I work (or do anything) only when it is absolutely necessary to work (do it). But this can prove bad for me in the long run. Any ideas on how I can push myself to be more excited about things, concentrate more on stuff that matters and be more interested to do stuff?

Please feel free to ask questions. Thanks for reading. Any advice would be extremely helpful."

I could intern at tech company but would have to wait til junior year.

Realistic path to first CS job?",csthrowaway9422,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/efigbl/physics_degree_with_20_gpa_unrelated_work/,"I'd like to switch careers, although I was lucky enough to get the job I have, which took 2 years after graduating to get. I do 'data analysis' right now but it involves no coding or math besides excel macros. I literally just look at sheets of errors in client submitted data and fix it to patch up discrepancys in trends. I'm sure in an interview I could make it sound interesting and relevant but I don't want to sugarcoat it here.

I have a physics degree from UT Austin. I went in with a full merit scholarship and was on track to graduate in ~2.5 years, then spent the last 2 years getting straight F's, after having finished my upper division physics requirements, on general requirements like english and art that I skipped as a freshmen. It was really dumb and I scraped just over a 2.0. I know a lot of math and am pretty good at it but don't have much opportunity to use it these days. I coded a bit in college. I did one class (part of a fellowship but not really) where we learned python and had to use matlab a ton for homework in upper divison classes, but that was years ago and I don't remember much. No internships or projects. I made some games and websites when I was about 12 or so but just didn't stick with it after.

Grad school is out. Maybe I could go to a school that takes people with such low GPA's but I actually worry that it would look even worse than just my bachelors, since it's at least from a known school. I'm not a very good student anyways. I've been self studying after work, gone through SICP, and half an algorithms book. I could probably study during downtime at work and maybe try to automate things, although that would require learning VBA.

I'd like to figure out what the most efficient use of my time would be in this situation. With work experience and an unrelated major I doubt anyone will even ask my GPA or care. But breaking into this field seems bipolar judging from the subreddit. Lurking for a few weeks it sounds like lots of people with cs degrees and internships cant find jobs after hundreds of applications and grinding leetcode all day everyday, and others find jobs no problem just knowing a little Java and a firm handshake. I don't particularly care about working for a prestigous company, am still in Austin. I just need a first coding job for a while to then leapfrog over to something better. My goal is within 2 years.

As far as I can tell I just need to study a lot and make some projects. I started learning C++, and planned on learning python and sql to find a quantdev job or just something in data science. But I've seen lots of people saying you need a masters for that which seems out of the question. It looks like learning Javascript and becoming a fullstack devloper is both easier and more in demand. But my medium/long term goal is to work somewhere I can do some math. I really miss it and I'm good at it. Maybe I could learn backend stuff and then transition over? I'm not sure. I really don't know much about it besides lurking this forum for a few weeks. Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm sure there are options I'm missing. I'd also love an honest assessment of my prospects to know if I'm wasting my time or not. Do any of you hiring managers have experience with similar resumes? Thank you."

Subject Tests: Math 2 (760), Physics (760)

UW/W GPA and Rank: NONE! I go to a STEM boarding school that doesn’t record these stuff due to the rigor and everyone would basically have a non-competitive GPA. 

Coursework: 

Math - Calc 1&amp;2, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Higher Topics in Math (like Game Theory and stuff)

Comp Sci - Object-Oriented Programming with Java, Data Structures 1&amp;2, Discrete Mathematics, Computer Architecture

Physics: Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism

AP: World History (4), US History (5), Computer Science Principles (4), Calc BC (this year), Computer Science A (this year)

My school is too rigorous that we ain’t got time for AP tests so it’s difficult to study for them. We don’t offer AP classes either (our classes are beyond AP level and closer to actual college classes)

Awards:
Got a medal from the state governor for academic excellence
National Merit Semifinalist
1st place in Nation for TEAM+S competition

Extracurricular:
Mentor (Senior): basically I become a mentor for three juniors at our school (forgot to mention that our school is a two-year residential highschool for only juniors and seniors) and I do monthly meetings with them, hangout with other mentors and their mentees with food and games, we host semester events like Capture the Flag and Movie Night. I spend about an hour a week doing this. 

Tutor (Senior): I basically tutor other students at my school in Math (everything from Calc 2 and below), Physics, History, Comp Sci. I spend about 7 hours a week doing this. 

FTC Robotics (Captain; Junior-Senior): you get the jizz. I do robotics stuff. We have gone to state before. Our school’s rigorous schedule won’t allow us to go to competitions beyond state. About 5 hours a week. 

Botball (Programming Captain; Junior-Senior): same thing but this one is a new club on our school so me and a few other captains are running the show and getting it started. About an hour a week. 

Computer Science Crew (Co-founder; Junior-Senior): a bunch of my friends were like “people should know about CS more” so we created a group at our school and host weekly meetings discussing topics in CS like neural networks, hacking, etc.  we also teach students in Java and help with homework. We are currently planning on hosting a state-wide hackathon. I spend about an hour a week on this. 

TEAM+S (Junior-Senior): that’s the competition our team did and win 1st place in the nation for. We travelled to DC for the competition after winning state. It was fun. Spent about an hour a day during the active season.

School Ambassador (Junior-Senior): I become a representative for the school, traveling to middle and high schools around the state to recruit more students and hope they’ll apply to our school. We also have this big annual fundraising gala where state governors, big companies (Boeing, Paycom, etc.) and others come to our school. It would be the student representatives to talk to these officials and encourage them to apply by showing them how our school has impacted us. I do an hour a week, roughly, because we don’t have set meetings or something like that. 

Neuroscience Research (Senior): currently working on finding the correlation of sleep and reaction time. I code in R using RStudio to develop a program to assess the subject’s reaction time and surveying them afterwards with questions related to how much sleep they got and the quality of it. Spend about 4 hours a week doing this. 

Internship at tech company (senior): interning at a computer vision company focused on self driving vehicles. Pretty cool stuff ngl. I get paid. It’s nice. Amount of time spent varies depending on how much freetime I have. 

Essays/LORs/Other: umm, personal statement was reviewed by a professor that is very good in composition and familiar with College app process. She helped me and said it was a really good essay. I also got it reviewed by professors similar to her skill level and experience, and they said the same thing. Prob a 8/10. LORs is a bit tougher but I think it’s about a 6-7/10.

For example, I've found it hard to think of a good personal project I can do using just C++, so I'm totally open to learning other languages to help with that, but I'm not even sure where to start- most online curriculums are web dev-oriented so I've seen people say they aren't the best path to go down if I want to go into SWE, but maybe I'm mistaken there? Overall, I'm just asking for advice about how I can go from ""good at coding for school"" to ""good at seriously coding outside of school"" or how others went about becoming more independent and carving out a path for themselves, because I feel like I have no guidance and am just super lost, and I'm worried I'll stay like this until it's too late.

efl4ta,244,2019-12-25,Remember that your mental health is incredibly important during a job search,sherlockwholmes_,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/efl4ta/remember_that_your_mental_health_is_incredibly/,"Hey all, and Merry Christmas.

I don’t know if anyone needs to hear this, but if one person can take something useful away from this post I’ll be happy. Please keep in mind the state of your mental health when you’re looking for jobs. This industry is not always easy to navigate, and for some it’s hard to even get your foot in the door. Failure happens, and sometimes there’s nothing you can do about it. Sometimes you get thrown a curveball you couldn’t see coming.

If you’re struggling with your mental health, there’s a good chance that it’ll affect your interviewing and networking skills. Please, sort that stuff out after you’re in a good place mentally. It makes an absolute world of difference in your success. I know because I tried it, and failed miserably.

This past summer I had an internship in Corporate Banking that I loved. The people were fantastic, I learned a ton, and I was really looking forward to joining the team full time. Multiple employees spoke openly with me throughout the summer that they *knew* I would get the return offer. Well, I didn’t. And it stung. The worst part was that I couldn’t do anything about it. The reason was a cost cutting measure that came down from higher ups, and not my performance. That was reassuring, but it made me feel like the cards were stacked against me.

For a while afterwards I tried to keep up the charade of being in a good place, but I wasn’t. And it showed in my success during networking and interviewing. Then, I decided to put a stop to all of the job searching. It was the best decision I have ever made in my life. I got my head back on straight, and after a few more weeks of networking with people I met over the summer, another opportunity appeared, and this time I was ready for it. Nailed it, and got the full time offer. At an even better bank, too. Now, I’m in the best state mentally I have ever been, and couldn’t have asked for a better holiday season.

Please, please please take care of your mental health. It’s completely overlooked in this industry, and there’s a lot of pressure to perform. It may feel like you’re wasting time you could be spending on the job hunt, but I promise it’s worth it.

Merry Christmas everybody."

I have taken a number of CS classes and have a lot of research experience where I was pretty much the ""undergrad who knows how to code so we can throw data analysis/web stuff at him."" 

I applied to several SWE/data science internships early in the fall on a whim, because I was feeling hesitant about my career goals and thought that I might want to switch to CS. I got one interview in early October and received an offer on Monday. 

The issue is that there are several summer research internships at universities I would rather complete this summer, and decisions for those generally don't come out until March. The offer I got pays more than I would receive at one of the research internships (like 2-3 times more). However, the offer is in the same city I attend school (low CoL Midwest USA), and something attractive about the research internships is that they generally provide housing with a stipend. 

My perfect summer would be any of \~10 internships in big cities around the US.  Unfortunately, they are very competitive. There are some ""safety"" internships I could apply to, but at that point I might rather take this SWE offer. 

I have about 2-3 weeks (the recruiter was unclear but said that since they were contacting me over the holidays so I would have an extra week or two to decide). I am considering applying to the research internships this week and requesting an early decision (most are due February 1st-15th). But they require two letters of recommendation and I would feel bad about reaching out during the holidays.

Any thoughts or suggestions on this would be much appreciated. I'm struggling to decide which is the best call for me/my career."
efm1xx,12,2019-12-25,Am I too empathetic to be a boss ?,CaptLapadite,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/efm1xx/am_i_too_empathetic_to_be_a_boss/,"I (M31) recently became not only my own boss, but the employer of a team of 20 people in Montreal, Canada. I fear dealing with personal stress among the team is driving me crazy. Recent workers’ complaints keep me awake at night and give me anxiety.

\--**A bit of background...**

after years of working in urban design as a project lead, I moved to the video game industry and started a company after achieving a degree in game design. The project started with my work partner in June 2018 and quickly grew to 7 people working together in my living room by the end of the year. Starting a company with nothing and little funds, we found a lot of interns and students newly out of school like us, craving for experience (just like us) to get a chance in this crowded industry. We got our first studio in January 2019, and grew the team to about 20 part-time people. Everybody's working on our first video game title launching in 2020. Without enough money to give salaries yet, we have binding contracts that ensure royalties on the project when launched. Every team member knows the deal and is OK with it. Since we can't offer the main aspect of a job -- salary --, workers had full liberty of their time and no obligations with us. My main concern was to give the best work environment I could to keep it afloat. Last autumn, we got a nice funding to start a new project. It allowed us to give our first salaries to some people in the team. As a very young indie dev and with limited resources, our wages are obviously under the AAA levels but still better than minimal wages.

We use time sheets for the pays and workers are free to do between 30 and 40 h per week, to allow for 4 days employment if they wish. Some even do less, and we don't really bother. We're open from 10 am to 6 pm to accommodate the usual gamer life cycle. We have some problems with absences and late workers, but don't stress too much about it. Anybody can get a day off or leave early if needed (for any reason) as long as we are informed and don't have to worry the person might be in trouble.

Most of our workers are the same age or younger than me. Some were my friends before being my employees. My associate is Asperger with ADHD and has trouble with human emotions. He sometimes has to take the day (or weeks) off to be able to work again. Needless to say, I'm quite alone with any responsibility related to the company and with dealing with our employees. It's my first time being a boss and stuff like accounting or HR aren't especially my expertise. I like learning about it and doing it, but obviously I still make mistakes here and there. My tasks include budget, salaries, wages, marketing, project management, HR, business development, tech support, office manager, creative lead, etc. While I try to delegate a few of my many roles, I'm still the one taking all decisions and lifting all the responsibility of the company.

\--

**I have an issue with my relations with 2 employees for which I'd like your advice.**

\--

**Employee ""A""**

joined us a few months ago and had some ""panic events"". Just a few days after he was in with us, he heard (we are in an open space and really transparent on our discussions) we were looking for someone more to address our amount of work. He just took his things and left the office. Later sent me a message telling me to send the rest of his stuff home by taxi as he won’t be coming back again. ... shocked and surprised, I called him immediately only to understand he thought we wanted to replace him. Which was never the case.

We had other similar episodes later. With him thinking we were calling him out for his bad work while it was definitely never the case. It's one of our most estimated employees and we try to tell him as much as possible.

A few weeks ago, we had a meeting regarding the project . We were behind schedule and I realized the teams were working too much in silos, unable to go forward before the end of the work of the other party... without the other party knowing about it. Being quite stressed with all the-end-of-year management, I asked the team promptly to work closely with him to support him in any way, as his part of the project was the most important at the moment.

Employee A ended his day, called sick the day after, and simply didn't come the days or week after. Nobody knew why. Tried to call him, he hung up on me. I sent him a message about how much respect I have for him and his work and how he is part of the studio's family. No answer. A coworker had a chance to chat with him, he told he felt we shouted at him and felt insulted. No other sensed that. I have coworkers telling me we can replace him if needed...

I had trouble to sleep for days and keep thinking about it. I really have a problem bearing the fact that someone I estimated that much just ghosted me and felt attacked or insulted while that was never my intention. On one part I feel I should just tell him we terminate his contract for just leaving without notice... on the other, I just want to clarify this misunderstanding and get things back to normal.

\--

**Employee ""B""**

joined our team for the new project for which we received funding. We met in the same course in game design and can be considered a friend. She argued having money issues with having to pay her student debts (which we all have, being all just out of school), she asked for a 25$+ per hour, with our limited budget we gave her 20$ which is still quite good for a junior position. In fact, as a new company with not much money, she has the best wage in the whole studio (even above the associates) and she knows it. However, she's clearly not the better employee we have. She's often late, often call off without notice, abandon some responsibility without a sign, is always eating out loud when we have any meeting at any time, etc. I met her to address her behaviour and she managed to correct some... but let's say it'll be a process and I'll have to remind her.

It's difficult because we have two relationships at once. One as friends, and one as an employee/boss.

We went to the same class, are the same age and are friends. She even could've been an associate at some point. But when it comes to our work relationship, she's really rough. She doesn't hesitate to blackmail me on how she could be somewhere else for a better wage (while, yes maybe, but at the time she had nothing and I was the one to offer her a job...). Anytime something is a bit off with the studio, she's the first to accuse me with fiery eyes.

I made a mistake recently and forgot the holidays would delay the wages by 2 days. She straight insulted me, telling how unacceptable the situation was. I mean, I know it isn't ideal, but I'm dealing with wages for the firsts times of my life, during Christmas Eve staying apart from my family. She, better than anyone, knows how all of this is new to me and yes, I will probably make mistakes here and there and it won't be my last.

I thought she would be comprehensive but it's quite the opposite. I feel like she wants me to feel she's the one in charge at some point and I know we can't continue that way. I don't really know how to approach this but I know that theses tense conversations we have can eat me with stress and anxiety for days.

\--

I realize that failing as an ""ideal"" boss affects me a lot personally. I actually never expected to be a boss, but as I started the company and have a rather absent associate, I bear the full responsibility. Trained as a creative, I almost don't have a chance to create anymore. My job now is to create business opportunities and ensure the studio well-being. I often feel quite alone in the decisions I have to take and find difficult to evacuate a lot of the stress related to the studio since I'm alone with this burden. Recently it's becoming difficult to bear and I'm thinking of reducing the team's size and the studio orientation.

I have this impression that if I didn't care it would all be easier. I would simply ""get over it"", fire people not in line with the company and have it somewhat easier. Or at least less stressful on a long period of time.

But members of our studio are becoming friends or were already from the beginning... and it hurts to see them unhappy.

I try to do my best as a young boss, but I still make errors here and there. The worst is when there can't even be a conversation to discuss the situation.

Am I too empathetic to be a boss ?

Should I be more careless ?

How should I deal with Employer A and B ?

How should I cope with the stress of responsibility I cannot share?

\-- TLDR

Being a new boss, I have difficulty dealing with workers unhappiness and take it as my own error. Bearing stress and anxiety for days and have trouble to sleep at night. Am I too empathetic to be a boss ?

I hate the interview process, grinding Leetcode for months, studying CTCI, data structures, doing countless whiteboard interviews every time I want to change a new job. I hate the toxic culture of people bragging about getting into companies like Google or FB and treating them like the holy grail. I don't like being surrounded by people who constantly talk about tech and nothing else. I disliked the pressure of having to do production deployments in 1 week during my internships, with managers constantly piling up more work. I just don't find programming to be super *interesting* like a bunch of other CS people do. All in all, I feel like I just hate what programming as a career comes with. Personally, I wanted to work as a PM or in Finance, as I find Excel to be relaxing. Does anyone else feel this way?"
efpnom,109,2019-12-25,Someone In This Cabin Knows Something I Don't Part 1,SalesFromTheRoad,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/efpnom/someone_in_this_cabin_knows_something_i_dont_part/,"I’m not sure if writing this will help but I feel like I have no other choice. I need you to read everything I’m saying, because we need help. At least I can say I tried knowing that someone read this before I died. 

Let me start from the beginning. My friends and I decided to rent a cabin in New Hampshire for the week over our summer vacation. I know, it sounds like something only dumb teenagers in a horror movie would do. I can promise you that hindsight is definitely 20/20. 

My name is Sam and I’m a college student. I was looking forward to this trip because it was the first time I’d seen my girlfriend Isley and my other friends in months due to an internship I had earlier in the summer. This was supposed to be a way for me to catch back up with my friends and unwind. 

When I got home though, Isley was cold. She wouldn’t look me in the eyes for too long and when I touched her I could feel a slight recoil. It was slight, as if she was trying to hide it but just couldn’t control that small initial reaction. My friend Marley felt off too. From the moment I got home I felt like I was unwelcome. It wasn’t a huge deal, I figured after a couple days of being back everything would probably get back to normal. 

We left from my friend Luke’s house on Sunday night to make the five hour drive to the cabin. As we drove, Luke was trying his hardest to craft the perfect road trip playlist. Isley’s best friend, Danica, sang along. I don’t think I heard a word out of Isley or Marley for the entirety of the trip. 

Of course, we weren’t sure where the closest liquor store would be, so when we arrived it took us about 15 minutes just to unload all the cases of beer. When we got them unloaded, we decided to crack them open right away. 

I really don’t think getting everybody drunk right away was the best idea. The dynamic of the group still wasn’t moving like it usually does and alcohol isn’t generally known to make people better communicators. About an hour after we got there and started drinking I’d already had enough. Isley seemed to want to talk to Luke more than me and Marley kept pulling Danica for private conversations. He kept holding his hand to cover his mouth for some reason. 

Every bone in my body was telling me that something was up. The only way I could figure to deal with it in my current state was to go take a walk. I’d gotten used to being alone over the summer, minus my much older co-workers, so I wasn’t too concerned about it. 

Nobody even said a word as I left and made my way down the dark driveway. The best part of being in the country is that when the sky is clear, the moonlight shines bright enough to light up everything.

I finished my beer early into the walk and was left wishing I had another. Luckily, I’d had enough that I wasn’t in much of a position to overthink my current standing amongst my friends. I was mostly just observing everything going on around me. 

I can’t even begin to overstate how much I wished I’d had another beer to distract me in that moment. I saw a red light coming from a clearing, probably around a football field away from me. At first, it was kind of hard to understand. I thought that maybe it was coming from a house but I didn’t remember seeing one on our way. As I got closer I could see that it was fire. The flickering of the light was unmistakable. 

The thing is, it didn’t look as if it was coming from one large source. It seemed to be coming from a bunch of smaller lights. I heard what sounded like a car door just then. I froze, looking around for any sign of life. I knew it came from the clearing or somewhere close to it. 

To my horror, the mystery was soon solved. I saw a shadow emerge from the clearing, clearly a human. He held a torch in his left hand. This torch should have illuminated him I thought, but he still looked like nothing but a shadow. He stopped in his path, coming to a standstill no more than 50 yards from me. It seemed as if he was looking at me, but without seeing the eyes I can’t be sure.

I stood completely still. I didn’t know if the dark was concealing me in the middle of the street but I have to assume that the figure could at least see my shadow. Soon, the figure disappeared back into the clearing. I let out a huge sigh and turned quickly, intent on getting back to the cabin as soon as humanly possible.

My turn quickly turned to a sprint as I saw something that I don’t think I could ever forget. As I prepared to make my way back to the house, I saw another shadow. This shadow was much closer, probably around ten feet. It didn’t stand still like the other though. It was on its way to the woods, only a couple of steps out. I wanted to believe that I was seeing things, but I know for a fact that it was a figure. 

As the shadow disappeared behind the tree line I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin. I was intent on not letting that figure follow me back. By the time I returned, I was completely sober, but everyone else was presumably asleep. Empty cans littered the living room and all of the bedroom doors were closed. 

I took one last look out of the window and locked the front door. I made my way into my bedroom where Isley was passed out. I slid into the last remaining sliver of space beside her and tried my best to decompress. 

Time and fate just didn’t seem to be on my side though. Not even five minutes later I heard something that made my skin crawl. I heard the front door unlock, open and close. The footsteps weren’t loud enough for me to locate. The sound woke Isley up too though. 

“Hey.” She said. “I’m sorry we haven’t gotten to talk much. We have a lot to catch up on.”

I gave her a kiss, assuring her that I wasn’t mad. Right now though, I couldn’t focus on anything else. I knew that someone in this house knew something I didn’t. And deep down, I knew that it was really, really bad. It took me a long time from then to figure it out, but as I continue my story, hopefully you’ll be able to see that there’s no way I could have known."

Hope everyone had a nice holiday!

I'm a 22 year old student from Montreal entering my last semester of study and will be graduating in April 2020 with a Bachelor of Commerce (Major in Economics, Minor in Finance) from McGill University in Montreal.

I have applied to a few graduate schools for Master's in Economics and expect to hear back around March.

Last week I was offered a job as a research assistant for the Bank of Canada (Canadian equivalent of the Federal Reserve). However, I'm based in Montreal and the position is in Calgary which is like 3500km away from my friends and family.

The position seems interesting/meaningful, the interview process was great, the pay is very competitive for a recent grad ($60K CAD) and the contract is a fixed one year term. Despite the fact that this job seems like a great opportunity from a career point of view, I'm not totally sold on taking the offer, which they gave me a few days to accept/decline.

By taking the job, I will likely miss my convocation ceremony and will need to defer admission into master's programs, if accepted. In addition, I'm not really sure I'd like the city, have no contacts there, and would likely end up spending about half of that year's salary on rent, living expenses, etc. I'd also have to forget about any post-graduation trip to Europe which I've been looking forward to, whatever that's worth.

I would much prefer working a 4 month summer position or internship closer to home and then returning to school in the Fall. However, this is quite the gamble as I may not find another internship or get accepted into a master's program at all. I haven't had much luck with my other countless internship/job applications thus far. One in the hand is definitely more valuable than two in the bush I guess.

If I knew for a fact that I'd get accepted into a master's program, I would definitely prefer to continue with school after my undergrad and would quite likely reject the job offer.

Thanks for any advice you may be able to provide :)"

I graduated in May of 2019 with a CS bachelor with a 3.0 GPA, back then I was immature and not considerate for my future, I did not work on side-projects and grind leet code, just try to have fun with the free times I have and leave all the problems to the future me. Thinking to cross the bridge when comes to it, just go to class do my test get a degree and everything is fine. 

Been working as a Salesforce Developer intern for a small company since then. I found the Salesforce Developer job to be boring and limited, from the experience of using the Salesforce exclusive programming language and the tedious blue waiting screen you see when you make modifications during the development process. 

And just like an ostrich pull out its head from the sand, after I decided to quit my current intern job, I realized how doomed my situation is, I only have experience as Salesforce Developer, I graduated with no side projects and not enough knowledge to become a professional software developer or anything cs related professional jobs, I have a general idea on those fields, but I do not know what exact skills the current industry need, and how good is considered ""ready"" to be a full time.

Can someone give me some advice on what should I do if I want to get into the SWE or Web-Developer field? Self-taught until I am ready? Just apply anyway? Grind Leetcode? Apply for another internship? Sorry for too much question marks guys I been thinking a lot every night before I sleep, and making a lot of pointless effort in the morning, watch tutorial videos a couple a day and hop onto leet code sometimes. I am a little introverted and my close friends/classmates are either unemploy or different majors therefore I couldn't seek advice from people around me.

I am having an issue regarding my income tax. I was working an internship for 9 months this year, and I did not know I had to go to the tax office to change my tax class status. Last year, I worked two separate Hiwis so I was put under Tax Class 6 by my university when filing the papers. 

This year, I just had the one job the whole year, and I submitted all the paperwork with the company indicating that it was my only source of income. Come to find out a week before the internship is over that I was still in tax class 6 from the previous year and that I was going/was getting taxed the highest amount, even though I was no longer working two jobs. 

I wanted to go to the tax office to get this resolved but I am now getting told that since I deregistered from my apartment (I am moving back to the U.S. soon.) my account is frozen and I am unable to make the changes until I register somewhere, which is not possible as I am crashing at a friends place until I fly back to the states. They say that I am not able to change the tax class because of this. 

Is there anything I can do? And if I am able to make the change, do you think I would be able to get a refund (the difference in what I would pay if I were tax class 1 like I was supposed to be?) 

Thanks for your help in advanced, guys. And happy holidays."

I am looking for a technical guide as I feel like I might be lacking some skills, which I plan to pick up in the next few months before I start giving interviews.

Here is some context before I pose the question, I have had around 1.8yrs of experience ( 6 Months Internship)

* Internship (ML Intern)
   * I worked mostly on NLP, with NLTK, TextBlob, and Gensim, working on Intent Engines for multiple domains
   * I also worked with Integrating these models with the larger system, Flask(RestPlus) and gRCP.
   * I also worked with the Attention model on Custom Data to build a Representation model which was later used for Summarization and Intent detection with Tensorflow 1.x.
* Work (AI Engineer)
   * Here I mostly worked with the Microsoft Bot Framework C# to build the custom chatbot.
   * I again used Topic modeling for Intent detection as LUIS was not working for us (Data security reasons)
   * I used Flask(RestPlus) to build mostly wrapper API over Bing Search and Sentiment API's

The main reason why I am looking for a switch is that the current company is mostly focused on the Line of Business Apps and stitch services from other companies as a single Product.

Coming to my question now, What I am looking for is mostly an ML Engineer, and here is what I have prepared/preparing so far

* Data Structures  and Algorithms mostly doing HackerEarth and CodeChef
* Studying ML algorithms Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, thinking of  XGBoost and LGBM.
* Studying SQL and planning to NoSQL or Graph
* Most of my time I am spending on Math, and trying to convert Math to Code from research papers.

So my question is

* Should I pick up a strict language such as C++ or Go? Not really interested in Java and I learned C# at my work.
* Should I start learning System Desing? or Stacks such as AWS Azure GCP?
* I mostly do HackerEarth with Python as that is my main language should I switch to something like C++?
* Should I concentrate more on traditional DS and Algo or the ones related to ML?
* I also got some advice to pick up deployment with Docker and Kubernetes?

In general, I still when I try to judge myself on these things I see a lot of gaps and I am confused if I'll be able to make it as an ML Engineer, what I mean is that I am struggling between Pure SWE and ML, as I was told that an MLE is an SWE who is good at ML."

My manager at my first internship just had me separate my classes in a package for each component. 

Also, I’m not sure if I implemented it incorrectly, but the whole controller portion seemed kinda pointless. It felt like I was just adding an unnecessary layer of abstraction between my GUI. Why not just call my DB methods directly from the GUI (this was a desktop application)?

Is it just a way of organizing your code?"
efybz4,58,2019-12-26,Why you should break up your PEY,TuloCantHitski,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/efybz4/why_you_should_break_up_your_pey/,"Inspired by the fantastic and comprehensive post from /u/Skelzore!

The thesis here essentially is: you should, ideally, spend your PEY year at more than one company to optimize your experience and professional development. I would go only go as far as a 4x4 if you're CS however, as students in many industries and functions can benefit from building experience and responsibility at one position for 12-16 months. 

**What does breaking up your PEY mean?**

Instead of spending your PEY at one place for 16 months (which appears to be most common), this means doing smaller amounts of time at multiple companies.

The only ""legal"" way to do this if you want to be able to use the PEY portal, get official PEY credit, etc. is to do a 12-month PEY at one company, and follow that up with a 4-month summer internship at some other company. The other method requires you to take a gap year where you just do 4 4-month internships, or something. You can also technically accept a 16-month PEY and then quit after 12 months. More details on the pros/cons of each below.

**Why should you break up your PEY?**

- It gives you a **wider range of experience** and builds your resume more

- It **accelerates your professional progression** and helps you ""jump up the ladder"". Each time you jump companies, you should have a better resume, which helps you get a better position. Spending all 16 months at one place is suboptimal and you likely could have gotten a better internship by the end of it.

- It **helps you grow and avoid stagnation**. Many students in 16-month internships report feeling like they've stagnated towards the end of the term. 1.33 years is a long time to be in one place as an intern. At this stage, you should be trying to learn as much as possible. Personally, I started feeling a bit bored at my PEY after 9 months. 

- IMO, there are lots of fantastic employers who don't post to the PEY job portal (and maybe even your dream company). PEY can be strategically used to build up your profile so that you're **competitive for your dream jobs**.

Overall, I think the logic here is clear. Suppose that after each 4-months of work experience (i.e. the most common co-op length), the competitiveness of your profile increases by some factor r. The more ""work experience units"" you have under your belt, the more this factor compounds. After 4 4-month work experiences, you've grown by a factor of r^4, for instance. Most gains one receives from working at a place for 12 months or longer diminish, IMO, so you want to compound as much as possible. 

**Pros and Cons of the 12+4 Route**

Securing a PEY position is a lot easier than securing a general summer internship. This is because for PEY, you're mostly just competing with your classmates, but general internships involve competing with multiple schools (from multiple countries as well, depending on the company). For people who don't already have all-star experience, doing the 12-month PEY will likely get you a better position and experience than you would have gotten in a summer internship. Doing the 12-month PEY first is a great way to build your experience, especially if it's your first internship. Then, with a full year of this co-op experience under your belt, you'll be competitive for a wide range of summer internships and likely secure an internship in a better position than your PEY (which will subsequently look better when applying for full-time).

The only real downside in my mind is that if you limit yourself to only applying to 12-month PEY positions, you limit your pool. You obviously don't want to do this to the point where you can't secure a PEY. In my experience, this isn't really a problem since there are usually a healthy # of 12-month positions (or employers willing to be flexible / negotiation on length). The other annoying thing is having to interview while you're working. You may have to take days off. Personally, I had to do this or kind of sneak out of work at times. It's annoying but 100% worth it for the boost to your resume, IMO.  

Quick note on quitting a 16-month PEY after putting in 12 months: the pros to this are obviously the same as above. You may run into this scenario if you can only manage to get a 16-month PEY in length. An additional con here is that you may burn a bridge with your employer, since you'd be quitting on the contract you signed. That being said, you may happily take this hit if it means securing a dream internship. Moreover, many employers will understand (i.e. no bridge burned) if you just approach the situation in a mature manner and give them advanced notice.

Also, you may be thinking: what if I try to do this strategy but then fail to secure a summer internship that is better than my PEY? To that I say, all good! If you've already signed a 16-month PEY, then you just continue business as usual. If you signed a 12-month, you can often just ask your employer if you can extend into the summer. If you're a decent employee, they'll say yes 90% of the time. 

**Pros and Cons of the 4x4 Route**

The pro here is obvious: 4 experiences at 4 different companies before you graduate is amazing. You'll learn about a wide range of work places, tools, cultures, etc. It also looks better on your resume than being at one place for 16 months, despite both being the same amount of time at work. You'll also likely get stellar internships towards the end, as your experience constantly compounds with each additional internship. 

The biggest difficulty is simply that this is *hard*. You have to be constantly interviewing in each of your internships, which adds stress. There's also uncertainty. With a 12 or 16 month PEY, you know where you are for the next year. In this strategy, you have no clue where you're going to be in 3 months and it may just be unemployed if you're not able to swing something. This can be partially mitigated by trying to set up work terms in advance (i.e. push a summer internship to the fall). Please note also that you *may* be taking a gap year, which (I believe) means you start accruing interest on OSAP. That being said, when this method works, it REALLY works - I know lots of people who basically took a tour of the Big N through 4 consecutive internships. Also, if you plead / negotiate with the PEY office, they should let you make it an official PEY, which really helps for visa purposes (and solves the OSAP problem).   

**My Experience**

Personally, I did the 12+4 break-up so that I could leverage the PEY portal at least somewhat. I was able to make a massive jump between the quality of my PEY and the quality of my subsequent internship (where I'm returning full-time). My plan from the beginning of PEY was to use a 12-month position to set myself up for my dream job, which thankfully I secured (thanks in part to my PEY experience!). I liked this middle-ground approach because it would still allow me to compound my experience and get my ""dream job"" before graduating (which a 16-month PEY would not let me do). I wasn't super confident in my ability to find 3 or 4 internships all on my own and didn't want the accompanying stress, which is primarily why I didn't go with the 4x4. 

**Why It's Still Obviously Okay if You Do a 16-Month**

Experience is experience and 16 months of work experience is fantastic! All of the above is more about how to optimize your PEY time, **especially if your PEY employer isn't your target/dream position**. If you happen to get your dream employer for PEY...then you're luckier than most and you should just probably work there. Another positive is that staying for 16 months can help you build great relationships there (especially valuable if you plan to return there full-time). Moreover, it's the least stressful option as you don't have to move places, you don't have to adjust to new companies, and you don't have to worry about looking/interviewing for other internships.

**UPDATE**: Moreover, it's important to note that a 16-month internship can be really great depending on the company, which is why it's good to do your due diligence. The ones that are flexible in giving you more responsibility, different projects, and different teams are great and will simulate the breadth of experience you can acquire via multiple internships. ALSO, I feel that shorter term internships in general are much more common and useful in CS. For ""heavy industries"", such as civil, mechanical, mining engineering, etc. and even capitally intensive work like hardware, the longer term experience of 12-16 months is really beneficial, as it helps give you additional responsibility that you wouldn't receive as a fresh intern. 

The question you want to ask yourself when assessing whether a longer term 12-16 month internship will be conducive to your growth is: **will they treat me like a full-time employee**? I know of PEY employers who basically gave ~2 months of proper training and then treated the students just like FT'ers. Worse companies will give you BS intern tasks, which is obviously awful for 16 consecutive months.

Would love to hear any thoughts on the above. Also feel free to ask any follow-up questions!"

i’m a second year and i’ve taken up to calc 3 but i haven’t taken physics 1 yet (plan to take that next semester along with programming 1). 

my question is, will i be ready for an internship in time if i switch now? am i too late? i read that you won’t be ready for interviews until you take data structures which i wouldn’t take until next spring. i’m worried about not getting an internship since i won’t know about data structures and algorithms (or have the necessary skills needed/coded long enough to get an internship for summer 2021). 

i was also thinking about taking programming 2/discrete over the summer and data structures in the fall. but even then i’m still not sure if i would be able to secure an internship in time. 

i made a plan and i think i can still graduate on time, but i still need to meet with an advisor. sorry this was so wordy!

This caused me to interrupt him, and he responded my yelling at me.  I have quite frankly had one six week period in the past 4 and a half years where I was neither in school, or working a job, or both. He also has a habit of occasionally making abrupt demands, in a threatening manner. He does pay for my college education, housing, etc and I repeatedly express gratitude for this, and he often praises me for my success. However, the instant he and I have conflicting opinions, or our views contradict, I feel as though he stops treating me like a human, and makes no effort to acknowledge my side whatsoever. When something isn't going exactly the way he wants it to, whether it be a conversation or situation, he begins to treat other people poorly by raising his voice, and often even insulting other people. Throughout my life, he has lost countless friends, as well as had a lot of difficulty with his employees due to his controlling and abrasive nature.

All in all, despite him being very giving financially, I have began to grow distant with him over the years due to this behavior. His complete lack of respect for other people's feelings, as well as my own, make me feel extremely threatened around him.

I have been working for this company for the past 5-6 months and I love the job as a whole. This is my first ""real"" job, previously I was working retail and had an IT internship for a local municipality which was really helpful in getting me interviews.

Anyways I just wanted to get some thoughts on my role/tasks that I do as part of my job for this company. We are essentially a company that offers pharma CRM software to many clients, our internal employees is probably 100, but we have a multitude of clients nationwide. 

My role is asset/hardware management for said clients. My primary job duty is to build devices (iPads, laptops, iPhones, Surfaces etc) and ship them out to reps whether it's for a new employee or a repair they have sent in to us. We keep track of inventory for all these client's devices. Some of the things I have done or learned that are ""IT"" related and feel like will really help me are:

* Imaging hundreds of devices using WDS
* Creating these images per client, sysprepping and capturing, uploading to WDS etc.
* Created Powershell scripts to back data up, a script to create a self extracting exe. Batch files.
* Mobile device management
* As part of imaging I have learned quite a bit about group policy alebit local because these devices aren't joined to a domain, customization using unattend.xml
* Now my new project is configuring MDT with task sequences instead of the old school imaging process we were using. I really enjoy this because it lets me play around and explore/learn. 

My only concerns with this job is that I'm not really troubleshooting at all, we have the help desk for that. None of this is for domain joined devices so no AD work, we have Network team for that. Are my concerns real or am I doing enough as a noobie in the IT world?"

Currently a junior studying CS who will be interning at a HFT firm (among the likes of Citadel, Jump, IMC) in Chicago working on low-latency software and was wondering about my potential career growth. I’m wondering if I made the right decision of turning down an intern opportunity with a unicorn startup (I wanted to try something different). 

I was discussing it with my dad and he doesn’t think that there is much career growth with this field of HFT compared to tech in the Bay Area (which I agree with). I eventually do want to go to the Bay to work with some of the hot tech companies but I’m worried that the skills I learned will not translate well (e.g. behind the industry changes etc). Was wondering if anyone had any insight or opinions on this? 

I’m super grateful to be in this situation. It’s honestly not something to complain about. But any thoughts would be much appreciated.

Just a bit background about me: I graduated from one of top 3 law schools in my country (it's one of 3rd world countries but I'd rather not share the name of it) with 3.43/4.00 GPA in 2017 (I was in top 30 amongst more than 200 graduates). The school is one of top 400-500 in the QS rankings.

Then, I completed my LLM with a distinction degree from a top 100 world and top 10 the UK university in 2018.

I returned to my country in December 2018 and everything started to go downhill for me:

First, I really wanted to continue academia and purse a PhD. After a few rejections from some EU schools, I've decided that funded PhD's in the EU are mostly closed for candidates from 3rd world countries. In other words, I am not smart, hard-working and ambitious enough for a PhD in Europe. So the door of academia was closed for me.

After that, I've started to apply for jobs/internships in my country since a one year internship must be completed for attorney's license. **It is really important to note here that, as my country is a 3rd world one with a terrible economy, both government and private sector is corrupted i.e. you need to have strong connections (whether from inside a company/office or political one) to get a job.**

Long story short, I've been rejected from 6 more internship applications (some of the offices were best ones while some were midde scaled) and I was devastated. I wanted to die for so long that I prayed (not a believer but from desparation) for dying every night, went to therapy etc.

Now I am doing my internship at an office (unpaid and they literally just accept anyone who applys so nothing to cheer me up here) and it will be over in 6 months.

\------

I have to start applying for new jobs. But I am really scared that I will be rejected again and again. Every time I got rejected I feel like all my education, hard-working and my family's support were for nothing. 

Almost everyone from my school with lower GPA and lower English than me and no LLM have great jobs. Except me. I find it really hard not to give up and keep going. 

Even applying is like going through hell for me and I've been proscrinating for months because of the fear of rejection. So, how can I keep my morale high and don't give up after rejections?

\-----

TL DR; I feel that I am overqualified and people worse qualified than me have great jobs but I got rejected from almost all my applications last year. Now, I need to apply for jobs again and I don't have the courage to make some applications. How can I handle rejections?

Thanks."

Some background: 

1. So I am a 3rd year CS student in a top 15 (according to google, not sure if this even matters lol) college for CompSci in the US. 
2. I have been battling depression and other personal issues since getting to school and my grades have been awful. Sub 2.5 GPA...
3. I am horribly behind as in I have completed all my Gen-eds, Sciences, Maths (all of calc, linear alg), etc and now have all the CompSci classes left to graduate.
4. No internships, no work experience, no side projects. No real skills within CS as I have only taken the weed out data structures course. 

I am tired of being a failure and have realized that my mind has been focused on the wrong things this whole time. Now I am scrambling as I feel like I have so much to do from now to the stages of getting interviews. I'll be graduating 2021 if everything goes as planned. 

Have I completely F'ed up?

My ideas:

1. Firstly, I believe I need an internship for this summer, however I am nervous nobody will accept me as I have no real CS skills compared to all my other peers who have completed more CS classes than me. 
2. I have no side projects and based on what I know so far, I am not sure if I am capable of doing something like creating a mobil app, or web app, or anything really. 
3. I haven't used any university resources, but I think it may be a good idea to ask various professors if I can help them with their research or join graduate students in helping them in some way - think like an intern. 

**TL;DR:** 3rd year not much experience, nothing to put on resume, need advice on what to do so I can get interviews after I graduate and actually have a career."
eg8ee3,4,2019-12-27,"Internship search: MLM Scam from ""x"" employee",uyenvickyvo,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/eg8ee3/internship_search_mlm_scam_from_x_employee/,"This is something I just experience today and would love to share with everyone. Name and Occupation in this story are hidden. 

MLM: Multi-level marketing (**MLM**), also called pyramid selling, network marketing, and referral marketing.

I'm from Silicon Valley, and I'm actively looking for a UX Design Summer Internship. Just like everyone else, I also contact recruiters and employees of companies to learn about their experience, to network, to ask for advice and important asking if their team is looking for an intern using Linkedin.   
About 3 weeks ago, I added and connected with a Senior / Lead employee of a top Silicon Valley company. I checked her resume/portfolio and website to see her skills and experience In my introduction email, I told her briefly about my experience and why I was contacting her. She replied same day saying that she will look out for internship positions within her company and will let her know; but in the meantime, she would like to learn more about me. At that moment, I thought that well, it's normal, if she was going to help with the referral, she should know more about me. The thing I was surprised about was that she suggested we speak on the phone as it is easier. On the phone, she dodged a few of my questions about her job and her company. I found it a little off that the whole conversation was about me. I told her briefly that I was an international student ($$$), doing design and entrepreneurship program at Stanford.  Anyway, after the call, she messaged me on Linkedin and said that she would love to meet me because I sounded like I had potential that she would love to help out. I agreed to meet her. I've met many other designers before to chat casually about their work. So I thought it's just gonna be another one. And my mindset the whole time was that her team is looking for an intern to mentor.

I met her. Again, the whole conversation was just about me. For the first half an hour, we talked about design, which was normal. Then she started to switch the subject to Entrepreneurship and asked me why I was interested in it. At that point, I still thought everything was normal, but I did think about how she was so interested in talking about entrepreneurship while my internship would be about Design. I told her that knowing the Entrepreneurship mindset will help me become a better UX Designer. UX design is just about solving problems every day.  Then, she mentioned that since I moved here as an international student, my family must be very wealth off right? I started to sense something weird and I told her .....no, I told her blanky that I'm a broke students and my family is struggling just like everyone else who lives in San Francisco. I told her I don't have tuition money, and that was why I needed an internship.

 At this moment, I already know it was sketchy and sounded like a scam, but I wanted to hear more.  I can see her expression changed a bit. Her eyes looked a bit like blank to me. Then she told me that I'm no longer qualified for the entrepreneurship private mentorship group (I was like whattttt??!!!???, this is the first time she mentioned it. I don't intend to become an entrepreneur at this point of my life, I thought the whole point of the meeting was to get to know me for a potential referral) She said I had very different mindsets of other people in the group. Everyone joined because they wanted to become financially independent. She started to tell me about how people who joined the group are not retired in their 30s. I told her my goal is different. She then started to guilt trip me and like look down on me by saying how ""her people"" now already make tons of money without doing anything while ""people like me"" are being puppets at corporates. She used an example of an unnamed guy who was also an international student, at my school, how he joined the program and now doesn't have to work a day. She talked about her ""mentors"" like god. I was nice enough to tell her I have to go, and as I was leaving, I even ask her a casual question like ""Hope you have a great new year, do you have any plan?"" - She then said ""Oh, I'm just gonna go back to my husband and we will continue on building assets together"" in a mocking kinda voice. I found it so funny how her behavior and attitude changed from the moment she met me to the moment where I said I'm broke, she realized she can't take advantage of me. 

As I walked out of the car, I started to google. So many similar story popped up. There are many people fall for this mentorship scam because they are desperate. Check subreddit /antiMLM.  This scam mostly targets people who are students, looking for jobs or want to be an entrepreneur overnight. If you got ""chosen"", you would be asked to pay a monthly fee to go through your mentorship ($500 a month up to $2000k a month) which promised you to be a millionaire in like 5 years. Plus, the more people you recruit, the more $$ you have. Anyway, I just found it so funny how I was the one who contacted her first (perfect target), but I was smart enough to spot her weird behavior. I cannot believe this is done by a senior x employee at a big tech company.

I’ve had a very weird night so far. Also, I’m on mobile. So sorry in advance, formatting, blah blah..

Background:

I’m a 20 year old female college student studying 3D Animation. I’m more than halfway through the program and I’ve enjoyed it a lot so far. There’s a huge range of areas that you can specialize in the 3D industry, and through my classes, I think I’ve been at least decent in all the areas so far. I really like animating, but I’m also starting to wonder if I like it enough to do it for the rest of my life. I think I could, if I step away from it, but the long hours at school are starting to burn me out. And it’s almost time to finalize my applications for summer internships and I’m stressing out because I feel like I’m nowhere close to being good enough for Pixar or Dreamworks. I found out that my college doesn’t really pump out people in the specific area of the field that I want to go into, and that I’ll probably have to do another two years post-graduation with an online program if I want to get a job. 

When I was a kid I always had a long list of things I wanted to be when I grew up. Marine biologist, doctor, astronaut, etc. But looking back, most of them had to do with law enforcement. Detective, forensic scientist, etc. I wanted to be in the Air Force for a while. I’ve been watching shows like Forensic Files and Dateline since I was in elementary school. I love that stuff. 

I’ve loved art since I was in middle school. I love painting and drawing and embroidery. I was really into theatre and acting and I always wanted to be in movies. I thought that animation was the perfect career choice to mash those together. At the same time though, I’ve always been intrigued with crime and anatomy. I always thought that I’d be an EMT or something in college, but so far I’ve just been working in restaurants. 

Side note, I’ve always been an academic and overly observant. I’m past my core classes in college now and I kind of miss using all the analytical parts of my brain. I love animation, but I also love the feeling of writing reports that I can be proud of and solving equations. I have taken every class I’ve ever had way too seriously. 

ALSO I’m a person who really looks up to authority figures, especially supervisors or teachers. I commit myself to my work and I really enjoy gaining responsibility and climbing the ladder, even at my dumb high school fast food job. This is definitely possible in an animation career, but it’s also a career that could involve a lot of freelancing, which might be difficult because I do have trouble motivating myself sometimes. And I’m awful at social media marketing and branding myself and all that.

Some Rising Action:

I quit my waitressing job a month and a half ago because I thought that I had a different job, but that fell through. Since all of my final projects were coming up and I was in crazy crunch time for school, I delayed getting a new job until after Christmas. I thought about going back, but I hated my restaurant. I do well under stress, but I thought that I might look for jobs where I felt like my stress was at least about something important. When I left work after a very stressful shift at the restaurant, I didn’t feel relieved or glad that I did something that day. I always felt bad. Sure, people got their food and had a good night, but if the stress got to be too much, I never felt like it was worth it. 

I looked for nannying jobs and nursery jobs. I tried to find any sort of medical job that I could do part-time (are candy-stripers still a thing?) or maybe police jobs where I could just do paperwork or something, idk. But holiday shopping was wearing me down and I  couldn’t afford to dance around and consider my options. I got another restaurant job. This one is really fancy and high-end, and I have the chance to make a lot of money. I should be excited, but I’m really not. 

Today: 

Tomorrow is my first official day of training after all the interviews and paperwork and stuff (for the restaurant). And while I was trying to get to sleep, I thought about my old thought about being an EMT in college. I did some research about that. It sounds fun, but I wouldn’t have enough time to build my animation reel for school. I looked into hospital jobs and police jobs. And I saw some listing for the FBI. 

Now, I know what you’re thinking. The FBI isn’t a college job. And it’s not what I’m studying. And it’s so intense and competitive and high-level, there’s no way some art student could just apply and be in the FBI! 

But I read through the requirements and the interview process and the student internship programs. I couldn’t help but think—what if I put in an internship application for the FBI along with my Pixar, Dreamworks, Sony, and other animation internships? If I somehow got it, should I even take it? Would it be totally stupid if I threw away the career I’m trying to build for a career in law enforcement? I’ve been thinking that I know what I want to do with my life for a few years but suddenly I’m questioning it. 

I’d really value all of your advice, Reddit.


TL;DR I made the decision between art and science/law enforcement in high school. I chose art. Now, in college, I’m second guessing myself. Should I try to get an undergrad FBI internship?"

I live in Portugal and am a math graduate, currently working towards a masters in CS. What I find most enjoyable, and what I believe am better at, is algorithms.

What are some things you think I should be working on, so I can improve myself?

I live in Portugal and am a math graduate, currently working towards a masters in CS. What I find most enjoyable, and what I believe am better at, is algorithms. However, when I compare myself with my classmates, my programming knowledge is really sub par, compared to theirs. I understand most of of the theoretical stuff going on, but when they talk about data bases or other stuff like Unix and the like it flies a bit over my head.

In regards to my skills in programming, I'm more comfortable with Python and C, even though I haven't really done anything special. I also know a tiny little bit of Haskell and SQL.

I'm expecting to do a summer internship next year so I can hopefully improve my skills.

What are some things you think I should be working on, so I can improve myself?

Careeup provides unpaid internships in cities like london, barcelona, singapore etc.

I have got some matches (for soft eng and data science roles) according to them, and they are asking to rank me.

I have given some thoughts to it, and have checked the companies’ profile, which I am impressed about. However, the fact they are unpaid, would really be a big problem, since these major cities have really high living expenses. 

Also, is there a chance some company, if reached personally, will agree in some sort of payment? And overall, what do you think about careerup, and how much would it be helpful for my future of working here in Canada."

egchz8,3,2019-12-27,Information about Masters in CS/Visual Computing at Saarland University - I asked some questions I had in mind to a few students and thought I'd share their responses for other prospective students.,HaseoKusajishi,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/egchz8/information_about_masters_in_csvisual_computing/,"I had got an admit for Visual Computing at Saarland, and I'd asked around about the university to a few current/past students. Just thought I'd share their answers for everyone who might be thinking of pursuing a Masters here. Note that some of the information is specific to CS/Visual Computing, and may not hold for other programs. I've numbered the answers, where each number corresponds to a specific student's answer. I've copied their answers verbatim, except fixing typos and removing personal details.

**Q1: As a Saarland student, do you have a chance of getting to work with  researchers from MPI and DFKI, while being a Masters student? For  instance, do a lot of students get to do their Masters theses at  MPI/DFKI/any other research cluster? What does this depend on, your  grades/the program you're attending/networking with profs?**

**A1**: Yes. As a master's student, I am involved with MPI-INF as a research  assistant (HiWi). Yes, there are plenty of masters students who do their  thesis with these institutes.

**A2**: Yes, you can get work there. I know countless people who started working at DFKI close to the start of their studies, even when they weren't good at coding yet. I also know people who worked at the Scheer Tower, CISPA, or others. It should be absolutely no problem to  find a small side job during your studies. For theses: usually, professors will openly suggest topics and you  talk about it to them OR you have a topic in mind, talk to a professor  about it and he will either connect you with people who know a lot about  the topic or do the supervision himself. It is mandatory that your  first supervisor is a professor (being a professor is something more  unique in Germany than in in the US, it doesn't just mean ""lecturer""). I  know people who did their theses at DFKI combined with their side job, I  know some who did it just with a professor and I personally did mine at  a company, working together with one professor. Lots of possibilities.

**A3**: Yes, for instance I am doing my master's thesis in MPI and I know of a lot of students who do it in either DFKI/MPI.

**A4**: Yes, grades matter but so does prior experience. It can help if you've taken a course with the prof. in question but isn't strictly necessary. If you're going to reach out to someone it's also important to write a nice motivation letter describing your research interests and to make connections to what research is being done in the department, i.e. send a targeted application and not a generic one.

**A5**: Yes - grades are important - how you performed in their classes - you can go talk to them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2: What do most Saarland graduates end up doing? Do they go on to do a PhD  at one of the associated research institutes, or move to industry? I did try to learn this from LinkedIn but it seems skewed towards research.**

**A1**: Research. Masters students, for some reason, do not seem to be very  motivated to pursue positions in the industry. I am not one of them, and  I hope to go back to the industry as soon as I am done.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3: What's the student:prof ratio like, in Visual Computing (VC)? I mean, are profs usually responsive to individual queries/project discussions?**

**A1**: Not sure about ratios. Some lectures have a lot of students, some hardly  have 20 students attending them. Really depends on whether it's a core  course, whether the subject is easy e.t.c. Professors have office hours  during which you can approach them. As far as I have noticed, they encourage discussions.

**A2**: I don't know the exact ratio but it heavily depends on the courses.  There are courses with hundreds of people but also some with only 20-50.  It would be interesting to know where you're from. University here is  QUITE different to the UK/US. Brits and Americans have told me that in  their home countries, it's more like school, there are more resources  (because of the higher costs) which means you can go to the professor  any time you want and they will always be able to help you on the spot. In Germany, university expects you to be more independent, meaning  that you're expected to work through things yourself. Obviously you can  email your professor anytime and go to office hours and whatnot but I've  often heard complains from (especially) Americans that they felt like  they don't get enough support. The job of a professor in Germany is  research + teaching as opposed to only teaching, so they often have a  LOT on their schedule and are therefore more busy. But obviously, you  will find professors who are very communicative and some who are not. It  all depends.

**A3**: I don't know the exact number, you can check the visual computing page for the number of profs. Some professors are very helpful/responsive some aren't. Usually the ""in demand"" professors are less responsive especially if you send them unsolicited (also not very well drafted) emails asking for thesis/hiwi, etc. You can check online for general rules of emailing profs, there are some good posts on Quora/StackOverflow.

**A4**: As a general caveat, I completed the masters a few years ago and things have changed a little since then, mostly that more students are applying/getting accepted and the course selection/profs have changed a little. It depends on the course, but usually the ratio is OK and in any case all profs/tutors usually have a one-hour weekly slot for office hours and it shouldn't be tough to get an appointment to discuss whatever you need to.

**A5**: Depends - if you have a good profile - yes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4: Do you happen to know anything about the courses and the quality of teaching in the VC program?**

**A1**: VC program has a lot of overlap with the computer science program, though VC is more restrictive in the sense that you *have*  to take some mandatory lectures. Quality of ""teaching"" depends really  on the professors. The courses, including the assignments, are usually  designed well, and the assignments will contain material not covered in  the lecture. This is not necessarily a bad thing.

**A2**: I do not. I would think that at least some of them would overlap with normal CS courses. For those I can say that some people say that CS courses at Saarland University are a little more theoretical than at  other universities. But CS here has an excellent reputation and I've never known a graduate who did not get a good job afterwards.

**A3**: Again, just like at any university the quality varies but there are some profs who are exceptionally good at teaching e.g. Prof. Weickert.

**A4**: The quality of the program and the courses are very good.

**A5**: I was in VC program - I changed to CS - it has a rigid structure and is quite math heavy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q5: It's stated on the VC program site that students can take core CS  courses and go on to get a Masters in CS. Do you happen to know people in CS who've done this successfully? I was wondering what the experience is like.**

**A1**: I know students who switched from VC to a CS degree, because they found  the bucketing system in VC (i.e, you have to complete x credits in topic  y) annoying. Computer Science do not have any mandatory courses, and  hence you are never forced to study a topic you do not like.

**A2**: I do not. It's not that uncommon to take courses from other specializations though. A friend of mine did a bachelors for both  ""Medieninformatik"" and normal ""Informatik"" (CS).

**A3**: I know some people who have switched halfway through, it isn't complicated. Some people do it because the course requirements are less rigid for CS and you need slightly less coursework because some credit points go towards your MSc thesis presentation. If you're asking about getting a double degree, you might have to take some additional courses and do a second thesis.

**A4**: As a VC student you can transfer to CS if your grades are good, the courses you can take as a CS student and a VC student are more or less the same.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q6: In general, what's the work/life balance like? I understand different  people have different paces and lifestyles, but assuming that a student  doesn't slack off and doesn't party much, is the pace of teaching  manageable? For instance, do you see people in CS/VC struggling to keep up?**

**A1**: Depends on the quality of the student, and more importantly, the choice  of lectures. You would have an easy time coping up with HCI  (Human-Computer Interaction - it is a core course) if you decide to take  that course. But instead, if you are taking a mathy core course like  optimization, naturally you will find if a bit more challenging.  Personally, I think that the coursework is very manageable. If you are  having a hard time, there's no penalty associated with dropping out of a  course. And students tend to do this a lot - they usually sign up for a  lot of courses, realise later that a) they don't like it or b) they  like it but do not have time for it, and this is very normal behavior.  For instance, I attended machine learning lectures this semester (core, 9  credits), realised that I have too much on my plate and there's no way  I'll find time for all the things that I am doing. Also, the ML course  this semester was offered by the math department, and I am not a fan of  their notations and love for theorems. So I stopped attending ML  lectures, and signed up for an ""elements of statistical learning""  course. The topics are *very* similar to the ML course, but it is  just 5 credits (hence less work load) and they don't care much about  proofs. The point I am trying to make is, Saarland is very flexible. I'm  sure you will be able to find some combination of coursework that you  would be able to cope up with.

**A2**: Obviously extremely different from person to person. There are courses  that are known to be difficult and others that are known to be easier. I  think most people struggle with math the most, although this might be  more for the bachelor's than the master's degree. I think it should be  fine if you apply yourself a little bit. Semester breaks are long in  Germany (2-3 months twice a year, if you don't take seminars during that  time), so you always have some time to relax and cool down.

**A3**: Yes, it's manageable. Finding people to do assignments with helps. Often you are encouraged to hand them in in groups.

**A4**: Depends on the courses you take, but yes, people do struggle if they  take more difficult courses, it depends on your priorities, what type of  courses you want to take, how fast you want to finish, etc.

**A5**: I didn't have a work-life balance - especially during my thesis - it's all work - for me it was...but it's manageable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q7: For administrative tasks and filling paperwork, do you need to know fluent German?**

**A1**: Yes. You must know German. But I don't speak any German. I managed anyway. So will you ;)

**A2**: I'm gonna say no because of all my American friends surviving despite  not being close to fluent in the language. You should prepare yourself  for LOTS of annoying bureaucracy at the start though. In the first few  weeks, there's gonna be a LOT of annoying paperwork that has to be done.  But people are usually helpful enough and if you struggle too much,  Germans you will meet will help you out with translating.

**A3**: No. Although I was already fluent in German, so I can't speak to this much. Isn't a barrier as far as I can tell from friends.

**A4**: You can get by without knowing German, you can use Google translate and all but in some cases it may be difficult.

**A5**: No no, you will get help - so don't worry.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q8: I read that Saarland dormitories have a long waiting list. Do you happen to know how far back you need to book a slot, to have a good chance of  getting it?**

**A1**: The waiting period is a semester. I ended up getting a one-room apartment (studio?) in the city.

**A2**: Yes, they are always at full capacity and especially during winter  times, it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to find a spot if you don't apply  extremely early. The majority people live in so-called WGs  (Wohngemeinschaften) which just means shared flat with other people  (usually other students). This is the most cost-efficient option if you  don't generally dislike people (and also you will make friends much  easier).

**A3**: No idea, but it's tricky to get a place and it's best to start as early as possible.

**A5**: That's tough - don't rely on it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q9: Do you have any specific website recommendations for student apartments (shared housing) in Saarbrucken?**

**A1**: There are a lot of WGs (i.e shared apartments). I sort of wanted to live alone, and hence got my room [here](https://www.studentenwohnungen-saarbruecken.de/unsere-wohnangebote-fur-studenten-saarbruecken.html).

**A2**: The most common one by FAR is [https://www.wg-gesucht.de/](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/). The optimal places for students are St.Johann, Mitte or  Alt-Saarbrücken. St.Johann covers much of the city center and also  includes the ""Nauwieserviertel"" which is basically the student's quarter  full of pubs. Mitte is also in the city center but usually more  expensive and Alt-Saarbrücken is a little quieter, further away but  really cheap to live in. Dudweiler is also extremely close to the  university but it's VERY far away from the inner city and anything..  exciting. But they have a nice climbing gym at least.

**A3**: This group: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/862796117115095/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/862796117115095/) and this website: [https://www.wg-gesucht.de/](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/).

&amp;#x200B;

**Q10: Are there ample computing resources available to students at Saarland?  For instance, for deep learning experiments or rendering, one would need  access to GPU servers with high RAMs, often for a prolonged duration  (long-running experiments/simultaneous experiments). Are such resources  readily available to students?**

**A1**: Yes. I took a high-level computer vision course (offered by MPI) on my first semester and the course involved a project, and all students were given access to decent GPUs. I don't remember exactly, but I think they were P100s. Basically, you SSH into MPI/University resources through a VPN.

**A2**: We had this at the Computational Linguistics department to train language models etc. and our department is soooo much smaller. So I would definitely think: yes. But that's a question you could ask the Studienkoordinator.

**A3**: Not sure about this. The deep learning boom took off when was already a research assistant in the computer vision department.

**A5**: I would assume..

&amp;#x200B;

**Q11: I've heard that the style of teaching math is rather ""dry"" in German  universities, with less emphasis on proof motivation and visualization,  and more on terse theorem-proof sessions. Would you say that is true to a  large extent, or is this dependent on individual profs?**

**A1**: That statement is true, but fortunately not so much in Saarland. But  then again, I avoid proof-heavy math courses like the plague, so I might  not be the best person to answer this. The assignments do sometimes ask  the students to prove something, and I sometimes do get get annoyed  with this.

**A2**: Yes, that's what I hear a lot too. Math can get rather dry. My math  courses were nothing like CS courses, so I cant compare them with mine.

**A3**: Depends on the professor, and I don't know what your reference point is here, but some do place a lot of emphasis on theorem proofs, and some don't.

**A5**: That's true - I think.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q12: Is there any academic advantage/disadvantage in enrolling in one semester over another, for VC?**

**A1**: Nope.

**A2**: In my experience, the winter semester is the 'normal' one to start for  MOST pograms. That's when you have most of the introductory courses,  etc. But i can absolutely not say if this is the case for VC I'm afraid.

**A3**: Depends on the courses on offer, but one nice course for the first semester which I believe is offered in the summer is the Image Processing and Computer Vision course. Ultimately, I don't think it matters too much.

**A5**: Not really - not imo

&amp;#x200B;

**Q13: How does the process of getting MPI to approve you doing your Masters  thesis there work? Is it like, you get good grades in a set of courses  related to the work of a researcher in MPI, contact him over email  asking for a RA position, then have an interview with them? Or do you  discuss your interests with one of the profs at Saarland, they recommend  your name over to a researcher at MPI, who then contacts you for an  interview?**

**A1**: In my case, I just went to the lecturer at the end of the course (i.e  the last lecture of the course) and straight up asked him ""Is there a  way I can contribute to your research, preferably as a HiWi?"". He said  yes. By this point, he was familiar with me (I was a regular in the  class), and my assignment grades were good. He asked me to email him,  and mention that we talked after the lecture, and that was it. He read  through my resume and offered me a HiWi. Usually, if the  professor/lecturer does not know you, you go through an interview - I  didn't have to since he knew me. Getting a masters thesis at MPI follows  a similar pattern - turn up for lectures offered by people from the  MPI, get okayish grades at least, and then walk up to the professor and  ask. If you seem motivated enough, the professor will usually be happy  to have you as a thesis student. *Some* departments, like D2 at  MPI-INF (Multimodal computing and machine learning) are quite in demand  (everyone and their grandmother wants to do a thesis in ML+CV) and thus  has a GPA cutoff - 1.5 or better. That's an unfairly high cutoff, since  unlike the US, Germany does not have grade inflation, and you have to be  really good at giving exams to maintain an overall GPA of 1.5 or  higher. However, regardless of your GPA, most departments will offer you a thesis if you do reasonably well in their particular course and show sufficient motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q14: How easy is it to make the switch from VC to CS (Do you need to maintain high grades?  Does it depend on CS student strength at the time?), and when can it be  done at the earliest?**

**A1**: It's quite easy. You just have to fill out an application form. Yes, you  must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher, and you can switch only after the  first semester. Getting 2.0 or higher shouldn't too difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q15: If I decide to take courses at a slow pace, can I stay and study beyond the normal duration of the program?**

**A1**: Yup. You have a whopping 6 semesters to complete your coursework (i.e 90  credits). And then you can take another semester to do your thesis, I  guess. There's some restriction - for example, you *must*  complete 9 credits by the end of your first semester, 30 by the end of  the second, and so on (I forgot the exact numbers). But yes, you can  take more than the normal duration of the program. Also, there's no  ""normal"" duration of the program. Most students I know take 5 semesters -  4 semesters for coursework + a semester for the thesis. But I took more  courses than recommended, and I'm set to complete my coursework by my  3rd semester. I'll probably do the thesis on my fourth semester and be  done with the whole thing, or skip my fourth semester altogether to do  an internship somewhere, though I don't have any internship offers as of  yet. But then again, I was fine with filling up all my free time with assignments and the HiWi job, and not working so hard for the exams. Long story short, how fast you  want to graduate depends all on you. If you go all in, and enroll for  courses during the semester breaks as well (yes, some courses are  offered during the break), then you *can* be done with your  coursework in almost two semesters, and move on to your thesis. That  puts the earliest graduation date as 3 semesters.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q16: What is it like to do a HiWi job at MPI? I mean, what does your day to  day work look like? Do you actually get involved with the prof's  research and get to publish stuff?**

**A1**: This varies *wildly*. I think I won the HiWi lottery though. I  somewhat contribute to the research (i.e helped build a research  toolkit). I am not micro-managed, and my working hours are very flexible, and I'm on friendly terms with my advisor (we get a beer  together once every few weeks). But as far as I understand, what I have  is an exception and not the norm. An overwhelming majority of HiWi jobs are web dev stuff that  do not usually lead to a publication. However, if you do a good job,  you dramatically increase the chances of getting a thesis there, or in  any case, your advisor might be able to give you a recommendation letter  based on your HiWi.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q17: Of the courses you've taken so far, what courses did you love? Also, are  there any courses that you'd blindly suggest to avoid (prof irregular,  teaching unclear with fast pace)? Of course, interests vary across  people, but I'm just trying to get a general idea of the department's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to teaching.**

**A1**: I'll give you a short summary of the courses I took last summer semester:

a. IPCV (Image Processing and Computer Vision) - well structured, you  get a very good understanding of image analysis (sobel and gaussian  filters, fourier transforms, optical flow etc), and the lectures are interesting.

b. (HLCV) High Level Computer Vision - Offered by MPI. Lectures are *bad*  \- they're not boring but there are 200 slides per lecture and yet the  professor (Bernt Schiele) finishes early. I remember explicitly asking  him ""do I need a deep learning background for this course?"" and he  smiled and said, ""not necessarily, you should be able to pick things up  during the course"". I did pick things up, but only because my team put  in an insane amount of time on the assignments. HLCV basically drops you  at the deep end of the pool, and you either sink or you swim. But the  assignments and the project was worth it - I am quite confident with  pytorch now and the background I got really helped me with the other  courses. Once you go through HLCV, you can go through anything. Dr.  Schiele also explicitly mentioned that ""If you survive the first 2  assignments, you will survive the course"". I would heavily recommend  this course, but be prepared to slog.

c. AI (Artificial Intelligence). Waste of time. I took this only  because it was just algorithms, and it was a core course (9 credits).  This was supposed to be my ""easy course"", and though the assignments  were easy enough, the exam was a Kobayashi Maru. You are given 2 hours,  and until you write (and think) really fast, you can't complete the  exam. Given enough time, I could have scored a lot more. Makes me wonder  what they are trying to evaluate - my understanding of the subject or  how fast I can churn out algorithms? I ended up getting a 2.7 for this  easy subject, but I won't complain since I got my 9 credits without  working much for it.

d. TNIR (Topics in Neural Information Retrieval). My favorite course  last summer semester. The assignments involved reading actual research  papers and writing an essay comparing and contrasting them. Had a lot of  fun, and since you read a lot of research papers, you get a good idea  of the research field *and* a sense of accomplishment towards the  end of the course. But this can  be quite dry if you are not into NLP/IR.

e. German classes. Enough said.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q18: If you do an internship at a company in the last semester, whom would  you work with for your thesis? A prof from Saarland or a company person?**

**A1**: For doing your thesis with a company, you have to get a professor from  the university to co-supervise you. Not sure if professors like doing  this. In any case, you can do an internship without it being a thesis -  you get 6 credit points for doing a ""praktikum"" - i.e an industrial  internship. The main reason students would like an industry thesis is  that they get paid there, while no professor would pay a Masters thesis student at the University.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q19: I hear Saarland has a gym (Uni-fit). Do you happen to know how much they charge students?**

**A1**: Oh yeah, I use the uni-gym. It's around 20 euros a month for the students.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q20: Is there anything else you wish an international student knew before joining Saarland?**

**A2**: Travel! Saarland is basically in the heart of Europe, you can get to  so many places. Paris is only 2-3 hours away. There are lots of German  cities to visit, too. There is so much to see and you should take  advantage of living so centrally in Europe. All my international friends  said that they loved how easy it was to travel through all of Europe. About studying here generally: never stress too much about  university, there is so much other stuff in life. Take time for your  hobbies, relax and to make and meet friends.  I consider some  international friends I met as some of my best friends to this day.  Don't see studying abroad just a cheap option to study but also to  broaden your horizons.

**A5**: It's a good place :)"

egeig6,21,2019-12-27,Referred for Integrity Issue,cryingforhers,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/egeig6/referred_for_integrity_issue/,"AHHH. I recently got an email that I was referred to the dean for a possible integrity issue. When I emailed the prof (this is for a stats class with coding), he said that there was evidence saying that I had copied code off of another student or off the internet. I went through the 9 assignments we did and realized I had used Chegg on one out of the like 80 problems I did. I did not even use it on the code, I used it in my explanation like a dumbfuck. In addition, I honestly put in so much work - hours of work - into this class and cannot believe I was referred over one question. I also got an A on the exams and final project.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much the last few days I have been tripping balls, believing that I will fail (which means it is unlikely I will get an internship) or it will be on my transcript forever (AHHH). 

I am so scared. Does anyone have any idea what is going to happen and what I should do? Any advice will be appreciated :)  Thank you."
egeq26,1,2019-12-27,Springboard &amp; job guarantees? Is it worth it?,fozz179,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/egeq26/springboard_job_guarantees_is_it_worth_it/,"I have a friend who's trying to get into a comp sci career. Hes currently pretty set on the Springboard software engineering course. He's under the impression its very much worth it as they apparently 'guarantee' you a job at the end. 

Myself, being heavily self taught, am under the impression the course doesn't really offer anything he can't do on his own for mostly free. I'v suggested he work through one of the Odin Project's curriculum, find some courses on Coursera/Udemy to supplement his knowledge, work on lots of his own projects and build up a profile on github and then apply for jobs from there. 

I'm a professional software dev and iv offered to 'mentor' him a few times a week as well, so hes got that for free as well. 

So is this viable, or is spending ~10k on Sprinboard, still somehow worth it?

I think of myself as mostly self taught but i did go through a college course &amp; i got a programming job through an internship the school setup for me. So i'm not really sure how viable it is to get a job purely from just being self taught."

egfw1k,65,2019-12-27,Lesson learned from this recruiting season: behaviorals and communication are KEY!!,_BurntRice,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/egfw1k/lesson_learned_from_this_recruiting_season/,"So after a full recruiting season, one thing I noticed when reflecting back is that companies that included a behavioral in their interviewing process were the ones that I either got an offer from or went far in their interview process and I feel like the leetcode grind is always far more emphasized in comparison to behaviorals.  

  
Now of course there’s the leetcode grind and im not saying that’s not important. Obviously most times you have to go through a coding challenge. And honestly those are just a matter of being on that stupid leetcode grind (I personally HATE IT).   
  
But I found that once I passed that and go to phone and onsite interviews, my behaviorals carried a lot of weight. Especially for interns where they care about “culture fit”. I think at the end of the day, there’s gonna be a ton of people who can solve leetcode problems and code but it’s the behaviorals that can REALLY set a candidate apart. Even before the coding challenge, at career fairs, having a solid answer to “Tell me about yourself” can make a huge difference with a recruiter.    
  
  
Furthermore, communication during the technicals is really important. Sometimes when I get stuck (Which is lowkey often since im not the best technical interviewer), i’ll flat out tell the interviewer that i’m hitting a wall and explain where i’m getting confused and just talk it out. I know this kind of thing is always written in forums and CTCI but I’d like to endorse those methods as it can really make or break an interview.  
Prepare those stories and mock them with your friends. And for those of you who did the Amazon LP stuff, use it in other companies behaviorals. It may seem like less of a priority compared to leetcode practice but put the time into it. Best of luck to everyone this recruiting season!"

My name is Anthony and I worked at GS IBD for five years. During that time, I interviewed hundreds of summer analyst and summer associate applicants and scored dozens of HireVue recordings. I also ran the lateral and mobility recruiting processes and was on the summer intern review panel for my industry group.

In addition, I was an MBA admissions reader at the Kellogg School of Management and Co-Captain of my college recruiting team at Oliver Wyman, so happy to answer any questions you might have about business school applications or management consulting recruiting.

Selfishly, I'm here today to promote my company, [IBsherpa](https://www.ibsherpa.com), which offers career coaching services for aspiring investment bankers.

Over the past several years, investment banking recruiting has faced increased competitive pressure from tech, management consulting, and buyside.  Investment banks have responded by utilizing technologies like the HireVue interview that allow them to scale recruiting efforts and expand outside their traditional core set of schools. In addition, banks have worked to standardize their recruiting processes (including limiting technical interview questions to a pre-approved list) in order to reduce interviewer bias.

Today, more than ever, the banking recruiting process can be prepared for, and knowing what to spend your time (and what not to) can really be the difference between getting an offer vs. not.

So with that, ask me (almost) anything!

eghhl2,42,2019-12-27,PSA: How to do research at a university as a student without paying for a program,Abject_Combination,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eghhl2/psa_how_to_do_research_at_a_university_as_a/,"I've gotten a few questions from people asking how I interned/worked at 3 different labs and authored 3 research papers in high school. I wanted to help some of you out who are interested in such experiences without having to shell out thousands of dollars for summer programs and personal/family connections to researchers.

**My experience going through the process:**

I'm from the Bay Area in California, so UCSF, Stanford, and Berkeley were all options. I first had an independent project I started in my freshman year. I needed a lab to test a device I made since it would require a very niche, hazardous organism, so I contacted a few labs with the proper equipment with a full project proposal. I wrote a very detailed email about my background, my project, and how I could carry out my testing in their lab. I also attached a resume, which gave me credibility.

Fortunately out of the 10-ish emails (far too few in retrospect) I sent, I got one offer to interview, which ultimately lead to an internship over the winter months. This situation was kind of unique since I was working on my own project—not assisting with the lab's existing ones. I authored a paper from my work independently and have been continuing the project on my own time for the past 4 years.

My second experience was over summer as a rising junior. I had experience, so I was able to talk about that in the emails. I sent 20 emails this time (again, too few). Problem is, I started sending emails over summer, which was way too late. Don't make this mistake. Somehow, I was accepted and went to one lab. No paper this time, as I didn't try to create my own project. Still, I had a good time.

Third experience started in spring this year and is ongoing. I started sending emails in winter, and this time, I sent a metric fuck ton (around a 100). I got a few responses and went to interview. Ended up choosing a lab I really love for their research interests and the fact that the professor was extremely laid back. He also emphasized the fact I was able to choose a project of my own since he wanted me to focus on computational work instead of wet lab given my background.    From this, I've authored 2 papers of my own. Best experience of all 3 labs.

**My advice for you:**

For your first research experience, you're going to have to prove your potential since you haven't been in a lab before. If you don't have a project, you can join as an intern to help with their existing projects. In that case, to find a lab, you need to do some research by going to different professors' lab websites and figuring out what you're interested in. Most have their emails on the website or somewhere online; it's easy to find.

The thing is, volume is key. Send as many emails as you can, because I can guarantee 90% of professors won't respond. But make sure you personalize your email for every professor—don't just send a mass email. You really want to look for a place where you'll be happy doing research.

Once you get a response, the professor will most likely call you for an interview. This is probably just a formality; it's not stressful at all, at least in my experience. This gives you a chance to better understand that particular lab and ask questions.If you're lucky enough to get multiple interviews, then decide where you'll be able to get the most tangible results. At the end of the day, you want to have something to show for all your work at a lab, be it a paper or a letter of rec.

Papers are going to be tough unless you contribute something truly novel. Authoring a paper, where you are head of the project, is a significant time commitment and will not happen if you're just interning or helping out. That being said, it's a great experience if you can manage it.

**Why would a professor want a high school intern?**

It sometimes just comes down to generosity and genuine people who want to foster science in the next generation. Cynically thinking, you're also going to be free labor for them :)

**Closing thoughts:**

I hope this post helps some of you out there. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any starting points for university labs near you."

The Perfect Essay for the Common Application

by Awesome College Confidential Mom

Last night, as I looked through my lovely son’s application for his safety school, Harvard University, I was very much disappointed by what I saw. My son had written a perfectly inadequate essay that did not play to his strengths at all—he had written about what he learned from his internship over the summer, instead of his grueling journey of taking the SATs thirty-six times ~~because I forced him to~~! So as I am an awesome, cool, and loving mom who knows how college applications work, due to my browsing the incredibly credible site College Confidential for at least sixteen hours a day, I decided that I needed to rewrite my son’s Common Application essay for him so that it would be ~~as~~ perfect ~~as I am~~ and really portray his struggles accurately. 

*The following prompt has been chosen:*

*Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.*

From a young age, I’ve been an incredibly persevering person. In fact, to demonstrate this incredibly awesome quality of mine, I will now relate you to grueling journey of achieving over a 1600 on my SATs. In fact, I believe that I possess the extremely special and rare talent of being able to break the maximum score barrier of the SAT. 

Few students have struggled as much as I have. Every time I yelled at my mother—sorry—*reminded* my dear, lovely mother rather loudly to log onto my CollegeBoard account and sign me up for my SAT, I strained my vocal chords quite a bit. This has caused me to be quite a sickly person throughout my high school career. However, because of my determination, I was still able to take the SAT a total of thirty-six times. I can also proudly say that I have developed high strength and stamina in my vocal chords; I can speak audibly for a full one hour a day now, and am able to still speak semi-audibly with the assistance of a megaphone for the other twenty-three hours of the day. I believe that I may soon be recruited by many top universities in the country due to my athletic prowess.

What’s my secret? I started early. See, most high schoolers aren’t intelligent, high-functioning beings like me, so they never realized that they should have started taking this test in middle school. Unlike those monkeys, I like to start early. From the first day I entered my sixth grade homeroom class, I cracked open those SAT prep books and started studying. Because I am an incredibly focused and hardworking person, I was able to stare at my Princeton Review book for a whopping nineteen minutes per day.

However, despite my early efforts to achieve success on the SAT, I was unable to achieve my target goal of 1600. I was only able to score a slightly below average, mediocre 1590 on the SAT. What’s wrong with that? Well, while a 1590 may seem incredibly impressive to my small-brained high school cohorts, who would be lucky to even score a 100 on the SAT, a 1590 was ten points too far away from my goal of scoring the equivalent of what my friend paid to get fake pictures of her with rowing equipment to successfully get admitted to the University of Somewhere in California: $1,600. 

So I took the SAT again. And again. And again. And again. And again. This went on thirty-five times. Each time, my vocal chords were strained as I loudly reminded my mother to register me for the SAT again. Each time, I tore my biceps tendon vicariously when my mother picked up her credit card to pay for my SAT. Each time, my vision instantly blurred with tears when my mother registered me; my eyeballs had been vicariously strained when she stared at the computer screen. It was a difficult journey I struggled through. It was bad for my extremely strong, indelicate immune system. It was some tuff stuff. 

But finally, through my hard work and exertion, I was able to reach my goal. On my thirty-sixth attempt at exerting my dominance on the SATs, I was finally able to achieve my dream score of 1700. By then, I was physically exhausted. I had lost my voice (the proctor was a meanie; she didn’t let me bring my megaphone into the testing room—as if I would cheat with the megaphone! I’m not a peasant; I cheat instead by hiding notes in my Texas Instruments graphing calculator). 

While most people believe that the maximum score one can get on the SAT is 1600, I am the sole possessor of the score of 1700 on the test. (Did YOU receive a 1700 on the SAT? No? I didn’t think so anyways.) Through my hard work, I believe that I have cultivated a talent of being able to break score barriers. I have reached the uncharted territories. I have broken stereotypes of what American students can achieve. I have single-handedly raised the bar for the rest of you fools. I am a pioneer. I am revolutionary."
egke07,0,2019-12-27,How do I face rejection if my older cousin doesn't want to go to a music fesival with me? She means so much to me and I know that I don't know how I would face rejection from her.,JohnFruscianteIsBack,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/egke07/how_do_i_face_rejection_if_my_older_cousin_doesnt/,"I'm 17 (guy) and my cousin is 20 by the way.

So I basically wanted to invite my cousin to a music festival because one of my favourite bands (who I've never seen live before) are playing there, and though my parents say I am only allowed to buy a ticket for myself (despite me having the money for two tickets), I’m still gonna buy two tickets before asking her. I know I will cry though if my cousin says no, and I will also hurt myself and maybe even stop eating until my parents force me. I'm not saying that would be my cousin's fault though, I'm just a little sensitive. It would mean so much to me though if my cousin said yes. I would probably jump around and brag to everyone I know that I'm going to see Pearl Jam with a girl. 

The price for two tickets by the way, is 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival however isn't happening until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from my high school for attendance (only in the country I live in), as well as my internship (I go to school three days a week and am at my internship two days a week). I've also been thinking of using my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival.

The reason why I want to pay for my cousin is because she is such a special person. She's incredibly ambitious, and sweet. It's like she's my best friend even though I'm not her best friend. But I want to pay for her because I feel like she's probably going to think of me more highly then. And we've never bought each other gifts, we just get money from our aunts when it's our birthdays. I haven't asked her yet, although she went to this festival last summer, so I know there’s at least a bit of a chance she'll go. Although I have several friends, none of them would want to go to the festival, because of one of these reasons:

1.They're not interested (maybe don't care for music that much or they don't like big crowds).

2.They're too poor for the ticket.

3.They would rather spend money on something else.

I feel like I would be in a really surrealistic dream to go to this festival with my cousin. I imagine that when/if Pearl Jam play ""Black"", I tell her ""holy shit this is the greatest day of my life"".

It's like, if she says no, should I just drink myself to misery? I just don't know how I would cope. I still want to ask her though. I feel like there's at least a 30% chance she'll say yes, and even though that might be a slim chance I still have some confidence that she'll say yes.

TL;DR How do I face rejection if my older cousin doesn't want to go to a music fesival with me? She means so much to me and I know that I don't know how I would face rejection from her."

Someone can probably put this much more eloquently than I. 

Saw an interesting post in /r/Engineeringstudents I'd like to discuss

The OP in that sub put together in infograph of 80 some companies he applied to for an internship. The results were not too welcoming, and it turns out that over half of the companies he applied to didn't even give him the time of day to send him a rejection letter.  This got me thinking. At any well- established college/university, there are only so many students in a particular program (say 7-8 hundred). Now, take the amount of colleges in a certain state that offer the similar type of major program as another in-state college, and you're up to a couple thousand students. 

Up to this point, I've only been talking about colleges in a single state. But think about how many colleges there are in a country like the US.  Now, I'm beginning to think about how the STEM degree market is beginning to become oversaturated. Notice how there's no shortage of minimum wage type jobs at the moment (at least in my area), but specialized jobs are nearly impossible to come by (as shown by OP's experience in /r/engineeringstudents). I think if the economy was truly booming, people with degrees wouldn't have trouble finding more specialized (bullshit) work and jobs wouldn't have to be created just to be created. Truly,  I think this problem arises from living in a capitalist, economic system.  Seriously, if you create a job just to create a job (and pay someone the absolute minimum), what's the point? It just seems like an endless feedback loop where nothing is being accomplished."

I have had a hard time making friends for a long time, at 10 I was taken out of school due to bullying, at 14 I stopped wanted to deal with the religious homeschool group due to their bigotry which was the entire homeschool community in the area and then at 16 I was taking college classes with students in their 20s who just weren't interested. I'm still in the weird position of being younger or in groups were social circles have been established and being autistic and depressed + having ADHD just makes things hard. But at this point, I'm used to dinners with an overbearing mother and a sister that resents me cause we are constantly being pitted against each other.

It's just that within the last two months I've been rejected by every internship I've applied for, I am not sure if I am even in the field I want to be, struggling with classes for a master Idk if I want, lost my cat that I've have since I was 8 and the constant reason I told myself not to self-harm or be suicidal, trying to come to terms with maybe being aro with a mother who thinks that means being a sociopath and a community that has been ripped to shreds, realizing my mother has more sympathy for her boyfriends' ex wife who refuses to get a job, clean her house, cook real food for her kids and has called the police on my sister over charges she made up all cause she had depression ""worse"" than me, been ghosted by my one internet friend and I am worried that they will hurt themselves due to their last message, lost a baby snake I was raising up and I still don't know what I did wrong that killed him, dealt with family who is just constantly upset that I am not doing more and having my mother who comments on my weight and whatever I eat nonstop. 

Along with losing my meds and being too scared to admit it cause I couldn't handle any more criticism, I have been crying constantly and can't feel joy at most things. I have new meds but still, feel like shit all the time.

I am not writing, or play video games or even enjoying watching tv. 

I am trying to get better. I am trying to join some groups on roll20, I have a job, trying to find local activities to attend, learning to use public transport cause I can't drive and forced myself to write something for a fan zine.

I just think if I have to deal with one more lonely birthday I'm going to breakdown and my mother had told me to my face she will put me in an institution if I go too far for her(in anger, but she tends to let what she really thinks, knows and feels slip when she is mad so I am taking it seriously) and that terrifies me. 

Is there anything I can do to try to make this less lonely?"

I am thinking about a doing tech career in financial institutions, like fintech, investment banks, hedge funds etc. I was always interested in finance and economics, but I never got the chance to learn it during my bachelor's or master's CS program. Now I am planning to learn those areas on my own and get a CFA certificate. I know that the program is quite dense and will take at least half a year of hard work to pass the exam.

I just wanted to hear from more experienced folks from fintech industry, what they think about this idea. Does it make sense to invest that much work and will it help to advance my career in such institutions? Or is it a better idea to spend that time on getting more ground in CS?"

egpvz4,0,2019-12-28,"Is it a good idéa if I pay for two tickets to a music festival, and then ask my cousin if she wants to come? My parents say I can't pay for anyone but me, but I disagree as I think it's OK to not be greedy.",RolliSchimdt,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/egpvz4/is_it_a_good_idéa_if_i_pay_for_two_tickets_to_a/,"I'm 17 (guy), and my cousin is 20 by the way.

If she says no though, I know I will cry and I will also hurt myself and maybe even stop eating until my parents force me. I'm not saying that would be my cousin's fault though, I'm just a little sensitive. It would mean so much to me though if my cousin said yes. I would probably jump around and brag to everyone I know that I'm going to see Pearl Jam with a girl.

The price for two tickets by the way, is 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival however isn't happening until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from my high school for attendance (only in the country I live in), as well as my internship (I go to school three days a week and am at my internship two days a week). I've also been thinking of using my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival.

The reason why I want to pay for my cousin is because she is such a special person. She's incredibly ambitious, and sweet. It's like she's my best friend even though I'm not her best friend. But I want to pay for her because I feel like she's probably going to think of me more highly then. And we've never bought each other gifts, we just get money from our aunts when it's our birthdays. I haven't asked her yet, although she went to this festival last summer, so I know there’s at least a bit of a chance she'll go. Although I have several friends, none of them would want to go to the festival, because of one of these reasons:

1.They're not interested (maybe don't care for music that much or they don't like big crowds).

2.They're too poor for the ticket.

3.They would rather spend money on something else.

I feel like I would be in a really surrealistic dream to go to this festival with my cousin. I imagine that when/if Pearl Jam play ""Black"", I tell her ""holy shit this is the greatest day of my life"".

It's like, if she says no, should I just drink myself to misery? I just don't know how I would cope. I still want to ask her though. I feel like there's at least a 30% chance she'll say yes, and even though that might be a slim chance I still have some confidence that she'll say yes.

I've been thinking about this a lot. But my cousin is really sweet for the most part. Though I don't understand why she took away my beer when I tried to impress her, or why she got pissed because I had no jacket on when I said I wanted to come with her outside late at night. I also remember when several months ago, me, my cousin and my little cousin were walking in the woods, and when my little cousin said my cousin's shirt was yellow, I told her ""huh? it's yellow"". Then my older cousin repeatedly asked me if I was color blind, and said it in a way as if I was a baby. But maybe she was right, I'm not sure.

TL;DR Is it a good idéa if I pay for two tickets to a music festival, and then ask my cousin if she wants to come? My parents say I can't pay for anyone but me, but I disagree as I think it's OK to be nice."
egs64j,419,2019-12-28,0 to Systems Admin in less than 3 years. You can do it too.,gingerbeardm0n,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/egs64j/0_to_systems_admin_in_less_than_3_years_you_can/,"Here is the nitty gritty of my journey so far.

I went to a Community College and got a 2 year degree in IT.  While in CC, I worked a slew of shitty jobs from pizza delivery to a collections agency making no more than $12 an hour.  In order to graduate, we had to have an internship for the last semester as part of the Capstone class.  I applied to anything and everything in the area, and landed an internship doing desktop support (still making 12 an hour, but getting experience nonetheless).  During my internship, I obtained A+ and Net+.

Ok, now I have 5 months of experience, an associates, and 2 certs.  I start applying to full time jobs.  In about a month or so of applying, I had 2 interviews, but did not get an offer from either.  I started applying to jobs in different states (just to see if I could get anything).  Sure enough, I landed an interview, got an offer, accepted, and moved (I had family in this state).  This was for a desktop support gig making \~40k a year.

I worked at this job for a little over a year.  I gained some pretty good experience during my time here.  I was the sole desktop tech for a remote office, so I was pretty much 'the guy' for everything.  I worked a lot with the admins back at HQ since they were the experts in systems and networking.  Seeing what they did made me realize I wanted to make the move from support to admin, but I could not do it at this job since there was no room for advancement unless I were to move again and work at HQ.  I couldn't find any junior sysadmin roles in my location and since I still had less than 2 years of experience, a sysadmin job seemed out of the question.  How could I bridge this gap of wanting to make that jump to T3 but having a lack of experience to do so?  Working for an MSP of course!

I left my comfy desktop job for a service desk (help desk on steroids) job at an MSP.  I took this job knowing exactly what it was.  Ticket after ticket of talking on the phone with customers and fixing their issues.  If you do a search on here for MSP, you will see the horror stories that come with them.  While this was stressful, the exposure I got to all of these SMB networks was unreal.  In any given day, you could work on tickets from password resets to an entire site being down.  My printer isn't working to setting up firewall access rules.  This was the exposure I needed to make that jump.  The plan was to stick it out for a year, and I did.  During that year, I also got my Sec+, CCNA, and bachelors degree from WGU.

After a year at the MSP, I updated my linkedin and switched my status to looking.  I was surprised to see the influx of messages from recruiters.  I had a few interviews and got an offer for a company doing internal sysadmin work making 65k a year and couldn't be happier.  It's crazy to me that it happened to fast, and I would like to thank everyone in this sub for giving me the courage to put myself out there and APPLY.

Key takeaway from this:

If I can do it, you can do it, but you have to WANT IT.  I moved, took a job I knew I wouldn't like, and spent nights and weekends studying, tinkering, and labbing at home while friends were out.  I knew where I wanted to be and what I wanted to do and I was going to get there, no matter what.  The only person holding you back is you.

egt8u1,2,2019-12-28,What do top machine learning programs look for in candidates?,MaximumOverkeks,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/egt8u1/what_do_top_machine_learning_programs_look_for_in/,"Hello everyone,

I am currently a senior in high school, and I want to pursue a PhD in machine learning. I plan on majoring in math and statistics at a T50 state school.

However, I understand that the top programs (MIT, CMU, UC-Berkeley) are extremely hard to get into, even more so for machine learning. My question is: what should I try to do over the next three years to boost my chances as a candidate? I’ve already taken linear algebra with the local community college and am wrapping up multivariable calculus, so hopefully I can begin learning more machine learning in the coming weeks.

Here are some other questions I have:

I heard published research was huge for the top programs, but what should I aim for there? Would a paper or two on arXiv be enough, or would I have to try to get a paper published to a huge conference like NIPS or ICML? Would co-authoring be enough or would I have to have some first-authorships under my belt?

I’ve read that references are huge as well. However, the state school I’m going to isn’t known as a machine learning school. While intro courses are offered in machine learning, I doubt the profs are going to be world-renown experts. Obviously I’ll utilize any resource the college has to offer, but should I aim to build connections with more renown researchers in the field? How would I go about doing this? Beyond just getting a reference, I really want to work with a expert so that I can have someone to contact if I have a question about the field.

For my summers, would they be better spent at internships, researching, or a mix of the two?

Lastly, I feel like going to a T50 school is hurting my chances the most here. Is my only hope transferring out into a more prestigious school at the cost of an extra year in college, or is it possible to compensate for the lack of prestige through research experience? If I managed to get say, a first-authorship published at a top conference like ICML, would that compensate for the lack of prestige in my undergraduate school? Would that even be possible given that I’ve only had a basic introduction to machine learning through a course with my magnet school?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, as machine learning is a genuine passion I have, not something I’m just pursuing for the money."

I am currently under the track for Computer Engineering. I love tech and fixing problems and it has always been something I enjoy though I hate the workload (like a lot) I look at it like ""omfg I'm almost done and it will all be worth it"". I am hesitant about engineering school taking me with my 3.7GPA. I wonder if I should stay longer and make it higher to a 3.8 or just keep it. My friends have all graduated on time or earlier and I feel ashamed since I'll be graduating later due to various reasons (death, hospitalizations, internships, and etc..) I have an internship opportunity with NASA that I was recommended for but that will hold me a semester behind....I was suppose to graduate in 2018 but am on track to graduate in 2021 or 2022. I have been thinking about grad school and my future lately. People think I would be a fantastic doctor. I would love medicine especially the salary (which would be a huge motivator for me). My classes right now since it's still general classes I am able to either stay with my engineering or transfer into ""pre-med"". If I went into medicine I would want to be a Physician or maybe a surgeon but I am not sure yet. The thing is I have such bbad experience with doctors (Malpractice) and they have always almost or have killed someone I know. I would want to change the world of medicine. The only problem...is that I don't have an autoimmune problem but basically after the stuff I went through when I was younger due to Malpractice and found out I'm extremely allergic and also I was too young to take ""all the doctor said was I'm so sorry"". My immune system is pretty good but let's say I get sick, it is then worse on my body than the person who is truly sick or I contracted it from. I once was sick taking the bus (though I was used to it at a time where it was clean and we had specific routes before I started driving) a while ago and was in bed for 2 weeks. When I go to the hospital I have to wear 1-2 mask on to make sure I don't catch anything. I also am a bit not he introverted side and aren't a huge fan of humans (well stupid people rather lol) I love hearing people out and them being vulnerable and my compassion is strong and I like helping them out (for legitimate reasons). I don't mind dealing with sick people so far as it's not the kind I can contract from easily. I wonder if there is something in medicine where I could do that I could make the salary of the doctor but reduce that risk? That or I just might have to wear mask. I am interested in shadowing or hearing from actual doctors or related on their take, why they picked their profession, pros, cons, do they regret the decision, or any advice. As for engineering, I am very good at it and have gotten compliments and it allows me to express my passion or interest. Though I would prefer either the hardware route or network architecture since I am not a fan of coding all day and find it quite boring lol. The only problem I have is job stability. With the advancement of AI technology I wonder how the job market will eb for engineers or if it will be taken over by robots lol. I also would like a high salary and engineering is strictly middle class if that. I have an experience of doing IT &amp; Law so far as work experience. I have been told to also apply to law school (which I heard is a bit depressing) which I am interested in but I find that lawyers tend to be total a\*\*holes and are always angry about every little thing and are judgmental. If I did law I'd do IP law so I could head down the route of being a patent attorney.

Hello,
I'm an applied mathematics and computer science french Master student. 
Next year, I am considering a gap year where I'd like to work as a research intern in order get more experience to have more chances of getting a great PhD after my Master.
This is mainly because I consider my GPA won't be enough (I f**cked up last year, I had depression and only secured a 3.2 GPA) and also because I would like to just take a year outside of my home country.
My ultimate goal (one I must achieve) is publishing at least a paper to a top academic venue (AISTATS,KDD,AAAI,ICML,NEURIPS etc.)
This would greatly boost my confidence level and help me get a good PhD afterwards.
I understand that I have to search for researchers that are good supervisors and underrated enough so that they would consider taking me.

Do you have any clues of where to search ?

I never got into more interesting stuff at these companies. There was no DevOps, no microservices, there wasn't even any proper testing. I was also always a junior. I did get assigned projects that were completely done on my own, but these kinds of CMS projects don't really impress other companies. I learned the hard way that web agency work is only appealing to other web agencies and no one else.

**Later years**

That leads me to my second half of my career, the freelance years. I had just entered my 30's. I've now been at it for 5 years freelancing after a startup was floundering and left me to go on my own after they cut my contract short, but at least it was different from eCommerce/CMS stuff. 

However, work is much more sparse in these years, and pay is not much better not to mention it's still risky contract work. I'd often go to, many months of having no work, to a few months of contract work for peanuts, and back again to many months of no work. It's unsustainable. My living arrangement is with my single mom who is now over 70 and needs more of my help than ever to get errands done.

----

I would think that after 5 more years of this BS that I would be close to seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, but nope, not visible yet. So I will have to make a big change. But between fulfilling my mom's needs and getting myself out of debt, I feel trapped. 

I don't know what it takes for career changers to get the tools they need to start changing things but it feels like everything I must do costs money and I can't afford any of it. Should I go to a bootcamp? That costs money. My bachelor's wasn't in CS so should I get a Master's degree? Costs even more money. 

I have no job, about $1500 in the bank, I get no unemployment benefits and nobody is going to vouch for me because I haven't cared much about talking to colleagues after leaving jobs because they're not my friends. For the next job I take, I have to be careful not to end up at the same type of dead-end job. 

I would love to take an internship to do more interesting work and get an ""in"" with a better company, but there's an implicit rule about internships being for students only. I guess apprenticeships are more appropriate, but I don't understand why so few companies do apprenticeships.

Would you know how to help someone in this situation? Have you *met* any developer who lives like this and changed their life around?

I have seen teachers and retail workers get into software development careers and those really motivate me. But I am paralyzed by too many choices. Which ones should I take first?"

Long story short, I graduated with a degree in 2016 with my B.S. in hospitality management, thinking I wanted work in it when I first graduated. I went from not wanting to do that and work in advertising, to fashion, to advertising again, to finally realizing I want to get into the tech industry (which was inspired by 1 drunken night watching Silicon Valley believe it or not lmao).

Let me also preface with the fact that 1) I definitely want to learn how to code at some point and 2) I understand this job (or any job within the tech industry) isn't going to randomly double my salary and 3) I have always been interested in computers, coding, networks, and developing, but I always figured that you had to have a degree in it/be incredibly talented with computers. I'm wanting to gain a skill in something that I've been relatively interested in for a while now. I'd mainly like to learn how to code for front-end web development stuff.

A lot of my experience pertains to customer service, client success, and relationship building, though I'm kind of wondering which route to go in the IT world with my experience. I've mainly worked in retail, customer service, social media, and operations roles (hotel, stores, restaurants, internships, etc) for 8-9ish years, so I have a TON of experience in that. From when I'm writing this post, I have another round of interviews in a couple of days in a hospitality tech company (the role I'm interviewing for is Customer Support Specialist), though as I was talking to the recruiter about what exactly would I want to do. I told her I'm interested in account management in the long run (which I am), however I'm also looking at all the other pathways and trying to see which would be the most accurate with my background. I also looked at the pathway thread and maybe going towards the business analyst/project management route sounds good?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to get a head start on all of this in case I need to get some certifications (Which, if anyone would happen to know any that might be good for beginners/to start working on, that'd be amazing).

p.s. I guess if it helps any, I'm out of Dallas, TX."

I've been actively learning algorithms, problem solving, also looking for Github repository to contribute to, which I had no luck in. I'm not sure contributions towards what kind of projects interests the tech firm employers.

Any advice on what I can possibly work on will be great and much appreciated. Hopefully I can build enough personal project in half a year to a year's time so I can get a nice internship before I graduate.

Last interview I failed was a phone screen at Niantic, which stung because their interviews are pretty similar to Google (for obvious reasons). Meanwhile I know several of my old coworkers (at another company) and mates getting into Google, Two Sigma, etc with minimal additional studying compared to me, and most of them didn't do ~4 internships in college with the studying associated with that either (this was their first real rodeo).

After putting in this much effort and hours at the expense of my other hobbies and personal life and even work performance (I leetcode in empty conference rooms when I have nothing else to do or am procrastinating on something), when should I just quit trying to get better?

Meanwhile, I am a privileged, able bodied 18 year old girl living in a first-world country who wants to kill herself, when probably the worst things that have happened to me in my ENTIRE life were having to rehome my dog and being called fat and ugly by a guy I had a crush on. What an ungrateful brat, right?

I think I am a waste of life/resources and I don't deserve to live. Why? 
I have no life. All I do nowadays is play Overwatch, and I'm not even good at it despite the amount of time I've sunk into the game. I have no friends because I don't know how to make friends. Believe me, I do try, but the people I try to befriend eventually stop talking to me because I probably creep them out or something.

I am also ugly. I didnt take good care of myself when I was younger and now I have yellow teeth and premature wrinkles on my face. Many girls complain about the unwanted attention they get from guys but I'm here craving it. Surprisingly I have a boyfriend despite my homely appearance, who is the aforementioned guy I had a crush on. Last year I started doing bodyweight home workouts (can't afford a gym membership) HIIT and some slight weight training in an effort to improve my physique. It made me slender but didnt improve my flat butt situation. I continued to workout and intensify my training/eating habits in order to see results but a year later, I still have no ass or muscle whatsoever. So I stopped a month ago and gained about 3 kilos back. Because what's the point of busting my ass every day doing exercise (which I HATE with a burning passion) if I'm not gonna see any results? 

I am incredibly stupid and lazy. When you look into my eyes, they're just vacant. There's no one home. Somehow I have a scholarship despite my lack of intelligence. My grades in primary school up to now have been mediocre due to lack of effort. I see no future for myself because of this. I can't network with others to get jobs because I'm shy and have no social skills. I'll probably end up homeless or working a dead-end job in the future. I'm incredibly lucky to have gotten an internship in a shipping company through my dad's connections, because if it weren't for him, even more of my time would be devoted to doing fuck-all. I can't even bring myself to study or do homework. I've been learning to drive for at least a year now, only to fail my driving test last month due to a bunch of beginner driver mistakes. Who the fuck needs more than 5 months to pass their test or hell, even learn how to parallel park? I can't parallel park for shit even though I've been learning for so long. I wish I could give up driving but my parents won't allow me to. Driving lessons make me incredibly anxious no matter who the teacher is, because they always end up yelling at me for constantly fucking up. I shouldn't even be behind the wheel. I am a danger to others.

I wish I could start over. Do a sport as a kid, not spend as much time on the computer in my formative years, have better hygiene growing up, get a solid study/work ethic, etc. My parents played a part in fucking me up. My dad would beat me and emotionally abuse me for getting math problems wrong as a kid. He has stopped hitting me in the past years but he still yells hurtful things at me, like when I failed my driving test. My parents also never pushed me to do chores growing up so that I'd have more time to devote to my studies, but of course I just spent that time on Youtube and MMOs. My parents have recently been saying that they're losing hope in me.
I'm not even going to get started on my personality. I am a bad person, to be frank.

I'm useless.
I am blessed with so many opportunities, yet I remain absolutely useless. I can't even articulate my thoughts in this post accurately.

I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up, because I'm too afraid of the pain of messing up a suicide attempt. But I know my little sisters and boyfriend would miss me. I don't care so much about how my parents would feel, maybe they'd even feel regret at my passing and change their ways.

The only relief I get is when I sleep in bed at night."

I graduated with a CS Degree in 2017. I had an internship at a company doing ""DevOps"" which turned into a full time position right of college so I took it. I thought I would enjoy doing this level of systems engineering / development but after a company change in the same career I realize now it's just a glorified Sys Admin position with some coding occasionally. I realized that I miss coding and building things so I need to change careers. However I'm having some difficulty finding the right next path for me.   


I want to explore all of the elements of my degree that I enjoyed while in school so I thought why not do some projects in those fields. Currently I am going to explore:

* Assembly Language 
* Embedded Engineering
* Data Science

I finished my associate degree on time and looked forward to computer science at University. I did not want to “waste time” or money on prerequisite classes and I soon learned it was going to be worse because I could not pass the classes I attempted. The CS (programming) class was based on Dr. Racket, and that was hard to start with. I ended up dropping out, and after some time went to a community college to see if I could at least do some programming or if this was not the path for me. I succeeded in Java, C++, and SQL with almost a 4.0GPA. 
After seeing I could program but didn’t want to go back to the university I initially went to, I attempted a different B.S. program online. I learned Javascript, PHP, some SQL, and Java. I took accelerated courses and still managed to graduate.

The issue I am faced with is I have a misdemeanor on my record (solicitation, in case context matters or if anyone is curious). This I feel has cut off a lot of opportunities I tried to seek out, but I know it will be expunged in 2021. Still, the issue is I live in a small town where there are no opportunities. I am willing to move anywhere, even if it may just be an internship so I can get experience in the IT field. The one thing I’m not okay with is recruiters messaging me for “opportunities” to pay for their boot camp, which has no guarantees or certifications whatsoever. Are these a scam or has anyone had any good experiences with these? Also, is there any advice anyone can give to someone in my position?"

This is my first full time job. The work hasn’t really been what I was expecting (not that interesting), and I’m not learning very much at the moment (both the modelling and coding work is very basic). But, I’m thinking this might change as I get put on a more interesting project within credit risk once I settle in more.

I recently saw the 2020 Summer Intern post, which has made me think I may be severely underpaid. But that might just be attributable to the fact I’m in London rather than the US. I joined this job not really knowing much about finance or the various sub-fields, but now thinking I should have gone into a buy-side position (like trading or a fund). 

Background: Masters Graduate in Computer Science. Several internships as a Software Engineer &amp; Data Scientist.

Colleagues: The department is comprised totally of PhDs, Post Docs, and other academics. Generally, everyone is really smart and I get the impression that they’re much higher paid than me. I don’t feel like I can ask anyone there about their/my comp as the next youngest person in the department is 30 (I’m 22).

Hours: I work roughly 11hrs/day, no weekends.

Compensation: £45k ($60k) base + bonus (technically capped at 100% of base, but I’ve been told avg. is ~40%).

Benefits: free dinner, private health care, gym, various expense accounts (totalling ~£3k/yr ($4k/yr)), etc. 

I’m not sure if I’m currently underpaid, or what compensation progression is in this position.

When we were dating, I was his maid and mom, and could never be myself around him. He actually mocked me to the point of tears in public once over my interests. After he cheated, he continued to lie, juggle me and the OW, and gaslit me, laughed at me, blamed me, and mocked me. He straight up told me that cheating was natural and happened in nature, he thought I’d get over it. He made fun of me for crying over him cheating and juggling me and another woman. 3 months after we ended things he proposed to the OW and they got married on the exact day he cheated on me with her, a year later. It was a “special” day to them. 

I’ve more or less gotten over it over time, but of course there are times that it comes back up and feels like a kick in the gut. 

Like I said, my ex used to make me feel bad about my interests. One of them is hockey. I really love hockey. So when we were dating, I got us both tickets when my favorite team was in town playing the local NHL team. It was a big deal for me as I’d never gotten to see them play live before. My ex acted barely interested, belittled my feelings over it, and got mad and embarrassed at me for cheering for my team. 

We still have mutual friends, and on Instagram, I saw that they all went to the game for the same NHL team in the state. There was my ex, on his feet, yelling at the top of his lungs a cheer for the team, and yelling it at fans of the other team, to like be in their face. I couldn’t help but just feel.....kind of upset and pissed off. When I bought him tickets, I did it so we could bond over hopefully a new shared interest, to have a good time, to treat him to his first NHL game. When we went he could barely muster any enthusiasm or care. I could only cheer and celebrate in a way he approved otherwise I was “obnoxious and embarrassing” instead of just having a good time. Yet he could be an obnoxious jerk and get in other peoples faces and suddenly was so invested. 

I went through so much hell being in that toxic abusive relationship and it was a reminder what a complete crap person he is"
ehd4n9,6,2019-12-29,Is it reasonable to graduate one year later in my situation?,NordikIdealist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ehd4n9/is_it_reasonable_to_graduate_one_year_later_in_my/,"Hey,

I was talking with my dad earlier today. He bring up this topic and told me that he supports me about it, so it's better ask you all.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly about me:

I'm 23 years old computer engineering student in Turkey, currently at my final year. Next semester there is only one course that I cannot take due to it exceeds credit limit and I need to do a second internship (for 20 work days, this also count as course). If I go to summer school, I can graduate on time. Otherwise I'll be graduating in June 2021 since the course that I cannot take is in spring semester.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is my school is really bad. A no name university, really political and many teachers are incompetent. I will write more details about courses in spoilers in case you want to read. Long story short, I need to work my ass of to learn every concept all by my own. It's really hard for us -students in engineering faculty- to have free time because lecturers gives so many off-topic assignments.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to find a job I need to be well equipped. I'm aware of that. I don't have any side-projects which I did from start to finish. There is only project I contributed which is my cousin's cross platform mobile app. This and one internship is all I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Second but slightly minor issue is that when I graduate there is a compulsory military service which I don't want to go. If I manage to find a job abroad I can bypass this service by paying few thousand euros (it's a legal option if you stay in a foreign country for work for at least 3 years).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my dad advice me to NOT to go to summer school. Since the only course I cannot take is in spring semester, I can go back home and build some side projects, strengthen my resume and even learn a new language (I want to work in EU) and come back to school only for exams in spring semester (this is also an option if there is only one course that you have). I may not find a job in this condition but may find a chance to land a job with 1 year preparation.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a good idea?

Will ""finishing school in 5 years instead of 4"" be a problem when I am on job hunt?

I'm already -just guessing here- in disadvantage for being a non-EU/EEA citizen and requiring visa sponsorship. I don't want to put myself in a worse situation. I would really appreciate your thoughts and suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My school's ridicules:

&gt;!Firstly, our curriculum is based on 20 years ago's Computer Science curriculum. !&lt;

&gt;!\-In Programming Languages I they only showed really really basic C for whole semester. Declaring variable and arrays, and functions only.!&lt;

&gt;!\-Intro to Computer Engineering was basically how to open and shut down computers, what is floppy disk, what are file extensions, MS Excel shortcuts...!&lt;

&gt;!\-Programming Languages II was kinda better but still most complex topic was declaring pointers nothing more. Rest of the semester they taught some string library functions!&lt;

&gt;!\-From here it's sophomore year. One of the most cringe course was Internet Based Programming. Lecturer is a professor in geomatic engineering (his B.Sc and M.Sc is also in geomatic engineering) and  Deputy Chair of Department. He showed us some HTML4 and CSS. I'm not kidding, he told in class that ""HTML is out for few years and CSS is a new technology. We'll build a website with HTML and CSS with some ASP.NET. We're not showing you JavaScript because most of browsers don't even support it."" and he said this back in 2017.!&lt;

&gt;!\-Object-Oriented Programming. First week we coded our first class. Next week second class which is basically the same class with different name. This continued for 10 weeks. All classes are plain class, no inheritance or any object-oriented concept shown. Lecturer spend 2 hours just to teach ""this"" operator. In final exam he wanted us to write a class when you make an object constructor calls "" 'class name' makes 'varName' sound"". !&lt;

&gt;!\-Algorithms and Data Structures were surprisingly good. Lecturers knew what they're teaching. Algorithm course was more of mathematical based rather than coding. In data structures I had fun a lot. Red-black trees, Tries, AVL Trees... all were shown and lecturer (Assistant Professor) was super nice to me and two other friends for being active in class and helped us a lot, rest of the class just memorized codes in labs and many failed.!&lt;

&gt;!\-On third year we have more theoretical courses. Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Automata Theory, Data Communication Systems... All can be passed if you memorize last year's final/midterm exam which is available lecturers web sites.!&lt;

&gt;!\-Last year I thought we finally have some interesting  courses like AI, Data Mining and Image Processing but lecturers just read the presentation, no assignments towards subjects, no coding... They also happens to be ""memorize and pass"" kind of courses!&lt;"

I am a sophomore right now that wants to try and land a job as an intern somewhere in my area next summer. The thing is, I've not taken any CS courses yet at my University, just basics mostly. I've taken CS classes in high school, and do a lot of self study online and elsewhere. My question is; what do you all think the chances are of landing an intern position with not much technical experience? I want to begin doing little projects and uploading them to GitHub so that people see that I am at least competent in coding on some level. Please be as honest as possible. I am open to harsh realizations."

Stats:

SAT: 750M 650RW

GPA: 3.6

Extracurriculars: I think i have good extracurriculars, an internship at a software development company, debate club to name a few. I think they are decent at least. 

LOR: I asked to my science and english teacher and they both know me really well and i am sure they wrote great letters. 

TOEFL: 103

Extra Stuff: I am international student and i have been in US for a year I have the highest SAT in my highschool and I have 2 honors in both science and history. Oh and also I am enrolled to AP CS so it might help. Another thing that might help me is that i am probably not going to receive any financial aid because my parents do not really fit into the income gap required to get any financial aid (I hope this doesnt piss anyone off, it really isn’t my intention to sound like a rich brat). 

This is my situation in a nutshell I hope some people have some ideas and can help me in this situation. Thank you to all in advance and sorry for any grammatical errors.

ehe5z0,12,2019-12-29,What to expect after graduating from college,SarkHD,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ehe5z0/what_to_expect_after_graduating_from_college/,"I’m graduating next December with a bachelor’s degree in HR Management and I would like to find a HR Information Systems Manager or Benefits Manager position and I’m wondering what my realistic expectations should be when looking for an entry level job.

I’m a decent student with good grades and I’ve had many different jobs before but none of which is too closely related to the field I’d like to work in.

I’ve done some research in terms of the compensation I can expect in these positions, hence why I’m looking into these jobs but I feel like my expectations are too high overall and I will be disappointed once I start looking at job opportunities.

So what is the best way to increase my chances of finding the right job (internships maybe) and how long do you think it will take my to actually find a job? What should I expect in general after graduating from a decent college with decent grades?

Burst my bubble and bring me back down to earth please."

2. Is hour flexibility and remote opportunities common later on in career progression or are those perks really only commonplace in software development?"
ehfgk8,2,2019-12-29,I fucking hate my work,not-enough-failures,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ehfgk8/i_fucking_hate_my_work/,"So I work at a government body of around 30k people. I'm in IT and was hired to do level 1 tech support, which for those who don't know is basically answering calls and triaging tickets, or solving easier issues.

Now the internship offer I was hired as part of was about being both a level 1 and level 2 tech, but I didn't make that cut because of my horrible social skills during the interview (I presume, because without bragging I know shit about what I do), but still got hired because I expressed interest in doing only level 1 stuff.

Now because they saw that I was quite good, they told me I would get the level 2 training during the summer (summer 2019). I was excited for that, as level 1 stuff was getting repetitive. I waited, waited and waited. Nothing. I asked again and they said ""in the next 2 weeks"". So I waited.

Eventually, I said fuck it and decided that I was gonna fix some problems on my own, given how vague and uninterested my managers were (we were literally overflowing with open incidents because those idiots let everyone go on vacation simultaneously). So I asked them if I could help my coworkers solve some tickets, and they said sure why not. So I followed my colleague for a bit and started doing them myself. After weeks of reminding them to give me permissions on the different tools they said they'd give me access to, given that I was now doing level 2 support as well, I was finally able to do them on my own.

So that's what I did. Whenever I had questions, I'd get vague answers. I'd get reminded to ""try and mainly do level 1 stuff"" as it was obvious that they preferred me doing that for some reason. Which I respected, before eventually coming to an agreement of doing 50/50 of both.

Now came the time to go back to college. I was still given hours since my school schedule allowed me to work, but I was clearly told I could only take calls and do level 1 work during that time, because there wasn't ""enough time"".

Lo and behold, my coworker, who could work the exact same hours, was allowed to do the level 2 stuff as well, seemingly because time doesn't exist in his context.

At this point it just frustrated me. Why bother telling me I would get to go into the more advanced stuff if the whole process was gonna feel like they were just doing it to keep me there ? I felt as if it was merely ""tolerated"" because they knew the job market in that field is very, very competitive around here. It just infuriates me how I was literally lied to about petty shit, and even worse, I found out from another coworker that there was in fact no level 2 training AT ALL, so that was bullshit as well.

And it wasn't just that as well; the whole management is a disaster. A question I would have about the right procedures would have 5 different answers depending on who I asked and their position in the hierarchy. ""Temporary"" processes that clearly didn't work were de facto permanent, and problems that have been around forever and have clear solutions are never tackled.

Now that I started doing full time again for a bit since I'm between semester, I'm told I can do the good old 50/50 of level 1 and 2, then a week later told I have to mainly do call center and ONLY level 2 IF there is a severe overflow.

My different managers / bosses clearly seem to disagree on what to do with me, and it's just so infuriating.

I just want to quit, but I need money.

- Didn’t have interview for any of the other schools 

Recommendations:
- Got one from Comp Sci Teacher, US History Teacher, and NASA supervisor. 
- I’m not going to rate them because I really don’t know but I think they showed who I was

Essays: 
- My common app I had reviewed by many people and felt good about it. It was about me moving my whole life as well as a family medical incident that helped shape who I am today. It’s me and I think that’s what’s important. 
- MIT essays were only looked at by my mom. I wasn’t too certain about them because I kept switching topics up until the deadline and didn’t feel that confident. Here’s what I wrote about: 
- Fun: Talked about playing Minecraft 
- Program: Talked about MISTI and my obsession of Tokyo 
- Community: Talked about tutoring through Mu Alpha Theta 
- Surrounding World: Talked about moving my whole life
- Significant Challenge: Talked about robot breaking down during competition matches

So I guess I’m part of the proof that you don’t need an interview or perfect stats to get into MIT. Best advice I can give is to just be yourself and do what you love, sorry that’s really cliche lol.

Edit: I’ve updated the post with the rest of my decisions and apologize for saying that I don’t have perfect stats. I just assumed that my 670 chem offset everything else especially for a school like MIT. 

To those looking here in the future, I will be attending MIT next year!"

I am at one of the top 20 business schools in the country with high marks and lots of leadership experience, but no offers. None. And I interviewed with probably 8 companies locally( I applied both locally and all over the country). All of my interviews went well, saying they were interested, even went through multiple stages of interviews, and they said they’d follow up. Some did, I’m technically still waiting on two. The whole process of finding an internship this past semester was mentally draining, it felt like it’s own class added into my semester. I don’t want to sound weak but I’m drained from all of the work (and money) I put into it all, and am dreading to have to continue the process this next semester. Is an internship in the summer before your senior year crucial? I don’t understand what’s wrong with me, but no one wants me so I’m very concerned about my future and what it holds for me. My school makes it seem so crucial to have an internship this next summer so I’m beyond scared that I’ll have a degree from a prestigious school all for nothing. Any suggestions are welcome, some advice is strongly recommended because I feel like I’m in a rut right now and it’s painful. What sucks the most is seeing my friends getting offers and they’re around the same level of experience as me. Please give me any kind of words of advice, I need some motivation/positive thoughts right now!! Sorry in advance for sounding like a whiny child, just feeling a bit hopeless."

I’m entering (technically) my senior year in a couple of weeks and I’m supposed to start preparing to apply to grad school and I have no idea what I’m doing. 

I’m a criminal justice major and I’d like to go into research (maybe get a PhD, probably get a PhD) and I feel unprepared and terrified of the entire process. 

Although I’m apart of TRIO at my school, I feel like even though I’ll be getting help with applying to graduate school, the fact that I faced financial and personal difficulty with earning a bachelor’s degree (grew up in foster care, wasn’t prepared for college, familial abuse, etc.) means that I won’t have a chance of getting into grad school and focusing on getting a masters in Transnational Crime (or related area) or Victimology. 

I have actual experience of working in the field from a non-profit side, but my GPA is not as high as it could be (it will get better) and I don’t know how admissions committees look at an application being said. 

With that, are there any grad students/PhD, professors, or academics that could provide me with sound advice about grad school and if there are any summer prep programs or any resources that I could reach out to? 

I’m looking to do an internship within my city during the upcoming summer and do an internship in Spring 2021 once I graduate. I will be reaching out to a professor that is considering helping me with the process (also First Gen) and I will be emailing the coordinator of the grad school prep program at my university within the next few weeks. 

Any feedback would really help because like Jon Snow “I know some things,” but they’re only the basics and I’d like to get ahead before I fall behind. I’ve also posted in the Criminology subreddit but I’m hoping from feedback from those who have applied to grad school/are currently applying and may have experienced what I’m going through?"

Background about me:

I graduated with a Master of Engineering degree in Electronics Engineering from the UK (2008 - 2013).

The degree focused on: Microcontroller programming, Analogue and Digital Circuit Design, VHDL/FPGA, Digital Signal Processing, Advanced DSP, Control, and Discrete Control,...etc...

I returned to my home country, but unfortunately, there weren't lots of roles as Elec Eng or Embedded Eng, hence I worked as an Instrumentation and Control Engineer (2013 - 2019).

In 2019, I relocated to Australia, and my Visa allows me to work full time there, and I am in the process of changing my visa to a PR.

I am applying for jobs in Australia as an I&amp;C Engineer, and as an Electronics or Embedded Engineer, searching for Graduate, Junior, or Internship positions, I have even called Electronics companies about whether I can volunteer as an Electronics or Embedded Engineer without any luck.

So I decided to change strategy, invest in my self, but I don't know what is the best option to take, here are the following courses of action, I thought are available to me:

A) take a TAFE and become an Electronic Technician work in a company as a technician and hopefully, they would promote me to an engineer (lots of my colleagues in the UK took the same route, they were technicians at their companies before they sent them to uni to become engineers).

B) take a Graduate Certificate (6 months) or Graduate Diploma (1 year) from an Australia university

C) Take a Masters of Engineering in Computer Engineering from an Australian university (2 years max).

D) Take online courses such as Udemy, do projects and build an online profile of a list of projects I have done

E) Take accredited online courses from sources such as [edx.org](https://edx.org) or  [https://ocw.mit.edu/](https://ocw.mit.edu/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice regarding my inquiry is highly appreciated.

ehitjn,1,2019-12-30,Upcoming interview,PastaVeggies,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ehitjn/upcoming_interview/,"Good evening everyone I just have a few questions regarding my upcoming interview for my first full time IT position. I have 6 months of internship IT experience.  Not so much development but more IT support and infrastructure. I graduated with a bachelors in business information systems this month. I have my second set interviews with a company in the first week of January and I would really like to be prepared. It’s for a development position. Entry level Interphase engineering to be exact. I will be having 3 45 min video interviews with three different people back to back. One is a team lead interphase architect and one with a manager senior solutions leader and the last with a director network services. I am aware that the position uses SQL and Linux.
My question is with each interview being so long what will they mainly consist of? Will I be asked more about the type of work I can do? Would I be required to show any work that I have done in the past? It’s mainly school work since like I said I have never taken on a development position before. I will be brushing up on some SQL and Linux prior just in case but will that be necessary? I consider myself to be highly motivated and ambitious. Coding is not my strongest suit but I have a very good foundation to continue learning. 
Any tips or suggestions would be of great help and highly appreciated."
ehj5xk,18,2019-12-30,Confused CS freshman,SwissMoustache,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ehj5xk/confused_cs_freshman/,"Disclaimer: Some things that I have written below might not be true in the industry. They are what I THINK to be true in the industry. I have not yet worked so my knowledge about the topic is quite limited so please pardon any misconceptions that I have.

To provide context, I am a freshman at Purdue pursuing computer science. I have (I guess) some knowledge about Java and Python. To be more specific, I know the syntax and can solve problems and write basic algorithms using the 2 languages. 

After coming to university, a lot of my focus has shifted towards trying to obtain my first internship and eventually a job. 

What I realized was that companies don't just see what language you know, but rather what frameworks you know. For example knowing Javascript is not sufficient; knowing React or NodeJS would be much more helpful as those 2 are the things that are actually used for development of software rather than just knowledge of solving algorithms using the language. This is the first puzzle that I am trying to figure out. Which language should I learn? Are Python and Java sufficient? Should I learn frameworks within these 2 languages? If so, which ones? 

After researching about some, I found out about Java Spring and Django/Flask. These frameworks, as far as I know, are primarily for stuff related to web dev. This is what causes the second conundrum. Should I invest time learning web dev? What other subfields can I learn (e.g. app dev, cloud computing etc)? Which one has the best prospects? From what I see, if I were to invest time in, lets say, web dev, I would have the opportunity cost of other subfields that I could learn about. 

What I am most fearful about is investing time In something that might not give me a good return. I know I sound like a child right now and I should be able to take risks but i dont know it just seems to be a huge leap of faith. So it boils down to 2 things: what to specialize in (if to specialize at all instead of being a generalist) and what frameworks and stuff to learn. 

I have been having these 2 things weigh on my mind since a really long time. So much so that I have been reconsidering my choice of major. It Is not the effort that scares me but rather the width and breadth of the field. It is so hard to figure out where my interest lies since there are literally so many options. Also, I am afraid to spend 5 years specializing in a thing that might go redundant in 7 years. At the same time, I am also afraid to be limited growth-wise in the industry by a glass ceiling set by the type of specialization I chose.

Any help would be really appreciated and thanks for reading!"

ehk3q6,53,2019-12-30,"Computer Science MS from Berkeley/Stanford vs. New Grad offer in Arlington, VA",throwawaycs1414141,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ehk3q6/computer_science_ms_from_berkeleystanford_vs_new/,"Hey everyone!

I'm currently a senior studying CS at Berkeley trying to make a decision between staying in school for another year or two and getting an MS in CS, or leaving and going directly to industry next year. My offer expires in two weeks (for a certain big N's HQ2), while I'll have to make my final decision for which Masters program to go to come April. (I'm have an extremely good chance at Berkeley's 5th years; Stanford is a total crapshoot ofc. I also applied to CMU/Harvard, though with the big N offer I'm no longer seriously weighing those potential options.)

Here are the pros/cons that I've considered for each thus far:

**Masters Degree Pros:**

* I really like learning, and want to stay in academia for a bit longer to acquire some more in-depth knowledge in the field(s) I potentially want to specialize in (distributed computing, database systems). I do realize that the company I'll be working for is a great place to learn this knowledge, though, so idk how much of an advantage this truly is.
* For Stanford, I figure that if I'm going to get a Master's, it probably makes more sense to get it from a different institution? I also grew up right next to Stanford, so I could commute to school in 15 minutes from my parent's home. The name recognition from another school would be nice, too. Plus, Stanford was my dream school back in high school, so it would be pretty cool if I somehow got the chance to go there.
* For Berkeley, it'll be only a 1 year program, so not that big of a time commitment. Plus, my tuition would already be covered from my current job as a GSI (the school has a policy where if you work &gt;10 hrs/week as an instructor, your tuition will be refunded.), so I would be paid essentially 2k a month to be a Masters student.
I'm grew up in the Bay, went to college in the Bay, and all of my friends and family are in the Bay. I'm not too thrilled on the thought of leaving all of that behind to work at a company which I've heard doesn't have the best work/life balance.
* If I stay in the Bay Area for my Masters, I can apply for new grad/masters internship jobs come next year in the Bay Area. I'm aware that the company I would be working for doesn't have the highest new grad entry bar and their culture isn't the best, so I might be better off rolling the dice again next year?


**New Grad Offer Pros:**

* There's a huge opportunity cost that I'd be taking. For Berkeley, it'll be a lot less, since it's just 1 year (plus I'll essentially be paid to keep attending college), but for Stanford, I'm looking at a net loss of ~400k (factoring in both lost wages and the total tuition cost). That's a non-negligible amount; enough to make a down payment for a house in the Bay Area real estate market.
* I'll be able to explore a different part of the country and have new experiences. Especially considering the fact that I'm a CS major who grew up in the Bay Area who plans on moving back here eventually to raise a family, this may honestly be my only opportunity to leave the metro area that I'll seriously consider.
* If the US economy enters a serious recession within the next few years, I'd much rather be already in a job than with a year of two of industry experience and a decent amount of savings than be a graduating masters student with very little savings at all.
* Cost of living in Arlington would be lower. However, this is somewhat negated by the fact that if I were to eventually get a job offer in the Bay Area, I'd probably move back with my parents for a few years (so I'd be spending basically 0 on rent/living expenses, at the cost of most of the independence I gained in college).
* Having a BigN on my resume would be a pretty good boost to my resume and open a lot of doors, more than the two companies whom I interned with during my past two summers (a decent-sized SF unicorn and a Fortune 500 company).

With regards to why I can't just ask to convert my full time to an internship, the main reason is because I already accepted a return internship from the company I worked at last summer. I'll be going back to a team with people who I truly value (and who truly valued me– my manager wrote some of my rec letters), that does work I truly enjoy. In retrospect, it probably wasn't the best decision (since their new grad pay is rather low for the Bay Area, which is why I'm not looking to go back full time), but I have no intention of reneging at all.

Thank you so much for reading through this wall of text, and any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Please no ""Don't worry! You're still in high school!"" messages please. I get told that by family and friends too much and it is very discouraging.

Hi! I am currently a student in the San Bernardino and Riverside area. Over the last couple years I have heard worse and worse things about getting into computer science as (hopefully) a career. And now that I am taking my future seriously and trying to plan ahead so I am ready, I found a lot of people saying that the industry is very based off merit and skills. I love working with computers (specifically network stuff) but I have basically no experience besides just personal projects. I'm pretty set for college cause I get generally good grades (which I'm proud of) and my father is a Veteran so I get lots of college benefits. I'm mostly worried about what I am going to do after college. The area I live in is very expensive to live in, and I really have no plans to move anywhere far away. The tech industry nearby is also kind of limited (to my research). Should I be getting internships while I'm still in high school? Should I be building general CS skills? Am I overthinking everything? Should I be focusing towards something specific like networking or security or should I just be focusing on general CS? I really do love working with computers and building my own things, but I have not delved too deep into learning a program language. 

Any help is extremely appreciated honestly. Sorry if this is kind incomprehensible. Just very stressed and rambling at 2:30 A.M."

I never really wanted to be a teacher, but due to a combination of visa restrictions, lack of other opportunities, salary considerations, and so forth, I ended up in this field.  I've taught mainly sciences - math, physics and computer science.

My original degrees are in bioengineering (Master's) and mechanical engineering (Bachelor's), but never held formal jobs aside from internships or research in those areas.

I'm fluent in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish and know a little German and French.  I have some coding/web skills, particularly with Python, Matlab, C++/C but not enough to make a go of it at this point.

I live in Taiwan if it makes any difference and used to live in the US.  I'm a national of Taiwan and a full-fledged citizen of the United States."
ehkmus,1,2019-12-30,Third year in college trying to pivot from academic research to industry,confused_boi_1234,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ehkmus/third_year_in_college_trying_to_pivot_from/,"I'm in the middle of my third year of college at one of the most prestigious universities in the US studying physics, maths and statistics. For most of college, I was under the impression that I will go to graduate school in physics and as such, I spent most of my time and effort towards building up the best profile by working in research labs and with professors and taking hard graduate classes. Of late, I'm strongly reconsidering my passion for physics and would maybe not attend graduate school but explore my prospects in industry.

With that realization, the first step is to try to get job offers for the upcoming summer. (3rd year summer internship is considered really important and I feel like most people already have internships by now) Also I'm an international student so finding a job is slightly harder for me. So the next point is what jobs could I apply for? I have very little idea but with my background, I would be suitable for quantitative work which require problem solving, modelling and analysis. I also have significant programming experience from high school. As of now, I'm strongly considering fields like Data Science, Quantitative Financial and Engineering jobs. I'm just really confused and a bit scared that it's too late for me to find a good job. What other paths could I be suitable for? I'm very interested in statistics so I would appreciate suggestions about relevant jobs in that field. (Kinda fascinated by political statistics like polling.)

My main cause of concern is I have too many general skills but no specialized ones. So for example, if I want to apple for quantitative finance jobs, companies would prefer I know options pricing theory and trading algos. Of course, if I get a job I will learn it before the summer. But would companies even consider me due to my lack of specific skills?"

ehn20b,0,2019-12-30,I've decided that next month I'll buy two tickets to a music festival. Should I ask my cousin or a girl in my class if they want to go with me?,waittiltomorowfatboy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ehn20b/ive_decided_that_next_month_ill_buy_two_tickets/,"I'm 17 (guy), and my cousin is 20 by the way.

Two tickets cost 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival isn't until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from my high school for attendance (only in my country), and from my internship (school three days a week and internship two days a week). I can also use my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival.

I've been thinking about this a lot. I could either ask my cousin, or a girl in my class. I really want to go with a girl because then I can brag to my friends. I would feel so incredibly happy. In reality, I'd be happier if I went with my cousin. Because then I can always talk to her about the memory, but I'm sure I won't keep in contact with any of the girls in my class after I graduate in two and a half years.

My cousin's sweet for the most part. Though I don't understand why she took away my beer when I tried to impress her, or why she got pissed because I had no jacket on when I said I wanted to come with her outside late at night. I also remember when several months ago, me, my cousin and my little cousin were walking in the woods, and when my little cousin said my cousin's shirt was yellow, I told her ""huh? it's yellow"". Then my older cousin repeatedly asked me if I was color blind, and said it in a way as if I was a baby. But maybe she was right, I'm not sure. Overall though I love my cousin because she's so nice to me, like she's recommended me some good TV shows (Chernobyl and Stranger Things) and even gave me a ride in her car so we could buy candy together. I also love watching her play football (unfortunately she's not playing until April or May because of the wheater), even though I don't like football at all. I only like watching my cousin and her team play.

As for the girls in my class, most of them are sarcastic and mean, but it's like, maybe if I ask someone they'll say yes and think of me higher? I could ask them if my cousin says no. 

TL;DR I've decided that next month I'll buy two tickets to a music festival. Should I ask my cousin or a girl in my class if they want to go with me?"

I know the CS job market is incredibly over-saturated in that area. I assume the majority of that is with Software Engineers and Devs competing but I know there has to be a lot of IT competition. 

What next steps should I take to get a leg up? I’ve been told I have excellent people skills and every job I’ve had, my bosses always say I had excellent interview skills. 

Any advice for next steps?"

I want to chose 2/3 of these classes but need some advice on which ones. ML is super useful and I feel like I should have it under my belt for grad whereas graphics is something that I think I would just genuinely enjoy. I already have experience with MySQL that I learned at my job so I don't know if it's still worth it to take 421. Thanks!"

**Schools I'm Applying To As A Transfer:**

UPenn, Harvard, Northwestern, University of Southern California, UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke, Vandy, and Emory. I recognize that I probably have no chance at Penn Harvard or Duke, so Emory and USC are the two schools I'm most concerned about with me essentially molding my application for all things Emory.

I know my High School GPA wasn't the best, especially since it wasn't able to get me into my state school (UGA where I was waitlisted), but I'm hoping this semester's academic performance is able to make up for it. I understand that the school I'm currently at may not be top tier, but I really am hoping it is enough. Also if anybody has any details on the Trojan Transfer Plan I would love to see if I am eligible for that.

ehsvsf,1,2019-12-30,Am I a narcissist? Do I have another personality disorder?,Nearby-Property,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ehsvsf/am_i_a_narcissist_do_i_have_another_personality/,"I'm going to be super honest about my thoughts and behavior. I promise I'm not just trying to be edgy. I know I'm not normal but can't figure out what's wrong. Two different therapists have just taken my money to tell me to listen to Enya and crap.

I'm 20M.

My mother is an alcoholic and probably a narcissist herself. She has diagnoses of bodily dysmophic disorder and Borderline Personality. Before she started abusing alcohol and drugs, she used to be nice for a while and just flip out into rage. My parenting was very inconsistent, and I misbehaved a lot until I started spending a lot more time with my older brother (same dad, different mom) and my paternal grandfather. Our dad passed away and I didn't have male role models until they came along. After my mom started getting into drugs, she sold me to a pedophile for money. I don't remember the abuse, but I get sick to my stomach and turned off when it comes time to have sex with anyone. I can't get an erection for attractive people or get in the mood at all.

I'm extremely introverted, and I often justify it by telling myself I'm better than other people in some way. Usually it's that I'm smarter or they are boring. I don't have sympathy or empathy toward people until I start talking to them for a while and realize they're a good person. I care deeply about my brothers but don't have any social life because of the way I am. I get anxiety even speaking with people when I try to ""fake it until I make it,"" and I don't think I have anything in common with people.

In relationships, I just go for whoever will have me to avoid rejection, and then I pretend to like them even if I don't, hoping the feelings will come after I fake it. Like I said before, sex is hard for me. If I force myself to do it, I just feel empty and unfulfilled inside after we're done, like I know the person is not right for me to ever have true intimacy with. But I still get extremely depressed if they get bored with the relationship as well and want to break up with me. I know this is terrible, but I've threatened suicide and engaged in stalking behaviors when one of my exes went no contract and I still wanted to be friends. And I'm a hypocrite because I went NC on a guy who raped me and ignored his apologies. I've also bought gifts for people when it was early in the relationship and creepy to do so.

My solution to my relationship problems has just been to be single and celibate to avoid the shame and drama.

My employment situation is just like my relationship situation. I'm constantly rejected in interviews and take it very personally, so I just to back to working in gas stations instead of getting internships that might help me in the future. One of my brothers is a lawyer and he's always telling me that I'm doomed if I don't. My inadequacy in the eyes of other people is a major insecurity of mine, and I get triggered into suicidal depression if people press it too hard.

I feel like small children, ie my youngest brother and my nephew (ages 6 and 2) are the only people I can really be myself and be happy around. Both of the boys I mentioned tell me they love me and I'm their favorite, and I'd do anything for them after hearing that.

I'm sorry this was so long. Please be honest. Am I a narcissist?"

Likely major: probably either math or Econ, maybe Comsci 
Demographics: white/male/NY
Gpa:3.95 uw (school doesn’t do weighted or ranked, but if I had to guess probably somewhere in top 10-5%)

Sat: 1540 (790 math 750 English)
Subject test 800 math II, (probably gonna take either chemistry or physics later.
Ap equivalents (cause my school does the big dumb and gives us ap classes but doesn’t call them ap, and does not give us tests so we have to take it at the end of the year on our own dime.): junior year, APush, Ap chem, Ap Comsci A, AP:calc BC,
(Unfortunately can’t match up my physics class to anything in particular, my chem, history, and math classes are pretty much carbon copies of the aps, my physics is kinda like a mix of ap physics 1 and 2)
Senior year, ap physics C electricity and magnetism, and then ima take multi-variable calc, and ap stats. 
ECs (weak part yay):
Math team freshman-senior year, captain junior-senior year.
Chem mentors: (they pick 6 kids from the school to help kids who fail chemistry,)
Founded something called math cafe which is where I set up a room in school for people to go to if they need help with math.
No sports besides ultimate frisbee,

ehtqbe,0,2019-12-30,"If my cousin declines my offer to go to a music festival with me (I'll pay for her ticket), and I show sadness, is that manipulating?",eddievedder812,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ehtqbe/if_my_cousin_declines_my_offer_to_go_to_a_music/,"I'm 17 (guy), and my cousin is 20 by the way.

If she says no, I know I will cry, hurt myself and stop eating until my parents force me. Would it be manipulating if she found out I did this because she said no?

It would mean so much to me though if my cousin said yes. I would jump around and brag to everyone I know that I'm going to see Pearl Jam with a girl.

The price for two tickets by the way, is 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival isn't happening until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from my high school for attendance (only in my country), as well as my internship (school three days a week and internship two days a week). I've also been thinking of using my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival.

I want to pay for my cousin is because she is such a special person. Unfortunately my parents say I can't spend money on someone else but me, but I think it's OK to not be greedy. My cousin is incredibly ambitious, and sweet. It's like she's my best friend even though I'm not her best friend. But I want to pay for her because she's probably going to think of me more highly then. And we've never bought each other gifts, we just get money from our aunts when it's our birthdays. I haven't asked her yet, although she went to this festival last summer, so I know there’s at least a bit of a chance she'll go. Although I have friends, none of them would want to go to the festival, because of one of these reasons:

1.They're not interested (maybe don't care for music that much or they don't like big crowds).

2.They're too poor for the ticket.

3.They would rather spend money on something else.

I've been thinking about this a lot. But my cousin's sweet for the most part. Though I don't understand why she took away my beer when I tried to impress her, or why she got pissed because I had no jacket on when I said I wanted to come with her outside late at night. I also remember when several months ago, me, my cousin and my little cousin were walking in the woods, and when my little cousin said my cousin's shirt was yellow, I told her ""huh? it's yellow"". Then my older cousin repeatedly asked me if I was color blind, and said it in a way as if I was a baby. But maybe she was right, I'm not sure.

If she says no, should I drink myself to misery? I don't know how I would cope. I still want to ask her though. There's probably at least a 30% chance she'll say yes, and though that might be a slim chance I still have some confidence that she'll say yes.

TL;DR If my cousin declines my offer to go to a music festival with me (I'll pay for her ticket), and I show sadness, is that manipulating?"

*Now here's my* ***spike***\*:\*

I took part in the governor's STEM competition and designed an app that took advantage of wearables and cloud computing to detect opioid overdoses and alert an EMS if that happened. Placed 2nd in the competition and have moved on to making it a personal project. I prototyped with the Radiological Society of North America to look into implementing medical grade bands instead of commercial wearables like Apple Watches or fit bits. With the company I'm currently interning with, I used my connections there to present the idea to a group of investors to raise money for the project, obtain a medical patent (in process), and possibly put together a team of engineers at the company (with the funding) to help finalize the app. In my college essays, I emphasized how I look forward to leveraging the resources of the universities to finalize this app at the collegiate level possibly in conjunction with a few professors I contacted at Princeton and Harvard.

I'm also in my second STEM competition (have yet to compete) where my team and I redesigned inhalers with chemical adhesive paper that is meant to help detect how much medication has actually been absorbed by the patient. The paper changes color when it is exposed to medication and changes back to its original color when all of the medication has been inhaled.

&amp;#x200B;

I really think my opioid project is what is my ""spike."" It started with the STEM competition,  but its built up to much more than that. I've worked on it continuously for a couple of years and seem to have made progress with companies to help advance it."

I thought that having a degree would help me know to pinpoint something more specific but it has only made the topic broader. Right know I am going to try to get an internship on a company that works with IP addresses to see if I like it but after that my first notion of a plan starts to drift off.

My initial plan was to get a degree then a master, work for some company on R&amp;D and then open my own company doing something with the knowledge I get working in the field for a few years. I currently live on Mexico so in between there was the plan to go to either the US or Europe (until I am rich enough to come back and be even more richer in Mexico, but this last thing will depend on how my older self sees life I guess). Is this plan doable and good? What do I check out in order to see if a company/job/field is good enough? Should I really seek out a master? Should I just shoot everything until I hit a blank?

In high school, I failed AP Java. I walked out of the exam after 10 minutes. In the java class HS I just starred at a black computer screen and also failed the last few marking periods as well. College application deadline came and then it hit me, a psychology degree won't get my tummy full, so I picked the field that has Highest Salary to Effort Required to Get into the Job ratio. I picked Programming and stabbed my right knee right then and there.

I also realized that if I'm going to get anywhere in life without student debt, I also would need to study for the SAT, so I did and scored just enough to get into a CS Target School (1 of the top U's in Cali) with a 75% scholarship (had a high SAT &amp; high school GPA and did varsity sports). Since I got the financial package upfront and saw that low GPA requirement to keep it, I barely scraped by to get my undergrad degree with a mid 2's GPA and landed a job at a FANG via return offer at a summer internship in my junior year.

The job wasn't rocket science. I was told to do x and I did x. No questions asked, sat in the corner of my team and ate lunch by myself at my desk. 2 and a half years in, my senior manager told me the end users of the tools I was building were very satisfied with my work and wanted me to get a few more dev's to work under me. I got a over-achieve score, but not a flawless rating, mostly due to me not telling the end users I've completed something once I rolled out and deployed the changes. If you aren't catching this by now, I don't give a damn about programming.

6 months after receiving the above news, I walk into the office and see my team gone. Since I am usually late every day, I would expect them to be there. Not so that day. I was brought into a room shortly thereafter and was offered 2 options. A paid 1 year package and me leaving, or me going to another team (the other team was too in-it-to-win-it) and to start over. As you may have guessed already, I took the leave.

Today marks 3 months of me not working. I have 5 years worth of cash and live with my parents, and it is VERY difficult for me to land another SWE job at another tech or even fintech company. I've had numerous interviews 2 months ago that went sort of like this:

1. Phone call -   
&lt;tell me about yourself  
\&gt;Uh I am a software engineer and before this I was in CS at school X.  
&lt;Tell me what you want to work on  
\&gt;Uh improving features, fixing bugs, and making the business happy.  
&lt;We have 3 roles that fit the criteria, 1 is ...,2 is .... et.c Which would you like the most?  
\&gt;Uh, I think it's best if the manager picks where I'd do best in. I can do anything.  
&lt;One more question, what is your target compensation?  
&lt;Well, the market seems to be going for 150k in base, but if there is a position that can have a standard working week, then I'm willing to do 120k. I was paid 140k in my last job but I prefer long term stability over higher paying volatile jobs. (If they say it's a job where it's hands on and everyone sounds very excited/building something from scratch or works 7am-7pm, I drop the phone call)  
&lt;That works well with us. Please let me forward your resume to one the hiring managers.  

2. Online coding round:  
&lt;I am Manager X from Company Y and here is what we do.... Now please tell me about yourself.  
\&gt;I am a software engineer. (same thing as above. I read the title of every job and school back to them.)  
&lt;Ok how can you solve this techinical coding algo problem:  
\&gt;(talking to myself like a madman outloud). Solve it with O(n) t and O(1) s.  
&lt;Ok cool. That's diff than what I have tried, can you do it another way? What about trying this?  
&lt;Yes, but that is bad O(log(n)) space and does not improve time complexity.  
\&gt;Ok. Next Question...  
\&gt; Ok. Yeah that is the right solution. Do you have any other questions for me?  
&lt;Uh, no.  
\&gt;Great I will let you know.... etc.&lt;-----Quickly check leetcode/google: yes, i got lucky!!! This is my solution. Phew.
3. 50% landing this. Sometimes, from the online round above, even if I get right, they don't proceed.  
\&gt;Same thing as #2 except add these:&lt;Where do you see yourself in 10 years?  
\&gt;10 years ago, I thought I would be working for NASA as an astronaut. Here I am. I don't think I can see beyond 2 years.  
&lt; Haha alright. So what do you want from us as a company?  
\&gt;A desk, chair, some snacks and a quiet office. It helps me concentrate.  
&lt;What are some side projects you've been working on?  
\&gt;None that are coding related unfortunately.  
&lt;Ok. Well do you have any questions for me?  
&lt;No. Thank you.  
&lt;What would your manager say about you if I called him?  
\&gt;Not perfect, but a Good worker. Get's stuff done efficiently. You can call him and also ask for the end users to provide feedback.  
&lt;Why didn't you move to another team then?  
\&gt;The package was 1 year worth of pay.  
\&gt;Bob was supposed to meet you but looks like he is not feeling well. Can we reschedule for another day?&lt;Yeah..... sure. Have a good day!

&amp;#x200B;

4. &lt;No reply in email for 2 weeks and then ""Sorry,we will no longer... etc""  
\&gt;Aww damn, another rain drop in the bucket. \[Walk away and turn on Netflix or eat cookies\]  
\&gt;Wait for a day, forget what happened yesterday, rinse repeat, except every interview that goes by, I have less effort and less passion, not that I had a big amount to begin with.  


My fellow reditors, what do I do? Do I look for another field like finance? Can I just get away with tech support for 90k? I don't care about money. 100k or 200k a year won't make me a billionaire overnight. I could care less about the money and just want to get home at 5:30PM, watch TV, eat Tacos, wake up not have to go to work (prefer remote job). The way I see it is, I have to lie and fake my passion (very hard), and grind for 5 more years till I have enough cash to open a deli in kentucky or god nowswhere. Would the military take me? I feel like crap and am not asking for remorse. No one wants to take me and I don't know why or how to fix it."

Still planning to attend welcome weekend anyway for the fun/start making friends/start acclimating myself to business school &amp; U.S, but hesitating between attending R1 vs R2

I heard that R2 welcome weekend has more people and that R2 admits has more ""less traditional MBA"" people, which may be good for me as I am not from finance/consulting background and not sure how well I could connect with admits having such background (I found a few of my banker and consultant friends pretentious and McKinsey consultants staffed to my company talked down to me and mentioned he went to Harvard within first three minutes of our meeting, though admittedly I have a small sample size and I know a lot of cool consultant &amp; bankers too!). In addition, two of fellow admits whom I get to know quite well during the application process (and actually like) will be going to R2 welcome weekend

However, R1 welcome weekend will give me something to be excited too earlier and give information on housing, pre-MBA internship (plan to start hunting in March (1.5 month before R2 welcome weekend) for June start), dual-degree program (considering to apply in my first year, plan to write my personal statement in advance), which gives me more time to prepare for what to come. 

If I know I can have the best time and build strong friendships in both, I will definitely prefer R1 (approximately same cost for flight/housing, etc, will actually save one day leave if I go R1)

How was everyone's experience with admit weekend/social scene in B-school in general? Do people with similar backgrounds tend to stick together or many people end up becoming great friends with someone that they do not expect?"

I love watching movies and thinking about how every scene was put together, and why the movie works the way it does. How do I start building a career around this? Is grad school for film theory still an option for me considering I'm starting two years late? I really don't have any sort of experience that would lend itself to film. I have two years of college left, so what sort of internships can I do to not fall behind in the job search or grad school applications once I graduate?

ei08ao,2,2019-12-31,Is it possible to be fulfilled/fall in love with my job?,greetingsreddit1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ei08ao/is_it_possible_to_be_fulfilledfall_in_love_with/,"I know this is long, so thank you in advance for your advice.

I'm in my late teens. I went to college in the fall, but due to mental health problems and it generally not being a good fit, I left and am now taking a gap year. I'm going back to college next fall, but until then I've been working and looking for jobs.

The problem is, it's been going terribly. Back in the spring, I had an internship for a non-profit that I felt very connected to (in terms of the mission especially); I really didn't enjoy it, was making phone calls a lot of the time, and just generally counted down the hours until I could leave. I then had a job the following summer building on one of my core interests from high school - I loved it, had lots of friends there, but I was then asked to leave because of rumors (they were false!) spread by one of my coworkers. I looked for a job at an animal shelter, which I was not hired for - understandable, because I'm pretty young and unexperienced. I then worked at a fast food place for a total of two days, where I was fired because I ""don't have enough experience in the fast food industry,"" and they didn't have enough people to train me. I was late the previous day, and went home sick - I feel like that could also have had something to do with it.

I just....am kind of down on myself, and don't know if it'll be possible for me to enjoy a career. My biggest problem is that I get bored so easily, and fail to feel fulfilled by what I'm doing. My second biggest problem is that I'm really disorganized sometimes (i.e. me accidentally showing up late to the fast food job) and get stressed easily; often, I feel like someone is constantly evaluating me/that I'm not doing well enough. Lacking positive reinforcement, and constant evaluation in that way (often where I feel like I don't have room make mistakes and grow), makes me incredibly stressed out and unhappy.

I've always loved school, especially high school, and did pretty well, using academics, the relationships I formed there, and the activities I participated in as a huge source of fulfillment in my life. I'm just having trouble finding the same thing with my upcoming career, and it worries me. I feel a lot of pressure to grow up and figure out what I want to do with my life, and nothing really.....brings me any joy or purpose. I wish I wasn't bored or seemingly incompetent at everything I do. My self esteem has also taken a hit. I don't think I'm a lazy person, but maybe I am; I really just want something I can build my life around and enjoy, and that's not ""I just go to work to get money"" or ""I need to work to pass the time.""

Is it possible to be happy while working, and fulfilled by my job? If so, I really need some pointers, because I'm struggling to see a clear path forward where I can thrive. I really appreciate your advice in advance.

Edit: Apparently I was supposed to pick a flair (I've never been on this sub before). None of them really fit, so I'll just put it under ""Career Planning."""

I messed up my freshman year and have been working to get my GPA up but I ended with a 2.7. I think it's right to leave it out of my resume but I sometimes hear by doing that, employers might think it's even worse than that so I am not really sure. I wasn't able to get any internships at the time although I really was just quick to give up and that's on me. 

I took a class over the summer and fell in love with web development. I've been working on a few personal projects for the past few months to be more appealing but that's literally all I have going for me. I feel like I am being too wordy with the little experience I have and I'm not really sure what else to do. It's still incomplete because I don't know what else to add. For now I just had a bar with hobbies on the left. I wanted to move the soft skills to the side but the way I have it formatted, it just looks a bit weird cramming a few sentences in a narrow column. I was also thinking of putting a QR code in the bottom left that links to a video of me going over my largest personal project but I feel like that's a bit much. 

The thing is as much as I love web development, most of what I've learned in college were theoretical or creating data structures and managing memory. I feel like I would have to create another resume to tailor for non web dev jobs but then I wouldn't have any relevant projects for that and nothing else to really say. Most jobs I've worked are irrelevant but I tried incorporating them into my soft skills. 

I don't know if anyone else is in a similar situation cause I kind of feel helpless and stressed out over doing an interview for a tech position as I never even got accepted for one when applying to internships. I know it's my fault but I really do want to make the most of what I have now and am looking for advice on how I can at least get my foot in the door with my resume or if there's anything extra I should try doing before trying to get myself out there. Thanks for the help.

A little background:
I had the opportunity to go back to school about 4 years ago and I saw the greatest benefit in acquiring an engineering degree. The management and data analysis involved in Industrial Engineering was the best fit for my skill set, and now I will be graduating in the spring (May 2020). Last summer (2018) I got an internship at a machine shop in Hayward, CA, but it's not got a ton of upward mobility. My current title is Industrial Engineer II.

I've applied to what seems like hundreds of jobs via LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ziprecruiter, and handshake (through my school), but I haven't even really heard back from anyone. I've looked into hiring a recruiter, but it's more difficult than I initially thought.

Any help or guidance would be much appreciated.

Thanks again for your time!"

I am f(22) and currently pursuing a degree in Animation 2D at my local University which to be honest, I don't think I deserve to get in. I am stupidier or ignorance of a lot of things, it's make people irk and I can't keep up with the conversation with my peers. 

If my childhood me knew that I got admitted to my dream University, she would be so happy but at the same time I wish I can scold my younger self of a lot of thing she took for granted and somehow told her that she's so bullshit because if she really wants it, she should just start create a webcomic, story and create her own channel or anything that involves with ""I want to create something"" aspiration that she get so hyped about. 

I feel like I screwed up my life, every action will have it's consequences. When I was in middle school and high school,I did a lot of truancy and I got my disease of hyperthyroid then I had my diabetic so I rarely at school. I thought about it as nothing, I don't want to blame my parents but I wish they would give me more awareness about my action though, I don't really take my education seriously. 

Then my dad got me into college in diploma of multimedia. I did fine 3.0 gcpa but well, I don't think my skills are still optimal for my field career which means I need to strengthen my portfolio so much more, and most of what I learn in classes, some of it I remember theoratically but I don't know if it's effective as practically. The problem here are my internship semester, which I got terminated from my first internship but to be safe from repeating another sem, I worked under my father's friend which I just able to stay at home and do what the task he wanted me to, like designing t-shirt or social media post and created WordPress website, I basically cheating in that semester, at the same time, I also worked at fast food chain as restaurant crew (but since I'm spoiled) I got so pressured and quit it, besides I don't have time to work for ""intern"" anyway, I need some proofs to show that I did the work and actually, I hired someone to create that WordPress website all of this just make me afraid to pursue a career but instead I chose to study.

Then after I finish my final project (which I had to repeat another semester, because I don't do well on my first one), and my mistake of not working of any intern or any available job to increase any skills but instead I focus on getting fit, which I did, I love going to the gym, lift heavy, see my weight loss progress and being healthy overall with my strict glucose management with optimal hba1c. At this time, I felt so alive. 

Then, I got admitted to my dream University with my dream course, I appreciate it but later realised that I don't handle pressure very well, the stress got into me, I binge eating, I don't care about my health, I make a lot of mistake, I have a bad attitudes, I hear what you saying but I don't listen, I have suicidal thoughts, I feel dumb, I got burned out and don't care about my assignment, I feel like I am social inept, I got forgetful a lot,  I don't feel like I worth studying in my dream University and I'm afraid my result for my first semester would be a failure. Currently, I feel depressed ( or stressed ), theres a lot of negativity, i feel like im not suitable for any career due to a lot of mistakes in work and well my attitude about it too, I wish I can change, but I need to repriotize back again which is important because I feel lost what I want to be which is sad. I feel like my past mistake are catching up to me and it felt too late to redeem it back. I always give up, let's try not to give up In my degree even though it feels worthless because I know I can't predict the future but my suffering now should worth it for the future, I hope so. There's like two side of me fighting the one who whines a lot and the one who scold me to push harder. Typing this down, makes me feel a bit positivity inside of me. 

I feel like I will make mistakes repeatedly, I will talk this out to my doctor later on in my next appointment whether the problem is me or I got other underlying problem. I think i just want an easy way out, but with my personality like this, I dont think there's anyone want to work with me. I shouldn't take this oppurtinity for granted, this is like the closest I get to my ""dream"" job or probably it isn't. I don't know. Im crying for help yet I felt like I'm the problem and I shouldn't bother anyone for it, but I bother people with it anyway. 

My weight get increased from 52 to 56.7 kg now. My hba1c will probably increase much more, it's seems like my body is giving warning about my next possibilty disease which Is an heart attack. I feel messed up right now. I don't know how I end but if law attraction is correct, I'm on my way to my doom. I felt like I don't know myself anymore. I'm so stupid."

I initially came in planning to just try out computer science thinking that I would drop it later on and focus on a pre-med / health track but ended up not doing that. I've done 2 computer science internships in front end and web app development and they were ok - although I'm not sure whether my lack of excitement was because of the work itself or the subpar work environment. I'm interested in bioinformatics as it seems like an interesting intersection of the 2 fields I'm studying. However I took a bioinformatics course and it was very scripting heavy which I don't enjoy although I'm sure the course is not entirely representative of the field. 

 I've constantly been wondering if I should switch to a health care career such as nursing, physician assistant, or medicine as I enjoy studying biology, am stronger memorization (I think that compared to my classmates in computer science courses my logical reasoning ability is average but memorization ability is a lot higher), and feel like a career working with and directly helping people would be more fulfilling to me. However, I'm not sure this desire to work with people (which was sorely lacking during my first 2 internships) could be fulfilled by finding a workplace with a stronger sense of teamwork or moving into a management position later on in life. From my past 2 internships I just felt like the work I would be doing later in my career would not fulfill my need to help others.

I've done some hospital volunteering and it's been pretty boring and I feel like my drive to jump through the hoops to get into health care programs is just not as high as that of others. Any advice on what may seem like a better fit for me?

I just finished my associate's degree in psychology and I know I do not want to be a psychologist anymore. Not to mention it would require many years of school and money. I thought about being a kindergarten  teacher but when I volunteered at a preschool, I grew to hate it and crossed education off my list.  I was also hoping after my two years at community college it would have helped me discover what I want to do, but it sadly it hasn't. Maybe because I was too focused on my general studies than trying out some side jobs or researching more into a variety of fields.

I applied as an office assistant at a bank they called me back for an interview and want try out this job.

My mother thinks I am wasting my time trying to gain experience and working and I should continue with school and get a bachelor degree. She thinks I should start looking for work and experience after my bachelor degree, but I know its important to get experience and network while in college.

But aren't I also wasting my time studying something I may or may not like while not gaining any experience or money? I thought of doing online college and start working so it will be easier that way, but she is against this and some people say online college is bad. I feel so pressured and I do not know anymore. I still live with my mother, so she will keep this over my head until I move out.

Is it better for me to just go to college and pick any bachelor degree program that has an internship? and try to find a job that works with my school schedule? I have one major in mind which is family and consumer science, I kind of like it because it gives me a wide variety of career options.

ei7y7b,2,2019-12-31,I’m putting all my eggs in one basket,maltshuler,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ei7y7b/im_putting_all_my_eggs_in_one_basket/,"So I attend a school with a co op program. At my schools mock interview (they take real employers to interview sophomore students to help interviewing experience) I had a great interview. My employer said I had the best that day so far and he took my resume and told me I should be hearing back after the new year once they set up their spring internships (I’m doing summer).

During the interview we talked about me going to see the facility. I followed up and asked him about doing a tour and he said something along the lines of we were planning on having students come next semester to visit but I will set one up with you before the end of the fall semester. So I went on the private tour of the facility and I think it went very well. I met the head of Human Resources and the person in charge of the internships (the one who I would be reporting to and getting assignments from). I think it all went great, I was there for an hour and a half, nearly 2 hours just walking around with my interviewer asking questions and seeing what the company was doing. 

All this seems like I have the internship lined up. He said that he’ll make sure I know when their actual online application is up for the summer internship and will give me a call to set up the interview. I am going to email him in the next week to let him know I got on to the deans list this past semester too. 

So I have applied to 10 other internships so far but in my head I really see me getting this internship. He even started to talk about how much I would get paid before he cut himself off and said but we’ll worry about that later. 

I don’t really know what I’m here to ask. Am I out of line for assuming I am one of, if not, their top choice for their summer internship? Should I keep applying other places like crazy still? They are one of the most intriguing employers to me and will definitely choose there if given multiple offers. 

Any advice or stories about your previous experiences would be great."

I absolutely hate this degree AND the classes I've been taking (my school sucks and does nothing to offer students the ability to take classes from other majors).  Last year, I had the opportunity to do an Embedded Software Internship and I absolutely LOVED the work I did.  That's when I decided that I want to work that type of job.  Ever since, I've been researching/asking around online to see if companies would consider me for that position.  Embedded software engineer positions typically hire EE/CompE/other engineering/CS majors.  However, from the responses I've gotten, the consensus has been ""maybe?""  No one has said ""oh, you can land a job if you study hard and keep doing projects"".  This has been stressing me out and worrying me a lot this past year.  I've been self-studying but I can't help but feel that maybe it's going to be all for nothing if companies won't even give me a chance.  I've done a few interviews this past Fall and the companies I've talked to so far aren't interested in me.  I feel so sad/depressed because it feels like I finally found something that I'm strongly interested in but I'm wasting my time in school studying something irrelevant that won't make me qualified for the job I want.  

In terms of grad school, I am considering it but I really want to work 1-2 years in industry so I can use that to help my applications.  Also, my gpa is pretty low (its above 3.0 but still low).  I'm also really tired of academia right now so I would like a break before I come back into school again."

Dev or continue interning?",Nacho_Fries_Are_Sin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ei9iwk/current_college_student_in_cs_should_i_work/,"Some background, I am currently a junior in college working towards a degree in CS. Plan to graduate next December. I am also interning at a company and have grown more frustrated with the work environment so began applying for a new job. I feel that I have the experience to begin work as a Junior Dev so applied for both internships and jr. Dev positions. I have the availability to work full-time due to my upcoming schedule being fully at night or online.

2 companies brought me in for interviews, both originally for jr. Dev positions. The first one, I'll call NF (not the real initial) the interview went well, however, since I'm in college they would rather I work as an intern until I graduate and have prepared an offer. 

The other one, MD (also not the real initial), has brought me in for two interviews, both went well and they have expressed no issues with me being in college. They said they will get back to me with a decision by the end of this week, but I'm fairly confident they will extend an offer. 

Considering the fact that I am still in college, and the difference in flexibility and pay between intern and jr. Dev, what are some opinions or questions I should be asking myself to decide which offer to accept?

I can answer more questions from you to further the conversation, thanks in advance!"

One other developer. Striaght after college. Didnt have a great resume as personal things made it difficult to have time for internships. Anyways came in way under market for my area. 
Were developing a much needed upgrade to our system and based off that and things recently the raise i got out me no where near what i wanted and still way below market. To spare extra details im thinking about starting to look for a new job around my 11 month mark there. 

Curious if i could get some thoughts or opinions on whether i should stay longer because ive only been in the field a year. Or keep going with my plan to change companies"
eiandm,1,2019-12-31,How do I take the next step in my career?,okaybutlisten,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/eiandm/how_do_i_take_the_next_step_in_my_career/,"First, I want to leave my current job and I will explain more later.

Second, I am still in school and graduate 2020 so I am working full time and going to school part time. My degree is in IT, Network Operations and Security.

Third, I got offered an opportunity to join google's IT residency program. However, it wouldn't be until I finish my degree. So roughly 2021.

Fourth, my long term goal is to find my way into a devops/SRE position within the next 5 years.

Right now I work as a support engineer and I have been with the company for a year. We are an international company with multiple offices in the US, EMEA, and APAC. I moved from London to SF to head up our IT team in the US were we had about 350 users and 6+ offices. We originaly did not have any IT presence in the US at all. We are now growing the US team by another two memebers and I got promoted to be their lead. I was expecting a significant salary increase and did not get it when I asked for something higher they denied it. I've been working around 20+ hours of over time since I started this position and only recently got paid for it. I don't have the tools I need to do my job effeciently and I am treated like 24/7 support but not paid like it. With the promotion I will now be in charge of APAC and their support engineer as well. The salary is about %15 lower than the average for that role. Right now I do all of the onboarding for US employees, assest management, vendor relations, licensing purchasing, end user support, help desk managment, and executive support. I also handle any small network, security, or outages that come up.

I have decided that I want to stay long enough to train the new guys and my own replacment and then bounce. It has been incredibly difficult to finish this last semester with the work hours and stress. There are a few different scenarios that I am considering. I am really interested in the google ITRP which is basically what I do now but at google and would lead to a possible SRE job at google after 26 months. However, it is not set in stone I might fail the last interview and it's a year away. But if I have a really good shot at it I don't want to start another job where I will just be leaving in the next 6 months or so.

I am considering a few different options.

1. Stay at my current company until August/September and save up some money. Quit and focus on finishing my degree by December of 2020 and my interview with google. If things don't work out with google I can get a job somewhere else. I am currently applying for positions and will contiue to do so throughout the year just to gauge salaries and see whats out there.
2. Quit my job in March/April and get a summer intership. I would like to get a dev internship to brush up on my coding skills and maybe add one or two projects to my resume. The area I live in there are a lot of decent paying SWE internships and some other technical ones. I think it would be fun to have something temporary and project based. The internships would end around September time frame. Plus if my interview doesn't go well with google then I maybe have a foot in the door somewhere else.

Either way I want to quit my job and move on. I also do want like a two month break. I have money saved up now and can save another 5-10k in the next two or three months. I just need some time to focus on my studies and my mental health. I feel like I work really hard at my job but everyday more problems come up and then when I can't help someone or fix a problem I feel like a failure. I am absolutely drowning and I have tried really hard to make things better but either things get denied or I don't have the time. The company culture is toxic, abusive, and manipulative.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: I have told my boss in so many words that I am not happy with everything that is going on and don't think I make enough money. His response was that they are hiring two more people and in 6 months to a year they will consider a raise of %5. The 401k sucks, we don't get any food except on friday lunches, no outings, no gym membership, no speical perks really, no holiday bonus. The google program wouldn't pay me much more but the perks outway the pay.

Thank you for reading and any possible advice.

TLD: I want to quit my job but need help on deciding how I should handle it. I have the posiblity of starting a google ITRP in 2021 but don't know what to do until then. Please help?"

I'm prior US military, (currently using Post-9/11 GI Bill), with a top secret security clearance. I was thinking about returning to work for the federal government after I graduate, but I only have experience working for the military, and nothing else. 

Currently in the process of applying for more summer 2020 internships, (applied for quite a few about 4 months ago) and I thought about applying to the NSA or NGA. I'm interested in knowing if anyone has interned or worked for either of these agencies, and how you liked/disliked your experience. 

I enjoy what I study, I love CS and the math that is related to CS. I'm actually quite good at programming; not the best, but not the worst either. I'd obviously like to do something CS related if I worked for either of these two agencies. 

The main draw towards working another federal job are the insanely good benefits and job stability. Also, I would already have 5 years counted towards my retirement due to my military service."
