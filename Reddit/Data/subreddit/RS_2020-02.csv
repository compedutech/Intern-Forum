I'll be graduating with an M.S. in Computer Science in August, and I already have a B.S. in Computer Science. My grad school GPA is 4.0 and it was 3.7+ in undergrad. I'm pretty active on GitHub and I've spent much time and effort tweaking my resume. My resume has gotten good feedback from other classmates, friends, and professionals (on campus career services, software engineers). 

I don't have an internship because I elected to ""speed run"" my degrees. I will have finished my B.S. plus my M.S. in under 5 years. I did full semesters each summer to achieve this. I attend an average state school with a strong engineering department. USNews studies have said that it is actually one of the hardest departments in the country to obtain an A.

Here's the problem: I've applied to probably 40+ positions and I have heard back from 2. Both were ""no."" It's been over a month at this point since my last applications went out. 

I'm beginning to worry that there is some glaring issue that I'm not noticing. Is this solely because I don't have an internship on my resume? Or is this because I'm applying for jobs too soon (since I graduate in August)?"

I graduated BU(CAS - CS) about 6 years ago and have been working in healthcare tech in the area ever since. I found my job at a BU career fair and want to encourage you all to go. It's a great way to get in touch with a bunch of companies all at once, and many of them will do first round interviews with you on campus the next day, which can really accelerate the whole process. Get an internship or first job out of college lined up now and your spring semester will be a little more relaxing. 

Now it's come full circle and I'll be back at the ENG career fair next week ready to hire. If you are a CS major or otherwise interested in development, please come see me at the athenahealth booth! We have multiple full time positions and internships available. 

But with that shameless plug out of the way, it really is a good chance to get familiar with a bunch of local companies all at once, or companies all over the country if you've had enough winter. I encourage you to attend the ENG career fair next week if tech is your thing, or the next general one if not.

Feel free to comment or DM me with questions about either the career fair, or the positions we have open if you can't make the fair. Hope to see you Wednesday.

I just want to preface that I'm much more involved on the low-level software side of computer engineering rather than hardware (I'm not really that interested in circuits in general where they don't pertain to computer architecture). Also, I'm going to copy paste the post I had in cscareerquestions, but although I say I'm a CS major, my college's CS and EECS majors are practically identical, so the question should still pertain to this subreddit. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a sophomore in college and other than doing CS, I don't really know what kind of specific field / job I want to do. I really enjoyed a computer architecture class I took last semester, and ended up taking the more advanced version right now. I also got a research position with my professor in this class, which I can go more into detail about in the comments if needed. However, I've never really thought of what kind of industry jobs this leads to. I've always found it really cool how companies like NVidia, Google, etc. make specialized hardware to run certain applications (like GPUs, Google's TPU), but I don't know exactly how lucrative that field is, whether it will be expanding or contracting in the future, nor what sort of background I should have to enter the field.

I currently don't have an internship lined up for the summer, and so I'm pursuing this architecture research, but I don't know how much of a benefit that will have going forward, and want to guage my plan of attack for this summer and future semesters.

If it helps, I'm also taking all of the machine learning / AI classes at my university in the future, and I guess I was hoping that I could eventually end up working on hardware acceleration of machine learning applications.

Thanks!"
ewyk5t,4,2020-01-31,I bomb every coding assessment I get. What can I do to improve?,PenguinBond,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ewyk5t/i_bomb_every_coding_assessment_i_get_what_can_i/,"I am a junior in college looking to intern and every coding assessment I get I absolutely blow it. The multiple choice questions are filled with things I have never heard of, but that's just the start. I was able to get an internship my sophomore year but that's just because they did not have an assessment for me to take.

When I get to the programming part, I usually almost am able to figure out the problem, but I run out of time. Particularly why I run out of time is because I always run into errors with the language I am programming in and I do not understand how to do things in that language and waste so much time looking it up that I run out of time. I thought, ok, let's go with languages I know the best and also do some research on those languages beforehand so I know what I'm getting myself into.

Alas, no matter how I study I am always presented with a problem that I did not come across in my studies. This is something I can figure out in a real world work place, just by asking a coworker ""hey how do you do this?"" or looking it up on Google, but I just can't do it in 70 minutes or however long they give you.

What got me this time was inheritance in Java. I was researching Java beforehand and have done tons and tons of programming in Java before (it was my first language I even learned). But when I tried to inherit an abstract class it was not like any examples I saw online or like how I learned in school. After the assessment was over I put it into eclipse and let eclipse auto-generate the code for me, and eclipse did a bunch of stuff I have never seen before.

I have seen some people say that you should write programs before you take these things in the assessment to freshen up yourself, but I see two problems with this. The first is that I have no idea what the question is so I do not know what kind of program to write and I see it as unrealistic to just write a program that somehow implements every aspect of the language. The other is, just like with writing a cover letter, I do not wanna do this for every programming language and every assessment. I feel like it would be a better use of my time to just apply to more jobs.

Does anyone have any tips? Am I just under qualified and need to get better at programming?"

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

Probably am not going to take the ACT, took the SAT once my first try in August with just doing some nightly Khan Academy and got a 1490 (760 English and 730 Math), so I feel like I can break 1500 easily and a little bit more since math is easy to raise. My goal is 1520.

**UW/W GPA and Rank:**

GPA: We don't do 4 point scale but by overall is 97.64% unweighted (from freshman and sophomore year) and that is all honors classes so I don't know how that scaled. First semester of Junior year with 4 APs was exactly 97%

Rank: Freshman year was 9/160, but my GPA went from 96.78 to 97.64 so I know for sure I went up at least one spot maybe 2/3 (at least top 5%)

**Coursework:** AP/IB/Dual Enrollment classes, AP/IB scores, etc

**Schools:**

Georgetown is my top and reach, I want to go into politics so it has been my dream school forever

I have very basic Python skills and am currently learning C++. I know that I am not the most competitive intern but I do want to fully immerse myself in the environment before getting my Masters. Is it too premature for me to be applying for internships? Should I wait until after I get accepted/ during the middle of the Master's program?

I’ve been a marketing intern at a ophthalmic company since September 2019, my colleagues (90% are male) are all very friendly and loving. They pamper me a lot as i’m physically the smallest and also the youngest. I’ve been called cute and pretty by them many times.

Recently in Dec, a financial analyst joined, let’s name him M. I’ve never really spoken to M often as we are from two different departments even though our seats are right behind each other. Last week was my last week as their intern as they are hiring me on contract in the financial department, meaning I’ll have to sit beside M and work with him. However, about 3 weeks back, my marketing colleagues have been constantly shoving M’s name into my face when we go out to eat, even making sick jokes about me sitting on his lap when I get hired as a contract staff and that I should consider him. He’s actually pretty wealthy and is single. 

At first I thought it was a joke, so I brushed it off, but my friend and I realised that they kept on talking about M to me, as if they really wanted me to consider him, even to the extent of playing a game where they didn’t want to let me end it until I chose to marry M. I then realised that he actually stares at me very often, and would often just steal glances at me every day. To make matters worse, I found out from some of my colleagues in operations today that rumours have been going around that I like M. How could that happen when I wasn’t the one who asked about him, talked about him. I never once mentioned him to any of my colleagues. 

But all of a sudden they want to match make us, and now people are gossiping that I like him? Do you have any reasons as to what’s going on? Colleagues in operations have also been pushing me “What if he likes you? Would you consider him?” I’m very lost as to what’s going on.My intern friend says there’s a possibility that M is interested in me that’s why all these are happening, and that he probably told my colleagues about it. I’m afraid that this will affect my working relationship with him when I start my contract in March. I’m honestly pretty upset by all the rumours bc it’s such a bad start to my full time position.

Don’t worry, I’m absolutely done with academia after this degree! 

I’ve always done well in school and am a straight 4.0 student, but the idea of even speaking to a recruiter gives me crippling anxiety. Working on my resume makes me depressed, and my thoughts always turn to things like, “How can I convince the recruiter I’m actually good at this?” And “What if they can tell I’m a fake immediately?” Compound this with the fact that most CS internships are quite competitive, and there’s usually technical tests along the way, and it’s led to me constantly putting off what I know I need to do. 

With summer rapidly approaching, I need to find a way to get past this. I’ve tried the “just sit down and do it” strategy, but as soon as I start reading the requirements for different internships, the crippling anxiety comes back and I never feel comfortable enough applying.

ex4ksk,1,2020-02-01,I finally went for my ADHD referral,TechAndMusic,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ex4ksk/i_finally_went_for_my_adhd_referral/,"After putting it off for years, I finally got myself to just go and do it. I've had an autism diagnosis in 2015, after I started to realize more and more that some of my flaws and traits fell perfectly into place as part of an ASD. My mom had her suspicions when I grew up, but was _always_ sussed by teachers and family, and my father's side of family always just saw it as typical for them (Little do they know, I suspect a lot of them at the very least have traits of it, and my dad before his death did come to the conclusion he had it too). 

However, afterwards, I did also start to suspect I likely had ADHD too. Specifically ADHD-PI, I can be physically calm, but not mentally. Chronic procrastionation, screwing up all throughout school by doing nothing, impulsivity (specifically when it comes to food), getting into new hobbies and projects only to drop them when the new-ness wore off, poor stress management and planning, and the occasional shaky leg fidgeting.

Sure, some of it might overlap with ASD, but I figured enough is enough. I'm at a ""special"" college now, for people with various disabilities and disorders who get stuck in regular education, where they train you specifically to get into a job, and then through an internship, get you a contract and mostly on your own feet (there's still ways to get a government subsidised job coach, or other help). I've been doing their IT course, where I'm getting Microsoft's Windows Server 2016 certification, and I already have an internship lined up at an IT company which work as a three-man team. The third guy also came from this college, but is emigrating to Australia, so they decided to give the college another try, and I was seen fit for the position.

I've could have very likely finished high school and gone to the Dutch equivalent of college if I had been treated back then, and it frustrates me. At the very least, I could have done this course faster; I understand the material, and when I can push myself to it, I can get work done. But when I can't, which is the majority of the time, I'm just browsing around, doing nothing productive while bored out of my skull. At least my teacher's lessons are keeping me on track, and I only have one exam to go to finish it, with the hardest exam succesfully finished last year.

So, to get to the main topic of this post, I finally went for the referral yesterday, and it was literally a ten minute ordeal. The GP just listened to my symptoms and that that's why I would like a referral to a clinic to get diagnosed, and, that was that. Why have I pushed this off for so long? It was literally nothing! Now comes the 8+ weeks of wait, as any mental health care in this country takes eons for you to get an intake, but at least the first step's done, which for me is always the hardest. Here's to this decade being one of big and positive change."

I have been getting very mixed responses in regards to whether I should be concerned or not for getting an Engineering (or related field) job based on my experiences and GPA.  

As a little background, I am a senior graduating in the fall with my bachelors in Engineering Management Technology with a double minor in Mathematics and General Business Management.  I have an overall GPA of 2.54 and a departmental GPA of 2.92.  To note, my lower GPA is contributed to originally majoring in EE and not enjoying it; hence, my GPA suffered due to engagement level in those courses.  I refuse to retake them, as I am sure I will do no better in them since I have no interest in them.  Trying to compensate, I have been doing fairly well in the courses once I switched majors.  

In addition to this, I have had two ""relevant"" experiences within the field of engineering.  One was an internship at a medium-sized firm that lasted over double the amount of time that it was supposed to (was supposed to be 3 months, but turned into 8 due to engagement and work ethic).  Within this position, I was responsible for working along with the surface mount technology (SMT) team in creating work instructions for printed circuit boards that were to be used in military defense and aerospace applications (really was an AWESOME gig).  From there, I moved on to one of the largest engineering firms in the world (Fortune 200) company in which I work in the marketing department as an engineering researcher (Co-Op), essentially. I create product cross references to our competitors, perform market analyses/research, lead the on-boarding and data collection of new product lines (10 different products, 1500 part numbers to be approximate).  I have been in this position for a year, and have absolutely LOVED it.  

Through the university, I was able to gain a proficiency in using CAD programs including NX 12, Catia V5-6 and AutoCAD.  In my free time, I have a patent pending that is in relation to automotive safety technology that was done by pure interest and has no affiliation with the university. To ""round"" myself off as an undergraduate student, I was a Resident Assistant for four consecutive semesters, pledged a business fraternity, participated in a start-up incubator program and performed paid market research/feasibility study for a third-party start up (also unrelated to the university).

After speaking with my mentor at my current Co-Op, I was told that I can confidently profess that I have close to two years of relevant work experience, and upon graduation, I will have just short of three years of relevant engineering experience.  Furthermore, this engineering experience will not be just strictly technical, but also somewhat business oriented.  

I inquired about the type of positions in which I can take on, and my mentor told me that I can apply for anything from product management, marketing analyst, data analyst, program manager, marketing manager.  He even mentioned that I can apply for normal technical engineering roles, if I am interested in that.  

I would LOVE to continue on within the company I am currently at and become a product manager, and it is likely it will happen; however, I am never one to put all of my eggs into one basket.  Therefore, I want to apply at some top-dollar firms (if my credentials seem befitting to do so) such as Google, IBM, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Rolls Royce, Land Rover, etc.

With the aforementioned, what do you believe would be my chances of landing positions in companies of this sort considering my GPA compared to my overall experience?

To note: I am GREAT at interviewing!  I am lively, energetic, very well prepared and polished, and possess multifaceted effective communication.   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; have some great engineering-related experience, involved in undergrad and have proficiencies in quite a few technical areas.  My GPA is roughly 2.5 overall and 2.92 departmentally.  Can I apply to some top-dollar firms with those great experiences considering my GPA is not 3.0?  Will companies even care about my GPA that much even for entry-level?"
ex7tyc,1,2020-02-01,What can I do to be more productive at my job as a junior firmware engineer?,Rossally,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ex7tyc/what_can_i_do_to_be_more_productive_at_my_job_as/,"If there's a more specific or better suited subreddit for workplace advice, please redirect me to it. 

I work as a firmware engineer in a small company (less than 15 employees, I know the owners personally). My duties consist of coding in C and diagnosing any hardware problems in the prototype devices. I'm fresh out of college (majored in computer science, and graduated), held a couple jobs in the field before this one and so far it's the one that I've liked the most.

The issue is that I can't seem to be as productive as I was when I was in college; I like the job, and being realistic, it's probably among the closest things to my dream job that I could find without having to leave my province, but I feel like I'm slacking off more than what I should. It's not that I don't want to work - I genuinely do, I try to push through, but I get very tired and saturated with the task at hand.

I asked for a performance review and my superiors are happy with me (I also passed the two month probation period), but I want to feel more productive and more engaged with my work for the sake of my own happiness, and I also do not want my bosses' perception of myself to change. What are some things that I can do to achieve this?

Some more info:

* Computer science wasn't exactly my cup of tea when I started studying, the first year was almost catastrophic in terms of grades. It took me a while to learn how to code, to feel like I knew what I was doing (as opposed to trial and error), and to actually enjoy it. As years passed and I learned more, I started to enjoy it inmensely. 
* Before this job, I was an intern in another tech company for a couple months in summer of 2018 (I also did firmware, although I felt like I didn't quite fit in with the company culture), and then I worked for about 6 months in another one (I started doing embedded as well, but after a couple months they switched me to web development. I left because I wanted to go back to embedded, better pay and and a shorter commute). I also felt like I wasn't giving my 100%, and as much as I pushed, I couldn't give more. It got better the longer I spent in them though, so it might be a matter of getting to know the projects and the line of work - I'm aware that a real project is much more complex than homework projects, and you're expected to spend much more time involved in one.
* In every other aspect, this company fits my needs perfectly. I don't work long hours (from 8 AM through 3:30 PM, Monday through Friday, year round). The pay is good. I like the culture. It's the technical aspects of the work that I'm worried about - it feels as if I should like it more. I also have been working there for about three months and a half now.
* Working remote is not an option as I have to use electronic equipment I do not have at home (oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers and the like) and exchange prototypes with the hardware team very often. 
* I thought that it could be because I'm not used to working for that many hours straight - I might be missing some time management methods (some my fellow fresh-out-of-college engineer friends told me this happens to them as well). I used to go ""eff this, I'm gonna rest for half an hour and keep working on it at home"" whenever I felt saturated with schoolwork. Obviously now I can't do that. I don't currently take the good kind of breaks that require you going away from your desk and getting some fresh air, but I see none of the other coders at my office doing that (they do engage in casual conversation sometimes, but you can't schedule that). I do go to the bathroom, to get myself some tea or water or something to eat, but I never come back fully refreshed. I do check my phone every once in a while (no shame in that, the company culture is very friendly).
* I try to make myself as comfortable as I can, since that's one of the things that helped me to get used to coding in college. I take a lot of notes and draw diagrams to help me model the code better. I drink some tea. I keep written track of important stuff and keep my tasks organized. I bring some snacks. I listen to music every once in a while. I use a two-screen setup. 
* My health is OK and I'm young (23). I get my 8 hours of sleep. I do not go to the gym or practice any sports but I do walk a lot. I do have some back pain. It seems like my health is better than when I was in college; I used to sleep less, eat worse, and drink a lot more coffee (I'm currently cutting back on caffeine).

tl;dr: I am a junior firmware engineer working in what feels like the closest thing to my dream job, but I can't seem to concentrate as well as I did with homework in college, and therefore I don't enjoy it as much. I'm looking for ways to feel more productive so that I can be happier, and to be more productive so that I can be confident in that my superiors will be satisfied with my work."
ex84rh,6,2020-02-01,Starting salary for BI positions in Berlin,clayer77,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ex84rh/starting_salary_for_bi_positions_in_berlin/,"Hi,

I'm applying to positions such as BI analyst, business analyst, data analyst, and data scientist in Berlin, and would like to ask you for advice on starting salaries. 

My profile:
- BSc in mathematics (average student, top 40%)
- BSc in economics (best graduate of my cohort)
- MSc in economics with a focus on business analytics (best graduate of my cohort)
- Master's thesis was written at a reputated Institute for applied research and involved a lot of predictive modeling, especially time series forecasting implemented in R and Python
- semesters abroad at top institutions in the US and Australia 

Only two short internships:
- one in economic research
- one in business intelligence for a startup (involved lots of sql)

Obviously I do not have a lot of practical experience, but I found it harder than expected to find a job related to one of the roles mentioned above in Berlin.
I just got an offer for a junior BI position requiring SQL and R or python. The requirements seem quite high for a junior BI position, however they pay only 42k Euros per year.
Given my strong academic background I find this salary rather low, even for a junior position. However, I am not familiar with salaries in Berlin, so I would like to ask you for your assessment of this salary. The company is rather small (150-300 employees range).
Should I renegotiate? It's my only offer so far. However they would like to fill the position asap since the person that currently holds the position will be leaving the company very soon, which weakens their negotiation power, I would assume?

I'd appreciate your advice :)"

I am studying at a US university but not a name-brand one. I am a current second-year (4 years school) CS student and will have two internships (1 at a global-known company) + one externship (1-month) before starting the third year.

For EU, there is a Blue Card program.

I also understand Netherlands has a skilled workers program.

I have read a bit about immigration laws and work visas and identified Netherlands and Germany to have the most friendly policies.

I am also learning German and hope to be able to have B-1 proficiency by the time I graduate. I have read this help me secure a PR in Germany within 21 months as opposed to 33 months.


For Canada, I know it has an Express entry program which would grant me PR. And citizenship within 5 years.

For Australia, I am not sure what my options exist.

Which are my best options? I am leaning towards more Australia or Canada due to it having easy visas to work in the US later.

ex8nkv,0,2020-02-01,"Manager shafted me in review and promotion opportunity, what to do?",nocareergrowththrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ex8nkv/manager_shafted_me_in_review_and_promotion/,"Hi reddit,

I got screwed by my manager on my first review, and I need advice on my options.

I graduated in 2019 with a 3.83 from a top cs school and joined a company in July through their new grad program. I've already done a lot of internships so I've been around the block a few times. I had a choice between three teams:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Some devops team lead by a technical senior manager in his 40s

2) Some mobile team lead by a non-technical senior manager in his 30s

3) Some web team lead by a technical senior manager in his mid 20s

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to get to management as quickly as possible. I have the technical skills and have always been the popular one in school. I chose team 3 because I'd have thought the manager was most like me and would get where I'm coming from. 

In our first meeting, I told him that my goal is to get promoted at the end of the year. He said that's not possible per some company policy (not true), acknowledged my ambition, and gave me some next steps. To my dismay, most of them were bug fixes or small unimportant tickets. I went back to him and asked for higher visibility or re-architecture work and he basically dismissed my concern and said it takes time. 

To his credit, he later offered to add me to some architecture and design meetings to see what they're like. I spoke up, asked questions, and gave my recommendation like others but my manager kept shutting me down with ""let's take that offline"" or ""I'm happy to sync up with your question afterwards"". When the rest of the room went quiet after I said something, my manager certainly didn't step in to support me either. To make matters worse, he later criticized my initiative and told me I needed more context before I could give recommendations to a wider audience. That might be true for others, but I grasp technical material very quickly. 

From there, it's just been downhill. Not only does he no longer invite me to those meetings, but it's clear he thinks very little of my technical skills. He shared our 1 on 1 meeting notes and he wrote ""... needs further opportunities to dive into node"". Except for the fact I told him that I've already used node through most of school and previous internships. 

My review score was an N/A because he said that's what everyone got their first partial year. I'm pretty sure that's complete BS. He has a track record of growing and promoting campus hires, but none of my race and gender combo. I've asked my teammates if they've noticed what's going on and they either don't believe me at all or agree with him. It's fucking nuts. I scheduled a meeting with his manager to express my frustrations and was basically told that she appreciates my enthusiasm but agrees with my manager. 

What should I do? It's clear that my manager is young and inexperienced, so he likely doesn't know how to handle the situation or young talent. I'm thinking I can escalate to his manager's manager, talk to HR, or try to switch to one of the other teams but I'm open to suggestions."
ex9hki,6,2020-02-01,Should I delay my graduation in order to do co-op?,___word___,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ex9hki/should_i_delay_my_graduation_in_order_to_do_coop/,"Long story short, I’m on track to graduate with a combined major in stats/CS this May. But I have no internship experience in tech, nor any personal projects beyond projects done in classes. I know it’ll be tough getting a good CS job after I graduate (how tough it exactly is seems to be debatable - some have told me I’m screwed, while others seem to think it’s doable). So I’m contemplating staying in school to do a minor in Econ, just so I’d be eligible to do co-op, where hopefully I’d be able to build up some experience and where employers aren’t too concerned by a lack of experience. Downsides are extra tuition and the time opportunity cost of my graduation being delayed. 

What do you think? Is it better to spend the time to do at least a couple co-op’s, or would my time be better spent looking for a long-term job against the odds?"

exagdf,1,2020-02-01,HP Displayport Docking Issues,TallRichard,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/exagdf/hp_displayport_docking_issues/,"Hello Everyone,

I am a college student working part-time during the school year as a remote embedded systems software development intern. Because of this, I have a multi-monitor setup in my apartment that includes two 24"" 1080p monitors and one 32"" 4k monitor. I just bought the 4k monitor last week, and when I try to connect a DisplayPort cable between my laptop dock (HP Docking Station 2012 driven by an Nvidia Quadro K610M) the screen will load to full 4k 60 Hz, but it flickers on and off very quickly. This stops when I lower the resolution to 1080p 60 Hz. However, when I try and connect directly to the DisplayPort on the laptop itself, everything works flawlessly at 4k 60 Hz. The problem is that when the laptop is docked the hardware automatically disables the DisplayPort output on the laptop itself and enables the DisplayPort on the dock. Is there a way to disable the computer automatically disabling the DisplayPort on the laptop when docked? Do you think that the dock is bad and I should just request a new one from my employer? Is it possible that the dock was not build to the same DisplayPort spec(1.2, 1.4, etc) that port on the laptop is? Is there a firmware update for the HP docking station 2012 that I can update to fix this issue?

I have always been stronger at statistics than algorithms, which brought me to this option. However, I have realized that many data scientist jobs require either a MS or PhD, which weren't originally in my plans. My GPA isn't the best (3.2) and I currently only have a letter of rec from my SWE employer last summer, which might make getting a MS difficult. My options are:

\- Apply for a Master's &amp; scramble for letters of rec this semester . (If I do this option, can anyone recommend me what I should be doing to make myself a more qualified candidate, besides raising GPA)

\- Start out as a Data Analyst and self-study machine learning on the side and hopefully eventually convert.

\- Apply extensively to Data Scientist positions that I'll be widely underqualified for (unlikely to get FAANG or big N, so likely a smaller unknown company) and potentially get a position there?

\- Other options (open to anything!)

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I had a local SWE internship last summer (very small company, unfortunately didn't learn much), and will be interning at McAfee this summer as a Data Analyst Intern. I also have focused mainly on advancing my skills in Python &amp; SQL/MySQL so far, with the hopes of learning Tableau soon."

This is my second year in Med School (it's a total of 6 years + 4 years for specialties, here in Spain). First year went smooth, but I'm having troubles to pass this year even though I'm working a lot harder. I'm afraid it could take 1 or 2 more years. 

I also have a chronic kidney disease that might make me go to dyalisis in a few years, which won't help. Also I've been struggling with severe depression for 8 years, but I'm in therapy now and seeing some improvement. 

I have zero experience. Never had a work or internships.

I'm scared of getting a degree at 33-35 and not being able to get a job due to my lack of experience and chronic disease, but I'm also too tired and stressed to take a job and study at the same time. 

Any tips?"

I've taking Python classes in my university and currently learning other languages on my own.

I was offered a spot on the Year up program and I'm not sure if its worth it. Year up is 1 year program that offers hands on training and internships if you are between the ages 18-24 for free. They offer multiple career pathway courses which include software development. The first 6 months are classes and training and the second 6 months is an internship. I was interested because they can guarantee an internship, which I have been struggling to get one. The internship is with JPMorgan Chase, which I think is a very valuable experience. I want to accept it but the commitment is big. I would have to take classes monday-friday 9-4pm which means I have to quit one of my jobs cutting my income greatly, my only income would be from a library work study. The program does have stipend($50 a week) for all the students which is only gas money for me. I would have barely enough to pay off all my bills.  I would also have to stop my classes in the university and delay my graduation date. Is it worth it? Should I just find an internship on my own or should I go after this program?

tldr: I have to quit one of my jobs and stop my classes in the university to accept the Year up program to receive training in software development and a internship."

A little over a month ago, I accepted an offer from Y company.

Y company offered me a full time position, set to start in June 2020, and I only had a few days to accept the offer 1 month ago when I got it. 

I was not able to speak with my manager at X company because he was on vacation, and I accepted the offer from Y company thinking that I’ll use it as backup in case i end up not getting an offer from X company. 

Fast forward to now, my manager is back, and I’m starting to realize how...dangerous my decision was to just accept this offer from Y company. 

I can surely say that I’d much rather work at X company if I am offered something. I was planning to tell my manager that I got an offer from Y company (not explicitly say that I accepted it), and then ask if he has anything to offer me. If it is not better than the offer from Y company, I’ll leave X company. Otherwise, I’ll resign my offer at Y company and work at X company.

But now I’m feeling so....guilty about this. I’m literally going to lie to my manager. And the fact that I had this idea in the first place to just accept an offer and then decline it later feels so...disgusting now.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I love X company and I made a huge mistake accepting the offer from Y. The worst part is that X company actually works closely with Y company, so it’s got me even MORE paranoid because what if both HR teams somehow find out that I accepted Y company’s offer and I’m trying to get a job at X company?

I haven’t spoken a word to anyone at X company yet that I got accepted at Y. What if HR or my manager finds out before I even tell them? Would they even be able to find out?

All of this is making me so nervous and regretful. What do you think I should do?"

I’ve talked to older employees and the org seems to be very flat on the engineering side and so I don’t see any leadership opportunities in the future. Though my experience is only 3 years out of college I’ve had 4 internships as a SE (2 at notable companies, 2 at startups) during college and even held a position as a software engineer for a startup part time senior year. Peers around me with very similar experience seem to be making about 40% more than I am, though they work for bigger companies. I feel like I’m underpaid and my company has been dangling equity in front of me but nothing has been concrete. I have been interviewing with several companies and even landed an on-site with a FAANG tech giant, but didn’t end up with an offer. I have one offer for 100k base and possibly a very small options package. Should I keep looking for higher compensation else where?

I'm tomorrow sending in a letter basically saying I don't want to recieve any money from the state anymore because of a few reasons

1. I'm not allowed to apply for jobs. Everyone I've ever spoken to that are involved in all of this think I instead should have internship and do my 5th year of internship.
2. They've basically made it so that I can't live in my current apartment much longer because they've found me another apartment but can't seem to understand the money I get maybe only covers rent and nothing else.
3. I'll only have this income until the summer because you need to reapply and that process can take months and if I get it denied idk abt going into debt because I'm forced to live in an apartment I don't have money for and can't leave because the state is like we own u.

I get both my rent and my food paid for now because I live here bc i was about to be homeless before now that I'm about to be homeless again. but the apartment is for like teens that's why they don't want me to live here any longer and want me to start paying.

This year could either end with me being homeless and wondering where tf i put all my furniture and my cat. Or it could end with me having a job and supporting myself and never being afraid of being tossed from city to city and feeling like just a diagnosis on a paper.

Problem is that whenever I'm like ""I want to get a job I want to be my own person again"" I'm being spoken to (by professionals) as if I don't understand I'm mentally ill and I'm 5 years old or something.

I have a really dumb plan but i think about this every day and it's the only think I can do because I feel like a prisoner? but they say im allowed to leave whenever i want but where would i go

I accepted a position with a financial company in Chicago for the summer. I was pretty happy with the rate and the project, and I stopped looking for other internships. A few months later, I got a call from the recruiter saying they had recalculated payrates and that mine was lowered by about 22 percent. She said it was mainly because of my title, Systems Engineering Intern. She said Software Engineering Interns make the higher rate I was originally paid.

Well the job as outlined by my manager certainly involved software development and coding experience, so this seemed like a very weird thing to do. I'm honestly not too sure what the difference between a systems engineer and a software engineer is. Regardless, I was able to convince them to restore my original pay. However, as a backup, I setup some interviews with other companies.

Now I have other offers I'd like to take. I want to do this mostly because I feel like this company doesn't really value engineers if they would go and lower my pay like that after I had signed an offer letter. Is it wrong of me to renege even after they fixed it? Should I mention this as the reason when I tell the recruiter? I'd like to be honest but I don't want to burn any bridges.

Thanks."

I chose computer science engineering just because it was important to everyone else around. And, then in 2014 one day 4 a.m in the morning I called my parents and told that I am one of the two students who made it to Flipkart’s internship programme. That’s when I realised even if i didn’t choose CS, CS had chosen me.

At Flipkart I was surrounded with great minds from all the elite colleges everyone dreams of. With my growing curiosity and appetite in CS, I managed to get a full time job and then later received two promotions in three years. During those three years I worked on building platform services almost from scratch and found my interest growing in databases. I wanted to get more involved in distributed systems and started contributing in HBase. I soon started realising void in terms of advanced systems skills required to be able to understand such complex systems in and out.

Then, in July, 2018 I decided to pursue MS and took the GRE. But around the same time my father finally decided to retire. Leaving job was not an option anymore. Then I couldn’t deny the opportunity to join Facebook, London hoping to continue my interest in databases in company which is bold enough to build such systems from scratch. I couldn’t find the opportunity to join the team but when i came to know about OMSCS at GT which one of my colleagues was pursuing, i knew this was perfect for me to fill the academic gaps along with the job and build a strong foundation for my expertise in database systems.

Rich coursework of GT OMSCS on systems will help me catch up with the database experts at Facebook and be able to contribute more effectively when I get the opportunity to join the team. I want to be capable enough to think of high impact novel ideas which whole tech community can leverage. Google released paper on map reduce in 2004 and Bigtable in 2006, and even today many systems are built upon those ideas. Being at Facebook, I have opportunity to someday work on such problems which will be new in the industry and strong system skills gained through OMSCS will help me be part of the next amazing team which gives community back such amazing ideas."

exv0nb,3,2020-02-02,30-year-old writer feeling lost..any help?,boafriend,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/exv0nb/30yearold_writer_feeling_lostany_help/,"***Warning: Long post ahead***

I'm 30 turning 31 this year and am completely stuck in my career. I'm at my third job and have previously worked at a private furniture company and a nationwide retailer. I spent 4.5 years in marketing and e-commerce at the retailer HQ and did copywriting and social media content at the furniture place for roughly 2 years.

I am currently a copywriter at a startup from overseas that is moving incredibly slow here in the US. I've been here four months now and feel really stuck and am not really learning anything. Long story short, information is not shared and there isn't really a process here. The people I work with are 13 hours away and I'm pretty much in a silo. There are only 2 other guys here but they are in sales and a completely different world than me (they're in a different room too).

When I was at the furniture place, I had started worrying about my future. I realized I wasn't as creative as the other people on my team like the senior copywriters (of course, this comes with experience too). I pitched my ideas but it's a hit or miss thing. But my biggest realization was that I don't see the big picture sometimes, and am much better at seeing the fine details and nitty gritty. People would see campaign-level but I'd see all the inconsistencies in comma usage, capitalization, and even spelling errors in legal disclaimers. I enjoyed ""correcting"" things and making everything consistent and clean (which is important for a copywriter). I was also told a lot that my writing style was too formal and educational-sounding and had to loosen it up. Not a big deal -- I think I did improve and learn to flex my writing more (puns, interjections, alliterations, play on words, that kinda thing). But I realized maybe copywriting wasn't for me.

I was laid off unfortunately in September and after a few interviews at different companies, I only had this one offer at my current company. I mainly took it because I'm pretty capped at my salary range for my experience and could not find a job that paid in my desired range. My current job pays exactly what my last job did. I had wanted to find a technical writing job, but they're all very industry specific, and I could not land anything, even with the help of some recruiters (they're all useless in my years of experience, too).

At my current place all I do is write blog posts on social media tactics and edit video scripts (the company films product intro and trend report videos at their HQ), in addition to mass edits of website pages. The monotonous editing is fine (although can get dry at times) but my worry is how I'm not learning anything.

I previously took some SEMrush classes on keyword research and optimization, but have not found a way to touch on more of that. I had thought about transitioning away from copywriting and more into this technical stuff during my job search, but it hard due to lack of experience. I had only done SEO stuff full-time in an unpaid internship eons ago. My current company has a person who works with SEO, but limited information is shared, and she is 13 hours away. I've asked for metrics and performance stuff to gauge my edits and such, but..nothing is given.

This whole post is all over the place too (so much for being a writer). I just feel stuck. Because my current company is related to a tech solution for e-commerce, my parents are all excited that I can learn something from here and start my own business (I've never had such plans, they have just kept pushing for this for me for years and assumed it was something I'd eventually want to do). It's important to make money, but I have no fulfillment in my work.

I have found I really enjoy being on forums (have ever since I was a kid) and connecting with other people, relating to their problems and needs, and being a source of help. I have always enjoyed that. I also love social media, mainly memes (of course that doesn't lead to anything). I had thought of doing YouTube a long time ago because I love that connection to others (but I don't want to put my face out there for privacy. I also have low self-esteem due to years of acne). At one pint I even started an Instagram account to be a fashion blogger, but that fell flat and sizzled after a few months (it's hard to shoot everything by yourself). But yeah...I don't know how to challenge this interest into a possible career. My worries are also that generally...marketing/social media careers do not pay a lot. If it helps, I am located in Los Angeles and make $60k. I know it's not a lot.

Sorry for the messy post. But any help from anyone? Advice?

Thanks."

I knew I wanted to do this going into college so I’m already done with both of those majors requirements and only have one more core class until I complete every class required of me (aka my senior year will be full of credit fillers just to reach the needed amount for graduation. I have a rather high GPA and a lot of work and internship experience compared to my fellow HR peers. 

I got SUPER lucky and landed an HR internship position within the Total Rewards team at a widely respected organization. (Going to keep the name private) The internship was supposed to go from November to February but in the first week of January, they offered me an extension to May because they thought I was doing incredibly well. 

I never had intentions of going into compensation and benefits within HR but I love it and quite honestly, it’s the highest paying area within the field. They pay me WAY more than I’ve ever seen another intern being paid and I feel as though they genuinely value me as an employee. 

Here’s the conflict. 

I would do anything to stay there for the summer as well - I think it’s important to mention that the commute is like 10 minutes door to door for me and I just really like it there in general. 

BUT

I got an offer from Colgate for the summer in NYC in for compensation team and I want to accept it but I don’t want to miss my chance of staying where I am now! While working at Colgate would be a great resume booster, I’d like to keep my foot in the door where I am now for future full time employment opportunities. The pay is about the same (honestly don’t really care too much about the pay) but the commute would be closer to an hour. 

How would you go about asking your manager for an internship extension to summer? I feel like I’m pushing my luck by asking so soon but I do need to make a decision within the next couple of weeks. 

TIA for any advice - appreciate it!"

I never loved it. I went to study this because of ""Asian parents"", then realized I have zero interest in it. I have worked internships as auditor in other company. My performance was all time low as I require alot of guidance. I had to take a extra time as compared to my colleague to finish my work. Sometimes I skip lunch. Now I just work in my father's company doing random clerical works. Sounds like a good way to waste my parent's money.

I have noticed that whenever it comes to a subject related to IT or computing during my college years, I will easily get an A. Is that a good indication that I should try out a career related to computers? But most of the jobs require a degree, I'm not super genius in computers either. I am not young anymore too to get another degree (27 this year).

In addition, I noticed that I am an empath. I like listening to my friend's problems, not really good in giving advice but I am totally okay with listening to them all day. And has considered a career in psychology/therapy. I like helping people.

I have not pursued any of this because of money issues and age. Most people in my age are getting married, having their own company, and have the money to travel the world. Should I risk getting myself in debt? Should I pursue a part time degree while having a full time job? Or should I just continue doing something related to my degree (accounting)?

I am graduating with my Bachelor's in June, and I have no clue what to do.  Basically, I have spent the last 4 years extremely depressed.  I finally got some answers when I was tested for ADHD and bipolar last year,turns out I have ADHD, but not bipolar.  But it is too late for my GPA.  As a result, I will probably be graduating with a 2.9-3.0

Okay enough with the sob story.  I want to describe the things I have done in the last 4 months to make myself at least somewhat better in preparation for a job.  

-I have continued to do the best of my ability in my classes.

-I have read *Cracking the Code Interview* and completed most of the exercises in the book.  

-Reviewed some of the material from my probability/stats, linear algebra, data structures, and algorithm classes. 
 
-Started reading Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.  

-Finished parts of Andrew Ng's courses on Coursera for deep learning, without paying the fee

-Read some of the papers referenced in CS231n (Convolutional Neural Networks) course notes from Stanford

-Read the course notes from CS231n

-Wrote some Python scripts using some basic NN models (Keras, PyTorch)

-Finished an internship last summer doing writing Python scripts that tests certain hardware (courtesy of a family friend)

-Did 2-3 LeetCode questions per week.

At this point I am not sure what to do.  I am just so afraid of looking and applying for jobs.  My main concern is my GPA.  Will anyone give me a job with my crap GPA?  At this point I am just so afraid of looking online for any job for any company because I feel they will automatically reject me because of this factor.  I haven't even updated my resume in over a year.  Do people with below 3.0 GPA even get jobs in any tech company?  

I sometimes think of just submitting my resume without my GPA.  I am not sure if this will be a better option.  What sort of job do I even apply for?  I mean obviously, I can't expect a position that someone with a higher GPA might get.  Obviously, I can't expect the same pay because I have a lower GPA.  At this point, I am willing to work even at minimum wage, lol.

What do I do?"

Where? Why? I *knew* that we would meet again. They told me we would. It was written on the walls and the walls never lie.”

Before me stood Rudy Knowles, former slaughterer of pets and small rodents, former prophet of the sewers, former crazed clown, current mental patient. He looked elated to see me, smiling and talking quickly. His breath smelled awful and his teeth were broken yellow crayons in his mouth. I noticed a big roll of gauze wrapped around his right forearm. I was surprised he remembered me.

“When did you get here? Have you been out? I haven’t seen you since you were arrested.”

“I had to go away for a while. A little vacation in the white halls,” he said as he held up his bandaged arm.

I didn’t know what else to say to him. I had a sudden anxiety to leave this place. His arrival seemed to drive the point home that I didn’t belong here. I may have been crazy, but I wasn’t *that* crazy. 

He looked at me and his eyes got big, like he just realized something. “Hey! What are you doing here? Have you been forgotten too?”

**Part 8: Missing Pieces**

“Why do you keep saying that?” I asked as I gripped him by the front of his shirt.

He only smiled.

“What is all of this forgotten business?”

“There are other places you can go. My body isn’t here all the time. That’s what they said. I was trying to see what kind of openings I could make. Entrances and exits. This is not an exit, but it could be an entrance. Surface may be slippery when wet or on fire. Maybe if there was burning oil.”

I gripped his shirt tighter and pulled him closer. “Concentrate. You’re not completely bonkers. You *know* things. Do you know anything about a tall gray man?”

“Did I plant a seed? Oh. He planted a seed. I got it from him. I’m just the messenger gardener. Hee hee, Johnny Appleseed,” he giggled. 

I looked around to make sure there wasn’t a patient care aide watching us. I leaned in close to his face. “Quit fucking with me. I’m begging you.”

“Quit begging me. I’m fucking you.”

I let him go and walked off. He was taunting me and I was on the verge of losing it on him and I didn’t need to be stuck in here for any longer than I had to. 

It turns out he had pilfered a cigarette lighter and attempted to set his own arm on fire. The resulting burn had gotten severely infected and he had to spend a week or two in the hospital receiving IV antibiotics and wound care. 

He followed me around the next two days before I was discharged. He told me nonsense of secret messages sent to him through the staff’s smartphones, that they were delivering manifesto’s through YouTube videos and that he had seen them laughing at memes referencing his situation. He told me that he would have the last laugh, though. A flood was still coming and he knew the only place where the high ground was, that it was a safe place that no water would touch. 

\############

“We think you’ve been making excellent progress, Michael,” the doctor said at my treatment team meeting. I was sitting at a collection of tables that had been pushed together to form a large rectangle. There were people sitting at either sides, a nurse, the psychiatrist, a social worker, the counselor, a couple of interns and me at the head of the table, man of the hour. I had been going through this every couple of days since I had arrived here.

“What are you plans after discharge?” the counselor asked.  

“I’m going to look for a job. Perhaps a security detail.”

“Great. I will advise to not rush into anything right away. Remember your treatment doesn’t stop as soon as you leave here. It’s an ongoing process. You’ll have your meetings with me every two weeks starting out. I’d strongly advise AA. List of meeting times will be in your packet. But yes, I think a job would be a beneficial thing for you soon.”

They wrote notes and typed on laptops, while I just sat there. The cinder block walls were seafoam green and the fake laminate wood of the table was chipped and peeling at the corners. A bulletin board with a yellowing poster with a 1-800 number on it for a suicide prevention line hung on the back wall. I had a yearning and strong desire to leave this place and I thought that was a good thing. Before I had only felt an apathetic malaise, a secret wish that I would die in my sleep. 

“Is there anything else? Are you having any other problems?”

“No. I’m anxious to leave. I’m feeling...grateful. Grateful for you all helping me, grateful that I’m alive, grateful that I’m leaving.” Gratitude was an important thing for them here. They had talked about it multiple times in sessions and in group. I wasn’t blowing smoke up their collective asses with this statement. I would normally never share anything like this to people, but here I was.

\##########

I waited in the common area while they finalized the last of my paperwork and got my discharge packet ready. They had arranged for a driver to take me back to my apartment, the five star treatment. I stood and absentmindedly watched a woman with pink and purple hair and rows of old linear scars on her forearms working on a puzzle, a Lisa Frank style abomination with a white tiger leaping through a gaudy dreamscape. She was about three quarters done with it, the home stretch. Yet when she was done, the completed image might persist for a day at the most before being dismantled and put back in the box, only for the pieces to be dumped out again and reassembled by another patient. Over and over and over again.

“Think all the pieces will fit?” an all too familiar voice asked over my shoulder.

“Looking like it,” I responded. “I’m trying to look for some loose pieces myself.”

“You would be.”

“I don’t know if I believe in coincidence anymore, Rudy. You still go by Rudy, don’t you?”

“In here I do. What else do you believe? You’ve seen him, haven’t you?”

“Yes.”

“I knew it,” he said tauntingly. “And is that why you’re here? Because you spoke the truth?”

“Not exactly. What do you know about him?”

“He is reserved for certain people.”

“People, like Dennis?”

“Who?”

“The missing guy.”

“We are all missing something.”

“Tell me about it.”

“I wonder if his family is missing him?”

“Whose?”

“Your missing guy. The jogger. I saw him often, running and running, and then one day he was no longer there.”

“You *knew* about Dennis Burrow?”

He shrugged. “This...Dennis,” he said with the name ponderous on his tongue. “He went into the garage and I never saw him again. I was in the tunnels, watching him through the sewer grates.”

I about dropped over.

“Which garage? What sewer? What street? Why didn’t you tell us this before?” I was damn near yelling. 

“Nobody asked the right question, hee hee. I cannot remember the street. They are all the same.”

“Who did he go with? The Tall Gray Man? Was he there?”

He looked at me sternly. “No. The “Gray Man” as you call him has a name.”

“What is it?”  
 “I cannot pronounce it. You cannot pronounce it.”

“Did he abduct Dennis?”

“No. I do not know if he was taken. He went into the garage. He recognized someone, friendly. Waving. Hi, how are you? What are you doing here?” he mimicked friendly voices. 

“What did they look like?”  
 “A boy and a girl and a man. The girl, her third eye was staring at me.”

“Wait, third eye?” I was getting rapturous. People were looking in our direction.

“Yes. On the back of her head.” 

The tattoo! “Was she short with dark hair?”

“No. She was blonde and not short with dark hair. She was bigger than the boy she was with.” He spoke mechanically and acted bored. He wanted to speak to me of floods and forgotten realms, not boring minutiae from his life, yet he knew this was important to me and I must have passed some sort of test for him to divulge it to me. 

“Then what happened?”

He shrugged again. “I didn’t stick around. I had places to be, so many other things to see and learn.” 

It was the last I would get out of him. He stared at me blankly and refused to answer any more questions and then suddenly turned towards the puzzle table and flipped it over, pieces flying, the bi-polar cutter girl screaming and cussing, the patient care aides rushing over.  

I sure knew how to leave a place. 

\############

As soon as I got home, I took stock of my depressing apartment. There were empties all over the place, sentries by the kitchen and bathroom sink, windowsills and on end tables and my dresser. Some takeout rotted in my garbage and a pizza with only one slice missing shriveled in its cardboard box in the fridge. There was no other food save for a few jars and bottles of condiments. 

I began to clean. Vacuuming and sweeping and hauling out the trash and scrubbing the sinks and counters, it was all very Zen-like work for me and silenced my mind momentarily. I paused briefly as I held up a fifth of bourbon. There was still a few fingers of liquid in the bottom of the bottle. I opened the cap, sniffed it, and then quickly dumped it down the sink. 

And then I found the box from Amy Burrow's estate sale, the books, the old laptop. I set it on my kitchen table where it sat for days, taunting me. Did I dare disturb the universe, my newfound calmness? Ultimately I did and I set off to snooping, my heart pounding with a forbidden thrill. The browser history had not been cleared and there were passwords saved in a website for an online journaling app. I proceeded and found Amy's journal, a written account of a short and tumultuous span of her life. 

There was entry after entry of her trying to reconcile the rocky road that her relationship with Dennis has ended up on. It was a bit tiresome, full of negativity and only meant for her. I scrolled through and stumbled upon a sudden shift. 

&gt;*1/4/2014- Yesterday was amazing. It’s never been like that before with Dennis. I didn’t even know it could be like that. How many people don’t even know that? How many people live these lives of quiet desperation, never knowing how good it could be, stuck with a partner because they check all of the other boxes? I need to be careful though. I don’t know if this is just the taboo of it all that is making me feel this way, the excitement. I still have to keep my guard up. I need to quit this or figure out what to do.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*1/20/2014-Ok, it definitely isn’t just the thrill of the secret. It’s still as good as it’s ever been and I am thinking of him constantly. I really think there could be something there. Rick does too. He says as much. He says we should keep doing what we’re doing for now. What have I got to lose? I will just ride this out and see if my emotions are just deceiving me or not. I have to keep my head clear.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2/23/2014- Rick and I had the whole evening together. Dennis was required to attend a party at Jay’s house, some big client that they were trying to win over. Rick said he scheduled it that way so we could have a real night together. We went to dinner up in the city, a place on the north side, a reserved corner booth. It was fantastic and after we fucked right in the backseat of his car, the heaters running, cramped and passionate and clumsy, neither of us caring.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Later, we went to a small art gallery opening, sipping wine and making fun of paintings. And still after that we went back to Rick’s house and did it again and it was slow and sensual and built and built and I could feel something rising within me and the big release coming and after that I just let go and something else came over me, and I said it: “I love you, I love you, I love you” and he said it too.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2/25/2014 - Dennis has been different since the party at Jay’s, since Rick and I’s evening together. Distant. Even moreso than he had been since we’d been trying to get pregnant. Could he know? Could Jay have said something? No, I don’t think so. We’ve been so careful, never arranging meetings by phone, texting through secret phone apps, using this old computer. Jay doesn’t even know. It must be something else. I asked Dennis what was wrong, but he wouldn’t say.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3/16/2014- I’m so confused.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3/31/2014 - I need to break it off with Dennis. It isn’t fair to him. We can’t come back from this. Even if Rick and I don’t work I won’t go back to that though.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*4/26/2014 - Dennis says he’ll get the procedure. He’ll go to the urologist. It’s too little, too late and I’m secretly thankful he didn’t go sooner. I don’t give him much response to his change of mind and this angers him. I just can’t get excited about it anymore. We are sleeping in separate bedrooms now.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*5/13/2014 - Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I’m pregnant. I’m so scared. It isn’t Dennis’s. What will Rick think?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*5/16/2014- He is so excited. Says this is a sign. I feel a huge relief that he feels the same way as I do. I feel for the pain that Dennis will go through, but these things happen and he hasn’t seemed happy in a long time either. Better now than a lifetime of regret.*   

That was the last entry. A chill went down the base of my neck and into the small of my back. This was it, right? 

\###########

“That’s just rich,” Roush said. “What do you expect me to do with this hearsay information? Did you actually say any of this out loud? ‘Um yeah, I was in the nuthouse for mental issues and I was talking with this killer clown from the sewers and he says our missing person went into a garage one day and never came back out. I don’t really know which garage, but yeah, that’s it case closed.’ Listen, man I don’t know what it is with you and this case. I thought you were *done* with it.”

“I thought I was too, but then Rudy drops this bombshell on me right before discharge.”

“That’s convenient.”

“Yeah. He could’ve told us this two years ago and maybe we would’ve figured it all out. Says we didn’t ask him the right questions.”

“Unbelievable. Well, do you believe him?”

“Yes.”

“Well, there is nothing I can do about it. We’ve had strict orders on this case. After I went and visited you, I pulled up some of the files on the Burrow case, just to look around. They were at my office the *next* day asking me what I was doing. That means they’re actively checking the logs, making sure no one else is snooping around. I can’t do anything with this information and frankly, I think it’s a dead end. You got it from an insane person. Certifiable, grade A fucking nut.”

“He knew about the tattoos.”

“Sure.”

“And look, this laptop from Amy’s house. It has these diary entries that prove she was having an affair. Her child isn’t hers. It’s Rick Kuhlman’s. One of Dennis’s bosses. Maybe she had Dennis bumped off. Rudy said Dennis saw someone he knew, someone with a tattoo.”

“And maybe pickle farmers from Pluto called him home and that’s where he is. In that last entry it’s clear she is talking about divorce. Fortunately for her, he just happened to disappear before they could do that. A kindergarten teacher did not kill her husband. And how do we know that you didn't create all of this somehow, these diary entries? Just playing devil's advocate here, but all of this is awfully convenient.”

“What about Rick and Amy?I did some looking on Facebook. They got married and they moved to Colorado.""

“What do you want me to do, though? We can’t get a DNA test on the kid. There’s no body. Feds have no reason to get involved. There isn’t any grand conspiracy. My guess is her and Rick waited a long enough time after Dennis’s disappearance because of the optics of the thing. Look, I can’t go around peeking on the file anymore, turning over more stones. It will cost me my ass. A demotion if I keep pushing it. I’m pretty sure they railroaded *you* because of it. Do you really think they would terminate you for killing some rich lawyer's pet snake? You could fill a child cancer patient full of lead and they would probably only demote you if they felt it wasn't justified.”

“Isn’t that all the more reason to keep looking? Someone has something to hide?”

“Just let this go. Listen to yourself. Get healthy. Can you promise me you’ll quit all of this? At least until you’re in a clear headspace?”

“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” I said.

\######

Was I crazy? After speaking to Roush I had to wonder. You heard bizarre stories about dissociative identity disorders and people not remembering things they had done. Perhaps I had fabricated all of this in a fugue state of sorts. I had my memories, memories of speaking to Rudy in the asylum. They were reliable right? Could they be trusted? 

How do we know anything that we know? To chase this philosophical idea further would be maddening for me. I couldn't follow this thread further lest I devolve into some type of paranoia. 

And so, I let the case go for the time being. I had too much work to do with my mental health and the case and the alcohol had almost killed me multiple times, so I backed off. Getting better was my new goal now.

That’s the thing that I have heard a lot about, both in the nuthouse and in therapy and at AA, this idea of “letting go”, God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change and all of that. I couldn’t change that Dennis was gone. I couldn’t change that no one besides me cared. Maybe it was time for me to start caring for myself. 

I got a job working security at a complex of corporate offices and distribution offices for a large retail store that was based out of the city. It was easy and mind numbing work, but I was thankful that I was able to land on something. I didn’t look for any police jobs. My mental health record would preclude me from any of those.

\#######

It’s a simple life. I’ve got a dog now, a rescue. He’s some type of border collie mutt, a ragged beauty. Named him Dash. He holds me accountable, feeds me adoration, and puts up with my shit. I hold his leash, feed him kibble and pick up his shit. It’s an even trade. I love him and he loves me.

I still go to AA frequently, even though the urge has left me long ago. I go to listen mostly, offer some advice when I can, volunteer as a sponsor. It’s my way of giving back I suppose. 

Sure enough in the couple years since I left the force, they legalized weed in my state, for medicinal use that is. I got myself one of the medical cards that allows me to partake. It’s not the panacea that they make it out to be—I still have to put in the work—but it does help a little. It’s funny, I remember how we used to bust people for this stuff all of the time, folks whose lives were significantly derailed because of the legality of the drug. I remember several distinct cases where we applauded ourselves for big busts, trunks full of brick weed. We had used undercover cops and informants and full department resources, and now it’s advertised on billboards all along the highway and I smoke it on my back porch as the evening sun dips below the trees, Dash at my feet.     

I still think of Dennis often. He was the perfect person to go missing. A wife that didn’t miss him, a mother that didn’t miss him, coworkers that didn’t miss him, a kid that wasn’t his and no real friends. The missing people that get found after a long time, they’ve got people that care. Dennis didn’t. If anything turns up, it will be incidental, much like those kids in the lake, *if* a body is ever found. Google tells me that the acids in a python’s stomach are enough to completely digest the skeleton of their prey. 

What can I do about all of this? Perhaps I could come up with a sensational true crime book or podcast, get some attention. Me, a writer? I wouldn’t know where to start. Posting on this goddam website seems to be my only recourse. 

What was with the Tall Gray Man? At first I thought he was a hired hand, sent to scare me off of the case. Later, I supposed that I had been drugged by Dennis’s mother and that he was a hallucination. That iced tea had tasted awfully sweet. Lately, I’ve been thinking he’s there, but not really there, something of a contradiction. I think he was put there by the power of suggestion, a hysteria embedded in me by the words of one Rudy Knowles. He alluded to a “him” the first time I met him, started all of this forgotten business. In my frazzled state I created The Tall Gray Man, the man with the unpronounceable name, the Patron Saint of the Forgotten, janitor of the forgotten world, a place that I think that Dennis now resides. 

Some days I feel forgotten myself. I tried to call my daughter (she’s nearing sixteen now,I wonder if she has her learner’s permit?) and there was no answer. I know that she has her own cell phone now and I was able to track down the number through some favors. She didn’t answer. That generation hates to answer from unknown numbers. They prefer texts and screening calls. Rightfully so, I suppose. I didn’t leave a message. Her mother has blocked my number long ago, hangs up as soon as she knows its me. What has she told her about me? I am a mystery to her, forgotten, if I was ever truly known.

The rain hasn’t stopped in several days. I get alerts on my phone constantly about flash flood warnings and all of the reservoirs are full. The **\[Redacted\]** River is swollen, the water is cresting its banks. A family of four drowned in their vehicle, their bodies swept downstream in a wash. There’s talk about releasing water from the dam to flood some nearby farmland to avoid further damage to our fair city.  Outside and overhead the sky is gray, no end in sight and I wonder if there is a safe place that no water will touch."
ey1j56,0,2020-02-02,My first reddit post on mental health and how I dealt with it. Give it a read and tell me how you got over mental health issues/ helped someone else who was not happy get over their problems/ let me know if you are having trouble trying to get help and we can start a great conversation!,Drone_Girl,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ey1j56/my_first_reddit_post_on_mental_health_and_how_i/,"In this post, I want to talk about the depression story I told nobody about because I was embarrassed about the fact that I was a victim to poor mental health. Don’t worry, there is a happy ending to this. It all started during my sophomore year in college. I was excited to finally take classes in my new major. I had finally declared I was going to major in Mechanical Engineering and this time I was sure it was what I wanted to do. The semester started off fine but I knew it would be challenging because of the classes I was taking plus the research and clubs I was a part of. I am the kind of person who thinks I am capable of doing a lot more than I can and I constantly push myself to do more because in my mind I am becoming a ‘better’ version of myself when I achieve more. Don’t get me wrong here now, achieving more is being better but I forgot at the time that quality is more important than quantity. I overloaded myself with schoolwork and all these other things that I found myself barely making it. But I didn’t want to give up on anything. I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of doing it all. At the same time my social life was literally plummeting to the ground like an asteroid plummeting towards a planet. It was going so bad because one, all my closest girl-friends got into relationships within a month and not that that made me angry or anything, I was genuinely happy for them but a few weeks before they got into their relationships, I confessed my feelings to one of my friends and that went nowhere because he wanted to be just friends. Secondly, on top of that there was so much drama going on in my friends circle because of another girl drama situation. So all our socializing time went in talking about boys and that seemed to bother me a lot because I just couldn’t care enough. This happened every day that semester. At the same time one of my group projects in a class was going terrible because I was blessed with the worst group ever. I had to do everything and no one seemed to care about the group project. To make things worse, I did not get an internship during the career fair that year, and being a career focused person nothing breaks me down more than that. During these months I found myself crying to bed almost every night. My roommates also saw how I would get extremely emotional at times and they tried to talk to me about it but there was something within me that just couldn’t seem to feel better. It was this negative energy that refused to leave my body and I carried it with me everywhere, all the time. Music would help for a couple minutes but then reality would hit back and that energy would surround me again. Thanksgiving break rolled around and I wanted to fix myself. I gave myself some time to heal by going to Chicago with my roommate to spend the holiday with her family and from there I told myself to find what was going on and to mend it. I happened to watch Deepika Padukone’s depression video on YouTube one evening and it hit, that was it I was feeling a lot of what she described. I quickly started googling depression, it’s causes, remedies and I even took a quiz to see how bad my depression was. I then called one of my roommates and told her I thought I had depression because it all made sense. I was feeling what most depressed people felt. Now not to say I am 100% sure I had depression but whatever it was, it was not great. I didn’t know what to do with all these things I just read about and self diagnosing myself with depression, but I wanted to fix it. So over the next few weeks I told myself to take each day as it came. The semester got over. Winter break came and went by and I spent most of it in my room listening to music, just glad I survived the previous semester as my parents fought like they usually did and they also made it worse by dragging me into their bullshit by making me their messenger. The next semester I decided to actually turn things around. And I did. The moment I realized that I wanted to make each day count and I wanted to be happy with who I was, things really did change. I gave myself a second chance at being happy and truly understanding the purpose of my life here. This didn’t mean everyday was perfect or that I never had a bad day. I had bad and hard days but I didn’t let that discourage me. I understood that everyday is a chance to improve and learn. I am going to make mistakes. In fact, I am going to make a lot of mistakes but I won’t let myself crash down any more. I did that once and I promised myself that I will respect myself and only pick myself up from there. That semester was my lowest GPA semester because I took 2 very hard engineering courses but I survived and I learned. Just because I didn’t get an A doesn’t mean I am a failure. At least I was healthy and genuinely happy. I had better relationships with the people around me and I also opened my mind to learning and enhancing my knowledge because for the longest time I relied on the education system to teach me everything but that semester onward I taught myself about literally any interesting thing that popped up in my mind. Watch videos, read articles, and just LEARN! Keeping up with this positive outlook also allowed me to try new things like rock climbing where I met a lot of new people and also helped me find a new passion. I also got my first internship that semester, which is a whole story itself about not giving up. I am happy to say that I am actually proud of who I became that semester. I really flipped my world upside down. So, I hope this encourages anyone going through a rough time to fix their problems and find happiness because I know you can do it and get there. Don't be afraid to seek help from anyone you trust."
ey1w73,1,2020-02-03,"Self-Study Programmer(25years old, Korean guy) Bootcamp or University",Kayronfalanor,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ey1w73/selfstudy_programmer25years_old_korean_guy/,"   Hello, r/learnprogramming. I am a 25 year old, Korean guy with an associate's degree in biology from Canada. I tried to finish my degree at a Korean university and got severely depressed and developed a speech disorder in Korean because I was mostly raised in Western countries. Overseas universities are not really an option because of international student fees and places where college is free like Germany and Scandinavian countries are also not an option because learning a new language at a technical level is a huge obstacle. Also my therapist has identified that I am traumatised by having to forcibly restart from zero in multiple countries, multiple times. 
   However after a recovery period, I am in good mental and physical condition and am very eager to start my career. I chose programming because computers always fascinated me and I have a systematic and logical way of thinking. After a week of reading in November 2019, I decided to self-study Python through Udemy and Codecademy. I did the Zero to Hero bootcamp course from Udemy and am almost finished with the Computer Science path in Codecademy. Then I hit a roadblock with data structures like trees and queues. Although I made simple projects like a tictactoe game and a BMI calculator I am really struggling with projects that involve APIs. I also understand the concept of OOP and can make classes fine, but I can not seem to actually use it in my actual code. I read ""Python Programming Illustrated"" by William Sullivan and am currently working through ""Automate the Boring Stuff"". I have a list of python books to read but I found myself making little progress with just theory and only learning when I actually coded things myself.
   I read that networking and a coding community was essential so I sought out a local coding meetup and found some great people including a coding mentor. We are constantly helping one another and are developing small side projects to work on our spare time. I learned some basic HTML and CSS then familiarized myself with GitHub. I got onto Advent of Code and earned about 19 stats in total after backtracking throughout previous years. Then I found Codewars and solved their katas until I reached 6 kyu in Python. 
  All the online research that I did and a few books tell me that going to university would give me a strong foundation in coding knowledge and I can network with peers, learn from professors, get internships, and get a degree that some employers will see as a requirement. A local technical university that teaches fully in English seems like an option but I heard from students that it still has a Korean culture and I worry about the 4 year time commitment as my credits will not transfer. The university would even be free if I kept my grades up. Even if I apply, I might not be accpeted because I would have to compete with the high school seniors apllying for this year. Also I have read that a CS program in college might be outdated. 
   There is a bootcamp called Le Wagon in Seoul that I could attend which offers a 9 week Web Development course for about 8,000 dollars. This program could help me network and give me access to job resources. However I can only find stellar reviews about the course online and not a single complaint which I find very suspicious. I reached out to people on LinkedIn and of the 15 people that responded out of the 120 I contacted, they all recommended the course. Some said it was the best career move they made and others asked about my current direction and recommended it when I told them I wanted to become a full stack developer. It seems like a good bootcamp that teaches you what you need to know to develop a minimum viable product and market it well, and a lot of people seem to have found employment or made start-ups after graduating. Ideally I would have some input from people who did not like or failed the course so my sample is not affected by survivorship bias. 
   I worry that I'm progressing too slowly by self-studying. I average about 4 hours a day learning to code and actually coding but it is difficult to focus longer times. Mostly, I'm concerned that the lack of a proper network will hamstring me. I am extraordinarily lucky to have supporting parents who will provide for me until the end of this year. I am also exempt from the Korean military service. I'm leaning towards the bootcamp over the university at the moment but would welcome any tips or advice. I do not shy away from hard work and believe in slowly practicing until I get better at something by breaking concepts down into smaller and manageable pieces I can tackle. I want to also focus on not just technical skills but soft skills as well. 
   My ultimate goal is to find employment in an English speaking company or coountry where I can not only contribute but also experience career growth. Any input or advice is welcome. Thank you for taking the time to read my post."
ey2mkw,2,2020-02-03,Obsessing over rankings,HAK16,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ey2mkw/obsessing_over_rankings/,"I'm a computer engineering student at McGill. I could have chosen U of T or UMich at Ann Arbor, and now I'm starting to regret my decision. The other two are better ranked, and are seen as having better engineering schools. I don't think it's healthy obsessing over rankings, but I can't stop thinking that I would have better opportunities at these institutions, such as for internships.

Do these schools have that much better of an advantage, or am I worrying over nothing? If I do a postgrad at another university, would that be seen as more important than my undergrad when looking for jobs?"

My last year of computer science being this year.

I was trying to find my perfect major who could give me my perfect job, it didnt work well as you see.

I chose economy because i wanted to know how to make money and how the economy works.

I chose nursing because i have a crisis that any job is shit and just wanna help people.

I quit nursing because i realize i can't cope with the nursing enviorment an working with all women is not easy, and you dont really help as much as i thought.

Finally i choose Computer Science, degree Im in my last year and I have been doing a few internship lately, is not what i like but i can do it. I dont like it but i dont dislike it, i can cope with it. That's it.

I assume I will never like my job and is just a thing that helps me enjoy my life outside of work."

ey7q92,143,2020-02-03,"I Work For A Late Night Radio Show Called ""The Witching Hour"".",AliveMacaroon88,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ey7q92/i_work_for_a_late_night_radio_show_called_the/,"I work or I guess now, worked, at a radio station and I think… I think we made contact with... something. I don't really know anymore. Here, let me start from the beginning. About a year ago now I got an internship at a radio station, It’s always been a dream of mine to be in broadcast and while my end game goal wasn’t to be some disc-jockey slinging the same dozen shit songs day in and day out, it was a good way to get an in to the business. A *great* in actually, I was lucky to have it, all thanks to my uncle. Things were fine to start, I settled in nicely. I made a few friends, got to spend hours fundraising locally with the station and I felt like I was doing great things for the community. Funny thing isn’t it? A group of strangers all live together within, say, a 10-mile radius of each other and we’re all expected to be each other's friend. Where were they when everything went to shit? So much for community then.

I was on typical basic intern duties at first. When I wasn’t writing the news up for the hosts to present each morning, I would be running errands. Most of the time the hosts would want coffee or lunch or to let their dogs out. That’s fine, it was easy work and I didn’t mind getting to spend some time with a few furry friends now and then. It was a nice break from the monotonous computer screens and microphones that I stared at day in and day out. However, one day our boss, Victor, stopped in. He said to me, seemingly out of nowhere, “Garrett, you’ve really been an asset to this team, I think we can all agree. So, I want you to be on our late-night show with me.” his voice ruptured from his throat the likes of how cockroaches explode when you stomp on them. It oozed out, slimy and rotten. See, our boss, Victor, was an odd fellow, an *exceptionally* odd fellow. He worked for this station for many, many years. Slowly and surely working his way up. He never stopped by, more than likely due to the fact that he worked the graveyard shift each night. He ran a talk show, mostly it was callers who'd call in to talk about anything and everything. Ranging from lonely truckers out on the roads for countless hours, just needing a voice to hear to remind them they’re still in this hellish mortal coil, or even spouses who call to vent their marital problems, you name the weirdo and you’ve got them on air.

Victor, while here this afternoon, decided he was going to change up the formula for his nighttime show. See, he had recently become infatuated with this show that would play at night called “Coast to Coast”. Some gaudy talk show that preyed upon those of weak mind, spouting conspiracy theories and paranormal jargon at anyone daft enough to listen. Well, Victor’s new idea was to take the station in that direction. Who knows if he got any permission from the parent company who owned us, but I doubt it highly. “The Witching Hour” he was to call it, as if the name were to invoke some emotional response anytime he uttered the words, that cockroach ooze of a voice still slipping out between his teeth. I was to be the co-host. Me, some 22-year-old dude who had never been on air before in his life, landed an internship because his uncle had ties with one of the morning show hosts. The same dude that gratefully accepted the chance that Victor had presented him, the same dude who had been promoted from a salary free intern to someone with a decent living, the same dude who had no fucking clue what he just got himself into. Garrett, the radio host.

The transition to working the graveyard shift with Victor was not only hard on my body, as I had never worked a nightshift in my small and pedantic life, but it was also extremely eerie. I was used to the office being bright in the morning, laughter from the many employees. The smells of fast food breakfast sandwiches and cheap coffee emanating through the air. Instead, I was treated to minimal lighting, so minimal I stumbled over countless things making my way to the broadcasting room, the only source of light in the entire damn studio. Victor sat there, in his chair, preparing himself for the evening’s show, it wasn’t much, he just sat with his eyes closed, completely motionless. I never took Vic to be Buddhist, meditation didn’t seem like his thing. Now I realize, however, I didn’t know much about anything. I walked into the room, as quiet as I could be to not disturb Vic. Anxiety and nerves coursed through my body like a prized greyhound.

Not only was this to be the first live broadcast I had ever done it was with not only mine but everyone’s boss. “Welcome Garrett, please take a seat, are you excited to begin?” That damned voice, I don’t think I will ever get it out of my head. I took my seat, across the desk from Victor. He still sat motionless, like a marionette with no master to pull the strings. “I… brought you a coffee, I wasn’t sure how you took your coffee, so I just defaulted to 2 creams 2 sugar.” Victor didn’t reply, an ugly amount of time had passed before he spoke out of the blue “Thank you, Garrett.” He proceeded to make no motion for the coffee I was holding out for him. I could see his eyes flittering around behind his eyelids like some sort of robot scanning the pages of a thousand-page novel. As if nothing had happened out of the ordinary Victor snapped out of whatever state he was in and shot me a smile. At the time I figured it to be an embarrassed smile, a ‘sorry for holding everything up’ sort of smile. I know now, that I was wrong.

The first night went off without a hitch, the regulars all called in, nothing strange, just lonely people calling one of the last shows on the air in the county. I felt like I had a decent presence in the show and was able to toss in a few improvised quips, keeping the calls from getting overly sappy or melancholic. Dare I say I enjoyed it, Victor was actually a fun personality to bounce off of on-air. He was witty and fast with his responses, he gave some great tips to people in need and he kept the show running on track like he had done this for 40 years. That’s probably because he had, and boy was it amazing to see a master at work. Then, as the weeks went on and we settled into our groove, that being, I show up, Victor is in some meditative state, I prepare myself and the show goes off without a hitch. It worked well for us and me being someone who wanted nothing more in life than to be a full-time creative wasn’t going to complain about the awkward half-hour of silence I endured sitting across from Vic every night before the show. Sure it creeped me out, but I just sucked it up and rolled with it.

Then, after a few weeks of the show going great it dwindled. Slowly callers stopped calling, no one cared about the show. It just died. Victor had called a meeting the next day to talk about the station’s performance. It felt like any typical staff meeting, Victor would spout some hyperbolic bullshit about how we are all a team and need to band together to keep this station afloat, even if it meant some people had to pull overtime shifts to make sure loose ends were tied up into neat little bows. He then turned his attention to me. “Garrett, our show is dying, listener-ship has been on a steady decline since we started. Do you have any ideas to bolster this?” He threw me on the spot, I had no idea what to say so I just said: “Uh- I can try and have a few of my friends call in and spark a conversation? Maybe that will help us out and get the ball rolling.” Victor didn’t seem to care much for that thought, he just stared at me, motionless again, mouth agape. The room grew uneasy, I think everyone was waiting for Victor to snap and fire me on the spot. He didn’t, although I wish he had now. He snapped out of his mannequin impersonation, closed his mouth, stood up straight and again the oozing voice spewed out. “Not bad… I will make some arrangements to have some pre-loaded callers.” He never broke eye contact with me and I could’ve sworn his eyes changed for a second.

This brings us to tonight, this horrible wretched night, the one I will never get out of my mind no matter how much I try, tonight was the last broadcast of “The Witching Hour”. It started like any other, I arrived, coffee in hand, to a dark studio, weeks of traversing the desks and chairs in the dark had made me a master at navigating this office. I made it, once again, to the broadcast room. Vic sat there, in his motionless meditative state, but this time something was off. His eyes were open, staring down at the desk, still flittering around as if he was scanning something continuously. I walked in and took a seat at my side of the desk, put down my backpack and my coffee and pulled out some notes and conversation ideas I had jotted down.

Instead of our usual half-hour of silence, Victor looked up from the desk he stared at and stared directly at me, an empty look in his eyes as though he wasn’t really seeing me. “This will be our best show yet, also our last.” His voice wasn’t enthusiastic, it wasn’t a vote of confidence, it was a statement, nothing more, nothing less. Before I could even reply he shut down, back into that motionless stare. I could physically see the shift. It seemed as though the puppet master had walked away from the strings.

The show, again, like always, went off without a hitch. Almost every regular had called again making the show a bustling hive of conversation. I was so surprised, there was no announcement of this being the final broadcast and yet, everyone mentioned it. Before long the show had seemingly come to an end, Victor was his same usual bouncy on-air personality. He decided to take one more caller, mentioning that it was his friend. It was a man with a voice as filthy as Victors, at first I thought it *was* just Victor playing a joke and wasn’t actually his friend. The man talked about some out-there conspiracy involving mattress stores, but half-way through his story he mentioned my name. Not just my first name, being a host of a radio show made that public knowledge. He knew my entire name, first, middle, last. I was taken aback in an instant. He kept stammering on about his story and slowly the English that he spoke turned to gibberish, live on air. It just dissipated to some gurgling noises. The call went silent, and Victor had returned to his motionless stare. I was beyond freaked out. I didn’t know if I should leave to call the cops, it sounded like someone had just choked to death on the air. I asked Victor for some help and there was no reply, just that cold, evil stare.

I called out for the caller a few times, in hopes he would reply to me. As though he were waiting for me to act first he began to chant some words in a dialect I had never heard before, the words thundering through the studio. I cupped my ears in pain. Victor who had been motionless until now began to twitch. The thundering chants continuing, making my ears ring and my thoughts disperse until I couldn’t focus on anything. I sat there bound to the chair by this horrific chant, watching in agony as Victor began to shift, his skin tearing and his face deforming. That ungodly stare still fixated on me. Vic, if we can even call him that at this point, turned into this lanky black horrific figure that still stared at me, at my soul. The voids he had for eyes, the pits where those eyes should have been were jittering around like they were covered in maggots. I still count my lucky stars on the shoddy equipment the studio had, the connection had cut out for a split second, rendering the chant useless for a mere moment. I was free of the shackles it had bound me in. I made a dash from my chair to the exit of the studio, tumbling over all that same shit I had conquered in my months of coming here at night.

I felt the presence of that, thing, following me through the studio and out into the night. I ran and I ran for what seemed like hours until I reached my house. There was no sign of life anywhere in town, I screamed for help but no one came, so much for a sense of community. I can still feel the presence of it lurking in the shadows. It's been about a half-hour now but as I write this I see him in the trees, coldly staring at me, the voids of eyes quivering, his stance motionless. Once again the puppet master has left the strings. I fear for what will happen when he returns. God help me. The witching hour is coming to a close."

I just finished my bachelors degree and have to decide between 3 positions.

1) PwC 6 months internship in advisory for insurance companies.

2) Uni Credit Brokerage Internship 6 months

3) EY TAS financial DD consultant position

My plan would be to do either an 6 month internship now and start a masters degree in finance from a non target school or start the full time consultant position and try to apply for a masters degree in 1 and a half years from a target university. 

I want to end up in IB if possible after my masters degree so the decision i make now is very important. PwC would be nice but my responsibilities dont have anything to do with IB or M&amp;A. Unicredit has more to do with it but they told me in the interview they dont offer any full time offers after the internship because of downsizing. EY they are not yet sure if they take me because I dont have a masters degree and dont want me to quit after one and a half years because of that. 

I have to decide till the end of this week and I am scared if I turn any of them down my chances of future positions there are 0 and Uni Credit is the only Investment Bank where I live right now. My father said I should say yes to all 3 and decide later as PwC starts in April and Unicredit in July. What is your opinion on this? 

Thanks in advance"

Thanks for clicking on my post!

I’m currently a senior in high school thinking about majoring in either CS or MIS (leaning mostly towards CS). While some of my schools are really good at business, they aren’t as good (yet still pretty decent) at computer science.

To provide some perspective, the main schools in considering are: Baylor, Indiana, Georgia, Miami University, Purdue (I’m enrolled in the business school not CS program), and Ohio State. I’m still waiting on Northeastern, BU, and UW but I probably won’t be able to afford them. 

My main questions are:

- How can I get an internship at a large company in the Bay Area or Seattle without being at a large tech school like Stanford, Berkeley, GTech, Carnegie, etc.

- I’ve heard that a lot of those colleges have recruiter on campus from Apple, Google, FB, etc. Do they have those at other, less technical schools?

- How often do they hire students out of college from my range of schools?

- what experience should I build up (either internships or work at other companies after college before) to get a job?

- Which college, from my list, do you think has the best CS program?

Thanks for any help!"
eybvwo,3,2020-02-03,Internship problems per usual. Any advice?,Wincent98,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/eybvwo/internship_problems_per_usual_any_advice/,"I know this is a pretty common theme around this subreddit, so I am sorry I’m advance for asking for the same advice that many others ask on here, I just feel like I don’t have many other places to go to rant/ask for said advice.

I am an Aerospace Engineering student in my Junior Year (graduating May 2021) and have been straight out of luck securing an internship for Summer 2020. 

I think I am a decent candidate on paper, my GPA is at least not bad enough to instantly reject me (3.3) and I have current research and CFD experience in my uni’s Gas Turbine Lab, including some higher scale projects. I am a TA for a Matlab course, and I have even went out of my way to stand out by learning software outside my uni’s normal curriculum such as Python/CATIA/ANSYS

I wasn’t expecting a big company to take me up, but out of ~80 apps, I’ve gotten 2 interviews that each went to the last phase where I got rejected both times. I think, based on reading some experiences in here, that this means my networking/resume/interviewing skills aren’t the greatest, and it appears that the chance of me not having an internship for the summer is high.

This being said, what would the best course of action for me to try and build as much experience as possible this summer to try and maximize my chances of a job after my graduation? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, any and all advice is greatly appreciated :)"
eybzvp,1,2020-02-03,Python REST API help,iNeedAnAnonUsername,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/eybzvp/python_rest_api_help/,"I am applying for an internship that has a project as a part of the application. This is my first time applying for an internship, and I'm struggling to button up the last part of this project into something deliverable.

The prompt is to create a REST API endpoint in python that takes a URL query with a few parameters, use the parameters to search a database, then return a subset of results as json objects. 

For the sake of simplifying the problem to focus on what I don't understand, I have made this example much simpler. The URL query would be something like:

'/data/search?q=mike&amp;age=30'

where the database has names and ages, and the expected result is json objects from the database that have the name ""mike"" and the age ""30""

I have the logic working for the database search in a project, but I can't figure out how to make my code into an API.

I have been trying to read into this, so here is what I think I understand so far:

\- I have the server side logic all working, and I can test it by inputing test urls from within my project, and output json objects to the console. I just can't figure out how to pass in the URL from outside and then pass back the json objects from a server.

\- Of course I need a server to make requests to. Based on what I found online, the app Postman can help with this by making a virtual server that I can send commands through and receive the json objects as a response. I haven't spent too much time figuring out this app yet because I know I need code to make my software interface with it in the first place, but I figured I would include it for the sake of completeness.

\- The endpoint needs to be a GET request, and I need to use the 'requests' python library to handle HTTP requests. I can feed a URL to requests.get() and get 200 response codes, but I haven't been able to figure out how to parse the query string to feed into my program using the requests library. I just wrote my own URL parser to get the code working, but I feel like the requests library should be able to do this.

\- I need to use the Flask or Django framework to make my code into an API. From what I've read, Flask is easier to work with. This is probably the most confusing part for me. I don't know how to implement flask to make an API.

Any tips are appreciated. Thanks"
eyc0a7,3,2020-02-03,I recently turned 18 and my parents have done a 180 on me 'Serious',xannax159,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/eyc0a7/i_recently_turned_18_and_my_parents_have_done_a/,"My parents come from an Asian background (this effects things a lot) and im their second child born in the western world. 

My parents got me a car when I got my license (around 16 3/4) in exchange for me being employed at their business to ""help out"". I told my parents getting a car (especially the one they got me) was a really bad idea as it was insanely expensive (and now I realize more how dumb it was than I did before). So around 17 1/2 I started saving up for a used car that I would be happy owning and knowing it's not nearly expensive or fragile (i let my parents know that since my mom needed a car, ill give it to them). I'm now at 18 still saving up for the car and my parents have turned on their word. They wanted me to start paying them for the car (finance + insurance = \~1k/mo). Now I'm not going to try and make myself the ""victim"" really but with that new restriction they put on me, it would take me 15 months to save up for the car. Not to mention I also pay for the gas and maintenance of the car (which i already did). 

This infuriated me, especially because to even drive the car, they are forcing me to work there but now they want me to work there, make basically minimum wage, and spend every bit of money i have on just being able to drive that car. (i have to be able to drive at this point because of my school situation with transportation). I calculated in a perfect world I would be saving 200$ a month after their sanctions. 

Not only that, they want me to work more hours (while im still in high school and have internships).

&amp;#x200B;

Now i may sound like an entitled brat in the text above but please keep reading.

&amp;#x200B;

My older brother (19) has a car too. He doesn't pay jack for it. Hes had it for 2 years, asks my parents for gas money. Struggles to keep with maintenance. and has dropped out of college twice. And a certain another ongoing incident im not going to mention here thats costing my parents 50k. They dont expect him to pay for anything.

While im over here working my ass off just to keep up with what they're putting down because of the predicament im now in because of them.

They've also turned on their word when they told me they would fund my college (which i already got accepted to before they turned on it).

Financially they are considered rich. I know exactly how much they make despite their asks. I asked them if i could have 2 more months of not having to pay for the car so i could adjust to them and get a different used car sooner. But as of 2 days after my 18th birthday. They've already committed. Im not looking for approval here. Im looking for suggestions on how I should proceed. I've always worked for everything I own (except for the expensive ass impulse buy they made on the car) and now well after they'd already been informed of my plans they decided to throw a wrench in it. I could live without a car, believe me. But, my current situation, simply does not allow for me to be successful without it. I feel like im stuck. Like there's no way out and im trapped in their little loop. (need a car now? work here for minimum wage but we also want you to pay for the entire car). What im most concerned about is college, if they really are serious on not sending me. My future is basically going to be me wandering around from minimum wage to minimum wage and living under their roof until im like 33.

They despise the idea of me working elsewhere. They always say this, ""why would we pay others when we can pay ourselves?"" as in keeping the money in the family which I don't agree with because of its minimum wage. The simple idea of me refusing to work makes them ignore me until I reluctantly end up going anyways which then makes them happy. Nothing else ever makes them happy. Not getting accepted into college, or finding internships or any other achievement I've gotten. Work? Happy. Not working? not happy.

Also, their business is expanding. Its been doing the best it has been ever and it keeps doing better. But its not for me, I want to enter the Computer Science field through a degree and self-interest but their whole situation with college is hurting it. Emotionally im over them. They've done a lot more in the past but this is what I need help with currently.  

&amp;#x200B;

I thank you all very much. Please don't take this as me being an entitled brat. I want the best for me and my parents."

Through a recent internship at a software company, I realized that I love programming. I worked at the company for a few months, but did not want to work there full time after graduation. 

Since I stopped working at that company, I've been using my free time to learn programming. I started off with some free resources but recently bought a Java course on Udemy and am loving it. I am doing some traveling this summer, after I graduate, so the earliest I would be able to start working full time is August.

I plan to get my Oracle Java Certification after completing my course on Udemy and studying for a while. I am thinking about doing a 3 month coding boot camp from September to December. The boot camp will be about $9,000. I money saved up so I can pay it, debt free. No matter if I do the boot camp or not I will become a software engineer. I just need advice on how to get there.

One of things I'm most worried about is even getting a chance for an interview to prove I actually know how to code. I am a STEM major, which is better than nothing but I feel like a lot of resumes aren't even looked at if they aren't from a CS major. What changes should I make to my resume/cover letter? I guess I am just asking for advice on my whole situation. Should I do the boot camp or stay self-taught? What are some good resources to use besides Udemy? What do you guys think? I just feel like the biggest issue for me will be getting my foot in the door. This is why I want to do a boot camp because they do weekly mock interviews, help you with your resume, and help you network to find jobs. 

Any advice is helpful."

Now my main issue with this is the fact that I will not be earning any money over the summer, so I will have some issues the year after with paying for my tuition and transportation. So this is a very serious decision for me. As such I want to make sure I am making the right decision prioritizing the acquiring of valuable skills over immediate financial gain.

So below I've listed some of my questions:

1. Is this feasible for someone with no knowledge in these fields? 
   1. in terms of the time, 2 months is all I got.
2. Is it a good idea? i.e. are these certifications worth it? 
   1. My short term goal is to get a paid internship in cybersecurity
3. Are there any discounts for students? 
   1. Found [this](https://academic-store.comptia.org/Certification-Vouchers/c/11332?facetValueFilter=tenant~user-type:individual&amp;) regarding student discount but it seems to be limited to the US (I'm Canadian :'()
4. What resources would you recommend for these? 
   1. I have already done research just want to gather additional info
5. A cybersecurity internship (analyzing phishing emails and antivirus reports) vs taking the summer off to study. What would be better?
6. Do any Canadian professionals haven any tips for someone looking for a cybersecurity internship?
   1. Specifically the GTA Region
7. Any other advice for myself?

eyge1i,0,2020-02-03,Do you think the future of Computer Careers will largely happen in VR?,jppdan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eyge1i/do_you_think_the_future_of_computer_careers_will/,"Computer science student here, so a lot of you veterans might think this is a crazy/naiive idea. Of course, I realize there are some major obstacles that prevent CS work from comparatively being as productive in VR. Still, I am interested in fostering some discussion on this issue.

Today, as a intern software engineer, it's not uncommon for me to have two screens up, with multiple windows in each, and a big paper notebook in front of me. A critical part of my job involves juggling information and keeping this information organized. I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that generally, having 2 (or even maybe 3) monitors is a pretty big boost to productivity.

So, based on this initial premise, I believe that the future of CS and many other computationally focused career fields will see an increasing number of employees opting to work in VR versus a traditional monitor/PC setup.

1. In VR, there are far less limitations to the number of windows and monitors you can have in front of you. On a traditional PC/monitor setup, you can only really juggle 2 x the number of displays you have. There have actually been times where I wish I had a bit more screen real estate, when I'm cross-comparing plots or tracing way back into my code.
2. Being in a cubicle really, really sucks. Wouldn't it be nice to do all of your work in the peaceful zen of a cow pasture, or sitting by a river? In virtual reality, you can literally be wherever you want. If you think that being in a different setting will help you focus better than a boring cubicle, nothing stops you in VR.
3. Face to face collaboration is possible in VR, and with much more depth and expression than are typically available in video/phone calls. In VR, you can have meetings with multiple people, and with hand tracking you can draw diagrams/enunciate your thoughts with gestures/direct your attention to a specific person. In VR, digital workplace collaboration can be more expressive and productive than ever.

Of course, it's important to observe the limitations of VR if we are having this discussion.

1. The highest resolution VR headsets are not really capable of replacing your monitor when it comes to tasks like reading small print. I've personally never used one of the 8K headsets, or a valve index, so maybe someone who has can chime in. I don't think the resolution is good enough yet to promote a eye-strain-avoiding software development environment
2. There is definitely a bandwidth issue, since you can't really use a keyboard in VR. I like the idea of full-hand-tracking, and maybe some enterprising young lad will invent a new method of high-bandwidth input into VR. I also think that the new headsets with cameras could make it possible to have a video stream of your keyboard fed into VR, however this could also be very hard to use.
3. I'm curious what the psychological side effects of long-term VR exposure are, and if we expect people to work 40+ hour work weeks in a totally virtual environment it's important that the medical implications of this are considered.

While these limitations may prevent a VR workforce from burgeoning today, I think most of these issues are technical and will be solved relatively soon. I sort of see Virtual Desktop as the nascent precursor to what could be an exciting new frontier in productivity-minded UI design.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, if you think I am missing something blatantly obvious please let your voice be heard :)"
eygq3a,0,2020-02-03,Advice on which internship to accept,veggievoid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eygq3a/advice_on_which_internship_to_accept/,"I'm graduating in the next few months, and have been offered a summer internship after graduation at two different companies. I already have two internships under my belt, one as a student web dev and another as an app dev (currently working here until graduation).

The two companies are somewhat on the opposite sides of the spectrum, one is your traditional big business that's been around for awhile and typically hires a lot of students as interns once they graduate, or within their junior/senior years. The fulltime hire rate of interns is around 70-75%, according to HR. Job pays well, great benefits, all that. 

The other is a not small, but smaller company, with a ""rad"" kind of attitude. Open office, games, events, their own podcast, natural lighting with windows everywhere, and everybody is a part of the ""family."" That kind of scene (talked to my current manager who knows somewhat about them, he described them as trying to do ""the Google thing""). I've been reading up on jobs like this though and am somewhat leery. It pays well, and great benefits again, but from what I've read, jobs like this are a ploy to lure in people into toxic work environments. They call you ""family"" to pressure you into working harder for less than what other companies would pay you, the ""newage"" open office only benefitting managers that can keep their eyes on you, the games and events that no one play because they'd feel guilty looking like slackers to everyone else.

Basically, I'm torn between the two because they both seem like good companies to work for, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't find the openness of the second company somewhat appealing to the typical office environment. But I have one shot after graduation to find fulltime employment from an internship, and I'd rather not blow it. Any advice?"

Currently considering joining a bootcamp, more specifically App Academy. I come from a non-tech business background. And I had a few friends who have had great experiences with coding bootcamps in general. I have also had some that were not so lucky and when back to their old jobs while they've been passively applying for months now (which scare me, tbh!). There's also the self-learning path that I've heard some folks do well in, but I definitely think I may need the structure and accountability that the bootcamp will provide.  
  
I definitely know those that go above and beyond are more likely to get a job it seems, and that junior dev roles are tough to get in a saturated market, but would love your insights in the job hunt! 
 
Would love to be prepared before I make the plunge!  

* What are the biggest pain points with finding a job for you rn?  

* Are you applying for internships, full-time jobs, or both?  

* What phase in the job hunting process is the most difficult?

Before starting to send out applications, I was looking to get your opinions on the current state of my resume. I would appreciate it if you guys took a quick look!

The main questions I have about it:

\- Should it contain a short summary section?

\- It's currently 2 pages, which I am aware is too much for a new graduate. I'm not sure what to remove to condense it down to 1 page. 

\- My embedded systems experience lies in personal projects and extracurriculars. Both my internships were in C++ and 3D mathematics. I'm thinking I should maybe cut down on the descriptions of both the internships, but I also think it could be relevant to have good development on the things I've done in a company environment...

\- My final GPA is 3.2/4.0. Should I put it in my resume, or is it too low?

\- What would be your general critiques and suggestions?

Thank very much for your help!

I'm really passionate about marketing, but I really don't want to go through the undergrad BA route, and Cornell's approach to Communication really speaks to me. Here are The Stats:

* **Demographic:** White, middle class male
* **High School Stats:**
   * 4.73 (uw) GPA, 3.96 (w) GPA
   * **Awards**: Salutatorian, Honor Guard (T20 in graduating class of \~500 for GPA), First Team All League Volleyball Player, Boy's Volleyball Offensive Player of the Year, AP Scholar with Honor, AP Scholar with Distinction;
   * **EC's:** Worked at frozen yogurt store, worked at other food service restaurant, Varsity Boy's Volleyball, Assistant volleyball coach, volunteered at local elementary school (\~500 service hours in HS)
   * **Coursework:** AP World History (5), AP US History (5) AP Environmental Science (5) AP English Lang (4) AP US Gov and Politics (5) AP Calculus AB (4) AP Calculus BC (3) AP English Lit (3) Art History Class at CC (A+)
* **SAT:** 1440 - (750 Reading, 690 Math)
* **College Coursework:** Differential and Integral Calculus (A), Anthropology - Culture and Communication (A+), Intro to Philosophy of Mind (B+); **Current Coursework:** Calc - Integration and Infinite Series, History - Intro to Western Civilization, Macroeconomics: All expected A's
* **College GPA:** 3.767  (Dean's List)
* **College EC's:**
   * Job at Rec center as a marketing assistant, done pretty well, also leading an interview campaign type dealio currently, (not sure if worth mentioning at all but I created the highest performing post for the IG page) - really want to emphasize that I'm not trying to flex that to you guys lol
   * Marketing intern for a band in LA, (\~800k on Spotify), really love their music and have been a fan for awhile, reached out to them in a cold call fashion, ended up working out in my favor
   * Floor government community rep for residence hall
   * Played intramural volleyball and futsal
   * Volunteered for UCLA Volunteer day
* **Current Essay Ideas:** Developing how to share my voice amidst severe diagnosed social anxiety and what it has taught me, and how Cornell's unique take on Communication could help me with that. Also, a lot of kids here are really solely focused on stats and resume boosters, not actual learning/passion, fortunately I've already found mine so I kinda feel out of place... not very developed ideas clearly but I'm planning on working on them more once midterm szn is over
* Edit: **LOR's:**
   * History Prof: Yale undergrad + Stanford grad alum, pretty cool prof
   * Boss at Rec, have a good relationship
   * Band member (UCLA Alum)

Overall, I haven't really been challenged by courses here. I barely go to class and basically just play the system which I hate. I want to learn things that are actually interesting to me and be surrounded by people that feel the same. Also marketing opportunities are really limited here, I literally had to cold call for one of them; I feel like I've reached a ceiling for it. I believe Cornell could really enhance my college experience but I know transferring is always a crapshoot. Any advice you could offer is greatly appreciated, thanks!"

I'm in a situation where my future is in question.  I need some people to post comments below, maybe start a discussion.  I'll give you my background first and then my questions and concerns.

I'm halfway done with my CS degree and I decided that I am interested in software development or data science.  I'm not sure exactly which yet.  Man, things are coming up quick and I need advice for my next steps in the journey to start a career in CS.  As a 17 year old, I have to go to my parents and beg for something like a coding bootcamp; which I think would be the best option at this point.  **I've found that the classes in college are insufficient for knowing how to code for a job.** and that makes me a little worried.

So, should I go to a coding bootcamp in the summer?  I know they equip people with skills necessary for such a job and I want a job quickly.

Any differences between General Assembly and Flatiron?

I don't know if I should go the data science route or the software development route any help on deciding?

EDIT - it feels like I chose the wrong major.  I could have chosen Business or something, but there's no turning back now.  I can still switch to Cybersecurity with minimal damage though.

It also feels like idk how to code.  thats also worrisome.  I'm trying to find internships as quick as possible so that I can get employed full time and everything.

I'm INTP if that changes anything you give advice to me about."

eyjtck,1,2020-02-03,I want to make the most of this opportunity I've been given to get into IT... but I'm not sure what the right move is.,Rumcake256,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/eyjtck/i_want_to_make_the_most_of_this_opportunity_ive/,"To summarize, I went straight to work in customer service after high school. I got a few college credits during high school and didn't do any college afterwards. After 6 years working there, we were all laid off, and we were given access to TAA, a program that will pay for your schooling into a new field. I'm also getting unemployment right now, thankfully, but of course that's not going to last forever. I've always wanted to get into IT because I like technology and learning new things, but I've run into a few concerns.

The first is that TAA will only cover 2 years of education, so I can get an associates degree at best. That's not really going to do much for me on its own, but I do understand that I can seek certifications myself during that time (I'd probably have to pay for them myself if they aren't included in the college courses), study other IT things, do some intern work probably, etc. The thing is that I honestly don't know what part of IT will speak to me. Security sounds interesting, but I also feel like I might like getting into programming and AI's or some crazy stuff like that. I've read a lot of information here praising experience over anything else, and an internship would definitely do that. I just worry that it still wouldn't be enough compared to having xyz certifications.

Then there's ""My Computer Career."" a school (?) that I found out about that seems like it'll help me get many certifications while dipping my toes into different fields of IT to see what speaks to me. It takes 10 months with their night classes, which I prefer because it's slower pace and time isn't TOO much of a concern right now because of the unemployment. The general consensus of these guys seems to be that it's too pricey and isn't as helpful as it seems it is, given that they just teach IT and help with a bunch of certs. However, their price isn't an issue for me because I can get TAA to pay for it. I also like the idea of being able to go there, get help with getting my certs, make connections, and get some help finding a job afterwards, but at the same time, all the stuff I've read online (mostly here and other subreddits) is really discouraging. I would actually be going to a location of theirs, btw, not anything online.

It all comes down to this, though. I can either use TAA to get an associates that I can't do much with, other than try to move up to a Bachelor's in the future, or I can go to this school (?) that claims they'll show me many things in IT while having access to tutors and would help me get a job, too. It just seems a little too good to be true or easy, I guess.

I know I'm really ignorant when it comes to this, and I'm willing to go online and work on certifications myself or look into homelabs and what not. However, I have this unique opportunity for free schooling, and I want to make sure that I'm not wasting it. Please don't roast me for not knowing anything because I'm well aware of that, and that's why I'm here to ask people who DO know these things."
eyl4q0,8,2020-02-04,Computer Engineering student wanting to become a Software Engineer,Forceskittlez,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/eyl4q0/computer_engineering_student_wanting_to_become_a/,"For context: I wanted to CODO to CS during my freshman year but a series of unfortunate events happened but I'm now a 2nd-semester sophomore CompE student. 

I discovered I really wanted to go into Software Engineering when I was doing an internship as a software engineer for a startup company during the summer. However, I've been reading countless forums saying that CompE students have a huge disadvantage vs. CompSci students, and I'm not as confident in my future anymore. I also hate all the circuits/hardware classes and only enjoy the programming classes (ECE 26400), but I just plan on grinding it out... 

I don't plan on CODOing to CS. I talked to an advisor and she said I would need to retake CS 180 during the spring semester of my junior year (since I can't take it during Fall 2020) and that would put me to graduating in about 5.5 years rather than graduating in 4 years for Computer Engineering. It's too late and I can't bring myself to burdening my parents to pay an extra year of out-of-state tuition. 

So what can I do to make myself competitive for a Software Engineering position? I'm looking into the Computer Engineering Selectives and I already plan on taking ECE 30862 (OOP in C++ and Java) and ECE 46100 (Software Engineering). Is there anything else on the list that I could take? I definitely want to avoid ANY HARDWARE classes as well. Also any advice I can get? Can Computer Engineering students really get software engineering jobs? I know I should've done CS and it's something I regret to this day... I really wish my future holds up..."

Enrolled in a renowned research university, studying psychology, both parents alive and together, raised in a middle class family, loving boyfriend, in therapy, and off antidepressants and mood stabilizers after years of being on them. 

Despite all that, I can’t help but feel I will always be a failure in some way. 

Overweight, terrible acne, diagnosed severe recurrent major depressive disorder, diagnosed severe generalized anxiety disorder, history of disordered eating and exercise addiction so bad I had to go to physical therapy because the backs of my kneecaps were jagged from constant damage, struggling to find any sort of work, no car, got raped by someone I trusted a few years ago, self esteem nonexistent, and if my parents found out about half the things I’ve done, or my current relationship with an older man (who loves me very much) they’d probably disown me. They’ve always been hard on me, borderline emotionally abusive and manipulative. I know my mom secretly resents me because her pregnancy ended her military career. They refer to me as “an investment” and according to them, the investment is not doing well. 

I want to apply to graduate school, either for a PhD in clinical psychology or cognitive psychology, or a master’s in counseling and rehabilitation. I’d like to help other people in the ways I’ve been helped, given that I can be mentally healthy and stable enough to successfully provide treatment. 

But what’s the point? I couldn’t get in even if I tried. There will always be other people smarter than me, better grades, more internships, more research experience, better recommendations, I’m already behind in many ways and have academic probation on my record. 

I used to want to go into biology, because I’ve always loved science and the natural world ever since I was a little girl. Proved I was too stupid for that. Used to want to go to medical school, because I excelled in my anatomy and physiology classes and loved each second of it. Too dumb and I’d probably fuck up and accidentally kill someone. Used to want to join the military, until medical problems and a stint in a psych hospital kept me from doing that. 

I’m inferior to my peers, I’m a burden to my family (as said by my own mother), I’m in debt from medical bills and student loans, I’m just a hopeless fuck up. My boyfriend deserves someone better than me. My family deserves to be released from me. My death would free up resources for my sister. My therapist and psychiatrist wouldn’t have to hear me weep and moan anymore, and they could help people that can actually be fixed. 

That being said, I will continue to work hard and try my best until my birthday in late June. If I haven’t made progress, or if things get worse, I will do myself and everyone a favor by doing what my mother should have done when those lines popped up on the pregnancy test. I will terminate myself. 

I have a method, access to that method, and a deadline of a little over 5 months. And why not? I hate myself more than anyone could ever know. I’m not meant for this cruel world anyway. I just want to leave."

Thanks for clicking on my post!

I'm currently a senior in high school and am wanting to major in computer science. I want to get ahead of the curve on freshman internships so I can know what to expect. My questions are:

- What would you say are the best ways to build up your resume?

- Should I work a Help desk or technical support job on campus?

- I've heard class projects are good, but not the best at career fairs because it'll be hard to stand out (since everyone else in your class will have similar projects). Is this true? Should I add those?

I have a tough decision to make and I wanted to see what you all think.

I got a sales and marketing internship with a local tech startup in December of 2018. After about 3 months, there were some issues with funding and paychecks have been sporadic ever since. Around this time, the CEO told us that a large amount of funding was coming in so we would be back to normal soon. Throughout this time, I took on a larger role in the company and have developed a talent for selling and have generated a large increase in revenue for the company, but not even close to breaking even.

It has been almost a year and funding has not arrived. We have gotten small funding from our board here and there but, myself and the rest of the company have missed many paychecks and I am behind roughly $2,000 - $3,000.

After graduating this past December, I accepted a full-time offer but have been interviewing with other companies as well. I got a job offer for an outside/inside sales position with a similar company. Where I would only work remote (Which sounds awesome for me) and the company offers great compensation and benefits.

The question is, should I take the risk and stay at my current company that I really love in hopes that funding arrives and I take on a management position in the company, or take the new job offer and leave my company?"

I am programming since 11th grade as I had CS as a subject in high school. I used to code in C++ mainly. I know Java and a little bit of JS also. 

In my 2nd year, I started learning python from online tutorials. I did a 2-month  course of Machine Learning and its Applications at a govt. institute and build a bayesian classifier for Sentiment Analysis. This project was my first step into ML. I used R for this project. Then I practiced on some small projects which I got from online courses (simple linear regression, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors). In 5th sem, I started with Neural Nets and Deep Learning, which I dropped in between as I was not confident enough for learning more advanced stuff. 

The online courses I did are Andrew NG's course on Coursera and the University of Michigan's Specialisation in Data Science using Python.

I know the basic concepts but I don't know why I am still not confident enough to do my own project.

I am a quick learner and always willing to learn more. I am not able to decide whether I should learn the mathematical stuff first or should I focus on how to program ML models and learn using ML libraries first.

I want to have a job in M/AI field as an ML Engineer orData Scientist. Currently, I am a Data Analytics and Insights intern. My work here is leaned more towards ETL and using tools to gather the data only. We mostly use SQL for queries and tools such as Informatica/PowerBI/Tableau for visualization. Sometimes we have to go into Big Data concepts also.

But I want to do programming, which I cant do here.

In college, I took a basic Matlab course and I enjoyed it and did well in it. I wanted to switch into computer science, but I ended up finishing with a business degree to graduate as quickly as possible (parents were paying for the college against my will). I did some business internships, and if the specific field I'm going into is anything like these internships I don't think I will last much longer in business. Programming has always intrigued me due to the problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking.

I am unsure how to break into the field. I can't afford more than $10,000 in debt, plus going back to school will be tough as I would need to work in business while going to classes. I was looking into the idea of bootcamps, but I hear many people calling them scams. I also know you can self-teach, but I don't know how far that would get me in the job search.

eywyl3,2,2020-02-04,post-graduation break ?,KaterTot31,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/eywyl3/postgraduation_break/,"I am currently a college senior gratuating in spring so naturally I'm having a lot anxiety about that. I'm still not enirely sure what I want to be when I grow up but I do feel like I'm setting myself up for success. I just finished an internship with a well known company and now I'm starting a part time job in a new business venture of thiers that would likely turn full time after I graduate. I also have a possible internship oppertunity with a different company that could also potentially lead into a full time post grad position. So all things told, I feel like I'm doing all the right things that will set me up for a career post-grad.

However, I don't want to rush into career life straight out of college. I would really like to take a month after graduation to take a trip on my own. I want to take this trip to kind of chill out after having worked super hard in school and before getting into the full swing of my career. Also, I want to do it solo since I've never really done much on my own (I've always had roommates, travelled with others, etc.) and I almost want to prove to myself that I can do it. I have enough money saved up to cover the cost of the trip, so I'm not worried about that. I'm worried that if I take a month off I would be throwing away all the work I'm currently doing to put myself in a good position career-wise. It seems unlikly that the part-time job I have with the first company will let me take a month of vacation within the first 6 months of working there. As for the potential internship with the other company, it's hard to say for certain if it would even turn into a full time job after I graduate or if I would be in a position to negotiate the start date of that if it did. 

In short, is it crazy of me to take a month off right after graduating after having put in this work to set up these oppertunities? Is it at all resonable for me to expect either of these jobs to let me take essentially a gap month? I could potentially quit both positions and then worry about finding a completely new job once I get back, but then I'm essentially starting back at square one without any kind of saftey net."

I have also started learning to program in Python with Automate the Boring stuff with Python.

I'd like to finally move out but currently and since I have graduated I really can't get any calls back from anywhere. I went to a staffing agency last July and they told me that they would have a real hard time finding anything for me and that I should look elsewhere. My last job interview was for some door-to-door sales job, and the interviewer told me that ""I am young and I need to know what I want to do with my life,"" and that ""this job is for people who will stay here for a number of years"". I took it as a big sign that the job wasn't going to be very promising.

&amp;#x200B;

As time has gone on I have looked lower and lower for any job that I could seem to stand and my standards have gotten lower and lower. I applied to grocery stores a few weeks ago to get SOMETHING and haven't heard back from any of them. I just feel depressed from becoming the stereotypical loser who lives with his parents. I have a girlfriend and she has supported me through dating but both of us want to move out, but me not having a job is stunting that idea.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I be doing? What should  I be looking for? I don't know what to do with my life and it's like I went to school for nothing. I feel that I don't see what I should be doing right now to get my life back on track, because pretty much after graduating college it's been going steadily downhill."

I'm applying for the 2020 OMSCS and was wondering if any of you would be willing to give me some constructive criticism on my background and statement of purpose c: Thank you so much in advance!

Background:

I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from \[REDACTED\] in September of 2019 with a 3.89/4.00 GPA. I excelled in all of my Computer Science courses and focused on abstract mathematics and biochemistry when selecting electives to help expand my interest in Artificial Intelligence with Health Science applications.

From 2016-2019, I held a co-op position with \[REDACTED\]-- a company that designed web applications for the State of Michigan government. I worked as a full-stack developer, which taught me valuable skills in working with frameworks, front, and back-end languages and database systems. I excelled quickly and, by the end of my first year, was tasked with onboarding and managing all new interns. Furthermore, in 2018, I fully designed and implemented the database structure for one of our major government applications.

My Senior Thesis project focused on creating a product for my co-op employer to market and sell. Using a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with embedded software and various web frameworks, I produced a system that could reliably track and identify device presence on a network device and output statistics and predictions to the end-user. 

Currently, I am employed full-time as a software developer in the field of algorithmic traffic prediction software with a focus on algorithm design. Part of my job requires reading and analyzing code used by our internal neural networks, as well as analyzing their outputs. Furthermore, I also do independent contracting work for \[REDACTED\], where I serve as a cryptographer and computer network analyst. 

Through the Georgia Tech Masters of Computer Science program, I seek to further my understanding of Artificial Intelligence and how software communicates with end-users, especially in the field of medicine. I believe my background, as well as my drive to learn and succeed, will make me a competent and hardworking industry researcher in the field of Interactive Intelligence. 

Statement of Purpose:

After completing a Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, my goal is to become a prolific industry researcher in the field of Interactive Intelligence. I would love to work in a field where my research and development provides a tangible benefit to society, especially if significant strides could offer affordable healthcare services and mitigate damage from human error in diagnosis and disease tracking.

Once I graduate, my immediate goal is to find a career at a firm that is actively developing AI for healthcare applications or one that plans on creating such software as part of a research team. I hope that my expertise in AI and how it interfaces with users will aid in creating a product that is ethical, secure, and accessible to millions of patients across the country.

I have always been fascinated with Artificial Intelligence, both in application and ethics. Its potential in the field of healthcare is undeniable-- a capable AI could theoretically diagnose patients, prescribe medications, and even offer therapy with a much higher rate of success and accuracy than its human counterparts. It seems many corporations share this view, with Microsoft launching a multimillion-dollar program to create software that could one day revolutionize the healthcare industry.  

The Georgia Tech OMSCS program specifically interests me due to the availability of courses regarding how Artificial Intelligence interacts with society. For example, the Educational Technology course will give me a strong background to later help develop software that tailors courses and learning objectives towards students with learning disabilities or speech impediments. The online format would perfectly suit my busy schedule, and the strong focus on self-study and self-motivation is a perfect environment for me to learn and excel."

eyzra7,479,2020-02-04,Internet Incompetence,TLFScarheart,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/eyzra7/internet_incompetence/,"I'm not sure this counts, because I've never worked in tech, so let me know if there's a better place to post this.

I don't think I ever could work in tech. I've seen real tech peeps do things with computers that look like magic to me. That being said, I was born in the early 90's. This means I've watched the evolution of the internet happen before me. I also used to make stop motion videos, so I also know how to do minor work with sound and video editing.

After I graduated high school, I decided to take some classes at a local community college. One of the things I took on was an American Sign Language course. There were only 18 students in the course and half of the classes were taught by the same teacher. We'll call her Mrs. Sign. Now Mrs. Sign was probably in her 50's or 60's and the rest of the class in their 30's and 40's, other than me who was fresh out of high school. So I quickly got established as the youngster who could handle technology issues.

Turns out this was a blessing for Mrs. Sign who hadn't really kept up with technology and would often make minor mistakes that caused issues when she tried to teach using something from the computer. She'd then spend a few minutes at the computer trying to resolve it before I'd offer to help. Luckily, she was a kind woman and openly thankful for my assistance.

This continued for most of the two-year course. Then, maybe two weeks before it ended, two things happened.

The first was during some free time, Mrs. Sign mentioned that she got the audio we signed to by taking videos of herself talking and then extracting the audio from it. This struck me as odd. This woman was no computer genius, yet she knew how to do that? And anyway, why didn't she just record her voice? I don't remember if I said anything at the time, but I do remember making a mental note to look into this. I might know how to make her job easier. I imagine she'd like that.

The second happened about an hour later when class was back in session. Mrs. Sign was going to show us something on Youtube and the video began to glitch. She asked me what to do and I told her to try clicking the refresh button. Mrs. Sign replied, ""Which button is the refresh button?""

My jaw was on the floor! The jaws of the rest of my classmates weren't might higher. This was 2012! She often used Youtube videos and news sites for her classes. How could she not know what the refresh button was???

I composed myself and helped her find it. The video worked afterward, she appreciated my help, no harm no foul. But it was at this point that I realized, I needed to do more than just troubleshoot minor mistakes. After class that day I went up to Mrs. Sign privately and asked if we could meet after school sometime so I could help her set up some free recording software, and show her how to use it, as well as answer any computer-based questions she had before I graduated her class. Thankfully, this woman wasn't above letting her student teach her something she was struggling with. We set up a time to meet.

Before arriving there, I went out and bought her a microphone from Walmart. It wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out she didn't have one.

We met in her office and after a crash course on the ins and outs of the internet, I set her up with Audacity and gave her the microphone and showed her how to use them both. She offered to pay me back for the mic, but, honestly, I hadn't gotten her anything fancy. Besides she had pulled a few strings and had gotten me an internship in education, as she knew I was going into that next. So I felt she and I were even.

Fast forward a year later, and I'm at the campus for some business and pop into her office to say hi. She is all smiles as she tells me how much things have improved since I showed her how to record her voice and she now has much fewer issues with the internet.

""Every time I record something for the class to sign, I think about how you made that all possible! I really appreciate what you did for me!""

Here's hoping those of you who actually are in tech support have more warm fuzzy stories like these.

TL;DR Teacher doesn't know how to internet or record herself in 2012. Youngster saves the day. Happiness follows."

Will an internship in a good CS company in Japan help to get a good job or PhD in USA/Canada?

&amp;#x200B;

Hello guys,

I have just completed my final semester of Bsc on CS in Bangladesh and have no internship or job experience. For winning a hackathon held by a Japanese company, I am offered an internship in a well-known Japanese company and they seem to be very interested in me for my dedication to coding. I will be sitting with them this Sunday to discuss the details about the internship.

First of all, I should make myself clear about what I really want for my career. **All I want is to go to the USA or Canada.** Either by a job or being an MS or PhD student. For this reason, I was getting myself prepared for GRE and will be applying for a PhD scholarship in CS in Fall 2021 (before I found this offer).

I have known that for Bangladeshis, it is hard to get a job in the USA and then apply for VISA. This is the reason I was planning for a PhD.

My specific question is, will this internship in Japan help me in any way to get a better Job/PhD in US/Canada? Is it be good for me to invest my time in this internship so in future, this internship will help me to be highlighted by my CV. 

Also, the company I was offered from has a branch in Silicon Valley. So is there any chance of me that for my high performance, they might accept my request to apply on the California branch for job? (as I dont have any professional experience, this might be a dumb or obvious question)

Sorry for the long read."
ez018j,8,2020-02-04,I am 29 with a very scattered resume and don't know where to go next. How can I be more focused in my 30s?,smallcoconut,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ez018j/i_am_29_with_a_very_scattered_resume_and_dont/," Hi everyone, 

I’ve struggled with some issues with my career for my entire life. Even in college, I struggled to commit to a major (I studied Media Art and minored in Theater/English). After I graduated, I didn’t know what I wanted to pursue full time, and worked a slew of odd jobs (an actor at a Renaissance Faire, at a bar, an internship at an online cooking school, a nanny, etc). I love to write and throughout all of these careers I was trying to build up my repertoire as a freelance writer, which I did. 

At 25, my main freelance client dropped me, and I took a job in TV/FIlm (it fell into my lap and I had always considered it as a career path, as I once wanted to be a TV writer). After that gig ended, I was offered a full-time job in content management and media w/ a former client and worked there for two years. Last June, they ended up letting go of my entire department, and I was unemployed. After job searching for 4 months, I was offered a gig in TV again, and took the opportunity because I had always considered jumping back in and \*really\* trying to be a TV writer. That’s where I am now and my contract ends in April. I’m also continuing to freelance write, and have a small handful of clients. The money is a nice addition to my measly TV hourly rate, but it wouldn’t be enough to be my only income by any means. 

Essentially, I’ve been on two different career paths: one in writing/content management, and one in TV and film. I sort of wish I hadn’t taken this job—it will be a huge gap in my resume and I don’t know if I actually want to deal with the long hours and crazy hustle forever, especially since there’s no guarantee I’ll actually “make it” in the entertainment industry. Most of the people I work with “LOVE THE BIZ” … and I don’t know if that’s me. 

I turn 30 this year and I’m so mad at myself for not picking and committing to a certain path but it’s been so hard for me to stay focused on one thing. I lack focus and discipline, but I work really, really hard. I’ve written plays, all of which have done okay but no crazy success.  I’ve applied for jobs in media/editorial but have barely gotten interviews. I started creative side projects, like blogs and websites, and then eventually lose steam. 

To make matters worse,  I’m experiencing jealousy over my friends who seem to have their lives together. Since they’ve been more focused than I have, they’re advancing further in their careers, making more money, and generally seem more successful. 

I wish I could narrow down and find some sot of direction, but it’s always been so hard for me to pick a path and stick to it. I know I love to write, and I’m good at writing, but I’m not sure where that will take me. I also love writing about relationships/love/sex, and have recently had a lot of success in that area… so I want to maybe continue with that, but I’m not sure how. I’m in therapy, but that only does so much.

I guess there are two questions here. **One, what can I do for myself to find what it is I want to do w/ my career, and Two, how do I become more focused? I struggled with these same things at 24 and I don’t want to do it again in another 5 years.** 

Thank you so much for reading! "

If my sisters being Yale and Princeton alums mean anything, then legacy?

**Intended Major:** Materials Science

**SAT:** 1600 superscore / 1580 single score, essay being 8/8/7

**UW/W GPA:** 3.5 UW/3.9 W - school doesn't do class rank

**Coursework:** AP Calc BC, AP Physics C, AP Chem, post-AP Computer Science, and APUSH. I skipped a  level in my language class, which is rare.

**Awards:** Semifinals for CyberPatriot, USACO Gold

**Extracurriculars:**

Heavily involved in school clubs - president of the GSA, the BSU, and the HAM radio club, a member of the school's honor council, as well as the founder of the school's Tetris team.\*GSA:\*Lead a good number of school functions and activities that helped educate the student population on issues in the LGBTQ+ community. Headed donation drives and fundraisers that gave to underprivileged LGBTQ+ folks in the D.C. Metro Area.

\*BSU:\*Helped expand upon a preexisting mentorship program, worked on outreach programs to get more black kids into science (especially due to the disproportionately low acceptance rate for black students at my school), and addressed the administration's unfair actions against a particular black student earlier this year, which turned out well for us.

\*Honor Council:\*Was on the honor council (which is just a board of students who respond to instances of cheating and work to remedy trust issues between student and teacher) in freshman year, but I'm probably going to drop it due to a cramped schedule.

\*Amateur Radio Club:\*I currently have a General license and am shooting for the highest class later this month. I was responsible for the reconstruction of the school's radio station after renovations, and have volunteered at multiple outside events (primarily marathons) to get practice with this skill. Through events like these, I was able to network and get the club in contact with numerous people who've come in and helped the club grow.

\*Tetris Club:\*I created this as a sort of space to not just have fun, but also analyze some of the strategy behind Tetris, which has become an e-sport with a growing fanbase. I've organized trips to compete at local tournaments, and the school recognizes us as a sport.

\*Internship:\*Was fortunate enough to spend a summer as an intern in the computational materials science department (also through networking at HAM events) at a local but somewhat well-known university. Learned a LOT about the field and was able to contribute to research which is awaiting publication. I got my name on it, too :)

\*Wrestling:\*Wrestled this year and last, and am currently the varsity wrestler for my weight class. Don't know if I'll continue senior year due to an injury I sustained, but yeah. Even though I was varsity, I was one of the worst.

\*\*Essays/LORs/Background:\*\*I grew up in a very abusive household and was the victim of heavy physical abuse up until two years ago. Even though the damage still exists with me today, I've been able to work past it. Perhaps I'll shape my essays around the effects of the damage, but I feel as though that's a bit cliche and not that valuable. In terms of letters of recommendation, I don't really have any close relationships with my teachers, probably due to the fact that I don't do well in their classes. Luckily for me, personal essays are my strong suit. I hope.

I also am the sole brother of a large family (just under 10 people total), and an awkwardly-placed one. Over the past few years, I've been responsible for watching my siblings, sometimes for days on end, and it's taken a toll on my grades. I understand the content, it's just that I don't have nearly enough time to study all of it and I definitely don't have the pleasure of preparing for tests often. On top of that, I live pretty far away from the school (my bus ride is 1.5 hours, but can sometimes go all the way up to 2), and I get home from 5:30 to 6.

Just to finish it up though, I've been stressed beyond my wits for the past few years trying to prepare for college and juggle my home life. I primarily use my extracurriculars as a means of getting rid of all the excess stress, but it hasn't been enough. I'm really worried about my GPA and how that would negatively affect my chances at admission - especially given how everyone at our school is so competitive and close as hell in terms of GPA (most of my friends have above a 3.7 unweighted). I'm trying to see how I can use my extracurriculars in order to help recoup some of the lost ground, but it's probably not going to be enough. The schools don't care that much, from what I've seen.

**Colleges:** Other than the ones mentioned in the title, I'm also looking at UCLA, UMich, and Carnegie-Mellon.

Sorry to just throw all of my shit out there, but I just want there to be a little context to what I'm putting. I'd greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions!"

And I wanna END IT ALL IN A FEW DAYS.

I am a 3D/CGI/VFX artist who graduated in November 2018 currently based and live in New Zealand. I studied this field because I loved it since I was a kid and I thought to make a career out of this. As someone who is SE Asian and grew up in an SE Asian household, my parents were very critical about my career choice but they did not want to force me because it takes away a persons freedom if they do that but does not change the fact that they were still critical. I wanted to prove them wrong by doing this and working super hard on it with many fails and successes. Keep in mind my parents are the loveliest people you can meet and they are the greatest and toughest people I have ever known. The dumb and crazy shit I and my other siblings put them through for so many years and they still love us unconditionally no matter what. I aim to be that great of a person and parent one day.

Now I'm starting to think they're right. This field is very limited. I don't know how the fuck my peers got jobs in the industry from almost immediately or within 6 months. Most VFX studios want experienced people in their recruitment. I think it is my fault to because I did not take any internship programs during school breaks. I didn't because my skills were still lacking and I was working hard to improve on it in the break times. I had positive thinking back then that I would improve my work so I won't screw up or slow anything down. 

After graduating My plan was if I don't get in to a job in the industry, I will just work odd jobs or any job not related to my qualifications. So I started applying to studios and other companies not related to my field. Reality hit me there, I have more ghosts than rejection replies. Maybe because I don't have enough work experience? is that it? even though their job listings were okay with no experience?

I had my first real job when I was 20 years old (to some people a bit late for my age) it was simple warehouse job picking and packing mobile phone accessories. I was a casual there. I was there for I think a month and then I had to do ""Jury Duty"". Okay side note: FUCK JURY DUTY/SERVICES!!! IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!! Because of this stupid bullshit that I lost my job and they never called me back after that! What's worse is I endured this shit and the trials never happened so I waited for 4 hours in the waiting lobby with other like minded who clearly don't want to be there. We did this for 2 days and they let us go on the 2nd day because the trials were cancelled. After that I never got a call from my first job. Who ever sent me that Jury summon letter, FUCK YOU TO OBLIVION

I got lucky my 2nd job was I got contacted by a local studio through my Linkedin that they need someone to help with a hero character in a commercial. MY face and night lit up when I first got this message and didn't' hesitate to accept it. Even my parents were happy about this even though it just freelance work.. About a month after I applied for more since my work ended. And no surprise more ghosting, and uncertain projects starting from other studios who kind of considered me. OH maybe I will go back to the other plan find other jobs. And then ghosting and rejections from that too.

The shame that I am feeling right now is so great. I am almost a 25 yr old guy and I never even had a real job or done anything impactful in my life. Seeing younger peers even the ones born in the new millennium area happy they have jobs and other activities. I feel embarrassed when we have family gatherings and they all talking about their days and everything. What did I achieve... I graduated, got my degree. Had a month long job. I'm still in my learner driver license since 2014? That's it? FUCK ME DEAD I don't wanna exist! Erased!

Whats worse is we can't afford our house anymore because of my unemployment. To add insult to injury my family is almost falling apart and I am afraid I am afraid I am responsible for half of this mess the other half is the stupid decision the fiance and my older sibling that caused a further crack to our family. I love my parents, younger sibling and older sibling and any other relative who loved me to death I would take a bullet for any of them and I would kill anyone if they tried to cause any violence, harm to them. They are the ones who are keeping me from ending myself. If I did not have anyone I would've ended it long ago. I wanna end it all if the insult to injury happens. Then again I have thoughts about how selfish it is for me to end myself and how selfish the act is as well.I would just create a whole other problem or bigger. I would cause sadness, pain and despair to a large amount of people. I am still considering ending it in a few days. I still have time. I may not be here anymore to some of you who will read this and reply.

Oh you know what I wish it was a reality where you can actually donate your own life to someone who actually wants to live. Someone who are dying from battle damage, sickly, cancer patients, babies who were aborted just anyone who wants to live. God bless to each and everyone one of them."
ez3f2g,1,2020-02-04,Take offer and renege or decline early?,syrioa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ez3f2g/take_offer_and_renege_or_decline_early/,"Hi all,

I have two internship offers this summer - one for a smaller government contractor in Maryland, and another cybersecurity company in Plano, Texas. I would highly prefer the company in Plano, however... 

I received the Maryland offer 2 weeks ago, and I was able to extend the offer by 1 week, so the deadline to accept is this Friday. The other Plano company got back to me on Monday with a verbal offer and a email confirmation of the offer, but not the written offer yet. The problem is, the Plano company said that it could take a while for the written offer to come with no exact date, but definitely beyond my Friday deadline for the Maryland company. I’m afraid if I decline the Maryland offer now, the Plano company might “forget” or “ghost” me (have read too many horror stories about this situation), leaving me with no internship for the summer.

So, should I take the Maryland company and renege (they’re a smaller company and I would feel horrible), or decline and wait for the Plano offer? What are the odds they never come through with the written offer?"

This is my first time posting on Reddit, and I'm extremely appreciative of any constructive feedback and useful advice I receive! 

I'm a 30 year old female living in a mid sized city in the U.S. that has exploded in popularity in the last 5 years.  I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration at the age of 27, and I also have an Associate of Art Degree in Liberal Arts. Prior to attending college I worked in the service industry; admittedly, I was both naive and not very ""career minded"" in my early 20's.  Although I've always been naturally well spoken, charismatic and reasonably intelligent, I failed to understand how to really plan for my life and career based on my interests and desires. Because of this, I wound up studying Business Administration at the University level simply because it seemed like a decent and marketable degree to get. Rather than doing any internships, I focused solely on getting straight A's. It's worth noting that I learned a lot in my degree program and I felt genuinely interested in much of what I studied. Leaning more toward the creative side, I'm intrigued by people, sustainability, entrepreneurship and communication. I'm far less interested in accounting, financial modeling and statistics, although statistics when concerning subjects I'm interested in are fine ;). 

I live a bit of an eccentric lifestyle, although I don't want to be lumped into the millennial category of being lazy and self centered. I'm not super money motivated or into fancy things, but I enjoy travel, having a savings account, and generally speaking, not being poor! I do a lot of yoga and spend time outside trying to stay active and physically/mentally healthy. I'm a spiritual person who spends a lot of my time thinking about and talking about the meaning of life, and what it means to live a life fulfilled. 

Suffice it to say that upon graduation I was not in a good place mentally. I also had some unexpected medical problems surface that took me out for a few months at a time. I committed to getting my real estate license in hopes of beginning a dynamic career that wouldn't require me to sit at a desk, M-F. Without going into too much boring detail, my job in real estate was a bad cultural fit for me. Although I communicated with clients well, made a couple of deals and ultimately was told by my boss that I was ""truly unique"" and ""could go far"", I quit the job and fell into a depression. I didn't like the ""rah rah"" sales, the money centric nature of the work or the grind. Please know that I realize other real estate offices may have been different. 

In need of something to do and having considered a career in teaching, I took a summer teaching assistant job in a small mountain town outside of the city I live in. I enjoyed various aspects of working in the school and getting to move around a bit throughout my day, but wasn't sure I wanted to begin my credentialing for teaching due to the low pay and the high level of burnout in the profession. After that, I went on a three-ish month grueling job search back in the newly competitive, urban city where I live permanently.  I read books like What Color is your Parachute? while trying to improve my job search efforts. No bites, and by that point, my resume was starting to look just as confused and dysfunctional as I was... During this time I began substitute teaching for the Public Charter School Network which does not require a credential. Most of the jobs are in extremely low performing, poverty stricken areas. To say that the work is grueling is an understatement. Exhausted from my job search and constant ""self reflection process"" and obsession over what the hell I'm going to do with my life, I sort of resigned myself to being a substitute teacher for a while. I needed a mental break. 

I often find myself romanticizing about other professions and wishing I had studied something different. My sister is a nurse; she is paid relatively well, she gets to move around at work and she's able to travel and take time off when she needs to. Going back to school for nursing at this point would be extremely logistically and financially challenging. I'm looking for advice on how I can best expand on what I currently have or can build without having to take out more loans and dedicate years more of my life in the immediate future to school. 

Traits that link the jobs I HAVE done in my life thus far (service industry, real estate, teaching) are that they require good communication, charisma, energy, creativeness and enjoying dynamic working environments - all of which I have and enjoy. 

Other things I've considered (and some of these are a bit ""dreamy"", but I'm throwing it all out there) are: 

\-starting a small business

\- attempting to figure out if I'd like to go to graduate school, perhaps by working in a certain profession with the intention of furthering my career

\- becoming a hairstylist.

I am currently a full-time student, I work, and am involved in a -club- so I’ve got a pretty full schedule. If I were to continue with the internship I would only have to go once a week for a couple hours, however that would either result in me losing a chance to get money from work or time to just relax/do homework/not be constantly busy and stressed etc. 

The positive thing about the internship is that I would be working on a pretty cool project that would really look good on my resume and give me some good one of a kind experience (esp. in my field and for the future), however I think it’s important to note that the beginning half of this project comprised of me working independently with very little guidance and communication (director would barely answer emails and things were slow and unclear) so I didn’t like that and I’m afraid I will be expected to do too much like last time. Like I basically began the whole project as a teenage unpaid intern lol.

Let me give some background about myself. I am a pretty new developer joining a pretty decent company full time in 2018. I graduated uni with a BS in Computer Science. This was my first job (other than internships) and my first layoff. I was a firmware engineer working very close with hardware and other electrical engineers. On a personal note I think I am taking the layoff better than others, seeing this as an opportunity for a change. 

I have been laid off due to non-performance reasons and have been given a few months of pay excluding severance. I plan to utilize this time to transition from firmware engineering to something higher in the stack. My am really fascinated with the field of data science\ machine learning but I worry I do not have the educational background (phd/masters) to be able to enter this field. Is it possible to self teach myself to get employed in this field with competitive pay? I have a very string background in python from my uni classes, I have also taken some AI classes, and the core uni undergrad level math classes (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Stats). Let me know your thoughts if this is a reachable goal.

If Data Science\ ML is out of my reach, I would like to transition into some application programming. Preferably something along the lines of cloud computing or high level system programming. 

I do feel kind of lost right now, so any of your thoughts would be appreciated. Also any learning resources or articles relating to any of these would be helpful. Thank you!"

- Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering.
- 1 year internship at a top tier tech company as a Product Development Engineer.
- Master's degree in Electronic Engineering.
- 2 years experience working at a mid-top tier software company as a Software Engineer doing a mixture of support, operations and development work.
- 1 year experience running a side business (non-tech related) as a side hussle.

As I didn't come from a strictly computer science background I've taken classes across a number of area's including hardware, software, data science, physics and obtained some experience both tech and non-tech related. I'm finding it hard to focus on one area in terms of my career. I'm currently working in software as a software engineer but I'm becoming more and more frustrated as the months go on because progression is generally slow in big corporations and the day to day tasks can become mundane after a period of time. I feel like I am no longer being challenged.

I have thought about changing jobs but from the software engineering job advertisements that I am looking at , the type of work does not seem to be significantly different from one company to another for a position that I could get with my level of experience.

I've been following this subreddit over the past couple of years on and off, and not it seems i've come to a point where i need your help.

I've been an intern in a company for a while and finally finished my education as a Data technician(not sure if it's a global term, non english native here).

Over the next 2-3 months one of my main tasks is to start documenting everything. The current IT manager who will not be staying forever has a lot of information in his head, and very little written down. I've been asked, and offered a very good reward for a newly educated person, to start working on documenting everything. 

So a little about us without to many identifying things:

1. We're a production company - not an IT house
2. We run everything on-premise, AD, File storage, VM's, Exchange, and a metric shit ton of custom made systems.
3. The goal over the next couple of years is to identify where we can reduce and consolidate many of the minor custom made systems.

I have a slight idea where to start, but my question to you lovely wizards, are there any tools that can help me put all this information down in a nice readable manner that gives a good overview, or is the answer as simple as excel/powerpoint/word?

I've already worked on documenting our AD with a tool from microsoft to show sites, trusts, OU's, DC's etc that generates a couple of visio graphs. But i don't know exactly what things should be including in a thorough documentation of the infrastructure environment. I mean, i have a bunch of ideas - but nothing concrete, and i will have the sole responsibility over the next couple of months.

Please don't hesitate to ask me to provide more info if needed - i'm excited and scared for the responsibility, and would like all the help that i can get. I know most of it comes down to myself, but i hope that you guys have some tips for me.

In advance thanks"

Most don't usually last too long.  I have discovered that most people looking for advice and encouragement in actuality want neither.  They are looking for a silver bullet. 

There is no silver bullet.  There is no one single certification that will automatically put you at the top of a recruiter's list.  There is no programming boot camp that will automatically qualify you for a job.  There is no degree that will guarantee a successful career. 

Like anything else worth having in life, Success is not only a moving target - it's hard work.  You want the woman?  Woo her daily.  You want the fastest computer?  Upgrade the computer often.  You want to get serious about a growing career?

ez9khn,1,2020-02-05,Help Desk Intern: Learning opportunities during downtime,dr4cut,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ez9khn/help_desk_intern_learning_opportunities_during/,"
Hey guys, currently doing a 4 month internship at a small company and I’ve got about 3 months to go. 

The company uses windows based systems as clients and on the back end. They don’t host anything locally and outsource many of their operations to a third-party IT company that handles most of what I had initially expected to be learning/practicing here (user on-boarding /off-boarding, LDAP troubleshooting, some server sys-admin stuff, etc.). Nonetheless I do have access to these backend systems and have made user account related modifications. 

The one issue is that I don’t get a whole lot of tickets, And some of what we do get are either pushed to the outsourced company or require access privileges that are above me. This is all fine, however I want to make the most of this experience. 

I’ve been exploring automating certain tasks in the IT department and have been having a great time with PowerShell to accomplish this so far. However I’m having a hard time finding scripting opportunities (automation opportunities in general). I’ve been told by the third-party IT team that if I have any ideas that I should run them by them but unfortunately I don’t have any as I’m inexperienced really and don’t really know what to look for. Which is, in-part, why I’m here. 

I’ve been using as much of my downtime to either script or read/learn about certain Microsoft technologies. But honestly I’m interested in learning what I’ll use in my current situation. 

I would love any suggestions for what I can do to find automation opportunities here or any additional opportunities that will help me learn the Microsoft way of things. I have tried consulting my IT manager and the third-party IT team but it doesn’t seem they have any ideas initially. I believe if I approach them with an idea they’ll know whether or not it’s a worthwhile pursuit. 

Thanks guys."

(FYI, I am just an intern so go easy on me lol)

So I have a couple users that use laptops with docking stations. If the users open the published app while docked and over Ethernet, then undock the RDP drops and windows returns ""RemoteApp disconnected. An internal error occurred"". However, if the user first starts the app over WiFi, then docks, and undocks, RDP stays connected. Just spitballing here and wondering if anyone has any ideas I may not have tried yet. I'm hoping this is a small fix I can just change on the client side for the 3-4 users I have that are experiencing this.

But if I open a typical RDP session and manually remote into a server while docked then undock, RDP attempts to reconnect and does so once it picks up the wireless. How do I force our published app to try and reconnect?

\- I've tried making firewall rules to force mstsc to open over wireless but no luck (only solution I could think of).

\- Opening our published app in notepad and adding ""autoreconnection enabled:i:1"" but all this does is corrupt the RDP file"

I'm in a data structures course that uses c++ as the language and I find it a bit tough learning this language when my chances of using it are slim in the professional world. I currently have an internship where c# is used and have not heard of any cases where it is used in businesses. I was wondering if any of you guys had a similar experience, and how you got a better grasp of the language in a non traditional way outside of classroom adn homework). The sort of things I'm looking for would be potential projects or even online courses that have projects/ problems through the course. I know there are many good videos going over topics of c++ on Youtube but I'm looking for an outlet to practice the actual code and apply it to problems/projects. Thanks so much for any suggestions!

I do not want to piss off my current boss by seeing about switching to software. He knows I am going to school for cs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm applying to the Georgia Tech Masters in Computer Science program, which, instead of one Statement of Purpose, requires a background section (education and work  experience), and a separate SOP (why do you want to do this degree?). 

I was wondering if you guys would be so kind as to give mine a read and see if there are any glaring issues/general constructive criticism you could give. Tear it apart!

&amp;#x200B;

 

Background:

I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from \[REDACTED\] in September of 2019 with a 3.89/4.00 GPA. I excelled in all of my Computer Science courses and focused on abstract mathematics and biochemistry when selecting electives to help expand my interest in Artificial Intelligence with Health Science applications.

From 2016-2019, I held an intern position with  \[REDACTED\]-- a company that designed web applications for the \[REDACTED\] government. I worked as a full-stack developer, which taught me valuable skills in working with frameworks, front, and back-end languages and database systems. I excelled quickly and, by the end of my first year, was tasked with onboarding and managing all new interns. Furthermore, in 2018, I fully designed and implemented the database structure for one of our major government applications.

My Senior Thesis project focused on creating a product for my co-op employer to market and sell. Using a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with embedded software and various web frameworks, I produced a system that could reliably track and identify device presence on a network device and output statistics and predictions to the end-user. 

Currently, I am employed full-time as a software developer in the field of algorithmic traffic prediction software with a focus on algorithm design. Part of my job requires reading and analyzing code used by our internal neural networks, as well as analyzing their outputs. Furthermore, I also do independent contracting work for  \[REDACTED\], where I serve as a cryptographer and computer network analyst. 

Through the Georgia Tech Masters of Computer Science program, I seek to further my understanding of Artificial Intelligence and how software communicates with end-users, especially in the field of medicine. I believe my background, as well as my drive to learn and succeed, will make me a competent and hardworking industry researcher in the field of Interactive Intelligence. 

Statement of Purpose:

After completing a Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, my goal is to become a prolific industry researcher in the field of Interactive Intelligence. I would love to work in a field where my research and development provides a tangible benefit to society, especially if significant strides could offer affordable healthcare services and mitigate damage from human error in diagnosis and disease tracking.

Once I graduate, my immediate goal is to find a career at a firm that is actively developing AI for healthcare applications or one that plans on creating such software as part of a research team. I hope that my expertise in AI and how it interfaces with users will aid in creating a product that is ethical, secure, and accessible to millions of patients across the country.

I have always been fascinated with Artificial Intelligence, both in application and ethics. Its potential in the field of healthcare is undeniable-- a capable AI could theoretically diagnose patients, prescribe medications, and even offer therapy with a much higher rate of success and accuracy than its human counterparts. It seems many corporations share this view, with Microsoft launching a multimillion-dollar program to create software that could one day revolutionize the healthcare industry.  

The Georgia Tech OMSCS program specifically interests me due to the availability of courses regarding how Artificial Intelligence interacts with society. For example, the Educational Technology course will give me a strong background to later help develop software that tailors courses and learning objectives towards students with learning disabilities or speech impediments. The online format would perfectly suit my busy schedule, and the strong focus on self-study and self-motivation is a perfect environment for me to learn and excel."

&gt; ^(*Water is the best armor, but it has yet to blunt a knife.*)


&gt; &gt; ^(Sauvain saying.)

Vimodi forced himself to unclench his fists, burying the excitement that sparked in his chest when his guard slammed a mailed fist into the wooden door.  “Stand aside!"" the guard shouted gruffly, shouldering the door open and charging in with several of his fellows.  The warm light of the guest room spilled into the hallway, and Vimodi counted off a few beats before strolling in with practiced nonchalance.


The four Gadhun Draatim travelers were there, towering over his guards with surprised expressions as they stood clustered in one corner of the room.  The two hulking men stood at the fore of the group with their hands resting lightly on their odd cudgels.  His guards kept their composure even faced with the visitors’ aberrant size and appearance, forming a line to enclose their position with their spears held at a polite but ready rest.  Vimodi shivered inwardly at their stature - yes, he had been right to order his guards to corral them immediately.


“My honored guests,” he said, inclining his head slightly to the Gadhun Draatim.  “I hope you’re having a good evening.” 


“Vimodi,” the pale-skinned man replied, shifting his weight slightly forward.  The line of spears twitched at his motion, sharp blades dipping to hem him in.  The man looked darkly at the guards before taking a step back to glare at the governor.  


Vimodi bristled inwardly at the man’s familiar manner of address.  That response would have been an insult if delivered by a Sjocelym, but with this brutish foreigner he could only smile in response.  It suited his purposes in the end even if it rankled, he had to admit, because the guards he brought with him would remember his courtesy matched with insults from the foreign delegation.  Too many of his peers neglected to consider the opinions of their lessers, forgetting that even a humble guard’s recollection of events was significant if heard in court.  


No, this was too important to ignore the particulars.  The chariot would inspire ambition in his opponents just as it had done for him, and his acquisition of it must therefore be unimpeachable - so he smiled, eyes twinkling, and walked to stand in front of the foreigners.


“I thank you once again for bringing news of the impending danger from the desert,” he said, speaking slowly.  It was important that he be seen making the effort on their behalf.  “Unfortunately, such an extraordinary threat will require equally extraordinary measures on our part if we are to successfully defend our home.”  


He inclined his head toward the end table near the window.  “We must temporarily retain the sigil for your chariot,” he continued, struggling to keep his voice even.  “Please know that it is necessity that drives me to this extreme, and that I will make all efforts to provide recompense for the inconvenience.”


“No,” the same man replied, pale blue eyes locked onto Vimodi.  


Vimodi hesitated.  Had the brute understood him at all, or was he just reacting to his motion towards the end table?  “I regret that the situation forces this action,” he said smoothly, walking onward, “but it is my duty as governor to defend the valley with all available resources.  I must do this, for my people.”


The pale man stepped forward once more to stop him and Vimodi paused, but his guards intercepted the man with spearpoints held steady at his throat.  Anger flashed from blue eyes as he moved back to stand beside the others, eyes locked on Vimodi.  “Do not take it,” he said in a level voice, sounding oddly coherent for once.


“This is for the best,” Vimodi replied, not taking his eyes from the small drawer in the table.  “I’m doing you a favor, you know.  Even if I let you leave, someone else would take it from you - and most in the kingdom would gladly slit your throat for the chariot.  I have no desire for such violence, only for the means to defend my lands.”


He reached the table and slid the drawer open.  The dim light in the room reflected off the metal key, and Vimodi could feel his heart beat faster as he reached trembling fingers down to pick it up.  His fist closed around it and he pulled, frowning as he encountered a moment of unexpected resistance.  As he lifted the key from the drawer he saw that there was a small cord attached to it, and at the end of the cord there was a thin piece of coiled metal with a protruding pin.  


A pinging clatter sounded as two objects fell from behind the drawer - a flat metal piece that skittered away across the floorboards and a green metal cylinder that rolled forward heavily.  Its thin shell was perforated with a series of regularly spaced holes and splashed with a broad stripe of a lighter pastel green.  Vimodi peered at it curiously, and his guards turned to look at the source of the noise.


Then there was a sound beyond sound, and the world went white.


\---


Even with forewarning, there is only so much one can do when trapped in the same room as an exploding flashbang.  As the guards stared at the rolling canister the travelers had turned as one to avert their faces, close their eyes and plug their ears - but the concussion was like being punched in the chest, the noise echoing around the small room mercilessly even as the blinding reflected light from the detonation shone bright red through their eyelids.  


That said, there was no comparison to the state in which Vimodi and his men found themselves.  The guards had dropped their weapons to clutch at their eyes and ears, stumbling and kneeling in blind panic.  Vimodi was moaning incoherently on the floor, the truck’s keys sitting forgotten next to him.  


Jesse stepped over to grab them, tucking them into his pocket as the rest of them hefted their packs and filed unsteadily towards the door.  With one last glance at the room of incapacitated men Mark shut the door and sighed.  “Well, Plan D worked like a charm,” he said, speaking overloud past the ringing in his ears.  “Time to head out.”  He gave Gusje a quick double-click on the radio and motioned for the others to follow.  


They moved down the hallway as fast as they could without running.  There was no hope of remaining unnoticed, but it seemed that the fiction of Vimodi’s hospitality would at least let them move about the palace unmolested.  


Mark began to talk quietly with Gusje as they walked, her whispering voice over the radio guiding them up to the opulent suites where she was being kept.  The stealth turned out to be unnecessary as the suites were merely locked rather than guarded.  One kick from Jesse sent the doors swinging inward with a splintering crash, revealing a rather shocked-looking Gusje sitting on a plush bed and surrounded by a mound of frilly poufs and folded clothing.  She had exchanged her desert leathers for thickly-woven traveling clothes in a fine silken material inlaid with handsome filigree and beadwork.  


Jackie promptly burst out laughing and ducked back into the hallway.  Gusje scowled up at a smirking Mark as she stuffed a few expensive-looking items into her backpack and stomped towards the door.  “What?"" she asked, annoyed.  “I’m not likely to see cloth this nice again unless you plan on letting me betray you in every city we visit.”


“Let’s not make that our first move,” Mark replied, shooing her out.  “Come on, we don’t have much time.  Vimodi tried to take the key by force and things…  escalated.”


Gusje goggled at them.  “You killed him?"" she asked incredulously.


“What?  No!"" Mark retorted.  “We specifically tried *not* to kill him, and it was a complete success.”


Jackie rolled her eyes and grabbed them both by the arm, marching them toward the door to the room.  “Later,” she said brusquely.  “Alive Vimodi very angry.  Leaving time.”


Mark winced.  “She’s got a point,” he muttered.  “Come on, we can tell you about it in the truck.”


“What about my people?"" she objected.  “If he’s as angry as you say and I’m gone when he comes looking-”


“As much as it pains me to say it,” Mark sighed, “it looks like we’ll have to count on Tasja.”


\---


Vimodi threw the door to the scriptorium open with an echoing bang, heedless of the scandalized looks from the clerks within.  His vision was still swimming with angry purple blobs from the travelers’ trap, his ears buzzing with an insistent high-pitched whine and the maddened throbbing of his pulse.  


“Tasja!"" he bellowed, lurching into the room unsteadily.  Vertigo gripped him and he grabbed a chair for support, casting his gaze around the room until he found the diminutive clerk looking at him wide-eyed from a side table.  


“Vimodi Ma?"" the boy stammered, standing from his seat uncertainly.


“Where are the papers, boy?"" Vimodi thundered, stomping over to grab him by the front of his robes.  “The agreement with the sauvain bitch, give it to me!” 


“I don’t-"" Tasja said weakly, grabbing at Vimodi’s arm.  “It’s in the archives!”


“The archives?"" Vimodi repeated, letting his grip on Tasja’s robes slacken.  A sick feeling began to settle in his stomach.  “Already?  I only gave it to you at midday!”


The slender clerk straightened up, tugging his robes back into order.  “Gusje asked if I could send out the dispatches immediately, to hasten aid to her people,” Tasja explained, staring uncomprehendingly at Vimodi’s growing look of horror.  “You put your seal to the agreement, Vimodi Ma, so I saw no reason to delay.  I’ve already sent messages to the two gates, to the Ministers of Stone, Soil and Bread…”


The boy trailed off as Vimodi began to laugh, erratic and high-pitched.  “Fooled,” he croaked.  “By Maja’s grace, I’ve been walking blind.  Those lying foreigners, they planned all of this.  All of this.”  He continued to laugh, slumping into a chair as the docents converged on him in concern.  


He had been quite neatly swindled, he had to admit.  The chariot made for convincing bait, the Cereinem and the gigantic foreign freaks a veneer of legitimacy for the entire operation.  His adversaries had overplayed their hand, however.  The resources involved in orchestrating this sham were as good as a signed letter from the council advertising their intent to humiliate him, not to mention they had been agitating for certain preferential land allotments for quite some time now.  He had thought to rob them of their prize by handing the land to the refugees, a neat solution to two problems at once.  If the sauvain intended to turn around and hand the land to the council rather than staying beholden to him, however...  


But no, they had still erred.  A chariot could have been excused away as some foreign heirloom, but the saon draim they had used to incapacitate him and his men was too powerful to be anything but one of the *jeqiva*, the city-treasures.  One was scarcely going to turn up in the hands of some foreign giants without the sort of political connections the council cultivated.  


He began to laugh again, drawing renewed stares of concern from the docents as he slowly pushed himself up from the chair.  “The road goes both ways,” he muttered darkly, looking to where his handpicked guards hovered uncertainly just outside the scriptorium door.  He staggered toward them, beckoning sharply.  “Yes, yes,” he half-sang, feeling another bout of laughter coming on.  “It goes both ways.”


\---


Few people walked the grounds as they made a beeline for the carriage house.  They had been surprised to find a ready-made covered parking spot when they arrived, but Sjan Saal was apparently expected to receive visitors by chariot even if they had none of their own.  Two guards stood on either side of the open doorway as they approached but did not move to stop them from entering.  


“I guess they didn’t get the memo,” Jackie whispered wryly.  She slung her bag into the back and clambered in, turning to help Arjun up into the cab.  


Mark laughed darkly.  “Nah, you didn’t get all of Vimodi’s little speech back there,” he said.  “He’s sticking to the guest-right story, he wants this to look like it’s a ‘voluntary permanent loan’ from us to him.  He won’t have told anyone what he was really up to.”


“So he would have let us leave?"" Jackie asked incredulously.  


“If he had the truck he probably would prefer it,” Arjun pointed out.  “I doubt he cares very much one way or the other-”  Arjun cut off as Tasja slipped into the carriage house, flushed and breathing heavily.  He carried a battered leather satchel with documents and papers haphazardly stuffed inside.


“Tasja?"" Gusje asked, looking at the clerk in confusion.  “I thought you went to the scriptorium, what are you doing here?”


“You have to go!"" Tasja shouted, wheezing.  “Vimodi Ma is looking for you, he’s going to kill all of you!”


Mark and Jesse exchanged a look, readying their rifles.  “How many men?"" Jesse asked.  


“Only a few, but that doesn’t matter,” Tasja said agitatedly.  “He was trying to get the *jan met savedrai* from the vault, the docents won’t be able to stop him, his men brought *weapons into the scriptorium*-”


“Hold up,” Mark said, an alarmed look spreading over his face.  “He came to get what?  The flaming hand of-?”


“The Fiery Hand of Destruction,” Jesse said, looking perturbed.  “It’s a concerning name.”


“-not thinking straight, I’ve never seen him like this,” Tasja continued frantically, tears streaming from his eyes.  “I brought you maps and directions and - please, please, you have to leave before he finds you.”


“Well, that was always the plan,” Mark said.  “Let’s finish up before Vimodi can show us what he checked out of the library.  Tasja, you shouldn’t have come.  If Vimodi sees you with us…”


Tasja glared up at him, his eyes red and his lip quivering.  “I had to do something,” he said defiantly.  “He’s breaking his oaths to Sjan Saal, to the scriptorium and as your sworn host.  What he’s doing, it’s not *right*.”


Mark looked down at him, surprised, then grinned and ruffled the clerk’s already-disheveled hair.  “I take back everything I said, Short Round,” he grinned.  “Now hide, before-”


The door to the carriage house burst open with a crash, revealing a furious Vimodi stalking toward them.  “*You!*"" he screamed, pointing a quivering finger at them as he advanced.  His left hand was enveloped in an odd metallic gauntlet hooked to a bracer set with glowing crystals.  Behind him, a handful of spear-wielding guards filed nervously into the carriage house to take up positions behind the enraged governor.  


Vimodi’s bloodshot eyes fixed on Tasja, who was standing half-hidden behind Mark.  “And you,” he said again, his voice a low growl.  “I knew someone from my house was guiding them, but you - you traitor, you little ingrate!  You’d betray *me*?  After all I’ve given you?”  


Tasja was frozen with wordless panic in the face of Vimodi’s rage, but Mark moved to stand in front of him.  “Leave the kid alone,” he said calmly.  “You know, Vimodi, I’ve got to say that I’m very disappointed in your hospitality so far.”


The governor froze, his face twisting in apoplectic rage.  “A pack of filthy liars,” he spat.  “Conspiring against me, pretending your ignorance.  I see now.”  His eyes came to rest on Gusje, staring at him wide-eyed from the truck’s doorway.  “I see now,” he repeated, his voice manic and high-pitched.  “You came to me under false pretences.  You tricked your way into my home.  I have no obligation to you.”  He raised his hand with trembling fingers splayed wide.  


“I will tolerate your disrespect,” Vimodi said viciously, “no longer.”  At once, he clicked his fingers together.


The metallic device enveloping his hand glowed white-hot before belching out a roiling mass of flame towards Mark and Tasja.  The rest of the travelers scattered as Mark cursed and dove to the side, throwing an arm out to catch Tasja across the chest and slam him to the floor.  The fireball passed just over them to impact the wall of the carriage house with a crash.  Splintered timbers blasted out over the grounds and spread motes of fire into the lush garden outside, sizzling where they fell into the dewy greenery.  


Vimodi cackled deliriously, the recoil sending him staggering back a few steps.  One of the crystals on his arm had lost its glow, but five more burned brightly as he lifted his arm once more.  “Behold Sjocelym might,” he gloated breathlessly, “and die.”  His eyes narrowed as he sighted at the group, but as he brought his fingers together once more a pair of sharp cracks echoed through the room.  The fireball flew wide as his arm jerked sideways, the blast impacting the ground with a spray of dirt and splintered flooring.  Some of Vimodi’s men nearest the blast were peppered with debris and driven to the floor by the concussion.  


Vimodi fell to the ground screaming.  His bloody hand clutched spasmodically at the twin bullet wounds in his upper chest.  Before his knees settled on the floor Jesse had advanced to loom over him, smoke still trailing from the barrel of his rifle as he smashed its butt into Vimodi’s skull.  The governor crumpled and lay motionless on the ground.  


Mark pushed himself upright and stalked forward with his own rifle raised.  One of his sleeves was scorched and smoldering where the first fireball had brushed it. Traces of red, blistering skin showed where the cloth had burnt away.  He reached Jesse’s position just as the other man finished tugging the ornate metallic gauntlet off of Vimodi’s hand.  


“You good?"" Jesse asked, holding the fingers of the gauntlet carefully apart as he stood.  


Mark nodded, not taking his eyes off the guards.  “Yeah, peachy,” he replied.  “How’s our pyro?”


“Alive, knocked out,” Jesse said.  “My shot went high, I don’t think I got his lung.”


Mark nodded, then shot Vimodi in the head.  The governor’s body jerked weakly before falling still.  Jesse jumped back, startled, and looked at Mark with wide eyes.  


“Jesus, Mark!"" Jackie shouted from behind them.  “He was knocked out!”


Mark turned to face the others.  Jackie was glaring at him, rigid with fury, while Arjun stood just beside the truck with a tight, disapproving frown.  Tasja had risen to kneel on the debris-strewn floor, his face a horrified mask as he stared at Vimodi’s corpse.  “You think I should have let him live?"" Mark asked sardonically.  “We tried that before and look where it got us.  Do you think he would have woken up after we left and thought, ‘Gee, that was unpleasant’ and gone on with his life?”


“He was helpless,” Arjun said softly.  


“You know what he was,” Mark said, his voice thick with disdain.  “You’ve read about them, I’ve shaken their hands.  He would have taken it out on us, or on Gusje’s people when they came here.  One way or another we would have paid for leaving him alive.  So I didn’t.  It’s done.”  He looked at the far wall of the carriage house, which was rapidly burning out of control.  “This place is about to come down,” he sighed.  “If you want to talk about it later, let’s do it on the road.”


He turned to look at the guards, who had remained frozen by the entrance.  “We’re leaving,” he shouted in Ceiqa.  They stared at him blankly, and he shook his head in exasperation.  “Go outside, at least?”  The guards stirred into motion, filing reluctantly outside and standing clear from the door to permit the truck passage as Jackie drove it out.  Mark peered down at them with a stern look.  “Listen, we’re not going to have any trouble from you guys, right?"" he asked, sweeping his gaze across the group.  “Guys?”


One of them stood forward, shaking his head.  “Vimodi M…  No, *Vimodi* went too far,” the guard said.  “We will not interfere if you wish to leave.  Only…”  He hesitated, nodding at Jesse emerging from the building with Tasja leaning heavily on him for support.  “You must leave the Hand.  It is jeqiva, held in trust by the scriptorium for the defense of the city and the wall.  If we are to have any chance of surviving the Emperor’s blight we will need its power.”


Mark laughed, shaking his head.  “Oh, you want the weapon?  The one your governor just used on us?"" he said bitingly.  “No, I think we’ll keep this until we feel some *trust* between us.”  He took a step towards the guard, towering over the smaller man.  


“Vimodi signed some orders before he died,” Mark said.  “For the evacuation of the Cereinem in the desert and their safety behind the walls.  See that they’re carried out in full and we’ll bring it back before you need it.”  He clapped the guard on the shoulder, making him flinch.  “If you help the Cereinem you’re our allies.  Work with us, we’ll work with you.”


The guard looked up at Mark and Jesse, then back at the burning carriage house.  Beside them, Tasja had shifted to stare at the flames with a glassy, disbelieving expression.  “And if we don’t we’ll never see the Hand again, is that it?”  He returned his gaze to Mark, who shrugged noncommittally.  “Do we have a choice?"" the guard asked.  


“Not unless you think your men can stop us from leaving,” Mark replied, fixing the guard with a look and resting his hand lightly on his rifle.  The man sighed and shook his head slowly, and Mark gave him a thin smile.  “Cheer up.  We’re not a problem for you unless you make us one.  So when someone asks what happened here...”


“You were gone when we arrived,” the guard said tonelessly, looking towards the carriage house as the flames began to lick through its windows.  “Vimodi flew into a rage and burned the building, disappearing with the Hand into the blaze.”  He gave Mark a stony glare, crossing his arms.  “My men and I will hold to our side of the arrangement,” he said, “and you will hold to yours.  If you fail to bring the Hand back then the last act of Sjan Saal will be to find you and put one blade in you for each life you doomed.”


“I’d expect nothing less,” Mark said, holding out his hand.  “Don’t worry, we’ll be back.”


The guard clasped his hand listlessly and turned away to gather his men while Mark walked back toward the truck, clapping his hands.  “Let’s get gone!"" he shouted.  “We need to move before the fire draws more guards.”


Jesse nodded and knelt next to Tasja, who swayed unsteadily.  His eyes were glassy as he stared back towards the fire.  “Tasja, we’re leaving,” Jesse said quietly.  “Go with the guards.  They’ll take you back to the palace.”  


Tasja turned to look at him, his eyes struggling to focus on Jesse’s face.  “I can’t,” he whispered, trembling.  “It was me, I ruined everything, and Vimodi Ma...  I can’t go back there, I can’t, can’t…”  The clerk trailed off, then grabbed Jesse’s arm with sudden intensity.  “Take me with you,” he pled.  “Please.  I can’t stay here.”


A moment passed, and Jesse considered Tasja’s dirty, tear-streaked face as the young man clung to his sleeve.  “You sure?"" he asked softly.  “We could use your knowledge, but things will probably be…  like this.  Again.”  He gestured to the burning carriage house.


Tasja took another long look at the carriage house, then sniffed and nodded.  “I can’t go back there,” he repeated hoarsely.  The flames licked higher, shooting through a hole in the tiled roof as the broad rafters succumbed to the heat.  The smoke was thick and dark against the sky now, and they could hear faint shouts of alarm from the palace proper.


Jesse nodded and stood up.  “All right,” he said, opening the door to the waiting truck.  “Get in.”

So glad they were able to calm things down - wait, no.  *Burn* things down.  Well, darn.  Still, they’ve made it out of Sjan Saal in one piece and not much worse for wear, plus one shiny glove and an intern with PTSD.  I’m sure that their next stop will be much less eventful, stuff like this can’t happen *everywhere* they go.

ezcpfw,4,2020-02-05,Graduating December 2021 - look for internships or full time?,joshparker8675,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ezcpfw/graduating_december_2021_look_for_internships_or/,"I'm graduating in December 2021, and although I already have an internship for this summer I do have some questions about how to proceed for future interviews/this one. 

1. I didn't know that my graduation date would go from May-&gt;December so my currently planned internship thinks I'm graduating in May. I need to tell them, but in turn will they still consider me for full time or just for a return internship? I'm not sure how the timeline works. 
2. I'm going to a major career fair next month and I'm not sure if I should be looking for internships for next summer, or focusing on securing full-time for when I graduate in mid-December? I already have had 3 internships so I wouldn't be too stressed not to have one next summer, but IDK if I will be considered for a full time job at a big tech company (my goal) with the extra time remaining on my academic schedule. I'm also not sure how willing companies are to give students graduating in fall full time jobs in comparison to those who graduate right before summer. 

Thanks for any info! Sincerely, a college junior who is going through it"
ezcsed,1,2020-02-05,How can I make myself more competitive for bioinformatics PhDs?,conjr94,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/ezcsed/how_can_i_make_myself_more_competitive_for/,"I'm currently completing a research based Msc focused on computer vision for developmental biology and graduated in biological sciences with a 2:1 (GPA 3.7) with a lot of experience in sequencing analysis. I also did a bioinformatics based internship.

I've applied for many bioinformatics based PhD projects but only had one interview recently which didn't go great - there is a lot of competition (people with a 1st/GPA 4+) and I'm not very good at communicating my passions.

I'm going to continue applying for positions, but I'm worried I might not secure one for this year. My current plan to make myself more competitive is as follows:

* Try to achieve a publication from my Msc project.
* Continue applying for PhD positions.
* Also apply for job positions related to bioinformatics/data science/software development.
* If unsuccessful in finding a PhD project, volunteer for bioinformatics based projects at the uni.
* If unsuccessful in finding any full-time employment, focus on projects and work part-time.

Is there anything else I can do to make myself more competitive?"
ezcxar,9,2020-02-05,I hit a breaking point with my anxiety,PKDragoon1,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/ezcxar/i_hit_a_breaking_point_with_my_anxiety/,"Had my first day at my new job in a IT position a couple days ago. This is pretty much my first job outta college and the only other thing I really did as work was help out with my family business as I was too scared to talk to recruiters and look for internships in school.

 When I got there, they gave me a quick run through the office (it's a small company and office, 12-15 people), gave me a task to do, gave me access to their database and let me loose. I almost immediately panicked cause I didnt know what to do, and was too afraid to actually ask questions. I tried to look things up to see if I can get some idea but everything just seemed too much and overwhelming. I spent the whole day panicking and just pretended to look like I was doing something, kind of brushing off people who wanted to check up on me by saying I was researching how to do the task. Legit ran into the bathroom cause it felt like I was gonna explode any second. 

The next day I went to the office and told the boss about my issue, how the stress was too much to handle and that I was planning to see a therapist in order to fix this issue, and that I needed a break from work before I can continue. I have my first appointment on monday but all I can think about is if I made the right decision or if it was just anxiety from it being my first day there. My parents understood my decision but dont want me just staying in my house waiting for monday to come, but I'm too afraid right now to even think about talking to people at the moment. 

Sorry for the really long post but I just needed to get my thoughts and experience out somewhere. Never would've done this before until today and this definitely made me realize that this problem is more serious for me than what all my family is telling me."
ezd6vh,1072,2020-02-05,"An Instagrammer Shared Her ""Rules of the Road"" Story With Me. It Still Haunts Me.",throwawayaracehorse,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ezd6vh/an_instagrammer_shared_her_rules_of_the_road/,"*The following is a transcript from a short radio program that has been picked up by various listeners across the continental United States. Many have been perplexed by its sudden appearance and how it seems to preempt whatever song or radio program they are listening to at the time. It has even been known to appear on streaming programs such as podcasts or Spotify.*

*After experiencing the broadcast myself, I began to seek out and  record the experiences of individuals who had heard the radio program. Many have had unique experiences, hearing different scripts on the program and having drastically different consequences.*

*Sasha contacted me via email and we later had a meeting on Skype. She was a young woman in her early twenties and had heard the broadcast while road tripping in California with her friend, Greta. In her email, she was assured and driven. It was important for her to share her story, she said. But as I got her on the screen, as she sat at a desk in a pleasant home office with stark white walls and plenty of natural sunlight, she was tentative and shy at first. She read from a stack of papers in a shaky voice. However, the longer she spoke, the more her voice shed the insecurity and a sly, confident young woman emerged. This is her story.*

&amp;#x200B;

They say that behind every great man is a great woman. What they don’t tell you is behind that great woman is me, taking a picture of that great woman’s behind, making sure that it is framed perfectly in the shot as she stands before some grand vista or gorgeous natural landscape. I’m there to capture the natural beauty of both the scenery and her ass, a perfect upside down heart that’s squeezed into whatever activewear she’s promoting at the time, her thick blonde mane of hair cascading down her back like the many waterfalls she’s posed in front of.

Greta was an Instagrammer, an influencer, and I was the one standing behind her, responsible for much of her success as her photographer and caption writer and social media manager. For several years I considered her my best friend.

Before I go further, I’d like to preface all of this by saying that my relationship with Greta has always been kind of...complicated. And by complicated, I mean borderline exploitative. I believe that in any relationship there are givers and there are takers. Greta was not a giver.

This is not to say that she was some awful, soul-sucking bitch, in fact I did have genuine warm feelings towards her and still do to this day. In any abusive relationship, there is some sort of love there, something that drew us to that person initially. That’s what keeps us coming back: the idea that maybe they will change back into the person we revered in the beginning.

We met back east in college in a class we were both taking. She approached me with regards to an essay that she needed help with and the friendship blossomed from there. She was charismatic and full of a crackling energy that I was instantly drawn to and I was flattered that she took an interest in me. Sure, it seemed like it was a relationship that was started solely on her needing something, my assistance with her various writing assignments, but she offered much in return and genuinely liked me.

What did she offer in return? Adventure and excitement. She talked me into using marijuana for the first time, late nights out in the city with crazy experiences, concerts and Broadway shows, meeting all sorts of new people, my first shot of absinthe, and the travel, oh the travel. I wouldn’t have seen many parts of the world if it wasn’t for her.

She came from a rich family and I was on scholarship and had work study to get by. I simply couldn’t afford the lavish trips and restaurants that she took me to. It was always hard to simply turn her down when she invited me out to eat or to a concert or show and I would have to politely decline without giving the real reasons, but she saw through that.

“Whatever dude, I’m buying,” she would say and off we would go.

The response was the same when she came with the bright idea that we should fly to Paris on summer break.

“Do you know how much homework you’ve helped me with this semester? It’s the least I can do. I do not want to go alone. You’re my PIC. I’ll get your airfare, you just get the meals and maybe buy some wine over there.”

And so we went. It was here that she developed her passion for her Instagram page, even more so than your average college girl. She already had a sizable following of over three thousand followers and I took cute pictures of her all over the city and came up with clever captions. By the time we returned to the states, she had doubled the followers and was discussing it constantly.

“You know, we may be onto something here. There’s like these people that do this full time, just fly around and travel and get sponsors and shit. They pay for everything. How cool is that?”

The rest of the summer was filled with adventures and shenanigans, me the ever tag-along, taking photos of her and validating her every move: long weekends at the Hamptons, cocktails at rooftop bars in NYC, fashion galas, and a hike in the Adirondacks so she “wouldn’t appear too metropolitan.”

*It was here that Sasha paused in her story and stared off into space. Reflecting, perhaps? How was this story going to end? What broadcast did Buck Hensley present to them? What rule was obeyed or ignored?*

*“Sasha?”*

*“Oh, sorry.” She continued.*

I couldn’t really keep up with her financially, but she paid for lots of amenities: meals, hotels, transportation.  “Don’t worry about it,” she would say. “You’re like my publicist. We’re growing followers all the time. I really think this will work. We need to think bigger. You consider yourself the manager. It's *our* brand, I'm just the face of it.""

Despite whatever support I received, it still would clean me out—pride kept me from outright begging every time— and I lived constantly on the verge of overdraft from my checking account. I didn’t want to miss out on all of the fun and excitement though; she had me addicted. But I often wished she would take it easy and we could just relax and do more low key activities, activities that I would suggest and that she would shoot down.

She didn’t have a boyfriend and never strived for anything long term.

“I don’t need no man,” she would say. “They’ll only keep me from reaching my full potential. Once I reach that I'll reconsider.""

This is not to say that she didn’t enjoy male attention—she very much did—and she was prone to random hookups and casual flings. I didn’t like these types of relationships and the particular kind of sleazy douchebag guys that flocked to her at the different bars we would frequent. I did have genuine warm feelings towards her and still do to this day.  I was often left to fend for myself with the friends and most of the time I was able to fight them off, but alcohol and exhaustion and boredom led to too many mornings where I would awaken in a strange location and a depressing subway ride home, hating myself and the night I could barely remember. It was times like these where I felt like Greta was dragging me down.

Ultimately, I knew I was an adult and made my own decisions, but I wished she did a better job of looking out for me sometimes. I was losing myself in her, remaking myself into a person I wasn’t, and I couldn’t get off the carousel that was continuing to spin faster and faster and out of control.

She broke 100k followers by the fall semester and had gained several sponsors, getting her first checks and free products. I got the hand me down products, the items she didn’t want and she gave me a cut of the profits for taking the pictures and writing the captions. I never *knew* exactly how much she got paid and if I was getting a fair share. I didn’t think about getting a lawyer or drawing up a contract. It was just a casual affair and I was frankly happy at that point to be getting any money.

Greta continued to gain followers, the growth seemingly exponential and we got busier and busier. My grades began to slip that semester and I think Greta’s did as well. She dropped classes and wasn’t even carrying a full course load. Whenever I expressed reservations about the workload and falling behind in classes, she would come with the convenient exciting news that we had received another payment and cut me a check. This was usually enough to appease me.

By the time that summer rolled around and I had graduated, Greta had reached 750k followers and I was tired.So, so tired. I felt like a shell of myself and desperately in need of a break. I had gotten a coveted internship at a magazine for the summer and I was thankful for the opportunity to not have to live in Greta’s shadow, taking her pictures and bolstering her fame. She was not too pleased with my decision and it led to a dramatic and emotional confrontation at my apartment after my graduation.

“I can’t believe you’re gonna be gone all summer. Leaving me high and dry right when we’re about to break a million,” she said as she sipped her wine.

“Greta,” I said in a pleading tone. “This internship really means a lot to me. This is big time. It can really open a lot of doors.”

“Fine, fine,” she said as she procured a joint that we proceeded to smoke.

We zoned out to TV and soon I noticed that the bottle of wine was empty and could hear her banging around in the kitchen. She returned to the couch with a glass of bourbon.

“You know what, *fuck* your magazine and your internship. How much are they paying you anyways?”

“It’s not about the money.”

“Well what is it about? You getting tired of me? That’s how it always ends. I thought you were different.” I could see tears at the corners of her eyes.

“Greta.”

“No, it’s fine. I just thought we were in this together. I *totally* understand.” Her voice began to break.

“I’m just so, *so* tired of the fast paced life. I can’t keep up with you anymore.”

“But this is gonna be totally different. It’s more travel, more road trips. *Cross country*. It would be like one last trip before we have to enter the world of adulthood. It will be totally epic and totally laid back at the same time. More outdoorsy.”

I didn’t say anything.

“I can pay you. How much are you supposed to make over there? I’ll pay all your room and board, plus a weekly rate.” She was sounding frantic, spouting stuff off, anything to get me to change my mind. Before I knew it the glass of liquor was empty. Her words were slurring.

“My dad has some connections with The New Yorker. He could land you an editing job, I swear. Do this for me. We’re *so* close. I *need* you. You’re like my sister.”

I could only wince and shake my head. The words were caught in my throat and I didn’t know what to say.

“Fine!” she cried and stormed off back into the kitchen and I heard glass breaking and she soon emerged, standing at the threshold of the kitchen, a stream of blood running down her forearm and onto the floor.

“I’m so sorry,” she said and sobbed over and over again as I held a dishrag over her wound to stop the bleeding and held her as she cried into my shoulder.

I ended up withdrawing from my internship and going on the road trip. The self inflicted scar on her forearm, we ended up taking an artsy black and white photo of it and making an Instagram post about how we all had struggles and the importance of self care and taking care of your mental health. It got 500k likes.

*At this point, Sasha stopped again and didn’t speak for a while. I was beginning to wonder if she had somehow mistakenly contacted me. Her story, while riveting in a millenial sort of way, didn’t seem to have anything to do with Buck Hensley.*

*“Sasha, did you have an experience with the broadcast on your roadtrip?”*

*She looked up at me, confused.*

*“Buck Hensley and “The Rules of the Road?”* I asked.

“*Oh, right. Yes, we heard it in California.”*

We had just left Josua Tree and had taken a plethora of photos. I was sunburned and tired and cranky and the sun was coming down. I had come up with a caption for a photo of Greta hanging off one of the trees, something like “If you’re cool enough, he’ll let you hang on his branches and call him Josh”, not my best work, but it was something. Greta looked stunning as usual and she rode in the passenger seat, posting the pic and hashtags and  “fended off the haters and tended to the horny boys” in the comments of the post.

She was laughing and talking to herself while she worked her phone when all of a sudden she looked at me and said in a serious tone, “Sasha. A publisher has found my Instagram feed and wants a book deal. It’s one of the big ones. They want photos and stories of my adventures on the road.”

“That’s great! I can help with the writing. I’ve done all the captions. I mean, I can help you portray your vision. *Our* vision.”

“Um yeah, that’s the thing. They have a team they would like to use. Ghost writer and publicist and editor and everything. I’ve been in contact with all of them.”

“Oh.” A sledgehammer had hit me in the guts and I drove in silence. I fought back tears.

An hour passed and I didn’t say a word. I was so goddam angry and it took all I had not to explode on her. I was done. Next chance I got, I was out of here. She had her publishing team. She didn’t need me. I had given her everything and then some.

I turned on the radio, some Top 40 BS. I wasn’t really even listening. Rage coursed through me. She could sense I was upset and knew well enough not to talk. I turned up the volume of the radio and the drum machine beats of the dance music began to sound like a heartbeat, a heartbeat that sounded like it was throbbing right in my ears and then into my throat. There was a sudden silence and then a voice started talking. This is what it said.

&gt;Good evening folks, Burke Hensley here with yet another episode of “The Rules of the Road”. Hope ya’ll are doing just dandy out there tonight on that highway known as life on that planet known as Earth. Why do they call it Earth, anyways? Who named it? Is that what’s on the birth certificate out there after it shot out of a supernova’s hoo-ha? If you asked me, Earth’s parents dropped it on its head a few too many times. That’s why she’s so weird and wonky and cruel.  
&gt;  
&gt;Speaking of names, what’s in a name (besides letters that is)? I don’t rightly know, but I do know that names are important. Since the dawn of written and oral history, folks have had names. Even the Elder Gods that have existed long before us had names. You just can’t pronounce them! By golly, names are important, or my name ain’t Bud Henson!  
&gt;  
&gt;So that brings us to tonight’s “Rule of the Road”. It has to do with names, *your* names in particular. If at any point in your journey you stop at a gift shop or truck stop and they have them souvenir key chains with your name on it, you must purchase the one with your name on it. I’m partial to the ones with the state license plates on ‘em myself.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking, “Buckley, my parents were a bunch of chuckleheads and they named me Stephanie with a “fun” in the middle: Stefunee and that is anything but “funee” to me. Or you’re thinking they named me Chris with two z’s and two t’s and they screw it up at Starbucks all the time. There ain’t no way in hell they’re gonna have my correct name at no gift shop. And to that I say, fair enough. But look closer. You might be surprised at what you find.  
&gt;  
&gt;So what happens if you ignore this rule? Well, it might seem like a simple thing at first. How often do you really think about your own name? How important is it to you? I bet you overlook it, take it for granted. What if you lost it? If you ignore this rule, you might come to find what it’s like to *lose* your very own name. Do so at your own peril.  
&gt;  
&gt;Welp, that’s all I got for tonight. Thoughts and prayers to whomever may be listening up there that you arrive at your destination safely. But remember these prayers are just a courtesy. It is already written and they already know and we are doomed to stay on the same predetermined path until the end, no choice and no say in the matter. Stay alert. Stay lively. Stay lonely. Stay lucid. I’m Buck Hornswallow and these are “The Rules of the Road”.

At the time, I was too mad to think much of the broadcast. It may have lightened my mood a little bit and Greta gave a few nervous laughs. I drove on and pulled off at a hotel near Bakersfield and got a room for the night.

The next day, I had begun to speak a little more to Greta, the bare minimum. In my mind, I was planning on getting to Sacramento and flying back home and trying to pick up the pieces. I hadn’t revealed this information to her yet. We were low on gas and had stopped at a large truck stop. It was like a miniature grocery store in there. Rows and rows of snacks and souvenir T-shirts and trucker equipment and books on CD and DVDs and sunglasses.

“Hey, look,” Greta called over to me. She was standing at one of those little spinning display racks. It was full of souvenir keychains with names on them, little Route 66 themed ones.

“Oh yeah, like that weird radio show we heard,” I said.

“Think they’ll have our names on them? Not the most common. If they do, we better get them, just in case.”

“It would suck to lose your name after all the fame you’ve got.”

“Wow, they’ve got ‘em.” She held up two key chains, Greta and Sasha.

“Nice. I’m gonna get some water and I’ll buy these,” I said. “My treat.”

*Sasha paused and shuffled the papers. That strange look on her face again. Was she about to reveal what I suspected?*

She went back to the car and at the checkout I paid for one bottled water and one keychain with my name on it. The other one, I left behind.

*Sasha looked down at her stack of papers for a long time, most likely processing the weight of what she had done back in Bakersfield. She had had no way of knowing that the rules were real and that they could be deadly. What had been the consequence? Death? Was there a gravestone out there over Greta's body, no name etched into the granite?*

*She shuffled the papers and squinted at the words and then began again, her voice now monotone.*

It was subtle at first, occurring over weeks and the rest of the summer. First, I would have to repeat myself a lot of times to get her attention, like she wasn’t hearing her name. She would get a confused look on her face and kind of snap back into it and laugh and say something about a “brain fart” or “being hungover”.

Then, she would freeze up when trying to sign credit card receipts, staring blankly for an awkward amount of time. I would have to sign for her. We couldn’t rely on her to make any reservations, she would never know what name to put it under. This would come and go, at strange and random times. Sometimes it was like nothing had ever happened and she would seem completely normal, her old self. She could remember her name and who she was and all of our prior adventures.

Other times she put on a good front and was able to deceive just how confused she really was. It was only in talking to her that she would say something outrageous about her past—that she was a supermodel from Australia or that her name was Ashley— and you would realize she was in one of her states.

Meeting new people was a problem. She could only smile awkwardly during the introduction and I would have to say her name for her. She talked much less when she was like this, only smiled and nodded. You could ask her a question directly and she would answer, but not in a way that made sense. She seemed lost in her own apartment, frequently opening the wrong drawers and cabinets and asking me where the bathroom was.

She started to let go of her hygiene. Her hair looked matted and greasy and I would notice her wearing the same clothes for days at a time. Dishes piled up in her sink, dirty clothes all over her house.

She had gotten lost several times and I received calls from strangers in a bar to pick her up. One time her parents had to pick her up from an emergency room. The police had found her in an alley behind a Dunkin Donuts, lost and confused, clothing and hair disheveled. She had been missing for almost 24 hours.

They got her an ID bracelet with contact information, but we all kept a closer eye on her. It was hard to go out in public, because she could appear very normal and we never knew when she would suddenly “turn” and might wander off.

Her parents took her to a neurologist and she underwent a battery of tests. All of the tests were normal and they couldn’t find anything conclusive. Maybe it was psychological, they suggested? I offered to take care of her and let her stay with me during the day. Had I done this to her? Was the broadcast’s warning real? At the time, I thought it was just a goof. If I had known this was to happen, I wouldn’t have done it. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.

Either way I felt responsible and watching her during the day was the least I could do. It worked out pretty well. I could still go out at night and during the day I was working on my book deal stuff.

*Book deal? Had Sasha taken over the book deal after Greta’s mind started to go?*

I’ve noticed other weird things lately. Sometimes I find myself calling her the wrong name, just a few letters off or something similar. She doesn’t notice of course. She doesn’t even respond if I call her the right name. I’ve noticed her parents doing it too. They call her Natasha or Sharon or Shannon or Shelly. The thing is, *they* don’t notice it. It’s really weird.

*What? Didn’t she mean names similar to Greta*? *Sasha spaced out again. She didn’t talk for a long time.*

*“Sasha?” I asked.*

*She didn’t respond.*

*“Are you ok? You couldn’t have known the rules were real. I know you feel awfully guilty.”*

*She looked at me through the screen and then to the right and to the left, picked up the papers she was reading from and that’s when I noticed it: a silver bracelet on her left wrist. A medical ID bracelet.*

*I heard a voice shouting from the other room. It grew louder. Sasha turned towards the door, the voice. The door burst open and in burst a radiant and glamorous blonde.*

*“There you are,” she said. “What are you doing up here?”*

*“I’m just…” she trailed off and gestured towards the computer screen.*

*“Ohh...who have you called up? Is this that journalist guy you were talking about? Hope you didn’t tell him anything too bad about me,” the blonde said with a wink at the camera. She looked at me and spoke. “The psychiatrist recommended her keeping a journal, write things down when she remembered. He thinks it might help some. I guess she contacted you when she was lucid?”*

*“Yes. You must be Greta.”*

*“Sure am.”*

*“Can you tell me what’s going on?” I asked.*

*Greta sat down at the desk and patted Sasha on the back. “She’s been stable for a while. Has some really good days.” She turned to Sasha and said in a babyish voice, “We have to get you to your parents soon. Mommy has a big date tonight.” She turned to look at me. “Are you two done here? I’ve got a book release party this evening and lots of getting ready to do.”*

*“But, I thought that…” I started.*

*Greta looked down at the stack of papers. “What are these doing here?” she asked. “Have you been getting in my stuff again? You got part of yours mixed up with mine, ya big goof.”*

*Sasha looked down like a scolded child.*

*“I’m going to release a memoir about taking care of a friend with a mentally debilitating disease. It’s going to be my sophomore publication, these are some notes for the ghost writer. Well, it was nice to meet you. Say bye, Natasha.”*

*Sasha looked at me with a flat expression as everything I had just learned was turned upside down. As Greta reached to turn off the computer and hang up the call, I could see in her hand she held her keys. From the keys hung a little Route 66 souvenir keychain with a name etched on it: Greta.*

ezfdey,38,2020-02-05,Quarter-life crisis,kmfunder,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/ezfdey/quarterlife_crisis/,"Hello everyone! I'm going to try my best to get to the point without typing my whole life story, but I definitely have a multifaceted problem. 

I just 'mastered out' of a PhD program in applied mathematics last year, but before I left, I applied and got accepted to another PhD program at an ivy league university in computational biology. My experience in grad school the first time around really wasn't very pleasant. During this time, not only did I find myself in the middle of a toxic environment, I realized that I'm really only a mediocre mathematician, and that disease modeling wasn't as interesting as I'd once thought it would be. I'd done a couple bioinformatics/computational biology internships in undergrad, so I applied to do another one at the NIH the summer between my first and second year. And because that summer went so well, it ultimately led to my decision to leave the PhD program and focus my attention on developing a career in bioinformatics instead. However, since my initial exposure to life as a graduate student was pretty miserable, and the program I'd been accepted to was an intimidating step up academically, I got cold feet and decided to defer until next year (August 2020). I came back to the NIH for a 1 year fellowship to take some time to think about my life, while gaining some relevant experience, and now I'm strongly considering not enrolling in the PhD program at all. 

So I guess I have the following questions: 1) As of right now, I'm not really interested in running my own research group, but if I change my mind about it later in life, would it be career suicide to not take this opportunity while it's available? 2) How upset will the faculty at the university be about me deferring and then saying never mind? 3) I've never applied for a real job before, so how experienced are potential employers expecting candidates with masters degrees not in bioinformatics or computer science to be? I feel like I'm still very much an amateur bioinformatician and my statistics background isn't as extensive as most people think it is, so I'm a little worried about how I compare to my competition. Also, as a young black woman who hasn't attended any top-tier universities in the past, I know it's very possible I'm going to get low balled if I am offered a job. So 4) What's the best way to figure out 'my worth' if the salary isn't explicitly stated in the job description (which, apparently, is never the case outside of government jobs)?

Edit: I realized I forgot to mention I did my undergrad in math and biology, if that matters."

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts:**

* In the end, my old template got me my offer, but I got a lot more final rounds with my updated resume.
* I probably should have updated my resume a lot earlier.
* Always ask a lot of questions about the company and what work you would be doing exactly.
* I definitely should have started applying earlier.
   * I would probably have gotten a lot more callbacks if I did.
* I got really down during November/December, but don't give up!
* Hit me up if you have any questions."

I’m less than a year from finishing my second masters and I live in South Carolina, but am expecting to relocate after school to find work. This is assuming that my other half doesn’t get a solid position first, which as of now a UN internship is looking like it might become a full time position. However, proceed as if that was Not a factor in this currently just me planning to find work and expecting to relocate to just about anywhere (in the US).

Current Background and Education:

B.A. Intelligence and National Security studies
-Emphasis on information technology, intelligence communications, and cyber security.

-Published author of peer reviewed article through the European Intelligence Academy, relating to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.  

M.B.A. (Masters of Business Administration) 

Currently pursuing (pending graduation this coming December) an M.S. in Information Technology Management.

Essentially I’m in my mid-20s and have a varied background of service and other positions that helped me work full time as a full time student. I’m now approaching a point where I’ve decided I don’t want to pursue a doctorate and can’t seem to figure out what positions I can reasonably apply for with my background and little to no on paper experience. I do have extensive technical skills such as experience in coding, networking, graphic and web design, database architecture, and a few other areas. However, none of these skills can be tied to previous work and only some classes. However, I do have a solid portfolio if that would be helpful. I more than anything want to end up in the IT sector, but would also prefer to use the advantages of my MBA.


tl;dr - I have a lot of school background and no serious job experience. I’m really trying to get advice on what I can and should look for. Specifically in the technology/business sectors."

I have gotten resume help, advice with strategic career planning and general support just to name a few things.

I'd like to announce to you all that because of your help, I have been offered and have accepted an IT Operations and Technology internship for the Summer with a very well known storage device manufacturer making a wage that far eclipses anything I've ever made in my life in a location that is a perfect match for me. 

This is the beginning of the end of a life of poverty for me. I am the product of a single mother who raised 2 kids on a wage barely above the minimum. She didn't get any child support, got involved with drugs, got addicted, started selling, and went to prison sending my sister and I into the foster care system. She doesn't have a 4 year degree - in fact, no one in my family does. 

Because of all of this, it has taken me until I have reached 32 years of age to get to a point that I've learned what NOT to do, what TO do, and learn how to keep doing it. I was a 2.25 GPA student in HS. This is my second time in college - dropped out the first time. I tanked my GPA because I didn't withdraw from classes. I ruined my credit. I defaulted on my student loans, causing the IRS to garnish my federal tax returns until I got them out of default.

If you can relate at all to this story, please believe when I tell you that it is never too late to change your life. You don't have to be haunted everyday by past mistakes. But it takes hard work, discipline, and a plan to right the ship. If you've ever been told that you're 'smart' or 'gifted' by multiple people, but never had the confidence to take a chance and see if they're right, you owe it to yourself and to the world to find out.

Never stop learning. Never stop trying. Always have the utmost belief in yourself. Even when it's hard. Even if you have to fake it. Even if you feel like no one else believes in you, because I've had a lot of people in my life not believe in me and for a long time I believed them. It wasn't until I found this sub and the love of my life that I started thinking 'Hey, maybe I can do whatever it is I want to. Maybe I am smart enough. Maybe I do deserve to have a good life.' So, thank you all. Really.

TL;DR - It's never too late to change your life. I know you can do the thing."

ezl07r,2,2020-02-05,My family doesn't have good insurance and I worry that if I'm honest with a therapist or doctor about what I'm feeling they would involuntarily hospitalize me,everythingbagel459,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ezl07r/my_family_doesnt_have_good_insurance_and_i_worry/,"I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and attention deficit disorder when I was in 10th grade. I had been having building symptoms for 2 and a half years prior to the diagnosis. My parents chose not to medicate my depression and anxiety and sent me to therapy for a year instead.
 For a while after I got out of therapy everything was good. My entire junior year was great, I felt awesome and I was happy all the time. Then senior year rolled around and everything went to shit. My 12th grade year was just a massive shit show; I lost all but a handful of my friends due to drifting apart, I broke up with my boyfriend of 2 and a half years because he had been lying to me and avoiding me consistently, all four of my grandparents started dying from cancer, strokes and other health conditions, my dad lost his job, my parents and I constantly fought about college, my grades slipped, they thought my sister had a brain tumor for a month and a half, my dad and mom started having health issues, my aunt and uncle started having health issues, one of my friends was in an abusive relationship and started harming themselves, I had 2 AP courses, an internship, 4 extracurriculars, and then came the end of my senior year. 
I thought when I got out of school things would get better. Two weeks into summer, one of my friends committed suicide. I broke. I started having considerably self destructive behaviors. Within 24 hrs of the funeral, I had downloaded tinder, snuck out, and met up with someone 10 years my senior to have sex. I met up with that person twice more. Then I met someone who is only 7 years my senior and to this day, anytime I'm back in my home town, I meet up with him to fuck. I started smoking marijuana (its illegal to even have in my state). 
Then I moved away to college. The first night at college, my roommate (18 M) asked if I (18 F) wanted to get drunk. I said yes. I had never drank before and I gave myself alcohol poisoning. I don't remember anything that happened that night but according to my roommate I tried to have sex with him and threatened to drive back home if he didn't fuck me. I felt horrible and awful and I still cannot get over it to this day, even thought we didn't have sex. 
Ever since college started, things have gotten worse. My best friend moved 1500 miles away to her dream college, I haven't slept more than 4-5 hrs a night on average, within two weeks of college starting all four of my grandparents got hospitalized because of a life threatening event, I felt like I was swimming in molasses anytime I went to one of my classes, I struggled to get up in the mornings and was constantly sick. From the start of summer till now I have gone from 140lbs to 175lbs and I'm only 5'4"". I have struggled to make friends and have made friends with two people, neither of which I ever see or have classes with. 
I started going to the free therapy on campus but I felt like I couldn't be completely honest with them after the first couple of sessions because they told me they would hospitalize me involuntarily if I started talking about suicide or self harm. 
They put me on a medication, but it is an extremely low dose (5 mg) per my mothers orders (she's a nurse) and I feel like absolutely nothing has changed for the better even though I've been on it three months. 
I finished the first semester somehow, with horrible grades might I add, which may lead to me losing my scholarship and my place in the honors college if I do that badly this semester. 
This semester started and from the get go it has been 10 times worse. I constantly fail to show up to class because I can barely even force myself to drink water, let alone get out of bed. I was sick for a whole week and I'm already so behind. 
I have had nonstop fantasies about committing suicide. I sit in class and think about how and when I would do it. I started cutting myself again for the first time since tenth grade, my legs look like someone shredded them. 
I was gonna go to both of my roommates for help, both guys, both good friends from high school, but then one of their grandfathers died. I clammed up immediately and haven't said a word to either of them. I was going to kill myself over this past weekend. I was going to ask one of them to come with me to stop myself from doing it but they were both busy so I just got into my truck and drove. 
It was 8 pm when I left. I drove all the way to another state and back before I came back at almost midnight. On that drive I would constantly turn my headlights off and take both my hands off the wheel and lean back and close my eyes, hoping to hit a tree, but nothing happened. I never did it when another car was around, I didn't want to hurt other people, I wanted to hurt myself.
I didn't tell my roommates about that. 
I want to die. I don't want to be here anymore. But I don't want to abandon my best friend, my roommates, and my family. Those are the only things keeping me here right now, and everyday those attachments stretch a little thinner. 
I keep telling myself that I should go back to the doctor, that I should tell someone, that I should get help, but I'm absolutely terrified that I'm going to be involuntarily hospitalized and cost my family thousands of dollars. I'm worried that they are going to make me drop out of school and lose my scholarships. 
On the other hand I'm worried that if I do try to commit suicide, that I'll fail and leave my family with a huge mess and lots of bills. 
My brain is a mess. I can't focus. I can't sleep. I have been either starving myself or binge eating. I can't seem to do anything right and I feel so alone, even with my roommates and family. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if I feel 'sad' anymore. I just kind of feel blank. All the damn time. I don't want to do anything besides lie down in bed and never move again... 
I used to have dreams about my future, but I don't anymore. I wanted to be happily married with a fine job and a small house in a small neighborhood with a couple kids and a couple pets and now all I see is nothing. I don't think I would make a good partner or a good parent. I don't think I'm cut out for a job or for doing anything other than dying. 
I don't know what to do and I'm sorry this is a rambling mess, I can't really think straight anymore.

ezlo1b,2,2020-02-05,Fair use on internet photos,ChaseDevMac,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ezlo1b/fair_use_on_internet_photos/,"(Texas) Hey, I'm a college student that recently switched majors from mechanical engineering to computer science. I'm very far behind in the curriculum and everyone in the field and major has been telling me to spend the summer on personal projects (creating an app, website, etc.) since no one will hire me for an internship with such little computer science knowledge even with previous ME internship experience.

So, I got thinking. Why don't I make a quiz game about cars? Since that would blend two of my favorite things together. All the car quiz apps on Google Play and the AppStore suck, have very little content, have ugly UIs, etc. The game would have a picture of a car without its badges (i.e. photoshop out car logo/badge), but since I don't have an archive of pictures of every car in the world, I would like to use the internet to gather different viewpoints (sides, front, rear, top) of a bunch of vehicles. Obviously, these would be taken by photographers, companies, etc. and not by me, so I wouldn't own any of them. Would photoshopping just a small portion of a picture and using it in an app be against fair use/could I get in legal trouble if I were to make the app and put it on Google Play/AppStore? Does it depend on whether I monetize it (e.g. ads, one-time price) or not?

If you need to see a example image or any other information, just let me know.

Thank you!"

So I'll be graduating soon with a Bachelor's in Business Administration, majoring in both Marketing and Business Analytics.  I don't want to be a marketer.  I want to code.  I just want to know how to prove to employers that I know what I'm doing and can do as much as those that have a CS degree.

 I've done a few internships within marketing agencies as well as marketing divisions of large corporations but long-story short, *I hate marketing.*  It is just so boring for me and I honestly spend enough time on Twitter as is to be spending a fraction of my day writing *more* social media posts.  *Dislcaimer: that was just* ***one*** *of the things I did in some of these positions*.

**My webdev experience (WordPress/SquareSpace):**

* Built some WordPress and SquareSpace websites in the past (blogs and e-commerce stores) but never coded anything for them.
* I've worked with Google Analytics, Yoast, Moz, UberSuggest, and really any of the other digital marketing tools out there.

**My coding experience:**

* Learned Visual Basic in High School, gave me a great foundation to \[eventually\] build on.
* Solid understanding of HTML and CSS (if I don't know something, I can quickly find what I need on Google)
* Finished half of a JavaScript course on Udemy which ultimately led me to finding my love in computer science (I can finally begin to code *functional* websites!!!)
* Been working on many personal projects that, at the moment, only incorporate front-end coding but also utilize a ton of functions and a few classes.  One project is a digital game involving a pair of dice and 'chance'.
* Currently following Coding Train's JavaScript Data Structures and APIs playlist on YouTube.  Tackling back-end coding (fetch, JSON, POST/GET, etc.)
* Worked a *bit* with node.js-- I want to conquer back-end coding before I go full force on this.

**My questions for all of you:**

* What can make up for my lack of a CS degree on my resume?
* Are there other frameworks I should know before learning node.js?
* How important is understanding boolean algebra and proofs (I've seen these in my CS friends' homeworks).
* Are there things I should begin putting into practice.  I have a buddy working at Amazon that says he *whiteboards* everything.
* Should I practice coming up with wire frames?  I see IBM talk about it in one of their job descriptions.

These may be noob questions but I'm so naive to the CS field so hopefully I can get some good insight.

Thanks"

My only problem is that whenever I look on here or Indeed or just a casual google search for intro cs jobs, companies are looking for programmers who know front end, back end, fluent in multiple coding languages, basically a whole IT department in one person. I don't have any of that, I'm just a college cs student who is exploring Java at the moment. Does anyone have any companies that they recommend or stories of their early days of job searching and finding employers that were willing to teach them? I know that basically describes internships but I also seem to only find ones that again expect a whole IT department in one person. Am I looking in the wrong places? Should I focus on more mom and pop shops? Or should I just focus on my school and learn until I finally meet those companies requirements?"
ezmkj6,28,2020-02-05,"New Opportunity: Verifying your Organizations/Nonprofits/Projects for College Admissions and Finding ECs that are ""r/chanceme"" tier",CasusBellum,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/ezmkj6/new_opportunity_verifying_your/,"Hello all,

One thing I can see is that many students are looking to find ECs, and many of us are now juniors looking around posts to compare stats and schools.  I'm presenting an opportunity which I think can drastically change the admissions field, and also validate the very few of us who pursue organizational work and found nonprofits/businesses/organizations from the rest of the students faking these big-impact names for college admissions.

A big problem facing college admissions is confirming ECs.  One thing everyone knows is that colleges don't have the time to confirm all ECs.  Even a lie claiming an ""international nonprofit"" can go unnoticed at times.  Colleges aren't unaware of this, and this has subsequently devalued the creation of student run businesses, nonprofits, and organizations.  In truth, these student run endeavors are **very rare.**  Only about \~30% of the chance me posts made here who claim they have started one of these NPOs (nonprofits, businesses, organizations) have actually made a legal NPO and created impact.  No, your sneaker reselling isn't a business, its freelancing.  No, your group of friends that meet in the library don't constitute a community ""organization"".

That being said, student run NPOs are a huge effort and endeavor to start and run.  Like startups in the real world, only about \~10% of student NPOs are successful, largely because so many of them are started for college admissions purposes.  I think that NPOs are a great EC and an excellent way to pursue your interests.  **You don't have to be a founder**.  Many students are looking for ECs and opportunities beyond the traditional school clubs and groups.  Collaborating with many other students to build a legitimate NPO is how it should be done.

**The Opportunity**

RoundPier LLC is what I advocate for as the new ""LinkedIn"" for high schoolers.  RoundPier is a platform where you can input your hs resume and find internships, NPOs, and scholarships.  Many college summer programs (Eg) LaunchX, Wharton LBW) are also on the platform.  It is in its startup phase right now, which is why I'm eager to share this with y'all.

RoundPier is launching a new program called RoundPier Student Coalition.  The RSC helps student NPO leaders and EC-seeking students in these ways:

1. Helping students verify NPOs for college admissions:
   1. The RSC has a bronze-silver-gold-platinum tier on which it ranks NPOs based on members, impact, and online activity.  If your NPO is an RSC approved org, RP staff will do monthly reviews of your NPO to move up and down tiers as see fit.  For reference, there are about \~10 organizations in platinum only.  RP will also send letters to colleges you apply to verifying the work and impact of your NPO upon request.  This is also an honor rarely given.
2. Finding others to start NPOs
   1. Plenty of students want to found NPOs.  Some realize that they are restricted by their local community, and no one in their school wants to do it with them.  The more desperate students want to found an NPO with impact so badly, they lie and say that the NPO is international.
   2. Point being, many students want to found NPOs, but can't find the people to work with them.  I see so many posts of these students on A2C and chance me.  RoundPier is the platform for this: RP coalition is a place to find other incredibly motivated students to do this.  About 40% of RSC members are international as well.  And again, remember that RP can verify and help you with logistics for this project.
3. Reviving your NPO and collaborating with other NPOs
   1. As said previously, \~10% of student NPOs are successful.  It is **very difficult** to keep an online NPO with members across states/provinces/countries together.  It is much more likely to succeed if: 1) you merge with another NPO or 2) you recruit more devoted people.  RoundPier appeals to and hosts the top 10% of students (who else would use ""LinkedIn for high schoolers).  It is very easy to recruit from the site, a student I know personally got 8-9 interview requests for his NPO within 48 hours after posting.  There are students from Europe, Africa, and Asia on the platform.
   2. Being affiliated with RSC will get your NPO more recognition, if you can demonstrate adequate impact and organization within your NPO.
4. Becoming a student leader/ambassador for RoundPier
   1. I wouldn't expect this to appeal to many people, but some people are quite devoted to helping out their school community.  RP supports and endorses students at schools to attend RSC webinars and encourage students to use RP to find ECs and opportunities.  If you feel like founding an RP club (pseudo-career corner) at your school, this may be up your alley.
5. **(For all students)** College and Summer Program Recruitment
   1. RP is a hub for college and summer program recruitment.  Students who create RP profiles in general put themselves out there, just like LinkedIn, for colleges to examine.  Its not like putting down your email for CollegeBoard to blast you with random college emails, RP is a more extensive and in-depth recruiting process.  We've had colleges reach out to students personally, and chat with students about attending their universities.  You won't get email blasted, you may talk to AOs personally if they reach out, and you may even get scholarship offers based on your profile.
   2. I have to redact the name of this program, but RSC has had a competitive summer program (\~12% acceptance rate) directly recruit students from RP based on their EC profiles and stats as listed on RP.  I wouldn't be surprised if programs like TASP and RSI in the future do the same, considering that TASP already recruits using college board PSAT scores.

So why is RP doing this?  Whats the catch?

RP's mission concurrently is to gather a high proportion of top high schoolers on a site, which would be another hub of recruitment for colleges and summer programs.  It also attempts to solve many problems of college admissions, like the aforementioned verification for NPOs.  Eventually, it'll come to embody the phrase: ""If it ain't on RP, it ain't real"".

RSC is free, and the only requirement is that NPOs admitted to RSC have all their members onboard onto RP for logistics purposes.

**How do I join?**

As mentioned in the event time in this post description, RP is hosting an information session on Saturday. 10am-11am EST.  It is being held over Zoom.  To access the RSC webinar, you must also create an RP account with details at [roundpier.com](https://roundpier.com).  A zoom link will be posted on this post at 2/8 9:50 am EST.  All are welcome to join the info webinar.  RP has invited me to host this webinar, which I am glad for to spread the word to r/chanceme.

ezn8yf,263,2020-02-06,Got Into My Dream School But Ended Up At My Safety (My Story),Critical-Newt,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ezn8yf/got_into_my_dream_school_but_ended_up_at_my/,"Hey guys,
With acceptance/rejection season just around the corner I just wanted to share a little bit of my story because I ended up doing something kind of unconventional and I figured that maybe sharing it could help someone who is currently in the same boat that I was once in.

For background; I’m from rural Oklahoma. I graduated  high school in 2017 and I was valedictorian in my class of 400 students, took 10 AP classes, was involved in numerous extracurriculars, the whole 9 yards. So I was your basic stressed out over achiever just like most of the other people on this thread lol. I moved to rural Oklahoma halfway through my freshman year and I absolutely hated it. All throughout high school I was addicted to the YouTube channels of girls who went to elite schools and lived on their own in exciting cities such as New York and LA. Around me, my family was going through some difficult circumstances and I wanted to break away from it and pretend that I was someone else. Going to college was supposed to be my chance for a fresh start and the beginning of a new identity. That’s probably why I spend a good portion of high school worshiping NYU, prematurely planning my college life in NYC. 

So senior year rolls around the acceptances start rolling in. If anyone wants my complete list of acceptances and rejections along with stats then I can post them in the comments but for now I’ll just skip it. As you can probably tell from the title, I got into NYU. I told as many teachers as I could and I’m not going to lie, hearing the congratulations was low key addictive. It felt like validation that my years of anxiety hadn’t been for nothing, that my life was no longer going to be dictated by the circumstances of where I was and that I finally had some sense of control over my life. Unfortunately around this same time my parents also began the process of a nasty divorce. During the divorce it was discovered that my father had spent most of my college saving on his mistress and I was left with virtually nothing. Despite this I was still willing to take on student loans however my parents refused to cosign them. 

Overnight nearly all of the possible futures I had envisioned were destroyed. Now there was only one school which I could afford, a small local school which had granted me a full scholarship. It was dead last on my list of schools and it was my safety. I felt like I was going to disappoint all of the teachers who said that they were proud of me for getting into NYU. I felt like I was failing everyone’s expectations. To make matters worse, many of my other friends were going to prestigious out of state schools and I felt like they would look down on me. 

Fast forward a few years later and I have to say that going to the smaller school was probably one of the best decisions I have ever made. Going through school without debt has been one of the biggest blessings in my life. Instead of putting my money towards paying off debt, I’m hoping to spend my twenties using some of my money for small luxuries such as travel. Furthermore, the small university ended up being extremely flexible with my credit hours and I’m expected to graduate in three years instead of four. I also love the smaller campus because I’ve really gotten to intimately know all of my professors which has really come in handy when it comes to letters of recommendation. And at the end of the day, I feel like not going to a prestigious school really hasn’t impacted my long term goals. Currently I’m a Fulbright semifinalist (I’ll hear the final results sometime in the spring), I’ve taken on a number of great internships, I got a full scholarship to study abroad in China one summer, and I’m currently in my 4th year of working for an NBA team (my long term goal is to either be a sports executive or work for the State Department). 

At the end of the day I still have A LOT of regrets from my experience with the college admission system and going back there’s a number of things I would’ve done differently. But I think I’ve landed on my feet. So I guess my overall message is that you can’t plan out everything. I guarantee that no matter how many times you write out your five year plan, somewhere along the way life is going to happen and you’re going to get thrown off course. But it’s okay, if you keep a clear head then I promise you’ll eventually land on your feet. I know college admissions is like this huge thing for you right now, but at the end of the day the school you go to doesn’t really mean much. Nowadays many employers value practical work experience over educational prestige. I’ve personally known college dropouts that are making six figures and Ivy League graduates which are making near minimum wage. If you go to your dream school then that’s great! But if you don’t then it’s not the end of the world. 

Feel free to ask me anything below about my whole college ordeal or about admissions in general!

TLDR: Got into my dream school but I ended up on a completely different path."

She's been going to her internship for about three months, and because it stressed her out so much I decided to grab her a drink in the evening. Her drink of choice was cold glasses of full fat milk.

A few days later she said she wasn't feeling very well, she'd have cramps in her stomach, her acne increased a lot and she wasn't feeling well overall. Yall might have connected things by now, I didn't. I thought it must be stress or her oncoming period that caused these symptoms, and so did she.

This little ritual of me getting milk for her went on until yesterday evening, when I got her another glass. We were joking around about me forcing milk on her, because she is stubborn and didn't want it because I was the one who ordered it to her. She said: ""gimme that goddamn milk"" she started drinking, looked at me and said: ""which milk is this?"". You know, me and my girlfriend trust each other, a lot. And so she trusted me with grabbing the lactose free milk, instead of the full fat one. You see, my girlfriend is lactose intolerant. A little something that I, in fact, had forgotten until that very moment. She saw the gaze of horrific realisation in my face, which confirmed her suspicion.

At the end it did make us laugh a lot, and she's happy to know that there wasn't some underlying disease going on. But she's also very happy that she doesn't have to feel sick anymore.

Tl;Dr: i forgot my girlfriend is lactose intolerant, so I fed her full fat milk for over a month."

I'm about to finish my undergrad in Computer science and I've been half heartedly applying for internships.

The problem I face is motivating myself when I have no idea how much of my effort in trying to write a customized application actually results in better chances of getting an interview.

How much time would you recommend on spending per application on motivation letters, specific questions, cover letters etc.

For example, I was applying for a job for cybersecurity firm, and they had questions like 

&gt;What excites you about security?
Tell us about a problem in security that interests you and a proposed solution* 

&gt;Please briefly (i.e. in less than 100 words) summarise your programming experience so far.* 

&gt;Tell us how you stand out from other people doing your course* 

&gt;Describe a piece of security related news or research you have seen recently that you found interesting and explain why it interests you.* 

You really can't answer questions like these in half an hour, but then again is there any point into investing two hours if my chances of getting an interview (let alone passing it) are going to be near 0.

Another issue I find is while I may endure working somewhere I wouldn't like to say to gain experience, how am I supposed to present myself as wanting to work there."

I will graduate one year late and I'm also taking 2 classes over the first half of this summer. I have two previous internships that aren't related to software engineering really at all. I also have lots of extracurricular experience within the public policy and pre-law sphere at my college. My question mainly is about what I should do with my second half of this summer. I could potentially try and do research, or just self teach and grind leet code in order to prepare for the fall recruitment season. I haven't tried to apply to software engineering internships as I have no experience and they would need to be a duration of 8 weeks, which is pretty much impossible to find. Should  I really make an effort to get an internship for the second half of the summer or just reset and wait until fall? I'm not sure how I should feel about my position currently, on the one hand I had an adviser tell me I'm actually in good shape for future internship and job opportunities, as I have a unique background that makes me stand out from the crowd of most CS people who have similar resumes. But I'm not sure if this was just BS. Oh one final thing, is it necessary to get involved in CS clubs on campus? I'm involved in some orgs I really enjoy but none of them are particularly relevant to CS."

In a few month i will be doing my first internship in Google (which is outside of my country), but it will last only for 3 months. For now i haven’t done any full-time job in the IT-company (doing only personal  and group projects) and i won’t get one till this summer. 

I was wondering, should i get a job (to gain experience) after the summer if i hope to spend the next summer also doing some internship at the product company (outside of my country), since thus i will have only about 8 months to work (many companies in my city require to work at least for a year at them) or will i get enough experience just by doing short-time internships till graduation?

I was also thinking about getting some short-time remote job, are there some good resources for it?

I know that my question may seem a little bit ahead of time and silly, but i hope to read different opinions on the matter, if its better to do internships at product companies during breaks or stick to the full-time outsource job till the graduation."

I'm a Junior at my University studying Software Engineering and I'm looking for an internship this summer. I started my search about a month ago and I have applied to around 50 places, basically all are internships, the other couple are jobs that advertise no experience required.

My resume has been torn through and improved upon but I have still only heard back from roughly 5 places rejecting me.

I'm getting married in April and I'm getting really stressed looking for an internship because I need the money but nothing is solid yet. I know there are more jobs out there than posted online, like a lot more.

Should I calm down and be patient? Is there anything I can continue to do to get noticed since following up on sites like handshake and LinkedIn are kinda hard?"

I am a first year student at Delhi University and just found this (internship?) opportunity.The course content looks pretty good. I'm very much interested in data science.

The course duration is of 45 days where 30 days will be online training and the rest 15 days will be in IIT Kanpur. 

Can anyone share their experience with such courses? Am I just better off doing a course from Coursera instead of this one?

Thanks!"
ezxblt,1,2020-02-06,PTSD- the reason and why I feel stupid about it,Niyanii,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ezxblt/ptsd_the_reason_and_why_i_feel_stupid_about_it/,"A few weeks ago I got diagnosed with PTSD. I always thought that you could only get PTSD from a life and death situation. My PTSD however was caused by a shit supervisor at my graduation internship in 2018, and I feel really stupid about it.

My boss/supervisor basically made it a sport to try to shit as much on me as possbile. He started out as a very good supervisor I guess. Trying to help me, and teaching me new stuff, but after 2 months, something happened and no matter how hard I tried. Everything I did was garbage. He basically started wearing me down until the end of my internship. When he was nice to me, he made sexual jokes (sometimes involving me). I started having panick attacks in the bathroom every time he wanted to talk to me about something.

At the end of my internship he had to grade my work and my thesis which I was writing while I was doing my internship there. I needed at least a 7,5 to keep my gpa as high as it was to get admitted to the masters degree I wanted to do.

The day that he graded me came, and he started out talking about how I did not do my work well and how he never got the feeling that he got to know me. He told me that he talked to colleagues and was very confused that I was more open and talkative with other employers than with him, and that everyone had a different impression of me. He stated that I might had to go see a psychologist because he thought I had a multiple personality disorder. I don't remember the rest of the conversation very well honestly. Only that he graded me a 6 and I went home early and very upset. 

Eventually everything worked out when I got to talk to my professors/ graduation supervisor from college. They assured me that they were not going to let him grade me, as I told them my experience. Luckily they knew me well so they knew that the description of my internship supervisor could not be accurate. So in the end I did get into the masters of my choice. 

Fast forward a few months and I was still dealing with immens amounts of stress that I had to decide to take a gap year before my masters. I started seeing a psychologist (not for the personality disorder,  my supervisor kindly suggested that I had) beucase I was still dealing with panick attacks at my part time retail job I was taking in my gap year. Every time my boss wanted to talk to me, I suffered from panick attacks. Things eventually got slightly better and my psychologist decided I was doing fine and discontinued my treatment. When I started my masters in 2019, shit went down hill again. I had so much stress that I trembled when the exam weeks came around, and I was suffering from panic attacks again. 

This time I sought out another psychologist as I changed from GP. (Insurance things from the country I live in)After a few session my psychologist has diagnosed me with PTSD and an anxiety disorder. As the waiting times here are very long, I have to wait to the end of this months untill I start my treatment with EMDR.

Right now I feel trapped in a hole I can't get out of. I feel really stupid that a situation like that gave me PTSD. A normal person could just be like, fuck it. I don't agree, you are a dick and move on. But I feel weak for it to have such an impact on me. 

The feeling of stuckness stems from the fact that I feel incapable of doing anything. I get panic attacks when I get the feeling there is too much pressure on me, so persuing my masters degree is proving to be very difficult like this. Also I am afraid to start working in the professional field as everytime I am confronted with an 'authority figure' (basically my boss wanting to talk to be for any reason) I get panic attacks. 

I hope that things will start looking up in a few months with the treatment. I just needed to vent somewhere honestly. I feel very alone and ashamed. My boyfriend and parents are here for me but they don't felly get it.  I also had to delay my masters for another year as it has been proven to be very difficult to study with all the stress and panic attacks. 

Anyhow thanks for reading."

I have two offers right now. One of the them is a huge data company (not FANG, but well known) and the other is a small startup in my city. I was considering taking the large corporation for the name on the resume, but this startup is doing some pretty cool stuff, they are small (\~50ppl) but have almost 5 mil monthly users which my work would directly impact + better culture, more stuff to work on etc. Salaries are similar, big corp is in another city but no problem for me as I have family there. Also if I took the bigger company it would only be for summer, and since I am in a co op program I could potentially do a fall internship w/ a different company as well after the summer. Startup is for 8 months (both fall and summer).

What do you guys recommend? Love to hear your opinions. Thanks folks :)."

If I stay in the US, there might be a chance that I would have to leave after my degree and be barred from coming back for 10 years. I wouldn't be able to get internships during this time, so I'd gain experience doing research. However, if I go to Waterloo, there's still no guarantee that I'd be able to work in the US.  

Is the Stanford/MIT degree worth the possibility of not being able to work in the US for 10 years? I would ideally finish a masters with a focus in AI. I heard there are pretty high paying jobs at Google or Facebook for ML engineers in Canada. But their salaries are much lower than bay area salaries, right?"

ezy9pr,54,2020-02-06,Knucklebones,Summerisle_Apples,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ezy9pr/knucklebones/,"  People are surprised to learn I’m superstitious. I don’t walk under ladders or cross someone coming the opposite way on the stairs, and I try to avoid scheduling important stuff for Friday 13th. It isn’t something I always did; in fact, I can pinpoint exactly what made me believe in this stuff. It happened when I was interning at the British Museum back in the late 1990s.

  I was working on my Master’s degree in Conservation. Landing the British Museum summer job made me the envy of everyone on my course, and I hoped it would help me immensely when I graduated. After all, you don’t get much more prestigious than that! It housed one of the most impressive collections of Ancient Greek and Roman artefacts in the world – the time period I was most interested in.

  I’d been through the initial training and was working on my first exhibition, ‘Growing Up Roman: Childhood in the Ancient World’. As an intern, my job was to make sure the objects were properly documented when they were moved from their original collections, and to correctly display and label them. 

  Even after so much time studying and handling objects, there was still something incredible about touching these ancient wonders. I held coins that were newly made in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. I spent time labelling a beautiful lunula, a crescent-shaped pendant that a Roman girl would have worn to scare off evil spirits. In times like that, completely lost in this fascinating task, it felt like I was communicating with the long-dead. It’s the feeling that made me choose to go into object conservation in the first place. My fellow intern, Dave, didn’t seem to share my awe for these artefacts. He spent most of the time humming his favourite rock tunes loudly. I was so engrossed that I successfully tuned him out, on this occasion at least.

  The exhibition had sections on Education, Preparing for Adulthood, Clothing and Games. It was in the latter that I discovered the knucklebones.

  Today we call the game “jacks” or “fivestones”. Most kids today will have played it at some point: five small objects, usually plastic, which you flip into the air or try to catch on the back of your hand. The rules vary widely. In some cases, you might bounce a rubber ball and try to pick up as many of the jacks as you can before it lands.
 
  The Romans called it “tali”. Again, there were many variations, with some sets marked so that you could throw them in the air and score them when they landed according to what was written on them. Though most were simple children’s sets, there were some that seemed to have been used for fortune telling. The rules for that had, alas, been lost to the ages.

  The set I got was remarkable for two reasons. One was how well-preserved it was. Made of actual bone, probably from a sheep, it had crudely inscribed marks on each knucklebone. The cloth bag it was kept in was miraculously still intact, albeit tatty and in need of especially careful handling.

  The second is that it was from Pompeii, the tragic city of 79 AD eruption fame. Usually it would have been destroyed by the disaster, but luckily for us – or unluckily, depending on your perspective on my story – this particular set had been protected by quite a sturdy box. It was most likely among a child’s playthings. What became of the child, the family, the rest of the toys and all the other possessions in their house, we didn’t know – but we could make guesses, all of them gloomy. Holding the fragile set in my hands, I thought it so eerie that a family’s entire existence could be recorded only by the unlikely survival of one of their kid’s toys.

  “Sad, isn’t it?” Dave said, bringing me out of my reverie. He nodded at the artefact in my hands and I was impressed – he wasn’t usually one for sentimentality.

  “Yes. This was all that survived of that house.”

  “No, I mean it’s sad how we’ve got these toys. They were made to be played with, but we’re here putting them behind glass and treating them like -”

  “Like – museum pieces? Like irreplaceable pieces of history?”

  Not for the first time, I wondered why Dave had pursued a career in conservation anyway. I suspect he had connections that had got him the internship, although I never asked for fear of coming across like a jerk. He grabbed the knucklebones out of my hands before I could react.

  “I just think that - now and again - we should treat these things as the fun toys they were designed as.”

  With that, he grabbed a handful of the bones, threw them in the air, and caught a couple on the back of his hand. A few others clattered on to the table between us.

  Furious, I snatched the pieces off his hand and swore at him.

  “Wow, wow, Annie! That’s the first time I’ve heard you swear.”

  Truly, I wanted to punch him. Instead I gathered all of the tali set together and moved it as far from the idiot Dave as possible. He walked out soon after – leaving me to finish off the labelling, incidentally – and I didn’t speak to him for the rest of the day.

  I was just finishing up for the evening when our supervisor poked her head into the room and told me about Dave’s accident. He’d been on a stepladder taking down an old exhibition board when he’d fallen quite suddenly and broken his leg. The stepladder seemed to have shut itself, somehow. Dave would be withdrawing from his internship at this point. I felt guilty about the relief that flooded me, despite the extra work it would mean.

  Just before I left for the day, I had a quick glance at the parts of the exhibition I’d set up that afternoon. I was stunned to see the knucklebones out of their sack, when I could have sworn I’d put them in the bag with the opening wide enough for people to see the set. They were in a pile now, the bag neatly folded, with one piece on its own away from the others. I could tell from the markings it was one of the pieces Dave had caught on his hand. I shook it off, but with some difficulty, and put the set back as I thought I’d left it.

  That night I couldn’t get the thought of the tali set out of my head. It seemed ridiculous to assume it had anything to do with Dave’s accident, but the idea settled in my mind and wouldn’t budge. I pictured it in the middle of Pompeii’s destruction, surrounded by death, absorbing negativity. Absurd, I know, but the image stuck with me.

  The next day my supervisor called me in before I started for the day. She was kind, but said she was puzzled I would leave artefacts in the state I had the night before.

  “I don’t need to tell you how irreplaceable something like those knucklebones are,” she scolded, in the manner of a parent reminding a child to close the fridge door in future.

  I somehow knew what I would find before I went back to the display: the tali set was scattered all over the other exhibits, the empty bag tossed carelessly to one side. Fearing a break in – still clinging to the logical answer! - I looked over the CCTV footage for the night before, but it didn’t show anyone entering or exiting the room after I left. A chill wound its way up the back of my neck.

  The set needed to go back into storage; that much was clear. I set about collecting up the knucklebones before opening time. Each one gave off a strange heat and I had to put them down a couple of times, but I was determined not to be spooked out of my mission. If I never saw those bones again, it would still be too soon.

  When I had my last handful and was about to drop them into the bag, something stopped me. I paused without knowing why. It was as if my hands were possessed. Without thinking what I was doing, I threw the last few in the air, spun my hand around, and caught three on the back. They glowed again, heat emanating from them, until I jerked my hand away. There was a slight burn across my knuckles.

  That’s when I heard the crash. There were a couple of seconds of stunned silence, then a chorus of screams.

  I later learned that some scaffolding in another part of the museum had collapsed at the exact moment I threw the knucklebones. It had been put up there for roof repairs, and the company who erected it would have no idea how so many safety features had come loose at once. “A perfect storm, freak accident”, they called it. Five people were treated in hospital, all of them with broken bones.

  The tali set went back into storage that morning, replaced by some other Roman artefacts. I saw out the rest of my internship, got my reference and breathed a sigh of relief on my last day. I’ve questioned these events every day in the years since. Of course, it may have been a collection of odd coincidences – but I’ll never forget the warm sensation those bones made on the back of my hand, or the way that a previously sensible trainee conservator like me felt compelled to throw an ancient artefact in the air like that. 

  I work with ancient Egyptian objects in my current role at a quiet, regional museum. I enjoy the slower pace. The objects are rife with supposed curses, so I’m always careful – just in case, you understand. And I never open exhibitions on a Friday 13th."

Im currently looking for paid internships, and have been getting rejected like mad. However, its still middle of application season, so I havent completely given up yet. So far, the only company that wants me is a small business, adjacently related to my Econ degree which I want to focus on. Ive made a pro cons list, and was wondering if any redditors with more experience could help me out. 

Pros: 

* Its more closely related to my econ degree than my other jobs
* The founder, who did my interview and who I'll be working under, previously help positions as an investment analyst, which is what I want to do when I graduate 
* Shes writing a paper rn ,so if it gets published I might get my name on there, since a bulk of my job seems to be helping her research 
* Its located in my home city, so I wont have to sublet an apartment. 
* General piece of mind as I can stop worrying about internships/summer jobs. It also probably looks better than my backup plan of a summer work-study job at my uni
* I want the experience, and she mentioned that she might pay me later on

Cons: 

* Its unpaid, so if I accept Ill probably have to work a second job 
* Its a small company that ive never heard of, so not much brand recognition there.  
* Im still applying for other internships and going to career fairs right now 
* She mentioned that she'll be traveling alot, so I guess a bulk of the work will be remote? 
* I think she wants me to work during the school year as well, which would be hard. Im already taking five classes and working part-time
* Ive been burned by unpaid positions in small companies before, and im kinda sus"

I'm currently a student in Community College in Cybersecurity. I've worked two jobs in school that were just to help pay for school. It was warehouse work. I've been applying for internships for months and have not heard anything back. Same with job applications in my field of interest. I'm taking all online classes so I'm basically home all day doing school and applying. It's been the most depressing few months of my life. It's starting to take a toll on my school, as I'm finding it hard to find motivation to do pretty much anything. I'm someone who is driven by money. It sounds bad, but if I can earn money or work my way up, I'll work my butt off. But with no income right now I've gotten really depressed.

So that brings me to mine idea. I have always dreamed of starting a business and being able to be my own boss. I want to start something in Cybersecurity and prove my work experience, without having any jobs in it. I don't know if it's feasible or even a smart idea. Basically I'm just really lost right now and my mental state has been diminishing everyday because it feels like no one in my field wants to hire me. It feels like it's all been for nothing so far. Basically it seems like the only way to prove myself is by starting something myself, but I don't know how to go about it."

I love coding and working with tech.

I'm currently in my final year at university.  I recently accepted a summer internship offer as a software engineer at an investment bank.  The pro-rata pay for the role is close to 45k and the graduate role (if I were to convert) starts at around 50k.

However, recently I have been contemplating whether or not I should have chosen to pursue a career in a front office role like trading.  My long term goal is to work at a FAANG company, but I know this will be a tough pursuit. 

I worked really hard to get this internship, but now when I hear of others getting front office roles I question whether or not I should have done something similar.  

Any advice on how to get over/think about this differently?"

f02tnm,11,2020-02-06,I was once visited by a moth-shaped demon...,JustChillaxMan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f02tnm/i_was_once_visited_by_a_mothshaped_demon/,"People say that your dreams are a portal to other realms, other existences, or a place where deceased loved ones come to bring you messages. In that “tunnel” to the other side is also a risk of being exposed to night terrors, sleep paralysis, or other manifestations. Sometimes, it really isn’t just your imagination.

I had one in mid college.

I have always been an avid insect fan, particularly butterflies and moths. I find them to be fascinating in all ways and I’m only sad that people think such terrible things towards moths and usually end up killing or hurting them. Really, they’re from the same family Lepidoptera.

Except the one that manifested that night.

I was getting into bed and I distinctly remember how my older sister had already left to her internship during her MA studies in college. We grew up sharing trundle beds and a single room and it felt more empty without her there. I remember how the room was organized to this day - my bed parallel to the bedroom doorway, the computer shelf on the other side of my feet by the wall, the closet to my opposite left and the dresser drawer beside it to the left between the closet and the doorway. The window with my curtains was to my left as well. I remember getting into bed and covering myself with my four blankets (because I do get cold easily).

That night I fell asleep without feeling like I fell asleep. It was like I merged with another time zone, another evening in another existence and yet it was the same room, same house, same bed and same me. I remember seeing my mother get out from her bedroom across the hallway from my room. She told me something about checking on the neighbor across the street because at the time our next door neighbor was having medical problems in his old age. Apparently this was still true in the dream.

She got up in her gray joggers and put on her slip on shoes and told me she’d be right back. She opened the old wooden door to the front of the house and unlocked our wrought-iron screen door and left down the sidewalk. The darkness outside was strong and as she walked away she seemed to disappear in it. I waited by the screen door and looked out into the dead silence of the night. It was not a normal dark night. There wasn’t even a single star above. There was only the porch light to my left on the old brick porch wall and the salt yellow light illuminating the ivy we had growing there for years. The same flower pot sat in front by the porch entrance and the same wooden support beams stood alone.

As I waited for my mom to come back, something flew up to the porch out of the shadows. It was a large black moth with deep red eyes. No light shone off of its body or wings. It was thick with a girthy hairy body and legs and it passed my porch light. I got scared and ran away from the door and back to bed where I jumped under my covers. I had hoped it would go away before my mom came back. It didn’t leave. It flew menacingly through my screen door and into my den. Then, it went and turned to the right down my hallway. It seemed to know where I was.

When it entered my room I saw those deep red eyes glowering in the dark of my room and it immediately transformed at the foot of my bed into a tall grimacing figure. The face was a deep red skull with blurred eyes like hollow sockets. It resembled a reaper, shrouded in darkness as it looked before me.

I opened my eyes and there I was in my bed. Same bed and position as the sheets in my dream. There it was at my feet - the same creature in my visions. It had actually manifested out of my dreams and into my actual room. The face was focused on me and I was frozen with dear. Clearly, it had come to disturb me. I remember screaming for help hoping my mother would wake up and thankfully, she heard me and ran down the hall into my room where she saw me curled up on the bed.

I explained to her what happened and she prayed for me that night. I slept well the rest of the evening and the next day when I left for class, there was a large dead moth by my doorstep. Not kidding either. It was one of those black witch moths."

I have posted my resume below, because I can't think of any other place where I could be going wrong, as I don't seem to even pass the first level of filtering. I have shown my resume to a lot of people, and everyone tells me to make small changes here and there. Even after doing so, I have found no luck.

I’m in my final year at my university studying mechanical engineering. It’s been 6 years. A journey to say the least. I don’t have much knowledge of the corporate world and need some info.


Anyway here are my “employable stats”-

-I have decent experience with popular programs (CAD/MATLab etc...)

-worked on a few projects utilizing a lot of programs and research

-senior design project

-hard skills-3-D printing/milling

-Working on the FE exam at the moment 

 I have no internship experience 😫 and my GPA is 2.7



A friend of mine that works for a BIG defense/space contractor, you can probably guess haha. Anyway he’s been working there for 3 years, he’s actually in really good standing with the company (based on the awards/projects I seen).

He told me a year ago he can get me a job with his company when I graduate but I should aim for above a 3.0 GPA. Life happens and currently I’m at 2.7 GPA not the best I know.


My question is how the process works when you’re referred by a current employee. Will they not put a lot of emphasis on my GPA? Will I just be guaranteed an interview at the least? How likely will I even get the job? 

Basically how far can an employee go to get a friend/family member etc... hired. How does this work? I’d like to hear some stories or some advice on this. I’d appreciate it!"

First he wanted me to use PXE, which successfully installed the OS.

Then he wanted me to install the same OS on a different partition using a disc. I burned the ISO to the CD, at first it worked but I mistakenly chose the non-desktop version. So I wanted to retry installing with a standard desktop version, but it won't let me try again as the ""media driver is missing"". I can't even see the drives. 

I tried insterting the disk on my PC running windows 10, and booted via CD-Room and got no issue with the disc (I can see the different versions and my partitions. 

I even tried producing another disk to no avail. I'm quite sure that the ISO is not corrupted. Can anyone help? Please."
f04abu,1,2020-02-06,College Senior/intern looking for advice from some experienced folks,ok-yes24,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f04abu/college_seniorintern_looking_for_advice_from_some/,"Hey guys, I'm in an oddly specific situation and would really appreciate some advice or input. I'm a college Senior and have been working as an intern for the past 7 months as a software developer. The company is mainly an industrial control systems company but also does software systems for their clients in .NET and C#. They gave me a full time offer contingent upon graduation this year which I accepted because of good pay and because I like my coworkers. So I'm still interning and will be joining full time when I graduate this Summer. But now I'm concerned I'm learning a dying side of development (desktop) and am setting myself up poorly for the start of my career. 

For example, the project I'm on now is something called an MES system used by a manufacturer written in C# and WPF as a desktop application along with a heavy amount of SQL, stored procedures, and web reporting written in Visual Basic and SQL that runs in Internet Explorer. My main work environment is a Windows Server 2012 VM as that's what OS the propriety software my current project uses runs on. This software is only used in the control systems industry.

I've learned and grown as a developer just during my time as an intern, even delivering full fledged sprint items for the project, but I'm worried about future jobs. Job postings in my local job market are all Asp.Net or .Net Core web applications with technologies like Entity and frontend frameworks like Angular. I know virtually nothing about MVC web apps or anything of the like. I've done some basic HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a little php for school. I'm trying to learn asp.net in my spare time and I can do it but it's pretty overwhelming at first.

I was excited recently because as this project winds down (although they want me to work on it through the end of 2020) some of my team members are branching into RESTful web projects and building APIs. After talking to a team member though, he said they're using something called WFC instead of asp.net. I looked into it and it seems very old and I've never seen a job posting for it. Some other projects seem to use niche languages or technologies. 

I'm thinking about staying for a year to gain at least a year of full time experience while learning web applications with asp.net and .net core in the background and then making a move. 

I'm just very confused and concerned at this point in my career. I guess I'm asking what you think the best thing for me to do is? Move after a year? I'm also concerned trying to apply for a asp.net position after 1-2yrs experience working with my company now as the technologies and information seem radically different. I'd feel weird applying to a job asking for 1-3yrs asp.net experience and I'd have no professional web experience. Would I need to look for a more junior entry level position? It seems like a waste considering most people in the field are able to get a pay raise with roughly 2yrs experience which I'd have at that point. 

I'll admit this may come off as naive or even nit picky. I'm just trying to make sure I don't run into a dead end. Thanks for the read and for any comments!"
f04fxj,1,2020-02-06,IT Help Desk -&gt; Junior DevOps / Entry level Cloud roles?,VapesfromBible,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/f04fxj/it_help_desk_junior_devops_entry_level_cloud_roles/,"Help Desk to Junior DevOps?

I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems and spent the past 3 years in IT Support / Help Desk roles. I gained a great bit of knowledge and experience working in those roles as an intern (at a Fortune 500, at a Wealth/Finanace Company, and at a MSP). 



I was lucky enough to accept a great job out of college doing IT &amp; Software Support. About 5 months in, I realize that my heart really isn't in doing Tier 1 type Help Desk stuff (resetting passwords, program installs, recovering emails). I am starting to work with the software support team and realize all of these guys have a lot of coding knowledge in work in DevOps type roles. I figured I worked too hard in college and spent most of that time busting my butt interning to just be complacent with a job doing low level work. I am thankful for where I ended up... but I want to continue learning and climbing the ladder rather than be complacent. 



My goal was to start studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. After that, I wanted to grab a better understanding and study up on Linux (I have minor knowledge in Linux atm). After I got those 2 down - I wanted to dedicate my time learning Python and automation.



Is this a good learning track towards a Junior role? Has anyone moved out of a Help Desk role into a Junior DevOps role?



All suggestions help!! Thanks!

I got interviewed back in October and I got notified by phone that I got accepted in November. I did their background check and they reassured me that I would get my offer letter soon, but I would likely be starting in early January.

Fast forward December, I asked them for an update and they said that they were still working on a few things.

Finally, end of January, they tell me that my supervisor quit and no one is replacing her. They tell me that maybe a position will be open a week from now but in another department that's not really in my field.

Since I'm normally a full-time student, I didn't take any classes for this semester since I thought I had an internship; the deadline to add any classes had then passed. I had stopped applying to other internships and even rejected a few offers. 

It's now been a month and I have yet to receive any good news.

I could sue but I honestly think it's not worth my time and money.

I don't really know where I was going with this, I just needed to rant."
f05i6o,4,2020-02-06,25 and feeling completely lost and scattered,Background_Theory,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/f05i6o/25_and_feeling_completely_lost_and_scattered/,"Hey everyone,

I graduated with a BS in biochemistry and got an internship at a big biotech company in San Francisco right out of college in a supplier quality role. If I'm completely honest I had no idea what the job would be like but accepted it because it gave me a chance to go live in a big city. 

I was considering graduate schools but then got a contractor job in the same company that paid more as a customer service representative. Also had no idea what it was like, so I tried it for a few months, didn't like it and wanted to consider moving and graduate school, but then got a call for a contract job as a project coordinator. 

Also had no idea what that involved so I took it because I wanted to explore it because it also paid more and since it was only 6 months would let me save, but wanted to start some kind of graduate school to get the ball rolling, so I picked a program that had a hybrid option, could be done part-time online then I could move to finish the degree full-time in person. Then they extended my contract and then finally gave me a full-time role with benefits. I thought I'd be thrilled so I accepted but I then realized I truthfully don't feel connected to the school or subject matter with online classes (The main campus is based in Boston and I'm on the West Coast so the time zone difference makes everything difficult and it's expensive) and looking down the current career path I'm on I'm realizing I don't want to become a project manager either. Putting me in a shitty position where I'm trapped between a job I don't like and enrolled online for a degree I don't want.

So here I am, 25 (soon to be 26) with a useless biochemistry degree, in a job I'm enjoying less and less every day and debt from a handful of online courses in a masters I'm not even sure if I want or will finish. Part of me wishes I just left after that first internship or contract to go back to school full-time. I've had a handful of unrelated jobs in the biotech industry but none of them really stuck. I had an ok undergraduate GPA of 3.24, terrible GRE and ok letters of rec from only 1 professor. I was thinking about possibly pursuing a PhD since I do enjoy lab work and science, but now already in my mid-twenties think the opportunity cost of pursuing one is slipping away. 

I'm considering starting a local masters part-time at a cheaper state school (my company kicks in 10K of tuition assistance so it'd be covered) in computer science, or even just quitting my job altogether to do a bootcamp although that's significantly more risky.

What should I do? I feel trapped and unhappy and angry at myself for being so unfocused in the past 2-3 years I fumbled out of college. Any advice is appreciated."

Being away from my mom for the first time, I had to start learning to cook on my own using her recipes as a guide.

I've mostly been cooking batch meals like soups and stews. My first dishes came out so well that I got cocky and decided to start tweaking the recipes. One bright idea I had was to add cayenne pepper to minestrone soup to spice it up. I make my soup and go to town eating it. The first few bites taste pretty fucking good, but after that the spice starts to kick in and my mouth is on fire. When I try to sip the broth, I start choking violently from the amount of spice.

Afterwards, I had the following text conversation with my mom:

Me: Holy shit that cayenne pepper ain't no joke.

Mom: Yeah I hope you went easy on it.

Me: Man I only used a tablespoon I don't know why this shit is so hot.

Mom: JFC that's a lot! You're only supposed to use a pinch, maybe an 8th of a teaspoon at the most.

TL;DR: I'm new to cooking and I added over 20 times the recommended amount of cayenne pepper to one of my mom's soup recipes."

Gusto SWE

Stats: $52/hr $4500 housing SF

\- Cool culture and really nice people

\- Possibility to do the Kleiner Perkins Program

\- Learn about the startup life and people

\- More possibility for larger impact

\- Uses Rails with React

\- Relatively new program, might be less structured

Google STEP

Stats: $33/hr $9000 housing, probably SF

\- Lots of resources for learning, i.e. courses, mentors, ex-STEP panel, seminars

\- Bigger name helps with next year's internships

\- Learn about working in a large company

\- More structured program with tons of interns

\- Project matching is a wild card, could be good or bad

\- Less impact

Next week I'm starting my first bio-informatics internship. I'm really excited, but there is a small problem I'm running into while installing some things. I will be using a tool called [IgDiscover](http://docs.igdiscover.se/en/stable/installation.html), which is developed for Linux and available as a conda package from the bioconda channel. However, I have Windows, and while trying to install (conda) I noticed that several dependencies are only available for Linux (or macOS).

Since I'm a complete Linux noob, I am trying to inform myself the best I can on the internet, and from what I've read it's possible to install Ubuntu as a subsystem or in a virtual machine in windows. Is it possible to run Anaconda (at least Miniconda) on Ubuntu *within* Windows 10? If so, what is the most efficient way to do this: a virtual machine or a subsystem? Which takes more disk space and which is the fastest? Does anyone with conda/Ubuntu experience have any recommendations for me?

Thanks in advance :)"

People say I'm too young to be this bitter about life, but what's the fuckin point anyway. 

Eat, shit, sleep, and occasionally fuck? Oh yeah, don't forget about that dead end minimum wage job you have to go to where you have watch the sun come up. 

I went to college and I got a useless degree; complete fuckin scam. I'm going back for another major and I might graduate this semester but who fuckin knows. 

I've potentially got an internship lined up, where I'll have to pay about $250 to work for free. What is this shit? I was told that going to college would get me out of this bullshit.

By bullshit, I mean having to live a double life, because if my dad found out I'm gay, I'm homeless. It doesn't even feel worth it sometimes.  I'm so fucking jealous of my friends who don't even think of the luxuries they enjoy from accepting families.

I have a sinking feeling I am gonna die alone. Everyone just wants to fuck and doesn't think about the future.  Then I see these fucking Reddit posts of dudes getting married and I get even more bitter. What the fuck am I doing wrong? I maintain a positive attitude around people, but it's complete bullshit.

Also why bother with that? People are shitty anyway. I only know of 1 person who hasn't been shitty to me.  Everyone else just ends up fuckin dropping you as if you were a sack of shit.

I don't know why I'm hoping this degree is gonna open some financial opportunities for me; I've got one already and I still work for minimum wage. I want to buy a house and not have to fuckin hide anymore. 

Everything is absolute fucking shit, and I feel like I'm just biding my time until I die. Why do we even go through all this bullshit if we're just gonna die in another 60 years anyway. The sex will dry up long before then, I won't be athletic anymore, and I'll probably have some nurse putting a catheter in my urethra while I'm simultaneously shitting myself.

So, in conclusion, what the fuck are we doing? The only time I feel some semblance of ""being alive"" is when I'm doing 80+ on a mountain road. Everything in this world is so unbelievably fucked, my brain often disassociates itself in an attempt to get away from this shitshow that is life.

Please, go ahead and tell me that everything will get better if you just ""reframe it"". That's the first phase of grief, and I'm already on anger/acceptance."

Let me start off by saying this. I can solve the problems and do the work, but I really don't like it. I'm self-disciplined and allot time in my week to due my work. I'm a junior coming up on senior year. I just feel like I'm in a rut. I went into Computer Science because I was essentially living my life for my parents. I have a complicated past so I'd rather not get into it, needless to say I don't care about making XYZ dollars and having the biggest car or living in a huge house later on in life.

I love talking with people, debating, etc. My hobbies and interests revolve around traditional things and crafts, like brewing different forms of alcohol, cooking (absolutely love cooking), baking, etc. I also really love the topic of nutrition and health, and I'm constantly reading up on these. 

My dream, as cheesy as this will sound, so please don't judge, is to move out of my parents place into a [tiny house.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFNdIup9kS0) I know I'll still have to work in life and take responsibility, so don't misconstrue what I'm saying here. But I'm rather minimalistic in life and just want simple things. I want to visit different countries while I'm still young, build the tiny house, travel around the US and Canada, then settle down on a plot of rural land, and start a homestead.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I'm a minimalistic guy who doesn't live a lavish lifestyle and would just like to work a job he can at least be satisfied with, in the hopes of turning it into a remote position one day.

This is meant to be over my lifetime. I don't expect to just get a remote job out of college, nor do I expect to start earning highly. I'm willing to work to reach those points. So far, I've been looking into internship positions, but haven't heard back. My resume is likely crud, as I originally created it for software positions. Any tips on positions?

This is my first job in Software, apart from 2 internships in back-end/full stack roles. My org is kind of like an internal software consulting company, so I and my coworkers get paired with other teams in the company to do tech work. My managers are working out my first placement now, and they've approached me with a role involving Salesforce CRM Software at a booming subdivision of the company. It's also at a great location (better than the location I'm at now) that would allow me to stay at home and save money on rent. I have mixed feelings, and would love to get some insight how Salesforce is perceived by the industry.

I know that Salesforce uses a fork of Java called Apex, and a similar proprietary fork of Javascript. This feels like proper software engineering, but I wonder if it's not perceived as such by the industry? Will I be pigeonholed as a specialist if I spend too much time with this technology? I don't want to be in a situation where the industry moves on from Salesforce but I'm perceived as someone who can only bring value via a deprecated stack. I definitely want to be a software generalist in the long term, with an emphasis on the back-end. 

I will say that these assignments are temporary, and last between 6 months to a year/year and a half, so it's not like I'd be stuck doing this if I don't like it. I also know that salesforce is in demand so I feel like it can't hurt to have some of those skills in my toolbelt.

Even in college, I struggled to commit to a major (I studied Media Art and minored in Theater/English). After I graduated, I didn’t know what I wanted to pursue full time, and worked a slew of odd jobs (an actor at a Renaissance Faire, at a bar, an internship at an online cooking school, a nanny, etc). I love to write and throughout all of these careers I was trying to build up my repertoire as a freelance writer, which I did. 

At 25, my main freelance client dropped me, and I took a job in TV/FIlm (it fell into my lap and I had always considered it as a career path, as I once wanted to be a TV writer). After that gig ended, I was offered a full-time job in content management and media w/ a former client and worked there for two years. Last June, they ended up letting go of my entire department, and I was unemployed. After job searching for 4 months, I was offered a gig in TV again, and took the opportunity because I had always considered jumping back in and \*really\* trying to be a TV writer. That’s where I am now and my contract ends in April. I’m also continuing to freelance write, and have a small handful of clients. The money is a nice addition to my measly TV hourly rate, but it wouldn’t be enough to be my only income by any means. 

Essentially, I’ve been on two different career paths: one in writing/content management, and one in TV and film. I sort of wish I hadn’t taken this job—it will be a huge gap in my resume and I don’t know if I actually want to deal with the long hours and crazy hustle forever, especially since there’s no guarantee I’ll actually “make it” in the entertainment industry. Most of the people I work with “LOVE THE BIZ” … and I don’t know if that’s me. 

I turn 30 this year and I’m so mad at myself for not picking and committing to a certain path but it’s been so hard for me to stay focused on one thing. I lack focus and discipline, but I work really, really hard. I’ve written plays, all of which have done okay but no crazy success.  I’ve applied for jobs in media/editorial but have barely gotten interviews. I started creative side projects, like blogs and websites, and then eventually lose steam. 

To make matters worse,  I’m experiencing jealousy over my friends who seem to have their lives together. Since they’ve been more focused than I have, they’re advancing further in their careers, making more money, and generally seem more successful. 

I wish I could narrow down and find some sot of direction, but it’s always been so hard for me to pick a path and stick to it. I know I love to write, and I’m good at writing, but I’m not sure where that will take me. I also love writing about relationships/love/sex, and have recently had a lot of success in that area… so I want to maybe continue with that, but I’m not sure how. I’m in therapy, but that only does so much.

I guess there are two questions here. **One, what can I do for myself to find what it is I want to do w/ my career, and Two, how do I become more focused? I struggled with these same things at 24 and I don’t want to do it again in another 5 years.**"

*Some information about myself*: MSc student in CS in Italy. I recently came back from one semester abroad (Erasmus+) and only have done a 3-month internship during my Bachelor's degree (in Italy). I'll be graduating by the end of this year.

I've been thinking about moving to Germany to start my career. My areas of interest are mainly ML and DS. (I only know basic German and therefore would not be able to daily speak it in the beginning).

How, in your opinion, should I proceed since I have no experience in the field?

More specifically:

1. Should I necessarely start with internships/stages/graduate programs everywhere or can I directly land a Junior position? If internships are *a must,* I think I will struggle a lot on making ends meet every month.
2. Other than LinkedIn, do you have any particular advice on other platforms that work for Germany? (Xing, ...)
3. I mainly filter on ""Junior Data Scientist"", ""Junior Machine Learning Engineer"", and some other nice-looking positions. Do you have anything better to recommend to get the most from my research?
4. Are you aware of any company in Germany that is particularly open to (Junior) foreigners?
5. How common is for a company to provide help with German courses?
6. How hard is the interview process in Germany? How long does it generally take to get hired?
7. Are there standard contracts for employees in this field? Could you name/list them? Are employment contracts based on 12 paid months or on 13 (sometimes even 14)? (I hope this question makes sense, otherwise never mind!).

I understand it's a lot what I asked. Even if I'll not have all the answers, I'd like to have an overview on what's ahead.

Thanks for the attention,

Cheers!"

Since it's a university lab, the maintenance staff will be pretty fluid (people will graduate, be gone for a semester of internship, etc). I'm looking for a good centralized way to have all the machines for the most part tell the maintenance staff what needs to get done. Maybe like a group chat where the team members can join/exit at will, and the machines will periodically say things like ""Update available for program XYZ on host1"" or ""SMART disk error on host3"" or ""Unable to start service ABC on host2"".

If it was a consistent group of people maintaining this setup, I would just set up a few simple cron jobs/scripts that send emails to the staff.

There's honestly nothing wrong with boasting, it's super exciting that all your hard work has paid off!

Luckily, I feel like this sub has gotten better in this regard lately.

Regardless, here's another one for those of you out there feeling like you're doomed to a year of searching &amp; sending out hundreds of applications for a shitty job.


**So, my background:**

B.S. in CS from an online school

0 internships

0 professional field-related experience

**Applications sent:**

75 applications total

~20 of these were LinkedIn's ""Easy Apply,"" meaning I literally clicked 2 buttons &amp; it sent my resume. Extremely low effort.

The vast majority of these didn't have a cover letter. I typed up a generic one I started pasting &amp; wrote a custom letter for maybe 2 positions. I heard back from at least 1 of them.

I got 5 phone screens. All 5 phone screens led to coding challenges or technical phone screens. 

**Of the 4 screens:**

1 ghosted

1 rejection

1 on-site interview

2 I turned down the technical screen due to a better offer (they came late)


The on-site interview ended up in a job offer. 

**Offer:**

Denver

86k Salary

7k Signing bonus (includes relocation assistance)

**Total time spent applying:**

~ 2.5 months. I started applying just 1 month before graduating, but very very casually. I didn't really ramp up sending applications until after graduating.

**How I did it:**

Do I think I got super lucky? Honestly, no, not really. I applied almost exclusively through LinkedIn. I don't think I got anything out of doing the Easy Apply ones, but hey it only takes like 5 seconds so why not. I think that Easy Apply is better geared for more experienced candidates that have much more impressive resumes. A good resource that helped get me started was https://www.newgrad.tech/. I didn't tailor my resume for specific job postings. I went through a few iterations of my resume at first, but once I found one that I liked, I used the same one for every role.

**Edit:** *I've had multiple people post that I'm shilling for this site. I guess I can see why you might think that, but here's the truth. It's not my site &amp; I get nothing out of linking it. It has 0 ads, links to job postings directly, &amp; only makes money if you click affiliate links on a different page that the owner straight up tells you make him money. I posted it for 2 reasons. 1, I feel like other people that post these threads always have a long list of resources they used. Since I only used this site (at first) &amp; LinkedIn, I figured I'd contribute at least something tangible. 2, the site is really good if you're just starting. It's honestly not amazing much past that, bc you quickly run out of listings (it's not updated super often), but it helps you get your feet wet if you've been hesitant on starting the job hunt for whatever reason. If you're already far into your application process, it probably won't help much.*

As the title said, I basically did 0 leetcode. I say basically 0 because I think I did like 3-4 of the starter ones. I spent some time re-learning data structures because I felt that my school did a bad job of teaching them, but nothing crazy. 

**What allowed me to succeed:**

There's 2 reasons why I think I didn't have a hard time getting a good job.

**1:** I'm not awkward af talking on the phone or communicating via email.

I'm not extremely personable or fantastic at chit-chatting or anything, but I'm a normal person &amp; don't melt at the thought of having to talk to someone longer than 4 seconds. I'm also fairly good at writing &amp; do a good job at getting my point across in a particular way, so I think that helped a little bit, too.

**2:** Personal projects.

You've heard it before from everyone on here &amp; guess what: it's legit. I had I think 4 projects on my resume, 3 of which were school projects. Literally no one asked me about the bottom 2 &amp; I was asked about the second project twice. The focus was always on my first project, which was not a school project &amp; was an app I made that I use for my current (unrelated) job. 

It was very important, in my opinion, that this project *wasn't* a school project. You need to show initiative &amp; do something outside of what you're prescribed to do. It doesn't need to be super fancy or super high tech, it was basically a CRUD app. But make sure it's somewhat big (took real effort) &amp; be sure you can talk about the different aspects of the project. What went wrong, what you'd do differently, how &amp; why did you implement certain features, what focus did you put on the UI, etc.

**That's basically it.** Don't be super awkward on the phone. Don't be lazy &amp; do some projects. 

It helps if you're likable &amp; can come across as friendly &amp; personable. Like I said, I'm not actually super personable, I'm actually quite introverted. But I can still come off as if I'm not. 

Good luck to you all."
f0erv2,10,2020-02-07,Got a job a week after moving!,ArAMITAS,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/f0erv2/got_a_job_a_week_after_moving/,"Graduated in Dec 2019 and have been applying ever since. Almost nothing. I tried hard to see if there was something local using connections, but my area had almost no tech jobs nearby. After 300+ applications and working on my resume and interviewing skills I still had very few interviews and no offers. 

I have a BS in IT and a 4 month internship...

 I decided I was just going to move to a city with IT jobs so I could be local. After a lot of research I choose the research triangle. 

The first week out here I had three interviews and one already gave me an offer. I accepted. It was my top choice so I don't care to wait to hear back from the others.

Help desk specialist position, contract to hire. Already worked with the team a little and really enjoyed it!

So I'm super hyped! The move made all the difference. 
I also know the time of year is good for finding work. 

So I know I've spent a lot of time frustrated in my search for work so I thought I'd just share this. This group has been a lot of help. Trying to find my first job as honestly sucked, but it's worth it when something finally works out.

Looking forward starting my career in IT!

Edit: I had money saved up for several months and understand not everyone can afford to just get up an leave town without a job lined up. That barrier of not being local is a pain to get past"
f0fg53,0,2020-02-07,I'm kind of lost,M477M4NN,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/f0fg53/im_kind_of_lost/,"I'm a sophomore in CS at a decent CS school (OSU). For having been here for 3 full semesters, I don't feel like I've learned nearly as much as I should have. Due to how the program is set up, I've only taken 4 CS classes (3 programming classes, one of which was an intro to Java class). I'm not in any CS classes this semester (it's a weird situation; I was rejected from the major then got accepted late), and I'm only taking 12 credits and have a good amount of free time (or I would if I wasn't shit at managing time).

I would like to get an internship this summer, but I have no personal projects, no leetcode practice, nothing outside of class, and I have moderate social anxiety. There was a career fair this week that I didn't go to because I didn't feel like it was worth it. I'm just lost as to what I should be doing. I want to build my resume with personal projects, I just don't even know where to start (what to make, resources, etc). As far as internships go, I'm not even necessarily aiming for the big name companies (though that would be awesome).

If I don't get one this summer it's not a huge deal as I am going to take a 5th year anyways (an extra summer for an internship) and I can take a summer class or two, but it would just be nice to feel like I'm actually working toward my future career."
f0fqvh,2,2020-02-07,Extremely depressed math major in need of advice.,MTGplayer1254,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/f0fqvh/extremely_depressed_math_major_in_need_of_advice/,"My passion is deeply rooted in pure maths.  Im set to graduate undergrad in 2 years in hopes of graduate school (5 years to graduate as I moved around several majors).  

My issue is that I know I’m not good enough for a good graduate school.  I know how incredibly competitive the academic research market is, and I know that I realistically stand zero chance against it.

Due to this, I decided I should branch out and try to apply my math degree to something marketable.

My GPA is OK, but that’s it.  It’s just OK.  I believe it’s like 3.6 in my math classes.  I have no research experience.  I’ve only had a single long standing internship at an insurance company doing data analysis, which I hated.

I don’t enjoy applied statistics at all.  I took 2 stat theory classes and found them a lot of fun, but afterwards I was forced to take some data analysis courses (for my degree gen-Ed) and hated those as well.

I’ve looked into applied math, but I don’t enjoy coding much.  

Hell, I even tried economics and I couldn’t make it past the first 2 classes in the major due to how dry and uninteresting they were.  

I’m at a serious dead end of options as my graduation date is soon approaching.  I’m literally considering becoming a high school math teacher at this point, as then I can at-least advise kids to stay away from the major unless they’re geniuses / very interested in doing t-tests / asking a computer to solve numerical DE’s all day.

Where do I go from here?  I’ve talked the ear off of my advisor to no avail on where to go, and everyone I ask for advice says to ignore the red flags of academia and pursue your passion.   This is a lot easier said than done, as I would like to be able to pay off the mountain of student loan debt I’m currently burying myself under.

I’m seriously regretting dropping my engineering major I had my first year of college.  Looking back in hindsight, the classes I would have needed to take would have been easy as hell in comparison to all of the analysis, algebra and topology I’m taking now.  Plus I’d be practically guaranteed a good salary out of undergrad.

So, people of academia, were does someone like me belong?  I’ve run out of ideas myself.  

Thanks."

My wife is a J1 visa holder. She started the internship in March of 2019 and in November of 2019 we got married and filled out all necessary paperwork for marriage visa. We are still on great track for the marriage visa and actually got a notification saying they are ready to schedule our interview so we know that is all going right.

She makes around $1,000.00 a month, paid weekly $250.00 and $20.00 is withheld making her weekly pay $230.00. She has a social but it says on it she can only work for the approved company on her visa. She works in real estate as a marketing/office admin intern and with all the work she does I believe she should have all her income listed as W2. She has defined hours, work procedures, and fits all the other qualifications of W2 vs. 1099.

Her boss uses a payroll service company for payroll but when we got her tax forms 1/3 of the income was put under a W2 and 2/3 was put as 1099-misc. I think this is incorrect and all the income should be under W2. Am I wrong? Also, even though $20.00 got withheld every week, there is no income shown as withheld on the W2.

Also, since our status was married as of December 31st 2019, do I just file us jointly using turbo tax how I normally have been or do we need to use the 1040-NR?"

Hey, all. This is the first resume I've ever put together. I'm a ECE Senior, graduating May 2021, I got a recommendation for an internship through one of my professors, but he asked for me to forward him my resume... I don't have one.

The internship I'm applying for is in the company's CE department, specifically working with embedded systems in autonomous vehicles.

Looking for some advice about the overall impression of what I've put together so far, and what else I should include. Here's some more about me, but I wasn't sure if it's appropriate:

* Other work experience: Golf course for 3 years during and after high school, then a human supplement factory for 1.5 years (first as general labor, then somewhat of a maintenance / machine setup guy).
* I'm a dual major, I wasn't sure how to better that. Primary CompE Secondary EE.
* I've done a number of projects throughout my college experience involving simple AC and DC circuits, some digital logic design projects (sequential tail lights, traffic lights, reaction speed game, etc with flip-flops and/or PLDs), simple projects with microprocessors (Ti LaunchPad).None of these projects were particularly involved or lengthy, though.
* I like to tinker with computers, I've built every computer I've owned for the last 10+ years, and run a home server for local and remote file access, media server, etc.
* I do all of my own vehicle maintenance and repairs, I've never had to take my vehicle to a shop for more than an alignment and tire balance - so I'm quite familiar with cars, how they work and how to work on them.
* I've made the Dean's List every semester at my current school and have had offers to join two national or international honor societies (Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi) - decided not to join HKN because they were trying to restart the chapter and needed officers to help run it, but I live very far from campus and didn't have the time to spare from work and school. TBP was offered last week, still haven't made up my mind on that one.

I also had a quick question about whether it is appropriate to include a cover letter and a few recommendation letters. I know I can get a glowing letter from my most recent employer, likely a professor or two. I worked at the human supplement plant 4-5 years ago, and I'm not sure that's recent enough to get a recommendation letter from my old supervisor at this point.

I know that's a lot of info, but I wanted to be as thorough as I could. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to look everything over and offer some advice.

Thanks!

f0gcxf,2,2020-02-07,Business school with CS degree and experience,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/f0gcxf/business_school_with_cs_degree_and_experience/,"Moved from r/college

I'm a CS major graduating in '21 from a large (pretty average) state university and one of the paths I am considering is going to graduate school for an MBA. With this path, I would plan on working in software engineering for 5-8 years before either starting part-time classes or being a full-time student. The reason I would be working for a while first is to gain industry experience and build capital (I want to start a business). HBS is my first pick but I would apply to at least ten programs if I took this path. This is what I expect to be working with when I would hypothetically apply for graduate schools:

5-8 years of experience at well known companies doing SWE related work

3.5 GPA (Cum Laude), B.S. Computer Science (with an internship each year)

(Ideally, but not positively): A 730 on the GMAT when the time comes

Professional organization involvement: ACM

Semester working as a tutor or research assistant

I have Autism and can relate this to my development through college (if diversity programs are a thing for graduate school)

Student Government and fraternity leadership for three years

I know some of this is relevant and some might not be, but I listed all of it just so I wouldn't leave stones unturned. I tried to order it in importance of what I thought was most relevant.

Can anyone tell me if Harvard Business School, Sloan, or Wharton is a reasonable goal with this background? What extra stuff could I do to make myself a better candidate if I wanted to keep this path open as an option down the road?"

Background: Graduated with a CS degree in May 2019 and have been applying to jobs on and off since early February 2019 (I should be applying more but that's a different issue). It comes out to about 120 applications in 3 months, and I had maybe 5-6 companies respond for interviews. No internships, limited project experience, decent-looking resume based on feedback from here and from my father who is in a related but different line of work. The interviews I have had seem to go well from a personality perspective.

I know InfoSys doesn't have a great reputation, but I have struggled to land many interviews, let alone job offers. They made me an offer that I would have to accept within the week, and I know that a lot of people on here say that if you can't get anything else, InfoSys is fine to build up work experience. Today, I just got an opportunity from another company that wants me to do a video interview (recording answers to questions) by Monday. This is obviously not the same as a concrete offer, but I would prefer to work at one position rather than in contracting. Plus, I think it would come across better on my resume. However, I definitely don't want to throw away the one concrete offer I've gotten just because there's a hint of something that could happen.

I plan on talking with my parents about this as well, but I'm wondering what some of the people here might do."
f0gr5y,4,2020-02-07,Need advice on how to handle a situation about mental health discrimination,lunar_icarus,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/f0gr5y/need_advice_on_how_to_handle_a_situation_about/,"So recently, I need the advice I can get from this. Sorry it’s long. Some background context:

I attend university, I was a previous transfer student. I joined this club that caters to my ethnicity. It is more of a social club than a cultural one. I joined because my boyfriend introduced me to it and I was interested by how they ran the club. It’s been over a year since joining the club. I was worried to be around new people especially cause my boyfriend knew a lot of people from his club (he was previously Treasurer and now he’s internal Vice President) and I have diagnosed social anxiety/GAD/depression. His friend initially were very nice to me and I felt the need to maybe be friends with them because they seem to be good people. His friends are on the same executive board for this club so they’re almost like a team... but it’s more of a group of friends. Time goes by, it’s now spring semester of 2020. My bf is internal VP still and they handed out applications for new interns to be on the e-board. I applied, wanting to spread new ideas for this club such as more community work, connecting with our rival university who has the same cultural club, and bringing more cultural stuff into general meetings. I thought my interview was fine and did my BF. I wanted to go by the mission statement that the club has established in its development. 

This past Tuesday, they voted for interns during the weekly executive board meeting. I didn’t make the cut and I asked my bf why for the details. He initially said that my visions weren’t what they (the co presidents, in which by the way are a couple romantically) wanted from me. I didn’t believe my boyfriend so I asked for more and knew it was an excuse. He mentioned that one of the people at the meeting pointed out my mental health as the biggest issue. She thought I wasn’t capable of being an intern because I get overwhelmed easily. I was clearly upset at her words as my boyfriend summarized it for me. All of my disappointment for not getting the cut went away and I was angry about her saying that my mental health was the biggest reason why I could not join their board. My bf made a thought about that they could be threatened by my ideas, which to me aren’t threatening , but they tend to think in “groupthink” at meetings. I am very outspoken with ideas so I can see why they would feel that I wouldn’t agree to why they think all the time. But, it’s no excuse to use my mental health as a reason not to pick me as an intern. I even emphasized that I will be professional at all times during my interview, but of course they didn’t give me a chance. My boyfriend feels hurt about what his friend said about me and is silently mad at her. She doesn’t know that, but everyone during that meeting felt uncomfortable talking about me.

In my anger, I vented to a friend from my hometown who I’m close to. She told me that I could report the story to my university’s ADA department (disability department) so that I can make a grievance report. However, I am hesitant to report because that would mean I could ultimately burn bridges with the e board )and my boyfriend will likely have to burn those bridges too. I hate that my boyfriend is stuck in a position in choosing sides, I don’t want to subject him to that. And if I do report, they would know that I know what happened during the meeting because my boyfriend tells me everything. I’ve already started to distance myself already from them and making sure I keep my guard up at all times if I can’t avoid them while hanging out. I am just mad she and the others who didn’t stand up for me believed that I couldn’t do it. I signed up for a reason. I still have the high functioning parts of me despite my mental illnesses trying to function on the daily basis. I don’t let my mental health stop me from being a hard worker. They don’t know that I know so far. Only one person on the board knows and she wasn’t even there. She’s a true friend and is gravely upset at the situation that she’s considering resigning because she hates the way they’re running this cultural club. 

It’s so hypocritical of them to think that me being part of the e board is going to ruin their reputation. When in reality, it’s not because I’m not going to be a figurehead and the two co presidents are a couple who actually voted themselves last year to be presidents. The club is even a clique themselves. And even if my boyfriend is on the e board, I would have still maintained professionalism. 

I am very passionate about mental health due to my diagnoses, past experiences and I want to be a social worker focusing on mental health in the future. I want to be able to protect myself other side than just avoiding these people, which will be hard because they are my boyfriend’s friends. I also don’t like the discrimination people with mental health issues face when it comes to the workforce. I want to prevent any further discrimination in the future. 

Thank you for reading if you’ve made it this far. 

Any advice would be helpful."

So I already know binghamton is the better school based of rankings and what I have heard, but I have also heard a lot of good things about UB. The reason I don’t just go with binghamton is because UB gave me $5,000 off of tuition each year ($20,000 in total) so I could save money. I also like the location of UB more, I have been to the town of buffalo and liked it and it would be cool to be close to Niagara Falls and Toronto. 

I’m just wondering for someone who plans to major in Mathematics, Econ or Finance is there a significant difference in the education quality and internship opportunities between the two schools?  I also might want to go a top grad school so would going to a lesser school like UB hurt my chances at admissions?

f0j10d,8,2020-02-07,In STEM and an aspiring Polyglot (Physics major),Aegim,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/f0j10d/in_stem_and_an_aspiring_polyglot_physics_major/,"Hello, my situation is as followings: 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 and expecting to get my **Physics degree** sometime this year since I'm currently writing my thesis. And originally planned to get an **MSc in Data Science or Machine Learning**, as they've always seemed interesting to me, and seem to pay well, preferably with a scholarship, otherwise ***I'd need to work for a while and save up (so also looking for any ideas on what I could do right now)*****.** I'm currently taking a **certificated MOOC for Data Science**, and it does a little bit of Machine Learning at the end, and I'm doing well in it, but I'm not rushing it atm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other mentions: I've taken a course on *Quantum Computing*, but left it halfway, I'm gonna definitely catch up and finish it eventually. My internship focused on the *Parallelization* of code (completed it successfully, enjoyed it, but I feel like I still have a very long way to go in the subject) but I do enjoy programming simple stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a very technical skillset in several areas, never dove extremely deep in any of them, it gave me a bit of anxiety at times tbh, but when I could get into it it's definitely *one of the most rewarding feelings I've ever experienced (just seeing the math play out and understanding it is wonderful)*. But in a way, I have many interests and have pursued them for a bit, I'm a generalist at heart, I even got into drawing and art for a few years, but it's been an uphill battle.

&amp;#x200B;

However, recently (like 6 months ago) I developed an **extreme love for language learning**, and I've found that I enjoy the process a lot, so I wanna keep at it. It's actually lasted very long for me, and with basically no friction, which is surprising. It actually gave me more motivation for everything else I was doing, it's like a gift that keeps on giving. This took me by surprise because even though I've always been lowkey interested in knowing several languages, I never put much effort into learning them and figured I'd do more than well as a Spanish/English bilingual with some French. **And I really want to do something with this new love of mine. Even make it my main focus**, in a way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, the languages on my list are:

* **Spanish** &amp; **English** (Completely fluent, got a teacher's certificate for English)
* **French** (B2-C1 \[Fluent-ish\] already understand most of it, also I recently heard they work 35 hour weeks in France? Seems like a good place to work.)
* Italian (A2-B1 understand a lot due to mutual intelligibility but I'm **gonna drop it** soon)
* **Japanese** (definitely gonna get this one to fluency, beginner)
* **German** (0%)
* Norwegian (0%)
* Russian (0%)
* Indonesian (0%)
* Korean (not sure about this one, I just loved how logical the Hangul \[their script\] seem to be)

&amp;#x200B;

I want recommendations for career paths, willing to consider translation of scientific articles, but I don't know **how to get into it, what it's like etc**. Also, not sure how much I'd love that, but I can do it. Any other options are more than welcome. *I don't wanna work extremely long hours, but I'm willing to do it for a while to get into a good industry*, if I know for sure that at the end I'm gonna get to work way less and have a good job. **I still haven't applied to a Master's program so if there's a path I can take that requires a different one I could just do that.**

“This was the body of Gerald Farleigh.”

I had met Josette Plimons 3 weeks ago at our school’s lunchtime Silent Film club; now I was sitting with her in a stranger’s home, watching her dip a dainty grey spoon into a blue vase filled with an old man’s cremated remains. It was one of those times where there seemed to be no way to ask an unserious question, since any reality could pop up and present itself as the truth. “Do you ever take that with cream and sugar?”

“No,” Josette said. She tipped the spoonful of ash into a small glass bowl she had brought with her. Small, ornately illustrated leaves of ivy spooled around its rim. “That would be disrespectful.” She gently tapped the back of the spoon against the edge of the bowl in a rhythmic *clink* to jostle the last flakes of ash out.

That question didn’t seem like it needed a follow-up, so I took a moment to reflect. We were in old Gracie Farleigh’s house. She was one of the seniors Josette would visit and provide light care for every week, as part of a volunteer program that offered substantial college credit (“But that’s just a bonus,” Josette told me). The walls were festooned with a garish lilac print; portraits of the beaming dead cluttered old dark wooden shelves pushed against the walls like balustrades. There was no TV, only a window. This was a room that had been furnished and decorated before the invention of digital time. It was little wonder that Josette found this an appealing space for her ritual.

“And you’re, like…certain Mrs. Farleigh won’t come in and flip out.”

“Positive. I set her up with her little CRTV and a bowl of chili for her nap a half hour ago. She’s dead asleep.”

“Pun intended?” My voice quivered. She looked at me, aware of her own ability to generate discomfort, relishing it.

“No.”

&amp;#x200B;

We make up a big shape for our lives so that they’ll make sense when we think about them in the abstract, but when you stop and dig into the moments that are most important it’ll always feel like each one of them took place on a different planet. Some of those planets become moons: your memory is of what you were remembering at that time.

I sat on that weird pink couch and looked at Josette’s nails, lightly crusted with human remains. I remembered sitting in the art room with the rest of the Silent Film club at the end of lunch, five minutes before the bell was to ring. We had just wrapped up the scene in *The Golem* where the titular monster throws the Knight Florian off a tower and kills him. Miguel, the club founder, flicked the lights on.

“Any questions? Observations? Anything?” He must have felt like he had to present a façade that we were a “real” club by giving us half-hearted homework attempts after each viewing, even though our supervisor, Mr. Horton, was sitting off in the corner diddling with his iPad and clearly couldn’t have cared less. Miguel sighed. “Alright, see y’all here next Wednesday.” “Y’all” was a somewhat generous appraisal: there were four total members of the club.

Amid the soft shuffling of backpacks being hoisted and zipped up I saw Josette peering at the now-blank TV screen, her eyes focused on it as though trying to make sense of a confounding scene.

“What’s up?” I asked her. She looked at me, startled; and in fact *I* was startled by my own question. No one knew each other at the Silent Film club and, being a gaggle of quiet weirdos for the most part, we didn’t go out of our ways to socialize with one another.

“Not…much?” she said. “What do you mean ‘what’s up?’”

“No, nothing! Just, you looked like you were really concentrating there, almost like you were still watching the movie even though it’s turned off.”

She looked away from me, past my temple. “Well, I found it interesting” she said. “It seemed like they were setting up Florian to be the big hero of the movie, and then they just went and smoked him like that. Bold move.”

“Yeah,” I murmured, thinking about it. “It’s funny, too, because it’s not like the stories in movies were real sophisticated back then. Like with *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*—”

“Yes!” she replied, rolling her eyes and laughing. “I don’t care if it was the first plot twist in any movie ever, ‘it was all a dream’ is still dumb! It’s still cheating!”

“Thank you!” I said. The club had finished that movie a couple of weeks ago and, clearly, the betrayal of the ending was still a fresh wound for both of us. “It’s just like, trendy with internet weirdos to like that movie. Just because it has cool sets doesn’t mean it’s actually good.”

“You know, I was just about to—” she began as the shriek of the bell cut her off. It was likely for the best: Miguel had been eyeing the two of us peevishly, not only because he was feeling left out but also because we were trashing one of his favorite movies. It must have been killing him to feel like he couldn’t jump in and defend its honor.

“We’ll talk more about it later,” she said as we walked out of the classroom. “It’s *so cool* you think that too, though! I was afraid to say anything.”

“Yeah,” I said, laughing. She smiled in affirmation and then waved as she went down the hall. We didn’t share any classes together and didn’t have much in the way of common friend groups, but I didn’t want to wait until next Wednesday to talk to her again.

Fortunately, both of us turned out to be the type of people who, once dragged out of our shells, yearned to be charmed, to stumble into unique and intricate friendships. Josette bumped into me in the hall the next day and we picked up right where we left off: talking about the storytelling quirks of weird old movies, how Miguel never seemed to want to play anything but German Expressionism (“It’s good stuff and all, but like, is he aware that there were a bunch of other countries that also made movies in the ‘20s?” she quipped). We may not have shared any class periods but we did have a couple of teachers in common, which made it easy to find ways to do homework with each other after school. She was a fun person to be catty with; we shared many objects of disdain.

I learned a lot from her, too. Once she cracked a quiet moment of AP Chem study by asking me if I knew what a Sin-Eater was.

“You mean ‘death eaters?’ The things from *Harry Potter*?”

She looked at me like I’d just farted on her wedding cake. “No,” she dripped, “not the things from *Harry Potter*.”

“I guess I don’t then,” I said, smiling. I liked getting a rise out of her every so often.

She grimaced, then continued. “Sin-Eaters were Celtic wanderers who traveled the Irish countryside and absorbed the sins of the soon-to-be-deceased in exchange for a small fee, or for food and shelter. They were pretty much outcast from society because they were thought to be so bloated with the sins of the dead that it was spiritually dangerous even to be in their presence.”

“That’s pretty metal. Sounds like a good idea for a movie.”

She paused. “Why do you think a person would do that? Damn themselves irrevocably in exchange for a little bread and water?”

“Maybe they didn’t believe in Heaven and Hell; they could have been the first atheists. Or maybe it’s not really a choice?”

This piqued her curiosity. “How do you mean?”

“Well…people drive cars at crazy speeds even though part of them knows they might die; and they *do* die, all the time! And that’s a really direct and immediate physical thing, being in a speeding car, knowing you can’t totally control it. If so many modern people can’t even parse out the risk-reward of something like that, then how’s it so farfetched that there was once a whole class of society way back when that made their living by sending themselves to Hell, and they didn’t have any better reason for it than ‘I’ll deal with it later?’”

She still looked puzzled. I went on, floundering: “Look, I don’t know, why do people commit suicide, or eat at Taco Bell? Those aren’t choices either, exactly.” I couldn’t think of anything else to add; I wasn’t even sure if I believed myself. “You know?”

To my amazement she nodded reverently. “Yes,” Josette said, “I think I know exactly what you mean. Do you remember when the paper is due for Mr. Chetney’s class?” And that was the last we spoke of the Sin Eaters for at least a couple of weeks.

Still, the conversation lingered with me. She kept saying things that would remind me of it. Josette was fascinated with religion and spirituality. We’d be talking about *The Legend of Zelda* and she’d bring up something from Hebridean mythology that it reminded her of, or she’d quote some wisdom from the Upanishads when I was pissed at my dad and rambling about what a dick he had been. I asked her once where she found the time to learn all this shit. “My mom has a degree in religious studies from Naropa; a lot of these books are lying around the house. And anything I can’t find on the bookshelves is easy to look up online. I just read a chapter of the *Bhagvad Gita* or *Gods and Fighting Men* or what have you before I go to bed. But ancient wisdom is everywhere, truly.”

She was always serene when she talked about these things, but I could sense a desperation underneath it all. It seemed almost stream-of-consciousness the way she talked about them; none of her ideas fit together. They were free-floating and contradictory, dropped in and out of her life depending on the situation at hand and her present mood. It was almost like all these spiritual aphorisms and principles were photographs she had ripped out of a scrapbook, and she felt like if she grabbed enough of them then eventually every frayed corner, every stranger’s smiling face would form a bigger picture that would make sense of it all. I never asked if she believed in Hell or something like it, but it never felt like I had to.

It was a Tuesday in April when Josette first told me about her ritual. She seemed worried and bleary-eyed; April was the busiest time of the year for big class projects and papers, and she always looked a little bedraggled in any case, but something seemed off when we met up at lunch.

“You look like shit.”

“Thank you,” she growled.

“Is anything the matter?”

“Yes. I don’t know what specifically, but yes, something’s the matter.”

This was a cryptic answer even for Josette. “Help me out, girl, is it fever, is it trouble at home, cramps? Anything at all, even a ballpark. Even Google directions to *get* to the ballpark.”

She took a timid bite of her tuna fish sandwich and looked at me sheepishly, almost guiltily. “It’s over something weird that I don’t want you to know about.”

“It can’t be *that* much weirder than anything else about you,” I laughed. She still looked troubled. I straightened up: “Is it…*illegal*, that kind of thing?” I whispered.

“Not as far as I know.”

“Good?”

She sighed and pulled a sliver of crust off her sandwich. “You know when you were a little kid and you had ideas about life that didn’t seem to come from anywhere, they just slid out from under a rock in your head, and that made them seem all the more real? And then you’d fall into weird habits or say things that didn’t make sense to anyone else, because they corresponded to this thing you felt you *knew* about life, and you only stopped doing or saying those things because at some point someone corrected you?”

“I think so, yeah.”

She looked at me with great intention. “Could you give me an example?”

Put on the spot, I sputtered. Then something started coming back to me. “When I was really young I used to think fireflies were dead Christmas lightbulbs.”

Her eyes widened. “Yeah?”

“Yeah. I saw a bunch of them flittering around outside our house once, the day after my dad took all the decorations down. I think it was just unseasonably warm that year but at the time it didn’t occur to me to *not* think that they were the ghosts of our Christmas lights. I thought dad took them down too soon and they wanted to come back in the house. I started crying, thinking how lonely they must have felt. Felt that horrible little kid guilt that weighs down your whole torso.”

I ruminated; I hadn’t thought about this in a long time. “Actually, it’s even a little wilder than what you were talking about, because I remember telling my dad we needed to let the lights back in and when he tried to explain that they were just glowing bugs I didn’t believe him. I think I even got in trouble for calling him a liar.”

She nodded. “When I was little I ate some of my grandmother’s ashes.”

“On purpose?”

“Yeah.”

“Wow. Why?”

“I thought I’d be able to hear her soul or that she might come back to life.”

I looked down at the garish ketchup-colored cafeteria tiling. “Did it work?”

“Not really. Not the way I wanted it to.”

She took a big bite of her sandwich, the first real bite she’d taken since we started talking. “I still eat people’s ashes.”

I looked at her. “What?” I didn’t mishear her and I didn’t doubt for a second that she was telling the truth, but it was the only word that would come out.

“I think it’s making me sick.”

“Of course it’s making you sick, isn’t there like formaldehyde and stuff like that in people’s ashes?”

She shook her head urgently. “Not like that.” Then she looked at me. “Would you mind coming with me to Mrs. Farleigh’s house tomorrow?”

&amp;#x200B;

The memory moon passed over right at that point; I was back on that pink couch, body and mind. I remember my chest tightening, I remember that for some reason the tops of my cheeks were in pain.

“I thought about what you said about the Sin Eaters, how what they did wasn’t a choice,” she mused. “I don’t think you were right.”

“No?”

“I think you can be chosen by God but I think you also have to accept the call. Just like any other job.”

She slipped another spoonful of ash between her lips. She coughed and her eyes bulged ever so slightly. Then she wiped her mouth and continued.

“I think the older you get the quieter the call becomes. Whether you’re raised in a secular way or a religious way you’re only ever taught to do what other people say. You aren’t told how to listen to the spirits.”

Mrs. Farleigh gave a concerned yawp from upstairs. “Dear?!”

This startled Josette; to her own visible horror she almost knocked the ashes on the ground when she jumped up. She covered the bowl with her shaking palm as she stood.

“I’ll be right back,” she told me. She stuffed the bowl into my hands and jogged up the stairs. “Coming, Mrs. Farleigh!”

Holding onto those ashes was bizarre, to say the least. I looked into the bowl and tried to glean some spiritual significance from it, feel the gravity of what used to be a human body in my own hands, but nothing would come. It just looked like dirt, like the stuff that piles up in an unswept corner. I spent a few minutes alone in that hideous room, too nervous to poke around and too unfocused even to waste time on my phone, before she sauntered back down. “Mrs. Farleigh heard me cough and wanted to know if I was alright.” She smiled.

“Could you take this, please?” I held the bowl out to her, annoyed. She grabbed it from me nonchalantly and sat down again; I hadn’t noticed when she’d gotten up but she’d put the spoon behind her ear like a pencil and daintily retrieved it to continue eating.

“Anyway,” she went on, “if you hear the true call at all you usually hear it when you’re young, and it’s your own responsibility to have an epiphany when you’re older, because when you’re a kid you don’t really have the resources to follow up on your instincts. But you *know*, and a part of you always knows. That’s why I say you’re beholden to your own epiphany, even though that seems like the wrong way around.

“That story you told me about the fireflies, about how you used to think they were the ghosts of Christmas lights? I think you were right, or at least I think you were onto something. I think God was talking to you but you didn’t have the spiritual vocabulary to understand what He was saying.”

Her eyes were glued to mine, terrifying in their intensity. Her jaw was rigid. She put her free hand on my wrist and lightly gripped it. “If you could see what I see now. If you could just hear the call, the way I hear it.”

This had officially become Too Much. I yanked my hand away from her as gently as I could and started rustling up my backpack. “Jo, look.” I could already tell I was going to make her feel bad and I was already feeling guilty. “I think you’re super smart and probably the coolest and most interesting person I’ve ever met but like…this is fucked up. This isn’t normal. I don’t know if you’ve told this stuff to anyone else but I think anyone would say you need to go to a doctor of some kind. You already told me it’s making you sick so I think a part of you has to know that you need help.”

She scowled down at the rug in a raincloud of misery. I stood up; I didn’t know what else to say. I didn’t know if this old woman would be safe with her but I also didn’t want to be there a second longer. “I really care about you,” I mumbled. “Please do what’s best for yourself, and…I don’t know if maybe you hate me now but text me any time, I’m always down to talk.”

I left the house, waiting for a reply from her that wouldn’t present itself. The closest I’d get to a response would be the tinkle of silverware as I opened the door to the sidewalk.

&amp;#x200B;

I was home sick with the flu on a crisp Wednesday morning in May when I got a text from my friend Eli that Mr. Umbria had been stabbed in the side of the head with a compass during 3rd period AP Geometry, and that classes were cancelled for the rest of the day and maybe the rest of the week. Immediately I felt responsible because immediately I knew Josette had done it and I felt as though I hadn’t tried hard enough to help her.

I cried for a little bit, my guts roiling with sickness and guilt, and then I fell asleep. When I woke up I was feeling less nauseous and needed something to distract myself with, if only superficially, so I opened my laptop. I had a new email; it was sent via a file sharing service, although when I clicked the link to the download page I saw that the file wasn’t particularly large. It was sent from an email address composed of a gibberish sequence of letters and numbers; normally I would have written it off as a clumsy spyware trap sent by some Ukrainian grifter but today I knew it was from Josette. She’d likely made a proxy address of some kind just so whatever she’d sent me would be harder to trace back to her.

I opened the download; she had written me a letter. I couldn’t find a date on it but I figured she had to have sent it last night.

&amp;#x200B;

*hey friendo!!!*

*so i know i freaked you out a little last time we really talked and i also know you’ve been mad at me for not eating with you at lunch or hanging out with you after school or really seeing you or talking to you at all and i’m super sorry about that. i’ve been in a bad place. so i just wanted to send you this and let you know whats up and hopefully make a little more sense of how i’ve been acting? plese forgive the lack of capitalization and Tumbr-y use of punctuation, im writing this as fast as i can bc im not sure how much longer ill have the faculties to put this stuff into words (it’ll make sense later)*

*idk u will probably still think i am fuckin crazy after you read this but i did see that little glimmer of belief in your eyes even when you were telling me i shoulda gotten help. fear’s the best path to belief imo*

*anyway*

*when i first heard the Call i was really young, like i think 5 or 6 years old. it was like a week or 2 after my grandmas funeral and my mom had come home with her ashes in this nice little blue china urn. she left it on the end table for a minute to go do something and my dog from back then, a big boxer mutt named Swooper, knocked it all over the floor bc his tail was waggin too hard. so her ashes were sunk real thick in the carpet and Swooper started lappin it up with his tongue and trying to pull it out of the fabric with his teeth bc dogs are fuckin dumb and theyll eat anything.*

*grandma smelled horrible but i thought maybe Swooper knew something i didnt so i got on my hands and knees and started eatin too. the taste was* ***wretched.*** *my mom came back in the room and flipped a shit. she smacked me hard across the face and sent me to my room and put Swooper outside for the rest of the day (that was the one time in my life that my mom ever hit me jsyk).*

*im not sure abt you but when i was little my dreams and nightmares were way way more vivid than they are now. even with that in mind, even having had a relatively comprehensive grasp on the difference between dream and reality (for a little kid), this was something different. that night i heard my grandma talking. and it was this really spooky non-language i was hearing. like if u can imagine a language thats spoken only in tone, made from little inflections and interruptions that sound like words but aren’t comprehensible as words, thats what this was. the voice would bounce in and out of my range of hearing like the words were little rubber balls. and the tone itself was the scariest part bc it didnt sound like grandma, it didnt talk how she talked. it was like the* ***sound*** *of her voice but it sounded disappointed and mocking in a way grandma never did. and it was so, so quiet. i started crying and when i cried i heard the voice make a formless laugh, like a laugh without consonants. i had nightmares abt that voice for years afterwords but that wasn’t a nightmare. that was a ghost. its hard to explain the difference between a real supernatural experience and a nightmare or a hallucination but theyre as different from each other as hearing the voice coming from the person sitting next to you and hearing a voice on a podcast. you just* ***know.***

*nothing like that really happened again for a long time, probably bc i didn’t eat anyones ashes again for a long time lmao. then when i was 10 me and my family went to Yosemite for a big reunion type thing. the place was this big estate that was kinda next to a lake but it was one of those estates where the rich butthole that owns it wants to seem like they have taste so they make it a bunch of boring rectangles and rhombuses and weird grey glass cubes instead of a normal Richie Rich mansion like everyone actually wants.*

*the reunion itself sucked, it was one of those things where all these adults you dont know are trying to talk to you like youve known each other since Way Back When and havent spoken in years when really you just don’t fuckin care bc why would you? and all the kids are dressed kinda formal and have bad personalities and no one will share their DS with you. everyone under 15 seemed real put upon and i didnt want to talk to any of em.*

*so obvs i got bored and while everyone was getting shitfaced at the lake of the beach i started poking around the house. whoever owned the place (it was an aunt or something i dont remember) had a doberman named Max and he was like the nicest dog ever. i would just race him down the weird angular halls and since there was no one else in the place we could just crash into each other and bump into walls and no one told us to slow down or knock it off. it was easily the most fun i had at that whole place.*

*i bring Max up bc i think dogs have something to do with the paranormal stuff i get into. they always seem to lead me towards it some way or another. during one of our more rambunctious races i tripped and fell over him in the living room. i looked up and found myself in front of the fireplace. there was a ledge above it with a framed black-and-white photo of a woman, probably taken in the ‘30s judging from the coif of her hair (altho what do i know lol) and next to it, RIGHT FUCKIN NEXT TO IT there was a blue china urn. im not sure if it was exactly the same as the kind my grandma was held in but to my 10 year old eyes it looked totally identical.*

*i stood up and i picked it off the shelf. Max started jumping at my hands bc he was still in a playing mood but i held the urn tight. i opened the lid and looked into it. the ashes looked the same as my grandmas bc all ashes look the same but i wondered if maybe it would taste the same too?? so i looked around to see if anyone was coming in and when i saw i was still alone i stuck my finger in and tasted it, and then i gave it to Max so he could have a lick too. i never learned who that woman was but i had a few more laps and then i put her back on the shelf.*

*something occurred to me. i went back to where the party was happening down by the lake. everyone was dead drunk at this point. i found my mom and told her i was going to go explore the woods for a little while. she slurred that she didn’t want me to go too far. it was dark bc the sun was going down but i could tell from the glint of her eyes that they were barely in focus. maybe it wasn’t fair of me, its not like she drank all the time or anything, but i was disgusted. i felt this big black ball-and-chain of contempt for the ways of man wrap around my heart and i’ve never been able to shake it all the way loose ever since.*

*anyway, i went into the woods, not terribly far but aways enough so that i couldnt hear the party. i found a smooth boulder on a slight incline and i sat down on it. the trees blocked what little remained of the sun. the pattering and flickering of animal feet and insect wings at varying distances had a symphonic effect and where normally they would have spooked me tonight they put me at ease. i let my body relax and i waited.*

*when the dark fell completely i looked straight up. a faded silver cloak began to drift downward as if let go from the tops of the trees. it stayed fuzzy, like waves of vapor on a hot day, and no matter how far it fell past the trees it stayed small; i could see it passing branches as it came towards me but it never took up increasing space in my line of sight like something is supposed to do when its coming closer to you. i reached up to touch it and let it fold over my fingers and a cool breeze slipped across my palm and the cloak vanished. satisfied, i went back to the party with this little initiation into the true cosmogony of things skittering in secret around my heart. it was better than a first kiss.*

*i realized i was in possession of a special gift that no one else had (or if they did they were keeping pretty quiet about it). there was still so much i didnt know and as i got older these questions began to articulate themselves in more precise ways: was i inviting communication with spirits or simply observing behaviors without playing a meaningful part in them? is there an ethical line between the living and dead that shouldnt be crossed not out of some doofy fear of Black Magic or w/e but out of respect for the privacy of the souls themselves? is real communication even possible when language (like everything) is constrained by time and time has no meaning once a person stops having a body beholden to its whims? i started thinking about all this later. at that time all i knew was i needed to see more of this stuff to even know what exactly i was doing.*

*opportunities were few and far between when i was very young and so for a while the visions left me. i went to the graveyard and swallowed some of the dirt around the tombstones every so often but it didn’t have any effect. i tried to will myself into lucid dreaming and sometimes that worked as far as it went but like i said the difference between a vivid dream and seeing an actual ghost is like the difference between a vase of flowers and a still life painting. i even applied for an internship at the local mortuary but they didnt take me (tbh i dont think any mortuary worth its salt would trust any 12 year old who wanted to be around dead bodies all day lmao). this was about the time i started getting really into my moms religion books out of sheer desperation. if i couldnt go straight to the source of the universe i felt i had to at least scour for clues as to its true nature.*

*finally in 8th grade i had the idea of volunteering to be a caregiver. i saw a lil flyer in the office advertising some service for the elderly in exchange for college credit and i signed up on the spot. most of the people i helped were really happy to have a young woman around to give the house a lil youthful energy. meanwhile all i was concerned with was death. ironic!!! i think. anyhow the idea worked. it turns out elders keep pots full of their spouses and pets around almost uniformly. most of my cases were widows and widowers but sometimes when i got a married couple that needed help they’d still have an urn on display for one of their brothers or sisters.*

*the work itself was quietly unenjoyable. old people suck. even the ones who seemed nice and cute at first all ended up being racist or fucked up in some way. ive had to wipe a vile disgusting putrid concave human ass free of its shit on more than one occasion. one man would discharge \~mystery fluids\~ down his pants leg as he walked without noticing. i had to trail behind him and clean it up like i was holding the train of a grotesque wedding dress. i started to think that maybe the reason so many of them kept the urns in plain sight was something beyond commemorative sentiment. maybe they were proud of their dead kin. perhaps subconsciously envious.*

*the upside to this revolting job was that their withered malfunctioning bodies, once minimally provided for, were easy to keep out of my way while i did my research. it was as easy as feeding them chowder and turning the tv on most of the time. and i never felt i was being disrespectful to the dead that i consumed; if anything i was putting them to better use than their guardians ever would. i mentioned to you that i never “seasoned” the ashes at all because to me that* ***would*** *be disrespectful and anyway that might interfere with something in the communication process.*

*at first it was like the two times i’d done it before: i would have a little scoop of ash and then i’d have to wait a few hours and be in a dark quiet area for anything to happen. but after about a year the effects were more vivid and immediate. i remember being in a house and just* ***smelling*** *the ashes of a man’s sister and i heard the sound of a turquoise bell (don’t ask me how i know what color the bell was). it popped a tiny bit in the left ear and then shortened into itself, then it sort of spread to the rest of my cranium and exited through the right ear. i was excited. for the first time it felt like* ***they*** *were talkng to* ***me***, *not the other way around!! they trusted me! i downed a scoop and turned around and there was this blissful strong silhouette of a soldier sitting in the recliner. his face was an eyeless mouthless mass of light but i could tell he was smiling at me. i think he appreciated that he had a visitor after what maybe felt to him like eons of the silence of death. he vanished quickly but it was an incredibly joyful experience for me. it also proved to be the turning point.*

*ghosts would come to me stronger and faster and not always right before or after i had their ashes. i was down by our little town lake once and i saw a velvet gossamer shape that reached from shore to shore ripple underneath the waves. i saw the smoke form of an infant boy dancing between geese in a flock as they flew south for the winter. once when i was lying awake in my room a pair of white hands drifted through my door, each one holding an apple. i ate the one from the left hand and refused the one from the right. it was unthinkably sweet, like marshmallow foam.*

*these were all pleasant if not downright beautiful instances but they soon became the exception to the rule and in fact the reason i write this to you now is that i am still experiencing the death world but in a way that is now as rhythmic and constant as my beating heart and in a way which has become distressing to me and which i no longer welcome.*

*one night i woke up facing my bedroom wall and there was a set of teeth embedded in it. they were dull cracked smoker’s teeth that glowed with the slime of mistreatment. breath came from behind them, from inside the wall. i turned away and turned back and they were still there. i touched them. they were porous. night turned to day and they didnt disappear. i sleep next to them still. i feel the wall’s breath on my neck every night. the teeth dont talk but i wish they would. they would scare me less if theyd just say something.*

*at some juncture that i failed to spot or prepare for the entire living world cracked in my vision. now i see veins on the outside of my mother’s cheeks. there’s a scalpless hunchback at the side of our school. he claws at the ground like a dog trying to bury a bone and screams all day long. i dont think anything told him he doesnt have a body anymore. every car smells like a corpse. i am privy to open wounds in the fabric of nothing that bleed pure night and i dont dare go near them or look at them for too long. i would tell you where they are but you may be safer not knowing.*

*ive trained myself to cope but i can dislocate my senses from only so much of this. nor would i ever wish to separate myself from these spirit materials entirely. i have gained valuable insights from many of them. for instance: mr umbria has the skin and tongue of a komodo dragon. he sends mosquitoes to drain sleeping girls’ souls when the stars go down. he is not who he says he is and you should not trust him or in fact be near him at all if you can help it.*

*but do you want to know what i have observed about* ***you****? you talk in the frequency of mist. sometimes your eyes switch places when you have a big idea. you are beautiful. this is why for my own selfish reasons i wanted to initiate you into this world of mine, so i could have a friend who i knew would understand. but as you can probably guess i dont think you would have liked it very much. i ask your forgiveness but i dont feel entitled to it.\**

*im not at a point where i feel as though i can just stop eating the ashes and see what happens, as much as that might seem like the obvious and reasonable thing to do right now. it seems as though im at a point where i can sense the truth but it isnt coming in strong enough to be coherent; its like that ugly sound the radio makes when the signals strong enough to be more than static but too weak for you to really hear the music. i cant stay like this much longer and i have to believe im on the verge of a sensory breakthrough. and even if i stopped now i would never want the ghosts to leave completely. i can’t go back to the way it was. as painful as this all can be i’d rather see in the most violent shade of red than go colorblind.*

*i hear a sound like nails hitting a wood floor with each keystroke and the corner of the screen is starting to curdle. someones peering up at me from under my shoes. i cant write too much more. i dont know if we’ll ever really talk again. think of this as an apology and also as kind of a last will and testament for my normal existence in this world. i hope you have a good life. the secret of the call is now your inheritance if you should choose to claim it.*

I deleted the email and the file, but not before I printed the letter out, stapled it together and put it in a shoebox in my closet. I wondered if maybe I’d learned nothing from her story, keeping things around like this.

I’d do my best to take the specifics of what she told me to my grave, but everyone knew that me and Josette were close, and the kids at school, probably the cops too, would want to know if she had been acting strange before she attacked Mr. Umbria. I’d have to lie and tell them yes, she had, and as I did so I would have to dream of a perfect world where knowledge didn’t turn you insane, where the senses didn’t become dangerous when acted upon. The truth that I could never tell any of them would be that there was nothing strange at all about trying to live in a world like that."
f0l3hc,3,2020-02-07,Does anyone else constantly compare themselves to others?,LightGreenToast,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/f0l3hc/does_anyone_else_constantly_compare_themselves_to/," I find that I am largely motivated by anxiety about doing worse than my peers, rather than through internal motivation. Growing up, I was constantly told things like ""person x went to Harvard/got this grade/got this scholarship, why aren't you doing the same?"" I realize that this is a stereotype of Asian parents but I've realized that this way of thinking has been very ingrained in me.

I'm a second year uni student and I was a med school hopeful, I was doing everything right; volunteering, research, high GPA, etc. In retrospect I feel like I was motivated more by competing with my peers than anything else. I decided this year that I want to pursue computer science instead, and I'm starting from ground 0. I feel crushing anxiety about my career because I feel that I'm years behind of everyone else.

On one hand, the motivation is good because it makes me get stuff done; I have a research internship in computer science lined up for the summer and I'm working on catching up to everyone else. On the other, I feel like my way of thinking is extremely toxic. I applied to a leadership program for computer science students at my school with a friend of mine. I know that this is horrible, but my instinct was to want him not to get in, so that I could feel that I am ahead of him.

Does anyone else feel that they are doing poorly if they are not doing significantly better than their peers? I feel like the way I was brought up contributed to a lot of this, although I'm trying to overcome it now."

I've been struggling with a decision I recently made, in terms having some regret that has been bothering me. 

**Background**: Last summer I was supposed to be at a fairly famous three letter agency for an internship. Unfortunately for this internship I needed a very intensive security clearance and it did not finish in time for the internship. I was given the option to continue the clearance for a internship during the year, which I accepted.

After not hearing literally anything, despite my attempts to contact someone, I decided to start my job search again as I graduate this year. I was able to get a string internship at another federal agency (no security clearance required) and a job offer (I accepted) for a data science fellowship (3 year term) after I graduate with a very nice compensation package that works in the defense sector.

**What happened**: The day my new internship started I get a call from the previous agency that my clearance had gone through and asked when I could start. I explained that I was at another federal agency at the time and they said they would contact me about other options. I then get an email that I'm on their for-hire-list and I start getting job offers from this agency that for the past year and a half I've been thinking about.

Unfortunately, none of the positions were for a data scientist and the compensation was over 25k less than my fellowship so I turned it down.


**Conflicted**: I would love to work at the agency, but I just don't think the entry level position they would give me would help me grow in my career. I have student loans and the higher salary is also super compelling to me. I just keep regretting turning down an opportunity that for so long I wanted/still want?

Any advice on how I should deal with this? Did I make the right decision, or did I throw away something I should of taken?"

I’m currently finishing my final year of high school and am struggling with deciding on a major. Following university, I would want a career in technology consulting. The university I’m hoping to attend offers a degree in business technology management. I’ve always wanted a career focused on technology because it appears that is where the job market is most lucrative. Unfortunately, math is not my strong suit so I’m not sure I could pursue computer science as a major. I do, however, enjoy coding. I know that computer science is heavily math-based however. I currently am enrolled at a local college as dual-credit student studying software development, so I have some knowledge in both software and hardware. Would a degree in business technology management, perhaps with a minor in computer science, increase my chances of finding a job in technology consulting? Or would a degree in computer science, with a minor in business administration or business technology management, be better? I live in Canada but would love to eventually move to the States to pursue my career. My university is not high in ranks, but I of course would be doing a lot of networking and internships. Would that also increase my chances of being hired by a bigger company? Sorry if this was all over the place, but thanks for reading and any answers!"

I just wanted to get your opinions on this. I’ve been having a lot of self doubt in the fork I’m stuck between. 

So let me start off by saying that I have a degree in biology. My grades weren’t cut out for medical school and so I have moved onto the idea of pursuing CS. I am taking an intro to comp sci course at my local community college, learning basic java, while working FT. My goal isn’t to pursue a second degree. I am interested in apprenticing at X company. I do plan to take a python course, advanced java (questionable), discrete math (questionable), mobile app, and c++. I am not sure if I want to do an internship because idk if that would effect my eligibility for applying to an apprenticeship. I definitely want to do my own mini projects and try some leetcode problems when I’m more advanced. 

Honestly this is all new to me. I’m used to pipetting, making solutions, and looking at things under a microscope. It’s too early to say, but I just don’t know how to prepare myself for this journey. I don’t want to be too calculating but a guideline would help me ease the stress. I’m questioning whether or not taking these courses would help me be an effective coder. I do want to take my time and process all the information in this new world. I definitely don’t want to be disrespectful and seem like I’m overstepping boundaries, for example I am extremely nervous in applying to internships after one semester cause what if I don’t know what the heck I’m doing?! But I’m 25 and I feel like I’m so late to the game. I need experience! 

My questions are:
1. What are your thoughts about boot camp vs degree? 
2. Would you recommend me to take all the courses listed above, if not, more (and which ones)? 
3. Would it be cheating if I apply to an internship and then an apprenticeship? 
4. Where can I find beginner project ideas and resources? 
5. Any tips? 

Thanks for reading!"

I'll start this off with a brief background and then jump into my situation. I appreciate all the advice I've gotten here over the years, and thanks in advance to anyone with some pointers on where to go now!

* Education
   * BSc Honors in CS
      * Canadian University. 100-125 worldwide according to THE 2020 rankings.
      * 3.8 CS GPA
   * MSc in Computer Science (in progress)
      * Canadian University. Department is Top 10 worldwide CS graduate program, and even more so in my area. Number of notable faculty and discoveries in my research area at the university. This is a thesis stream program with a focus on producing research.
      * Research Area: Machine Learning in Healthcare. Lots of my work has extended into Systems and Software Engineering (as these are my interests as well).
      * Was ""supposed"" to have finished Jan 2020, however extended and aiming for June 2020 convocation but will be very tight to finish thesis. Could have done internships but didn't apply as I wanted to finish.
      * 3.2 GPA. Need four courses for degree and ended up taking an F in one. Otherwise have four A/A+'s.
      * Couple average publications as second author or shared/group first author. Nothing first author solo or major conference.
      * Received a \~$15k scholarship for AI research.
* Work Experience
   * 2016 - Intuit Canada - 8 months
      * Frontend WebDev. Part of undergrad work experience program.
   * 2017 - Intuit USA (Main Campus) - 4 Months
      * DevOps, CI/CD, ... . Return offer.
   * 2018 - Uber NYC - 2x4 months
      * Backend product engineering. Return offer (declined for MSc).

To put it briefly, I don't feel like I am good enough to do academic or industrial AI/ML research, nor am I sure that I want to, but after \~2 years in grad school, my software engineering abilities have notably deteriorated. I remember SE concepts, but I can get stumped by LeetCode Easy's and have trouble remembering some of the CS basics. I'm worried about the SE interview process and honestly, after long days of grinding on my thesis project, it's a real struggle to study even more for interviews. I don't doubt that I can excel as an engineer, but the interview is a hurdle as it's unrelated to my recent work and the actual job it's for. Then there's the whole issue of whether I really want to do a PhD, and if so, what my options even are (other than staying at the school I am at).

As for career priorities in the next 10 years, I'd say: career opportunities (ability to move to better positions/companies, continual learning), compensation, work/life balance. One worry I've been having is that regular Software Engineering will become oversupplied and devalue over time, but the AI/ML jobs might stand more of a chance long term. Even if I end up in a strict SE position, I would probably continue some AI/ML research on my own through my collaborators, though I would prefer this is integrated into my job. Something where SE meets ML would be a dream so that I can continue to develop both skill sets. I'm really aiming for big tech/FANG as that has the lifestyle and compensation I am looking for, but getting into Al/ML there is much more difficult. At the same time, I don't think I could give up the compensation and perks to go somewhere smaller/Canadian just to do data science.

Any and all advice is appreciated! I'm assuming many answers will be to buckle up and grind out the interview prep cycle if I want a job."

I had practiced Graphs, HashTable problems, Heaps, sorting, etc.. But not binary search.   He asked a binary search question and I was fucked. Could not properly think or formulate anything of value.

Needless to say I was rejected and I'm really broken up over it. I thought this would be a career defining moment for me to have a Big Tech internship this early. I was so excited especially being from a random university and being not the most 'smart' student historically.

Anyways, I'm wondering how I should be feeling. I think about it everyday. In the meantime, I am applying to a bunch of Canadian companies like RBC (just got HackerRank) and I am referred to Google and FaceBook for Fall (fall wouldnt be ideal but id gladly take it)

I’m a 24 year old female. Two years ago I moved a thousand miles away from home for an internship and completely fell in love with the city I was in. I was great at my job, entered my first healthy romantic relationship, and made incredible friendships. For the first time in my life, I truly felt happy and like I was living instead of existing. My mom, however, was not happy about that. Every single phone call or text messages was sealed with a passive aggressive, “I can’t wait until you come home/you flat left me” bow. Despite wanting to stay in the new city after my internship, I came home just to make her happy. Throughout my year away, I was constantly told by family and friends how miserable she was because she just missed me SO much. I voiced my desire to stay to my dad and my aunts, and they all more or less told me that I owed coming home to my mom, because the internship was supposed to be a year and going “SURPRISE! I’m moving here” seemed cruel. I was also told that my dad was having heath issues as well. They also all told me that I can always move back. I felt like I had no choice, so I moved back home. 

Ever since I’ve returned I’ve been extremely lonely and depressed. I feel like my life in on pause, both socially and career-wise. I have a bachelors degree in English, and I’ve been taking finance courses at the local community college and making podcast as a means to distract myself from my crippling loneliness. I’ve applied for a few “big girl” jobs and have gotten an interview or two, but nothing came from it. Right now I’m working at a “high end” retail store. 

I was recently offered a position back at my old company. I told my mom and her response has just been hysterical crying for hours. She keeps saying things like “what’s the point of having kids if they’re going to leave you?” “You’re born alone, you die alone” “why can’t you just move an hour away” “I never thought I’d have a kid like that” and “I’m so mad, I’m so mad, I’m so mad.” Obviously I love my mom and I feel so guilty that I’m breaking her heart. I know this change is going to affect our family dynamic forever. I want to make this move, but it’s so hard not to internalize her sadness and this guilt. I love my mom so much, and she has done so much for me. She works a terrible job that she hates because it pays well and provides for the family. She always went without so I could have extra. I’ve heard from so many friends and even my dad that I am not responsible for her happiness and that I need to live for myself, but dealing with the fallout from this is so hard when I know I’m breaking her heart. 

She keeps saying that I just want to live with my boyfriend and that I’m going to be stuck in a low paying job forever. However, I have every interest in getting a masters degree and going back to school to study either finance or psychology. The company I would be working for would even sponsor me for full tuition assistance. And of course I want to live with my boyfriend, but he isn’t the main reason I’d be moving there again. My parents are still together, but my dad has a massive temper. Every week or so there’s also a huge fight because of something so small and insignificant (ie dishes being in the sink). I don’t want to live in an environment like this anymore. I miss having a job I liked, having a social life, and feeling like I have agency instead of being trapped. But with her being so upset, it’s making me feel so guilty that I’m starting to question what I want. I don’t know how to be strong and do what is best for me. 

I love her and I don’t want to hurt her, but I also don’t want to end up in a Grey Gardens situation where I waste my life away just to appease her."

I am doing PHP, PostgreSQL, and VueJS and working part-time while I work on a BS in Computer Science. I also managed to secure another internship for Summer 2020 at a well-known large bank in Charlotte, NC. Ultimately, I want to set up myself up for the best career possible and leave the current city where I'm in school.

Current Internship:
Pros:

* Pay: $20/hour 
* Flexibility: Will work with me while I'm in school. Maybe able to go remote after 6 months.

Cons:

* Small company and not much in way of working on larger scale. 

Big bank internship:
Pros:

* $10/hour higher pay rate, $1500 housing stipend
* Located in a larger city
* Likely working on more in demand tech stack (don't know assignment yet though)
* Networking opportunities

Cons:

* Would need to give up ""regular pay"" in current internship.
* Red tape of large company

This leaves me with 3 options:

* Stay at internship, decline big bank internship. Stay part-time indefinitely and keep working on degree.
* Stay at internship, again, decline big bank internship. Go full-time and take what classes I can. Potentially leave school early and ""cash in"" on my experience and then move to more desirable area.
* Go to big bank internship, leave current job. Return back to city that I'm at school in, but no guarantee I will be able to come back to current job.

I'm really torn in this case as my current internship provides flexibility and experience. On the other hand, I have wanted to try living in a bigger city for awhile. Either way, I will need to work to some degree. My thinking is that if I leave my current situation, yes I will make more money, but I won't necessarily be able to return to this current internship in the Fall so I may find myself without a job come Fall. But on the other hand, I will get to work at a higher level and be in a better area to build connections with (even if its only for 2 months). I'm wondering if this is a ""bird in the hand"" kind of situation."

I thought it would be rather simple to bring her to the US, but that seems near impossible in a reasonable timeframe without being separated for a very prolonged period of time. 

We are ready to do whatever is needed for me to come to France now, as that seems the best option. 

What is the most straightforward way of doing this? Marriage seems rather complicated in France, lots of documents and translations, but we are ready to do it after Canada. 

If we are married in the US first, does that help us at all in helping me immigrate to France? 

What type of Visa will I need to go to France to officially marry her there?

I appreciate any help you all can give."

SAT 2 Physics is low but decided to send it to show I branch out a bit. GPA is petty rocky, Luckily Indian CBSE so was pretty lenient while converting.

My plan is to dropout of university (second year), stay in California, after my tech internship, join a startup accelerator and continue to grow my startup.

Heres some relevant info: 

- Canadian Citizen

- No criminal record

- I’ve been coding since I was 10. And started working in the industry when I was 16/17.

- 2nd year Computer Science student at top Canadian school (where I’m considering dropping out of end of this academic year).

- 2x software engineer intern at Shopify. Located in Toronto, ON, CA

- Apple WWDC Scholarship recipient (1 of 350 international)

- 2x Microsoft software engineer intern. Located in Redmond, WA, USA (J-1 visa) [2nd time will be this summer]

- Incoming Google software engineer intern. Located in Mountain View, CA, USA  (J-1 visa) [Doing this instead of going back to school in the fall]

- Accepted into elite Silicon Valley fellowship program, backed by large VC firms. But requires you to dropout of school and gives you $100,000 USD (under 1% annual international acceptance).

- Interest from US based investors in my startup.

- *** Tentative: potential acceptance into elite Silicon Valley startup accelerator (which invests into my startup).

Primarily given my Apple scholarship (which gained me some personal media attention), my recent acceptance into an elite Silicon Valley fellowship group (which most likely will give me/my startup some more media attention). Is there any chance I’ll be a strong applicant to the O1 visa? Since dropping out would prevent me from getting a TN visa, or would I have to take a formal investment from an investor towards my company so I can get a business visa? 


Any advice helps, thanks :)"

My old laptop is about 7 years old and simply will not run ArcMap with any sort of efficiency, let alone ArcPro. It's time to buy a new computer, and I'm having trouble deciding between a laptop and a desktop. The two I'm looking at are:

1. [HP Z2 Mini G4 Workstation](https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-z2-mini-g4-workstation?intel=8gi5&amp;jumpid=cs_com_nc_ns&amp;utm_medium=cs&amp;utm_source=ga&amp;utm_campaign=INT_COMM_I5_HGM_BR-DT&amp;utm_content=sp&amp;adid=312654707024&amp;addisttype=gpla_with_promotion&amp;5DU71UT%23ABA&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA1fnxBRBBEiwAVUouUk-vw8K4NXEi59nOmeWdcx7Qj3wBtnBY9RTCrlDchfhvIWVkPjeW8hoCZ1IQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds).

2. [EVOO Gaming Laptop](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Laptop-FHD-GTX-Windows-Black-Intel-Nvidia-Display-i7-9750H-16GB-Tuned-10-THX-Memory-1650-Home-144Hz-9th-SSD-EVOO-Gen-Spatial-256GB-Audio-Gaming-15/545386564?irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_0sq09kwOMxyORV9wUx0Mo34BUknQl00lQ1f5240&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_1883484&amp;clickid=0sq09kwOMxyORV9wUx0Mo34BUknQl00lQ1f5240). 

The HP costs ~800 USD (post tax) with a discount. If I were to buy the HP, I would upgrade it with a 500gb SSD and 8gb of RAM, which would bring its total to roughly **~890 USD**

The EVOO costs ~860 USD (post tax). If I were to buy the laptop, I would replace its SSD with a 500gb piece. This would bump the price up to **~930 USD**

I am hemming and hawing over portability and CPU power. If I were to go with the HP, I would sacrifice portability for an extra 0.4 ghz processing power and 250gb of SSD storage. Complicating this is that I doubt that I need an ""on-the-go"" GIS laptop. I would only ArcGIS at school, home, and eventually, at work. School computers are great, whomever I will work for would provide a computer, so I really only need something for at home. 

Am I dumb to buy a desktop, especially when the specs/price are so similar? Or is having the extra storage/processing power worth it?

I'd love some advice, please and thanks! I really need a computer that can run ArcPro ASAP since I'm going to be starting an internship within the coming week that will require me to have my own machine."

(Rant, I'm sorry if I sound all over the place. English is not my first language)

I am a 25-year-old international student, currently doing my second master's in Canada. I have so many things going on in my head and I just feel like I am not handling it well.

I am constantly stressed because I can't find a job in my field. I have been in Canada for more than 1 year (4 months stayed in Cambodia for a project). I see my classmates and the majority of them either have a job or got one in the government during their 2nd year. My program is about public policy and international affairs. As an international student, I have to struggle more, which is fair. I totally get it but even though I am qualified as much as anyone here, I don't even get an interview. I plan to graduate in April and I am still looking for a job, while everyone else has a job waiting for them. The fact that this is my second master's degree and I don't speak French makes it worse because I feel incompetent.

My parents are paying my fees, which are 3x more than what the locals pay. The fees increase every semester and I feel like a burden to my family. My parents say they will send money as much as I need and they have always been very supportive of me. Maybe that's why I feel guilty because I feel like a loser, good for nothing. I worked part-time as soon as I landed in Canada and was doing 4 courses in a semester on top of it, while still adjusting to a new country. I couldn't do it, I was struggling so much that I got fired from the place (a burger joint lol) after 3 weeks. My first semester grades were not that great - I lost the chance to get into co-op by a 0.5 mark. Co-op is an opportunity for students to gain work experience and it was my hope to get Canadian experience but I lost it. My sister finished her program (5years ago) in 4 semesters and she had co-op. I worked as a Research Assistant at the university and it helped a little bit (financially) but I couldn't save because I had to go back to my country for my sister's wedding. This was winter of 2019. I was really depressed and I tried to reach out and seek professional help but since I didn't have a family doctor, I couldn't get one at the school.

However, I had a breakthrough last year when I got accepted to a UN internship programme in Cambodia for 4 months (which I had to pay $3700 on top of my semester fee plus my living cost in Cambodia that my parents paid). The experience was really great and I actually did some substantial work. Now I am back to school and I am planning to finish my program this semester but it seems like I can't. Because my research supervisor said I can't submit my research draft on this 19th as it is too soon so I might have to finish it next semester (pay fees again).  
I am tired and I feel lost. I don't have a penny in my name, My sister lives in Toronto and she is doing very well. I have attended numerous career development workshops after landing here and they all seem to emphasize on 'networking' if I want to get a job. However, as an introvert and also coming from a very different culture, I find it very difficult to talk to people. I feel like people do not care what I say so I might as well not say anything. I have 2 or 3 friends in this country and I don't feel like they want to hear or know what's in my head so I don't tell them anything.

I have always had suicidal thoughts since I was 11 or 12 but never acted on it. My sister keeps telling me to find a job and telling me that I am wasting money. I haven't brought anything for myself to make me happy since I got here. I don't have friends to hang out with or even ask how/what I'm doing. My only friend here recently got a bf so she doesn't reply for days. That's fair because she is busy and she has no obligation to reply to my text right away. But I feel less and less wanted. Most of my friends back home are either working or getting married and I am nowhere near anything. I just think that nobody will notice if I just disappeared, except for my parents and my sister. But, on the other hand, a part of me feels like they might be relieved because then, they don't have to worry about their youngest good-for-nothing daughter, who can't even find a job at the age of 25 and constantly wasting money. I don't see a future anymore. I have no passion, no talent, no hobby and I could be the least interesting person on this planet.

People always say ""if you want to be liked, work on yourself, work on your confidence and the way you present yourself etc etc"". But how can I work on myself when I already feel so lost? I am ashamed and I feel like I can't stop myself from comparing with my peers and it breaks my heart that I have achieved nothing. I am in constant crippling emotional debt to my parents and I can't help but feel like a total failure.  
I need help but I don't know who to talk to. I want to improve and prove to myself that I am not lost but I don't know how to. Maybe life is not for me."

I have attended numerous career development workshops after landing here and they all seem to emphasize on 'networking' if I want to get a job. However, as an introvert and also coming from a very different culture, I find it very difficult to talk to people. I feel like people do not care what I say so I might as well not say anything. I have 2 or 3 friends in this country and I don't feel like they want to hear or know what's in my head so I don't tell them anything.

I have always had suicidal thoughts since I was 11 or 12 but never acted on it. My sister keeps telling me to find a job and telling me that I am wasting money. I haven't brought anything for myself to make me happy since I got here. I don't have friends to hang out with or even ask how/what I'm doing. My only friend here recently got a bf so she doesn't reply for days. That's fair because she is busy and she has no obligation to reply to my text right away. But I feel less and less wanted. Most of my friends back home are either working or getting married and I am nowhere near anything. I just think that nobody will notice if I just disappeared, except for my parents and my sister. But, on the other hand, a part of me feels like they might be relieved because then, they don't have to worry about their youngest good-for-nothing daughter, who can't even find a job at the age of 25 and constantly wasting money. I don't see a future anymore. I have no passion, no talent, no hobby and I could be the least interesting person on this planet.

People always say ""if you want to be liked, work on yourself, work on your confidence and the way you present yourself etc etc"". But how can I work on myself when I already feel so lost? I am ashamed and I feel like I can't stop myself from comparing with my peers and it breaks my heart that I have achieved nothing. I am in constant crippling emotional debt to my parents and I can't help but feel like a total failure.  
I need help but I don't know who to talk to. I want to improve and prove to myself that I am not lost but I don't know how to. Maybe life is not for me."

I'm a first-year MBA at top 10 b-school. I have a liberal arts background and before coming to school, I worked at small organizations in the creative field. I'm interested in retail, mostly strategy roles, and I'm trying to decide between Nike and Amazon internships.

Nike Global Operations Internship

I was really excited about Nike and think it's an awesome company, one of the best in retail. I think operations will be really challenging and interesting. I know the culture at Nike is great, and I've spoken to former interns who said they didn't have to work many hours and they're projects weren't very difficult. My counselor told me that Nike does not re-recruit for full-time and the internship is the pipeline to full-time. High conversion rate to full-time offer. My problem is, I don't know if I would want to live in Portland (I lived in NYC and SF before) and my goal coming into an MBA program was to push myself.

Amazon Retail Leadership Development Program

I've heard mixed things - obviously, one red flag is the workplace culture. I think I could learn a lot here though and be challenged. 50% conversion rate to full-time offer - I've heard MBA's are pretty competitive about getting that return offer. Although I want to work in retail, I'd get some tech experience here as well. I think I'd prefer Seattle to Portland. But, I've been told Nike is a more selective internship and my concern is Amazon takes a lot of MBA interns. Not sure if I'd work at Amazon fulltime if I got the return offer, but I know the pay differential between Amazon and Nike is big. 

Not sure which would necessarily position me better for a career in retail / for re-recruiting in the future. I could have a really enjoyable summer at Nike or hustle hard at Amazon. This would probably be my only shot to experience working at Nike, while I could re-interview for RLDP at Amazon next year (and go through the brutal interview process again). Also, I was hoping to return to NY or CA post-MBA.

Would love some input, especially from anyone who has any insight into either internship programs.

Thanks!"
f12yxh,2,2020-02-08,Statistics minor?,cs-binchhh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f12yxh/statistics_minor/,"Hi peeps,

I'm in a bit of a pickle. I am currently a fourth year student at a top Canadian university (McGill University) majoring in computer science. Over the last year, I have however realized that being a software developer is just not what I want to do. I love coding, and have had two internships as a dev, but much prefer ML/data analysis due to the field's versatility in a variety of fields (quantitative social sciences, biological data analysis, heck even data science applied to astronomy).

My question is the following: would extending my studies ever-so-slightly (1 year part-time - approximately 12-15 credits) to fulfill a statistics minor be worth it (courses would be in stochastic processes, time series, and probably databases to fill in a few CS holes)? I was initially planning on going for a master's to deepen my knowledge of the field but I just can't justify the financial and applications hassle (already took courses in ML, bioinformatics, NLP and Vision) for a program that seems redundant.

For context: I took out loans to pay for college but have already been paying them off with internship savings. I'm currently \~20k CAD in the debt hole, and would be around the same upon graduation in a year (have an internship lined up and would pick up a part-time job upon starting next year).

Thanks for your help!"

I have not had much success despite applying a lot(done about 70 apps and 10 coding challenges). Recent failures in later round interviews really have me feeling down. Should I be nervous at this point about not having something yet, or do people think there is still enough time not to worry? Are there any companies that are notably easier to get into for internships so I know I have a better chance of my time spent applying paying off?

Also most of the positions I have applied to have been through referrals, LinkedIn, or JumpStart.

Any advice is appreciated.

f1375s,3,2020-02-08,Did I make the right decision turning down a Data Analyst position at an Agency I want to work at for a Data Scientist position somewhere else?,chankills,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/f1375s/did_i_make_the_right_decision_turning_down_a_data/,"Hi All,

I've been struggling with a decision I recently made, in terms having some regret that has been bothering me.

**Background:** Last summer I was supposed to be at a fairly famous three letter agency for an internship. Unfortunately for this internship I needed a very intensive security clearance and it did not finish in time for the internship. I was given the option to continue the clearance for a internship during the year, which I accepted.

After not hearing literally anything, despite my attempts to contact someone, I decided to start my job search again as I graduate this year. I was able to get a spring internship at another federal agency (no security clearance required) and a job offer (I accepted) for a data science fellowship (3 year term) after I graduate with a very nice compensation package that works in the defense sector.

**What happened:** The day my new internship started I get a call from the previous agency that my clearance had gone through and asked when I could start. I explained that I was at another federal agency at the time and they said they would contact me about other options. I then get an email that I'm on their for-hire-list and I start getting job offers from this agency that for the past year and a half I've been thinking about.

Unfortunately, none of the positions were for a data scientist and the compensation was over 25k less than my fellowship so I turned it down.

**Conflicted:** I would love to work at the agency, but I just don't think the entry level position they would give me would help me grow in my career. I have student loans and the higher salary is also super compelling to me. I just keep regretting turning down an opportunity that for so long I wanted/still want?

Did I make the right decision, or did I throw away something I should of taken?"
f13f5t,2,2020-02-08,my first suicide post lol,why_am_ilikethis,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f13f5t/my_first_suicide_post_lol/,"welp, here I am. After months of stalking from the sidelines, I guess I finally want to say something.

I'm 18, turn 19 in June. In college, sophomore year. I don't really know what I want to do anymore. I went to school for journalism, but after getting through the first starter classes in my freshman year, my first ""true"" journalism class kicked my ass and I dropped the class, along with another course. Last semester was really hard for me. I was so depressed, I barely made it to class, hence why I ended up dropping the two classes.

I also quit my student newspaper job because of the pressure to write stories, again, can't even do the actual profession, right? Like, it sucks because of how bright-eyed I was my freshman year and the start of the semester going into it. Anything was possible and I felt on top of the world. I had gotten a scholarship that paid for my tuition because the professors thought I had potential. I had plans to go intern at the Capitol this fall semester to work in political reporting. I was so... excited.

And now, I'm barely waking up and getting through it all. I know where I am. I was here last semester, when my suicidal ideation was so bad, I was thinking of suicide every damn day. I wanted to just not exist anymore, right? It's not the death part that I wanted, it was the feeling of not having to deal with thinking.

I don't have any ""close"" friends. I think I have people who consider me a friend, but I'm so introverted and distant, I feel like they have no idea what's going on. And I don't really want to even talk to them, about anything. I feel isolated from everyone I knew in my freshman year. Ugh, this is such a weird feeling. It's like, I don't feel like I have people I connect with, that I have a purpose or someone to *feel* something towards.

I remember last semester being so close to suicide, but knowing that (and this isn't a good way to look at it but it's the only way my mind has wrapped itself around why I don't commit suicide) I'm too selfish and cowardly to kill myself. I don't want to feel pain and I'm afraid more of what I'll miss out than anything going with my life.

It's annoying because my brain constantly telling me to kill myself, that I'm worthless, that I would feel better if I just stopped living, but I know that I'll never actually do it. I'll never be able to take the plunge. It's worse when I called my parents or a guy I met for a hookup to explain why I feel like this and they tell me to go to the clinic on campus because, in their heads, they think that I'll kill myself if I don't, but I know that I won't. I'll just continue in this cycle of self-hate and wanting to die and then not doing it and then hating myself BECAUSE I didn't do it.

I also feel alienated from the world at large. It's weird because there are a bunch of young white guys who are constantly bitching and moaning and complaining about how women, people of color, and queer people are ruining their lives and making everything worse and they wish we could go back to the old days (where they were in charge). But the thing about being a white guy (who happens to be gay) in ""leftist"" politics is that you feel so alienated from everything. I don't feel connected to oppression experiences are a woman or a person of color. Even being gay I feel isn't as bad as being trans or non-binary.

I just feel like anytime I feel like I understand the world, it's invalidated by someone else's experiences. I don't feel like my opinions matters and I want them to matter, but I know that I have privilege and that just me whining about being a white guy is adding fuel to the fire of alt-right trolls and making social justice harder to attain. I was recently reading an article by a Black woman and she just casually mentions that it's not Black people's responsibility to end white supremacy and that white people need to fix it and I don't know... I just felt ucky, like I felt this shame of being white.

And I know that alt-right trolls like to use ""white guilt"" as a way to say the ""Left"" is trying to destroy white men and send us into a totalitarian nightmare of Ethnically-ambiguous trans lesbian dictators. Like, trust me, I know how people use ""white guilt"" as a concept to make white guys more angry at social justice movements and rile them up, so I try not to fall for it.

And there are ways some people who are liberal use ""white guilt"" as a cop-out to not engaging sincerely with Black activists. As an example from the aforementioned Black woman, white women who cry when faced with the ways that racism still permeates our society, specifically when white women use it again Black men.

But there's something I feel that like, emotional. I feel bad. I don't like the fact that our world still has racism in it. I want it to stop. I want these problems fixed. And the problem is... what am I supposed to do as a white guy, living in the middle of white America? The solution I guess to uplift as many voices of people of color, including Indigenous and especially women. But... what does uplifting mean? Like, I'm literally an 18-year-old college student trying to figure out what career I want while struggling with depression. What platform do I have to uplift these voices?

And already, I'm berating myself. I could look around for events that highlight people of color. I could spend my money on reading authors of color and Indigenous authors. I could give my money in PayPal to these people on Twitter or something. There is plenty I could do. But honestly, I feel like I just want to drown myself.

This is the part that gets me down the worst. I'd rather fantasize about killing myself than putting in any effort to end racism or misogyny or whatever. That's what's awful. That I am so complacent in my life that I would rather wallow in self-pity than lift a finger to try and help the world. I hate myself.

I don't feel like I have a community to turn to. Hell, even being gay, you'd think, but aren't you involved with like, the LGBTQ groups on campus? Well, I did, my freshman year. And guess what? I didn't feel any companionship. It felt more like just a small group of upperclassmen who already knew each other pretending to represent LGBTQ interests on campus while doing shit-all. I joined the fucking board of the club and no one there listened to what I thought. I was the cis white gay. Everyone else was more important than me.

Here, again. The trolls get to me. I know how stupid I sound. I should be listening, not having to interject my opinion everywhere. And a bunch of ""free-thinking rationalist"" will use this as proof of what a ""cuck"" I am or how the ""SJWs"" are destroying ""Western Civilization."" God, I don't even feel like I have any room to think without worrying about what everyone else is going to think. Hell, not even in my own anonymous suicide post can I feel truly safe to voice my thoughts.

I feel absolutely alone. I don't have any true connections. I have no goals in the future. I literally am just trying to make it through each day. I don't feel safe to think anymore. I don't feel like I even want to live in the world. That if I could just die, maybe that could help fix things. One less white guy to voice his opinion. And obviously, I'm not suggesting that white guys should just kill themselves to fix racism and sexism (f), but I have had the fantasy of killing myself and then making room for Indigenous or people of color to have my money or anything of mine. Like, that's legitimately a fantasy I've had.

Even then, that's a fantasy that basically means I'm a coward to run away from actually helping fight injustice. Like, even when I want to kill myself, I feel like a terrible person. I don't want to exist anymore. I wish I could wipe myself from the thought of every person I know. Pretend this white boy never existed. Maybe give all my money away to activist foundations and then work as a homeless person who advocates...

God, I sound absolutely batshit insane. I feel like it. I've been dealing with this train of thought in my head for the past 6 months or so. And this post literally all started because I saw that there was a Black Solidarity Summit happen on my campus today and I was like, that's cool, who's the speaker? Let me check her out! And then I just turn into a self-hating mess who wants to die to purge himself from responsibility.

And I know a lot of people are going to say, ""Just treat people with kindness! I don't see color! UwU!""

I know I'm being antagonistic. I know that I'm making it very hard for someone to sympathize with me. I know that I sound like a spoiled brat who's never had to deal with real problems. I know all of that. I just hate myself lol.

Welp, guess y'all can leave your comments. I'm going to go chug a bottle of Coca Cola until my teeth wither and then think about how much I hate myself some more.

God, what a pisser"
f14l91,1,2020-02-09,Not sure if I should leave my internship or not after receiving this news,kennythecopyguy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f14l91/not_sure_if_i_should_leave_my_internship_or_not/,"Hi guys, just found this sub and thought it would be able to help me in my current situation. So I am graduating college this May, and for the past year I have been interning at this company. I work anywhere from 20-30 hrs a week while being a full time student. I don’t want to go into too much detail, but I study finance and this internship is very high level and has been very stressful for me. Unfortunately, against what I was lead on to believe, they just told me they won’t be hiring me full time upon my graduation in a few months, but they want me to stay on until May.

I am pretty upset considering I’ve asked in the past if they are planning to keep me later, and they always implied they would but wouldn’t give me a straight answer. As far as I know, I have done nothing to make them dislike me. My question is, should I stay until May or put in a 2 weeks notice so I can focus more on recruiting? The money isn’t super important to me for these last few months, and it would be nice to only focus on keeping my grades up for the rest of the semester. My only concerns are that I would make my manager upset for leaving as soon as she told me this news (I still want to keep a good relationship with this company), and that the other part time intern on my team will be bombarded with work as soon as I leave.

Also if I do decide to put in my notice, I’m not sure how I would tell them. Would it also be easier on everyone to just put in a months notice so they have more time to figure out how to handle my absence? This all might sound silly, but I’m just not sure what the right thing to do here is."
f14s1h,19,2020-02-09,What to say to recruiters regarding classification (sophomore or junior) and expected graduation at the CNS Career Fair?,elydna,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/f14s1h/what_to_say_to_recruiters_regarding/,"Hey everyone, I’m preparing for the upcoming CNS career fair but I’m still facing a dilemma regarding what to tell recruiters about my classification and expected graduation.

My situation is a bit complicated. I’m a CS major in my third year of college, but my second year here at UT, and I’m only in OS. I was in the CAP program at UTSA, which restricted me to taking only core and general math/science classes, none of which were CS. I started 312 when I got here for my second year of college, so I’m a year behind and technically sophomore level in CS right now. My expected graduation is a semester late, on December 2021.

A couple of recruiters at this point have seen my expected graduation and coursework on my resume and figured out that I had to transfer into CS. This seems to put me at a disadvantage for getting interviews. Also, my level of experience doesn’t quite match that of other juniors (I didn’t have CS knowledge before getting in), so I have to rely on just two personal projects and a website. I don’t have any previous internship experience, and I’m aiming more for startups/medium-sized companies rather than big-name companies.

My biggest concern is: **should I tell recruiters that I’m a sophomore or a junior?** I’m a junior by both year and degree completion, but if I say that, I may end up being evaluated on the standards of juniors, and expected to have much more experience. If I say I’m a sophomore, then it seems more believable and in-line with my experience, but then I don’t stand a chance with the companies that hire only juniors and seniors.

Also, along with the suggestion of saying I’m a sophomore, a couple of resume reviewers told me to change my expected graduation from Dec 2021 to May 2022. This would make me being a transfer student less obvious."
f14zw0,3,2020-02-09,Finance at Bulge Bracket Bank -&gt; FAANG Software Engineer,KaiMou,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f14zw0/finance_at_bulge_bracket_bank_faang_software/,"I've had many direct messages sent to me on Reddit so I've decided to make a post to point these folks towards.

I graduated 2016 in New York with a business degree with a minor in CS. During my time at school, I've always focused on making it to the ""front office roles"" in a BB bank. The people around me were only focused on working at GS/MS and even though I wasn't SUPER interested in finance, it was a thing I thought I could see myself doing. During my junior year summer, I interned at one of the BB banks as a Sales and Trading analyst. After a grueling summer of 6 AM to 6 PM days and being treated like shit for being junior, I was already planning my next steps away from finance. Immediately after the internship, I applied for **100** software engineering jobs in the greater NYC area and received 0 callbacks. With no further time to spare, I signed my BB offer for Sales and Trading post graduation.

I started my full time position in June immediately after graduation. Given that we were prepping to take our [FINRA exams](https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams) for two months, our hours at the time were roughly 9 AM 5 PM. This gave me a lot of time to prepare for interviews via Leetcode. During the summer, I applied to another 50-60 jobs with 1-2 responses from which I was promptly ghosted after resending my resume. I gave up on the transition a bit after this.

After taking the FINRA exams, the work became grueling involving 6AM - 6PM days. This also included running lunch errands and coffee daily for the traders. Some days it involved me carrying 7-8 coffees by myself or taking 6-7 Sweetgreen Salad orders. In the winter, the hours were brutal as you never left the building for lunch since traders were expected to eat at their desks. 

Although I was supposed to be focusing on pitching trade ideas, I instead looked for opportunities to optimize existing Excel spreadsheets into Python scripts. For example, our team used Excel/VBA to risk our entire trading portfolio. Given the amount of securities in a portfolio, the Excel sheet would constantly crash. I focused on writing a Python script that would pull the data and calculate the risk exposure in a separate process and write down the risk to a flat file which Excel would read. This offloaded a lot of the heavy computation to Python which was more efficient than doing it in Excel.

After starting in June, I decided to start applying for jobs again in November. I couldn't stand the hours anymore and the attitude from senior employees towards the junior employees. I focused on sending out 200 more applications and framed my experience at the bank and really **focused on the business impact of the code I had written.**

200 applications later, I had received callbacks from 3 places. Take home assignment + onsite interview about basic coding for all 3. Received 2/3 offers. The place that rejected me told me it was too risky to hire a college graduate. I took the offer and one of the places which was a tiny seed stage startup. I would be the first engineer. This was when my foot was in the door.

I spent one year at the seed stage startup. There, I learned about code cleanliness, OOP design patterns in Ruby. Ultimately, I was still 1 of 3 engineers but just having the title was enough for recruiters after a year. When applying to jobs the second time around, I was fortunate enough to receive 3-4 offers with only 50-60 applications. 

Did my next year at a late stage startup where I learned about Kubernetes/Microservice Architecture/Post Mortems and other ""solid engineering practices"". During my last couple of months ago, I completed 400 LC problems and decided to pursue FAANG which I was able to land one after 2 onsites.

Many people think that not having a degree is why they can't get a job and then these people decide to pursue a boot camp. Ultimately, I think given the number of people graduating from boot camps every year, the value of a boot camp is becoming lower and lower. I would suggest anyone trying to break into tech exhaust all other options before going down the boot camp option.

Tips for finance employees trying to go to tech:

1. Given that you made it to finance, you probably have decent social skills from all the networking events. **You will need to emphasize this trait during the in-person interviews.** Fortunately, this is where software engineers are admittedly weak. Being comfortably conversational, making eye contact is super important. There's no way to improve this except to practice interviewing at different places and being able to tell a story for each of the questions.
2. Try to get some experience at your current job that will allow you to write a bit of code to optimize something. Once you have that small project, focus on things like ""cost-cutting"" or ""optimizing"". You want to frame your resume with concepts that tech recruiters are familiar with. ""Built an M&amp;A model to value comparable comps in manufacturing industries"" isn't something that your average tech recruiter is familiar with.
3. Focus on clean coding in the tech interview/take home projects. For example, no method should be over 6-7 lines. If you have to think too hard about the implementation of your solution, it's probably not the ""clean"" solution that will allow you to pass the interview. This is more important than commenting every single method/line of code.

Feel free to reply in this thread with any other comment/questions you have and I'll try my best to answer how I can. During my dark times, this subreddit really provided the motivation that I had to continue applying day in and day out. This is my way of giving back to the community and I hope some of you will find this helpful."
f164r8,0,2020-02-09,Taking a 6 month travel hiatus after graduation has ruined my career and made me unemployable. Do not make the same mistake as me. What can i do?,aronowitz12345,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f164r8/taking_a_6_month_travel_hiatus_after_graduation/,"I just wanted to make this post as a warning to all new graduates considering taking a travel hiatus as well as to look for general advice on what to do.

I graduated last year (summer 2019) and decided to take a hiatus to travel and refresh my mental energy after an exhausting 4 years. I was a little bit worried about doing this because everyone was warning me to get a job ASAP but I read some posts on Reddit about people saying they had no problems finding work afterwards.

I'm in Canada (so it might be different to those of you in USA) but I graduated with a Computer Science degree from Waterloo (one of the top CS schools in the country) and a 4.0 GPA (98% average). I excelled in many courses and had the opportunity to take masters and PhD level courses during my undergrad, as well as publish a few research papers.

I have a Github full of projects including getting some of my code added to both the Linux kernel (which is a huge accomplishment) and LLVM. As well as tons of toy projects (some in the 10k+ LOC).

I did four 4-month internships at top companies (2 local companies, Google, Facebook) and had return offers lined up for me which I put on hold.

I reached out and they all told me the same thing: Either they had no spots available or that the offer has been rescinded.

I sent out exactly 1394 resumes all over my city and had a response rate of around 2%, with the majority of these responses ghosting me after an initial HR screen asking why I have been out of work for 6 months. My resume is professional written (and I include my hiatus on my resume) and just one year ago the same resume would give me a response rate of 80%+ when applying to internships.

I attended many on-site interviews and aced them, but was ghosted and in one instance told by a friendly recruiter that they were looking for someone else who was more devoted to their career (eg no gaps), despite me performing exceptionally well.

So I just want to say DO NOT LISTEN to people here saying that taking a gap is OK. We are in a hiring market. There's thousands of exceptionally qualified candidates applying for the same position... and most of them won't have a gap... It will ruin your career as it has mine.

And I also want to ask for advice? I have no idea what to do here. I'm really frustrated and feel extremely depressed and lost. What am I supposed to do?"
f1652w,1,2020-02-09,How to help my ex?,squirrel93805,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f1652w/how_to_help_my_ex/,"My boyfriend of nine months and I recently broke up for a number of reasons, but mostly because I could tell he didn’t love himself enough to properly love someone else (in this case, me). He agreed when I brought that up, and then he admitted he was feeling suicidal. I’ve felt suicidal before too, but for different reasons, so I wanted to ask if any of you can relate.

After analyzing his life, I’ve come to the conclusion that he’s afraid of the future and taking on more responsibility. He just turned 25, and he’s always has a pretty easygoing life. He never tried hard in school, he took some exchange years (one to Germany, one to South Africa), he always played sports (swimming, diving, skiing, hunting) and was into adventurous activities, he loved going out with friends and traveling around Europe (he’s from Rome, so it wasn’t too difficult), and, after high school, he took a gap year, during which he worked as a waiter in England (to learn English) and Berlin (to learn German) before university. Then, he attended a university in Northern Germany for business management. He worked pretty hard, but it’s not like he made tons of sacrifices to get good grades. His final GPA was pretty good (an A in American terms), and he did an internship in Germany for a few months. Then, he decided to move back to Italy because he missed his country, and he chose to work in Milan. Then, that’s when everything changed.

He accepted a consulting job for a small, German-based firm. Also, even though he finished all of his university exams, he still had to write his thesis. He hates writing with a passion, and the initial idea of writing the thesis made him nervous, which slowly transitioned to anxiety. Then, after months of not being able to write it efficiently, being confused on how to structure it and research the information, and not knowing how to manage his time well (because he had to write it while working long hours and traveling a lot for work), this long-term anxiety slowly transformed into depression. Now, he’s had to write this thing for a year, and he’s almost done, but he’s just so desperate and hopeless that he doesn’t see a light at the end of the tunnel. He’s also starting to regret his job because, even though he liked it at first, he’s begun to feel like that type of consulting isn’t right for him. He doesn’t like working long hours, period. He also dislikes the huge responsibility of so many large projects at once. We broke up about a week ago, but I’ve been hearing him saying “ughhh I want to die” for months now. I always thought it was a joke, but, one week ago, I asked him if he really meant it, and he admitted he did. I don’t know how to help him; I tried comparing his life to other’s lives; he doesn’t have cancer, he doesn’t have any major disabilities, and he has lots of friends and a loving family, and he lives in an amazing country. I guess another problem is that he’s always been kind of a pessimist while I’ve always been an optimist, so I can’t relate to his “realistic” point of view and relate to him. I recommended he get therapy, and he agreed, and I know he’s started eating healthier since I recommended he try self-help techniques to make him feel better. 

I guess the main problem, though, is the Peter Pan Syndrome. He enjoyed his childhood, and now he doesn’t want to grow up. Any advice on how to embrace the future with open arms?

TLDR: My ex boyfriend is feeling suicidal because he doesn’t want to live a long life of working. Any advice on how he can change his mindset or feel better?"

It was a blessing since it has allowed me to learn new tech as react and angular insyead of old php like i would have learnt in the classrom lessons. (currently focused in react) Its basically a year and a half internship which im about to finish. Company loves how i work so in a month im being hired full time, once i finish my course with an above average junior salary for spain (which is low anyway).

Now... Ill be 22yo at this point and im thinking of trying to reach the top in an 8 year timeframe... That means getting in a big tech company as a webdev like netflix/amazon/shopify/google...
Am i dreaming too much? Since i dont have a college degree and im not that young anymore.

Would the process mean simply applying to interviews until i somehow make it? Or does networking play a bigger role there?

Has anyone without a college degree succeeded to do so at my age?"

I enjoy software development but I'm slightly nervous about doing it as a full-time job rather than just working on things when I want to - my worry is that it would get boring very quickly but I don't know, it's a good opportunity to see if I'd like that sort of career or not. Both seem like great places to work.

My background before starting the degree is a sort of SysAdmin managed IT services role.

App developer role - This is at a financial company in a really nice city that I'd love to go to, the pros of this are that I'd be able to start becoming a good developer and hopefully get into the app development market once I've finished my degree. The downside is that since it's a very specific role I wouldn't get too much exposure to anything else I find interesting. 

DevOps - This is with Oracle who have a really good placement program where I would get a lot of freedom to work on extra projects that interest me where there is a lot of room for growth and I'd be able to learn a lot of skills. The main language I'd be learning here would be python which I don't really know a whole lot about and how useful it is outside a DevOps role. The actual team I would be joining here seems a lot more energetic, friendly, etc.

Thanks so much.

tl;dr - Should I do my placement in app development or DevOps?"

Hey guys, brace yourselves this might be a long post. There will be a tl;dr in the bottom, but I think all the details need to be known in order for my situation to be understood.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'll start off by saying that when I was in highschool cs was the original plan for me to pursue but after some discouragement from family I decided on mechanical engineering. I ended up going to a school that has a first year general engineering program and at the end of the year, you pick what stream you'd like to pursue. Well I fucked that one up real bad, got into drugs, and essentially flunked my first year. After some appealing I was able to get back in and then repeat first year. Now, in my second year I once again fucked it up in the first semester and failed a bunch of courses (some of which I passed in the past lol just re-enrolled to get a better grade).

It was at that point that I finally got myself clean and in counseling but these grades were never going to go away and have been pulling my GPA into the dirt. Fast forward to the end of the school year and I have to choose my stream, my GPA is shot and I end up going into materials science and engineering. Going into my third year, I decided I'm going to own this, and convinced myself that I'm here by choice, I'm going to be a materials engineer... but I never really enjoyed the content, my grades suffered, and I got relatively mediocre Cs with some Bs and a single A.

After that year, I decided I wanted to switch to computer engineering but the transfer never went through because of my aforementioned grades. So, I decided I'm going to tough it out and get this degree and be a materials engineer. I met a girl and things started looking up for me, I felt like I enjoyed the material and I actually went to classes in my fourth year (level 3 keep in mind I'm a year behind) and ended up getting straight Bs with some As.

With some massive stroke of luck (and a prof who vouched for me) I ended up getting a year long materials engineering internship at a huge aerospace &amp; defence company! I feel like I'm on top of the world and that I'm finally going to be successful and I get to the job.... and I hate it. I honestly shouldn't, whenever I tell people about my job they're always like HOLY SHIT DUDE THAT IS SO COOL. I work with other interns and they all find it super interesting, and I'm not going to lie, sometimes it is but the majority of the time, I hate the job.

I recently went to SF to meet my gfs brother and he works at a big N type company (kind of), and he gives us a tour of his crazy ass facility and all I'm thinking in my head is what the fuck did I do to my life. Anyways that brings us to where I'm at now which is, I'm currently on a year long internship at a big aerospace company but I realize that I really don't think I want to pursue Materials Engineering anymore.

I really liked coding when I was in high school, I started programming when I was in middle school (wanted to learn how to make minecraft mods lol) and at this point I really think I'm ready to pull the trigger on becoming a dev however, I don't know what to do... someone with a mediocre GPA please help me.

I originally pursued engineering because I want to solve problems with math and science and I currently feel that it just really isn't possible / something that I'm interested in doing with materials science.

If you guys have any more questions please ask, I wrote this up hastily but I'm willing to give more details.

tl;dr I have mediocre grades in an engineering degree I'm currently pursuing but not really interested in, I want to get into cs but I'm worried that I won't be able to get a formal education in it because of my past and I'm getting to be too old to still be in undergrad / school... what do"

I'm having a super hard time getting in anywhere-- entry level analyst positions, internships, or otherwise. Recently, I was turned down (quite fast!) for an analyst internship. Looking back, I think it could be because I already knew how to do what they were looking to teach? The tasks they wanted interns to do were things I've done probably since year 2 of undergrad.

The thing is, my only work experience is as a sales associate (plus one marketing internship). I've been trying to tailor my resume and cover letter to these positions as best I can. In my cover letter, I make sure to add key words from the posting, and since I've already laid out my work history in my resume, I utilize the cover letter to expound on how my extracurriculars, relevant coursework, and thesis project, have given me the skillset necessary to do the job (depending on the job; and the cover letter is less than a page long).

My friend loaned me her SQL textbook and I'm working on that, although the majority of positions I apply to don't require it. Any tips on what I can do to make myself a more viable candidate?"

I am a junior in computer science at Northwestern University who is figuring out plans for the summer of 2020. My main interests are in data science and machine learning, but most of those jobs are for masters students so I haven't been able to leverage that interest as much as I had hoped in my job search process. I have an offer from a small local company (not Big N basically) for a full-time software development internship (mostly full-stack development), but I also may have an opportunity to work on research that more closely overlaps with my data science interests (I speak with that professor on Tuesday about my options on the team). The research will mostly consist of software development on data analysis/visualization applications for the research team. My main question is, is research something companies pay as much attention to as internships, or would the software development be more useful in my future career trajectory?"

It may seem far away, but let’s be real it’ll be August in no time and I’ll be going away to college. I want to start preparing now so by August I’m not thinking of this shit last minute (which is usually what I’d do lol) 

What are some things I should bring? Should I bring my Xbox and a small TV? Is having my Xbox worth it? A mini fridge? Like what do I bring to my dorm besides the essentials (bedding, toilet paper, paper towels). What are some underrated essentials? 

What does a weekend look like for you in college? Do you party every weekend? What are the parties like? Do you hook up with girls/guys? Do you have a relationship? 

What’s your day to day like? Remember, I’m coming from living at home while attending CC, I’m at my parents home every weekend on Xbox or watching anime on Xbox. My Xbox literally has entertained me though high school and now my first 2 years of college. So this is all a huge change for me.  

How are the gyms at your college? Are the gyms 24/7? Do you work out? I work out and I want to know how it is. What’s the bathroom situation, is it awkward? Where do you change your clothes with privacy?

How do I meet people that go to my future school or will be transferring as well? Should I even worry about this or just wait until
I get there? I’m not too concerned with this because I’m busy with finishing up my last semester, work, and soon an internship. 

When do I have to find a roommate to dorm with? How’s the food (generally) at college? 

If there are any tips or advice you have, don’t hesitate to tell me. I want to hear it all. You don’t have to answer every question, hopefully this can be a guide for transfers and freshman."

I just finished my internship at a company using satellite imagery, and during my time there I created &amp; hosted a few workshops on how to use deep learning for computer vision applied to satellite imagery. They were kind enough to let me publish them publicly, so I figured this sub might be interested!

&amp;#x200B;

You can find everything [here](https://github.com/MaxLenormand/Keras-for-computer-vision).  


There are already a ton of tutorials on how to make a Keras model, so why make some more? Because most of those that I found didn't tell me where to go once I had made a simple model. Once you have something working, how do you actually *improve* a model? I found it quite complicated to build this intuition about how to improve a model's accuracy, getting a feel for what deserved some improvements and what wasn't worth it.

These notebooks are meant to help provide some answers. They're all in Colab and each model can be trained in under a minute, which IMHO is perfect for tinkering, testing stuff and seeing rapid results. They were well received in the company I interned in (these guys deploy more traditional machine learning algos, but weren't familiar with deep learning) so hopefully this might help some others here! These aren't by no mean state of the art, but rather the things that I had to think about when actually interning: my model has X% accuracy, what's worth changing to gain a significant improvement?

The 1st one is the most detailed, with a simple binary classification. The 2 following ones are for a multi-class classification; one is incomplete and meant to be used as an exercise, the following one is a basic solution to it.  


**TL;DR: some Colab notebooks with a more in-depth approach of why and how to develop a basic deep learning model in Keras from my time interning as a data scientist in remote sensing.**

&amp;#x200B;

An advertising company I used to work for is considering adding Managed IT as a service. The reason they haven’t pushed the service is because they don’t have a staff member to manage it. 


My background: I am hungry for experience, which has been very, very, veryyyy challenging to obtain. I am completing my degree in IT, Cybersecurity Concentration, in April.  After countless rejections from internships, I became very close to obtaining one, only to be turned down because the other candidates had “completed CTF competitions”. As rough as it’s been, I try to take rejection as a teacher, and thus, have applied for a cyber competition via my school. 

My question is, if you were in my position, would you go for being the first and only IT staff at a company that is brand new to offering the service? Obviously, there are pros &amp; cons here. Part of me is excited at the thought, and open to embracing the inevitable discomfort as I’d learn a lot on my own. Another part of time me is terrified: no one there physically to ask questions to, no one there to provide guidance. Equally parts excitement and tremendous anxiety. 

Appreciate your feedback!"

He wasn’t prepared for it. No one really would. Ten years in the business made him a professional, but not professional enough. Old-fashioned backstabbing was still painful.

Crawling back to his safe house in a bullet-ridden aerocar that no longer flew, he swore it would never happen again.

At least the medicine cabinet was well-stocked. The liquor shelf? Less so. For two moons, Ruso holed up in the dingy apartment in the slum. A perfect place to let his wounds heal while drowning in self-pity. A perfect time to consider early retirement from the job—one didn’t involve in his unnatural death, hopefully.

He was laying low, but it wasn't easy. Lowdwellers talked, a lot. He could not take a walk on the street without the bounty hunters from a galaxy away hearing about. He had always been an outsider, even among his own people. Not a lot of Ghrusculs became assassins. Too cumbersome. Ruso was a small runt abandoned at birth and raised by the streets. Unwelcomed at most places he used to call home.

He wanted revenge. His handler was all fake smiles and hidden clauses. He hung Ruso out to dry, calling it a “vacation” and sent another asset to do the job. It went south, and he made Ruso take the fall. The number was half a million credits for his head, the last he heard of it.

He woke up sick. The medicine cabinet was empty. He considered a venture outside for some pain injections. Then, as if on cue, the telephone rang.

He wondered if it was telemarketing, just for the sheer irony. The phone was an old fashioned landline, one that not even the trash recycler wanted. It startled him when it worked, and was shrieking at such obnoxious volume, too.

“Hey, are you open for business?” The voice sounded young and lightly accented. Some dumb kid.

“Wrong number,” Ruso was about to hang up.

“No—wait, wait!” The voice called. Ruso stayed on, because he was getting used to the headache and bored. “Check your front door. Janajati, 200mg.”

Ruso hung up. He grabbed the rail pistol from under the couch and checked the front door through the slit. No one was outside his door. He checked the only window, next to the door and in the kitchen. Nothing stood up, just the bustling stackable dirty streets. He went to open the door. The hall was empty. A small package in yellow wrapping was sitting on the ground.

He locked the door and returned. The line rang again.

Ruso picked up.

“You kill people for a living, right?” Same kid, same trick trying to sound older than his age. “My employer wants someone dead.”

“I’m not in the business,” Ruso said tensely. He turned the package over. It has a smiley face sticker from Cha’s Pharmacy on the back. “Who am I talking to?”

“People call me ‘Green’,” the caller winced. His voice wavered briefly, perhaps was the bad connection. “Yeah…Look, man, I can’t do this mysterious benefactor thing. Woll’uyen…Tash-kor? I butchered that, didn’t I? The name’s on the file, along with his pic. Dead by Thursdays, that’s…let’s see, in five days.”

Along with the injector pack was a crumbled up, hand-written note. Ruso assumed it was the file. A printed photo of an Issiosiax in a three-piece suit.

“Okay, Groo…”

“It’s ‘’Green’,” the caller corrected him. “Dumb, I know.”

“Green. So you’re my new handler? You’re human. A human working for the Ranorks?”

“What? No, no,” Green said. ""This is private interest. Half a million points’ already in your account. The other half after he makes the news. Good?”

“Who do you work for and how did you find me?”

Already, Ruso felt his resolve weakened. He couldn’t hide in this shithole forever. He had some savings from past jobs, but not enough to last. He needed this. He knew.

“My employer has their ways, I suppose,” Green was pulling away from the microphone. “Sorry, give me a sec.”

There were noises coming from Green’s side of the line. People talking. Ruso pressed the phone to his largest ear, straining to hear the conversation. Nothing much he could hear, but Green’s voice was still coming through.

“Coming, coming!” Green’s voice came from far away. “Yeah, sure, I’ll buy coffee. Latte? Two lattes half sugar, and a matcha green tea, got it.” He came back. “Sorry about that. The comm device in the package, clip it to your ear so you don’t have to lug this antique everywhere. So, we good?”

“We good.”

Retirement could wait, said every hitman ever.

\*\*\*

Thus begin a new career with this strange human handler. Russo was making good money so he didn’t complain. Actually, there was no much to complain about. The jobs were never too simple or challenging. It kept him on his feet. In three months, he had infiltrated a galactic corporation’s regional office, poisoned a tourist trying out local street food, and got rid of a drug dealer who was getting ahead of himself. Not big-time contracts, but not small either.

Green’s voice was there to guide him, as annoying as that sounded. He seemed to know Ruso’s every move, and made odd comments now and then through the comm piece. Yet he also knew when to shut up and let Ruso do the work.

Risk had gotten used to his presence. One thing was clear. Humans were scary conversationists. They could spend hours talking about nothing.

He was sitting in a dingy diner that served “American-styled” food. Green recommended this place, said their food printer was high-quality import so it was almost the real deal.

The Contact was sitting across from him. In the private space of the red plastic booth, they discussed the target.

“I heard you’re the most feared assassin in this part of the galaxy,” the man said, blowing smoke after inhaling from a pipe-like device. “Is it true?”

Ruso was not particularly interested in the man’s information. He trusted Green would find out about everything he needed.

“I wonder if an apple pie still counts as an apple.” In the earpiece, Green was on one of his usual rants.

“Sure,” Ruso said. “If you say so.”

“Be glad your boss paid me enough to talk. Here, the guard schedule,” the Contact pushed a little chip toward Ruso. “The warlord usually wine-and-dines in the hot spring area before moonfall.”

“Back on Earth, we’ve got a saying,” Green pauses for dramatic effect. “An apple a day, keep the doctors away.”

Ruso forked his slice of synthetic apple pie.

“That sounds like an expensive lifestyle,” he said, chewing on the syrupy part.

His Contact did not have the appetite, nor did he noticed the other conversation going on, parallel to his own.

“The area is open and has plenty of roofspaces nearby,” he looked anxious, with his voice lowered even though there were few other costumers nearby.

“You’re also very well paid, if I may add.

It’s ancient wisdom,” Green said. “Hey, it’s not just in Commonspeak. It rhymes in English, too. Also Chinese. A lot of humans grow up hearing this phrase.”

“Do I look like a ninja to you?” Ruso huffed.

“Ninja is Japanese, not Chinese. You really should read more about human history. Fascinating stuff.”

“Not exactly,” the Contact said, looking away to check their surroundings the tenth time since they sat down.

“We’re done here,” Ruso said, standing up. He picked up the empty plate and handed it to the cleaning bot.

“Hey there, excuse me.” On his way out, he asked the waitress. “Do you know of a fresh produce market nearby?”

“Yes!” Green yelled, victorious, a little too loud in his ear. His voice synced with the waitress nodding. “I know I can convert you. You will see the benefit of the Earthling way!”

Ruso cleared his throat. He did not grin. He knew the area like the back of his hand.

\*\*\*

Ruso would never become a stealth guy, not in a million years. His approach to disposing of the target was straight forward. He first takes out the waiter on a smoke break. He could not disguise as him—the uniform was too small—so he took the key card. He climbed through the outer wall of the hot spring resort, walked across to the other end of the private property, and entered the building through the roof access door.

The guards were simple. Their footsteps sounded like thunders, thanks to his great hearing. So they were easy to avoid. Since getting Green as his handler, Ruso no longer had to worry about the surveillance cameras. The human took care of them on his end.

Once inside, he took an elevator to the ground floor. The halls were empty, except for expensive vases and revolutionary-styled paintings.

He noticed the Ranork family emblem. Instantly recognizable, too. He did not comment on it. He was always silent during missions.

He strode toward the outdoor spring. This pool of pinkish water was a rare luxury in the entire Ishtri system. Someone like Tezux Ranork who dealt in shady businesses could surely afford it. Ruso knew him well.

Revenge was right under his nose, so Ruso admitted he might have gone overboard. Shot all the guards and then seven bullets into Ranork’s head. By the end, there wasn’t much left to shoot at.

“Woah,” Green spoke in the comm, for the first time since Ruso entered the resort. “Let’s not meet in real life. Now get the hell out of there.”

Later that night, near the morning, Ruso ate his apple pie at a different dinner. It tasted different, though he could not tell which was more authentic.

Green ranted away in the earpiece.

“…not that it wasn’t a mission accomplished. I’m glad Target’s done, and all, but—it’s supposed to look like an accidental drowning!” Green paused to catch a breath. “Now look at all the paperwork I have to do. How am I gonna explain now? Target shot all his guards while naked in the pool and then accidentally drowned?”

“Those gills-men drowning? You are bad at jokes,” Ruso grunted. “I’m sure you can make it work.”

“Fine, fine.” The keyboard cluttered away on Green’s end. “Ugh, my boss is gonna kill me.”

“You sent me to kill my former handler. Anything you want to clue me in?”

“My employer wants him dead. I'm just the middleman…” Green hushed his voice. “A middleman who can pick which asset does the job, and I thought…you might appreciate this.”

Appreciate killing the man who stabbed him in the back? Ruso certainly did.

“Thank you,” Ruso said. He had been considered saying this all night. It seemed like the perfect opportunity. “There is something I need to ask you, face to face.

“What? Why? This channel is totally secure, you can ask anything here.”

“If you say so,” Ruso paused briefly. “Who am I working for? Who is your employer?”

“Look,” Green exhaled noisily. ""I’m just the intern here. It’s a giant organization. One beyond the imagination of either of us. We are cogs, so let’s do what cogs do best.”

“Work, get paid, and shut up about it?”

“Exactly,” Green said. ""Simple.""

So it was. Ruso was a simple man. The first time he was betrayed by his handler was also his last.

*This one is not so bad.*"

I've been scouring this reddit for grad school tips and have found a lot, I appreciate it! I have some reservations about my app though and would love to get the group's take on how I can better myself by the end of the year.

Summary of me:

* Did wet lab research in high school on hypoxia in cancer cells
* Did a 2-3 month internship at UCSF doing bioinformatics for a postdoc for his cadiomyopathy epigenetics data; this was after sophomore year college, I didn't know a lot and kind of sucked, and did not end on good terms with the postdoc I think?
* Triple major in molecular biology (genetics emphasis), computer science, and statistics @ Berkeley
* Graduated 2016, GPA 3.19
* Software engineer at Google for 3 years
* Software engineer at a biotech company now, doing opioid addiction recovery related work
* Taking Pharmacology and Biochemistry courses from Harvard Medical School online

My concerns:

* Low GPA
* Lack of real research
* No academic letters of rec

Thanks for any advice you all may have!

Edit: I am looking at schools in the US, specifically so far Berkeley, UCSF, Stanford, Harvard, MIT I think, + other schools where I find professors whose research I am interested in (not sure yet, still looking for now) \[also edited for format\]"

I'm currently an ECE freshman looking for things to do over the summer!

I've been looking for internships and or research opportunities (as I'm heavily considering doing grad school in the future, then again im still a freshman and plans change quite often...)

I haven't had much luck with internships as I don't have a lot of coding experience or personal projects (although I can program a little bit here and there) and I won't be taking relevant courses like Algorithms and SWE until next semester.

I've been trying to look for research instead as I have 2 summer's experience of research (although in a biological/wet lab setting), and I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to approach ECE/Math professors since the only ECE professor I've had so far is Patt, and well, he's made it pretty clear on his website that he doesn't take undergrads XD. I am currently taking Discrete/Embedded Systems and was thinking maybe I could talk to them or approach other professors in the field!

Any advice on who's best to contact or how to approach professors (are there any professors who are lenient on taking undergrads, etc.) :)?

Thank you!"
f1ifnt,550,2020-02-09,From being PIP'd at a startup to leveling up into a FANG in four months.,worried_about_pip,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f1ifnt/from_being_pipd_at_a_startup_to_leveling_up_into/,"When my manager sat me down in our 1:1 to deliver me the news that I was about to be put on a PIP the next week and to use the weekend to think what my next step should be, my initial reaction was to want to take it and save my job. I knew I've been in a bit of a slump, sleeping very poorly, and not outputting as much as I could have. But to be quite honest, this was a blessing in disguise.

The company I've been working at wasn't doing that well to begin with. We raised a series D in just under two years of existence and my options have quintupled in value since joining, but we've had regulational troubles and the hardware team has been slipping. Our CTO was fired four months after I joined, and our new CTO promised to double our engineering headcount by the end of last year. We've maybe only added 5 people to a team of 30 instead by that point. To that end, I've had multiple manager changes within that time period: a total of five managers and six manager changes all within 12 months. As this was my first job out of college, I thought this was all normal for a startup.

In addition, the pay was very low. For a new grad that didn't know better, like yours truly, that number was a lot for someone who was only ever paid hourly. But after discussing with friends that went onto working at FANGs and other, more established unicorn startups, it was abundantly clear that me and my fellow colleagues were severely underpaid. Like, over 50% lower in base salary alone underpaid for the same line of work and more stress.

The work itself wasn't that great either. It was a system that had to be supported globally with different rules in different countries and with physical hardware that we had little control over. Nobody left the office before dinner was served, and seldom did people start going home after dinner was finished (well, up until recently since people stopped giving fucks). We had almost no senior engineers either, most of the work was done by fresh grads or interns from top CS schools. We maybe had only four veteran IC's, but the rest of the ""senior"" staff were in management. Everyone else was a new grad or junior engineer. You wouldn't find anyone that had more than two years of experience in the rest of the crowd. It's fun to be around people my age, but the work was sloppy and stressful when shit broke because you're trying to build something with little guidance and your code reviewers are other new grads that are equally as experienced as yourself. Nobody (besides maybe three people) has ever coded in the framework we used, and everyone learned the language and framework right on the job. Our only training was a link to an official guide.

I'm not going to get into the company politics, but it's sufficient to say our Blind was so spicy to the point screenshots of several call-out threads were brought up in meetings and mentioned in all-hands. It was pretty bad.

But going back to me getting served a PIP. My manager gave me an ultimatum: either take the PIP, or take severance and interview for another company. Over that weekend, I thought really hard about all the things I've seen and done in the past year, and quite frankly, I found that I haven't been happy at that place for a while now. It doesn't make sense to try to save a job I wasn't going to be happy at, where I get paid peanuts, and where my contributions are invisible to upper management because the longest I've had the same manager for was two and a half months. I decided to take the severance and leave.

This gave me time to relax, exercise, enjoy hobbies I haven't done in months, and most importantly, spend time with family and friends I haven't been around with because of this job. Oh, I forgot to mention that the company moved headquarters halfway through my tenure and bumped my commute from 20 minutes to over an hour.

I haven't touched leetcode or interview prep materials in ages since joining, so I really only hit the books about two weeks after leaving. My daily routine would be to exercise in the day, eat a protein heavy meal, and study up leetcode into the night at a 24/7 cafe. I would usually do this with a buddy or two who are freelance developers. I also kept a spreadsheet of jobs I was interested in and updated their statuses in where I was at in the process, who the point of contact was, when the interview dates are, etc. I wanted to end up at a FANG company since their offices were much closer to where I lived and the culture there would help me grow more as an engineer. My process was that I started off with companies I didn't quite care about to practice interviewing, and then build up to places I did want to end up working at.

I slowly but steadily practiced coding problems, took my time to understand what the solutions were, and apply those skills onto other problems that came up. In reality, most programming problems you encounter are really just other problems in disguise, and you just need to know the fundamentals of CS to get through them. I'm sure everyone wants to know what my stats are, so here they are: 64 easy, 50 medium, 15 hard.

After a few months of practice and interviewing at companies I wasn't particularly interested in, I started applying for places that actually interested me. In the end, I got two offers and was able to negotiate with a FANG company that has an office 10 minutes away from my house. I not only nearly tripled my TC, but I also got leveled up to an L4. After being stuck in L3 for almost two years with shit pay, I am glad my patience and steady progress paid off.

My lessons learned in this whole experience:

- It's nice to have coworkers to hang out with that are your age, but it's not good for your growth if you don't have senior engineers or good managers that you can learn from and ask questions.
- Companies that say they're struggling to hire good engineers usually mean they're underpaying their engineers and end up hiring new grads with little experience who don't know any better.
- You need to have a consistent manager that will actually give a shit about your growth.
- When looking for a new job, don't settle for something just because it pays slightly better than what you previously had. Why knowingly put yourself in a situation you don't want to be a part of?
- Be patient with the job search. New things come all the time, and set up alerts on LinkedIn for jobs in your area. Again, don't settle for something you'll regret taking.
- Commute time matters. Sure, I can listen to podcasts on a train for an hour or sleep on it, but I'd rather use that time to get an extra hour of uninterrupted sleep in my own bed and be more energetic and productive for the whole day. Not to mention gain more time in the afternoon and evening to do activities with friends and family.
- Know your worth. levels.fyi is a great resource to see what you should be aiming for in pay.
- Blind and this subreddit will make you feel inadequate. Don't take it to heart and always focus on your own progress. But at least know what you should be aiming for and what others have experienced in interviews and in their own companies.
- Leetcode's interview experiences forum is a hidden gem (in my opinion) and is a great place to learn what processes are like at various companies and how people react to their own interviews.

As for my tips for the interview prep:

- Start with LC easy problems. I'm talking about two sum and fizzbuzz easy levels. These problems you should know how to solve blindfolded. Do a bunch of them, and do a couple new ones each day to warm up.
- LC medium problems are the most common I've encountered in interviews. Some can be hard, and some are stupidly easy. For the harder ones, don't be discouraged if you can't solve it right off the bat. Spend maybe at most 10 minutes thinking about it, and if you're still completely lost on how to solve it, there's no shame in looking at the ""discuss"" tab and seeing how others have solved it. Read the code line by line, understand what each piece is doing, implement the solution yourself, and move on to similar problems. With practice, you'll learn the patterns and tricks in these problems, and maybe you'll learn a few new syntactical party tricks in your language of choice.
- LC hard problems will come up, but not often. YMMV. You should practice them at least solving one hard problem per week, if not more. I've had N Queens asked on a phone screen, so you never know what will come up in interviews.
- There's a curated list of 75 problems you should solve that's been circling around here and on Blind. It's a good starting point.
- Common topics you'll encounter: linked lists, binary trees, binary search trees, DFS, BFS, heaps, stacks, queues, strings, arrays.
- I was recommended to use Interview Cake. While I didn't use it daily, it is a good resource in my opinion and the step by step solutions do help with guiding your thought process.

Most of my system design solutions came from experiences I've had and a lot were creative, open-ended questions. My advice is to be likeable to the interviewer and not BS your thought process. For some reason, system design is something that comes the most natural to me, so I sadly can't give much tips for studying on it besides seeing for yourself how current systems are built.

And in general, you should be likeable to the interviewer. Smile, ask them what they work on, what cool projects they've done at the company, what their work life balance is like, etc. You're interviewing for the company and you're interviewing the company for yourself. Your interviewer is judging on whether you'd be a good person to be around with for 8 hours and help contribute to solving their problems, and you're judging whether the company you're interviewing for will make you enjoy yourself being there.

Everyone's experience is unique and certainly not as relaxed as mine. I thankfully had enough savings to last me almost a whole year without a job, but I realize others might not be fortunate enough to have that luxury. It'll be hard, but worth it to study up in the evenings and then take days off to go to onsites. In the end, what matters most is your sanity and happiness.

Tl;dr: job sucked, I got PIP'd, quit, took time off, studied, interviewed, and accepted a FANG offer that tripled my pay in four months."

Considering the fact that this is a _career_ sub, I thought maybe some of you could help me out and lend me some general advice.

**About me**: I'm about to enter my 6th and **last semester** of my **Business Informatics Bachelor at Technical University Vienna** and am planning on continuing with a Master at ETH Zürich. My grades put me within the top 5% of my classes. My Austrian **GPA is 1,2** which should be like a 3,8 on the usual GPA scale afaik (Austrian grades range from 1 (best) to 5 (worst)). I have also been **working part-time** at a small company for a year now, doing some VBA/MySQL as well as SAP work. I can definitely feel some type of imposter syndrome sometimes, but considering that I had no prior knowledge about IT before beginning my studies, I think I'm doing very well considering my grades and the fact that I am able to work besides that (RIP sleep and social life though lol).

I am just gonna throw out a few questions that come to my mind, feel free to join in on my brainstorming! Would appreciate some help and just guidance in general about my future choices. 

**ETH/Studies specific**:

* Any experiences concerning **acceptance rates at ETH** for CS? I graduated top of my class at High School, have excellent grades and have started working early on, but reading about people with research experience getting declined I am not sure what to think of my chances.

* I have read a few times that getting a **CS Master with a focus on DS is recommended as opposed to a DS Master**. Does this still hold true? Adding onto this point, I am not sure which direction I would prefer. I'm very good at Maths, but feel like my programming best practices and experience in general may be a little behind compared to people who have been programming since they were very young. At ETH there's a general CS Master where you can pretty much pick any courses you like which sounds pretty intruging and would allow me to specialize in DS and ML.

* Will a **degree from ETH make a big difference in pay** compared to just finishing my Masters here in Vienna?

* **Any other universities** you would recommend as alternatives to ETH? ETH has the benefit of being very cheap (700€ per semester) which is why it's so attractive to me and also offers the possibility to join the Swiss work market. Unfortunately it does not have a campus, so I feel like I might be missing out a little compared to English/American Universities. TU München seemed pretty interesting as well, but I am not sure if that'd be worth it considering that it's probably very similar to TU Vienna. Feel free to correct me. Also I have no idea how scholarships work in America/England/etc so I am not even sure if it'd be viable for me to attend other universities considering that I get my Master here for free.

Work specific:

* I think I am somebody who's good with people/human interactions and I don't think that I wanna spend my whole life programming, which is why I wouldn't mind going down a more management oriented route. I am not sure what the current census is, but I have picked up a few times that if you want to become a good manager you should know the technology behind it. Would you recommend **focusing on becoming a good SWE first or start out immediately in a management role**?

* How high are my chances of ****finding a this years summer Internship at FAANG or similar applying this late? I currently get paid pretty well and the company is great, but I'm afraid that my learning might be limited as the company only has around 15 employees and thus I am mostly on my own without any real feedback. The Tech stack is also not something I see myself doing long term as I do not want to do SAP consulting indefinitely. I would like to join a bigger company and also would not mind going to another country. 

Also if anybody is currently studying at ETH, I would really appreciate any further information.

Thanks a lot!"

I'm a current undergraduate student that will be graduating in Fall 2020.

I only have American citizenship, but I am told that people in my field are very, very in demand. Additionally, I have research experience and am putting together a portfolio of projects now and will hopefully have an internship this summer.

Is it realistic to try to obtain a work visa? I understand it would be very difficult to obtain one since companies may not be really interested in sponsoring new-grads, but maybe it's worth a shot since my field is in demand?

I'd consider grad school, too, but I think I'm trying to take a break from school and just work/vibe for a year or so, figure out some personal stuff. Though I'll probably apply just to keep all my options open."

f1nfxu,0,2020-02-10,Top tier but in different state vs Mid tier close to home,ihav2pee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f1nfxu/top_tier_but_in_different_state_vs_mid_tier_close/,"I'm going through a bit of a crisis right now lol

I got a job offer from, what I'll call top tier in my eyes, but in a different state from where I am.

Right now, however, I am an intern at what I'll call a mid tier company, and they are set to offer me a full time position once I graduate this coming June. The salary is not set yet, but from other interns who got offers, the base salary I'll get is probably 20-30k less than the top tier offer I got. 

If I move to another state, I'll have to pay rent, make new friends, and adjust to a new environment in general. But, in turn, I'll be working at a ""top tier"" company, getting at a minimum 30k more than the ""mid tier"" job, and have the prestige on my resume. 

On the other hand, if I stay where I am, I can commute from home, I already have a set group of people I can call friends, I have a good relationship with my manager and teammates, and I enjoy the environment. But, it's ""mid tier"" and does not have the same flare on my resume as the ""top tier"" would. I also feel afraid that I may not be able to grow as much at my current company -- I have this feeling that working at a top tier company will give me more growth and experience. 

What do you guys think? It's hard for me to let go of my current situation -- where I love my job, friends, and home. But, I'd be throwing away the opportunity to work at a more ""prestigious"" job and make more money. 

What do you guys think I should do?"

Am I earning enough...,SkarZinSki,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f1niv3/am_i_learning_enough_am_i_earning_enough/,"TLDR: Web app development job, suddenly turns into a one-person IT department with extra duties for shitty pay. I don't know if I should look for, or am skilled enough for a new job.

Greetings everyone.

So I'm in a predicament where I am getting paranoid. Am I learning enough, and am I earning enough? Not sure if it's imposter syndrome but more on that later. 

I'm currently doing an internship thing. I say ""thing"" because it's not really an internship... A year ago I started working for an owner of a supermarket (further referred to as 'my boss') that wants a website for his business. Me, fresh out of uni with a shiny new degree was like ""Heck yea! Sure!"" I go for the interview and the money is not great but I figure sure, it's like an internship and he said we can review my salary after a year. The plus side for me, at the time, was that my boss is an experienced developer, knowing a lot about programming, and said that he would be happy to mentor me and teach me what he knows. I was like ""Awesome!"".

But now, coming in at over a year working for him a few things happened. Because he is a self-taught programmer he doesn't know how to do documentation or a requirement analysis of what he actually wants on his website. He is only like: ""OK, the website should do x and y"" and then a few days later it should do z aswell. There is never a fixed requirements list, just a list of all the website idea's he wants me to build.

In uni, I learned Java, C++, Javascript, and some Python. Most of those languages I learned on my own because programming fascinates me and I'm really passionate about it. So when I started working for my boss he said he wants us to use Angular 2+ and Firebase Firestore as the database for his websites. Which is fine,  ""I'll learn Typescript too"". He is also always saying that he wants me to learn the latest technologies. But when I do, he asks what I'm doing and why am I doing it and that I should just use Angular: ""It's easier"". The same thing with Firebase. I suggested a few times we should rather use MySQL or MongoDB and then he just laughs at me and says I'm just going to waste time (*And I'm just trying to save you money*). Then when still busy working on his store's website he gets new ideas of other websites I should develop and then says that one needs to be done before x date. Then x date comes and he's just like: ""That's cool, how far are we with the store's website?"". There is no structure of what is happening or what is supposed to be happening. When I start to get a structure of my own he starts to get uncomfortable and shuts it down and spins a crazy story about how a business should work. In my opinion, I think he gets scared he won't be able to control it, or in fear that I'll start my own business or something.

In this time working for him, I also needed to start doing IT Support for him and his business. Not by the job description of course, just because the internet went down once and I'm the only computer savvy person that can fix it. So now I'm stuck fixing the point of sale systems as well, along with any other IT related issue the store might have, even sometimes fixing the money lights. Then he reveals to me he has a CNC milling machine, and if I'm interested in learning how to use it. Curious me, because I love electronics (such as Arduino), I learn how to use the damn thing and at first, it was just a *do it in your free time* thing, but now I need to do milling jobs aswell. Meanwhile, I want to be a programmer/software engineer. I don't mind the CNC milling part, it's just he starts to expect I need to build his website, do IT support, do the CNC milling, and Marketing of his website such as the SEO stuff. All the while I'm getting paid $500 (R6000) a month (Note: I live in South Africa, so the living cost is lower) but it's still lower than the norm I should be getting. Sometimes he just walks in and says that I should do some other random thing. He's most of the time not mean or rude to me and says he sees me as his child (Work slave child to me though), but has a way to make me feel unwanted sometimes.

Now he also said that after a year we can look at my salary again, and now that it's been over a year he tells me when the websites I made, start making money then we can look into giving me a raise, and when I ask him again about it he says he wants to start a new business in Cyprus, and that I'll get paid in euros, but at this stage, I think his Cyprus idea will never see the light of day because he never mentions it anymore. The other day he said that I also need to remember that there is no pressure here and that I'm still learning and thus, no raise again. I also had to hear that his brother, which is his partner in the business, is asking questions about why he is keeping me, so to justify it he said he uses me for IT support. Now, suddenly, IT support is my main priority and any programming or development comes second.

At the start, I was learning a lot because it's my first real job as a programmer, but now with all the additional stuff it's starting to drain me and it makes my ability to program slow, and boring. I'm getting depressed because programming for me was always fun but it's not really anymore and I don't want to lose my passion for it (and hoping I didn't already lose it)...

Now the reason I say I don't know if it's imposter syndrome, is that I'm not sure if I am skilled enough to start looking for a new better paying job?  My portfolio is full of his half-finished projects, (luckily his store website is kinda done) and all of them are Angular2+ apps using firebase as a database. Or should I just look for a new intern job that is actually in the line of work I want to be? I might have learned a lot but now it feels that I'm not learning enough to be a viable candidate for a new job? Am I wasting my time? Or will his web app idea's become mainstream and I'll become rich or is this just one of those '*promise me the world'* bullshit. 

Sorry for my wall of text. I just needed to let my heart out and I don't know what to do anymore."
f1nuro,23,2020-02-10,Getting into bioinformatics with no bio experience?,momentropist,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/f1nuro/getting_into_bioinformatics_with_no_bio_experience/,"Looking through some of these posts, I have an unusual background. I have no lab experience, in chemistry or biology, and haven't taken a chem class since high school. Recently however, I have been educating myself about neuroscience, nutrition science, and genetics, and ideally I'd like to transition into a place where I get to work adjacent to these fields. I'm a senior computer science student with several internships under my belt and a good background in statistics/data science and likely have just this semester to bulk up on any knowledge/experience after which I won't have the resources of a research university.

How should I proceed? 

* I have room for one foundational chemistry/biology class but where should I go from there? If I had a choice should I take a course in genetics, general/cell biology, or chemistry? Should I take community college classes to cover the rest or is it even possible to self study? I don't have interest in doing wet lab work long term but am open to trying anything that works.
* I don't think grad school is an option because while my GPA is decent and doing well on the GRE is certainly doable, I am only beginning research now (not directly in computational biology), don't think I could enough faculty recommendations, and again don't have the course background.
* I am open to any way I can lean on my technical background and build out some basic competency in the field. What are good labs, summer programs, or entry level positions that are suitable for someone in my position? Project ideas and exercises I could use to build my resume?'

This question applies to biostatistics or related work in pharma/biotech or other biomedical fields as well -- just want to know what my options are. Thanks!"

now i am stressed. it pains me to realize that despite the hard work i put in, that one semester dragged my entire cumulative down. when ppl around me talk about gpa and internship, i feel extremely insecure and stressed. i realize that i will only be able to pull my gpa to around 3.3 by the time i graduate, assuming i do well. i feel like my biggest downfall in job search and recruiting is my gpa. what should i do, does anyone have a nice word of advice? .... really on the verge of paranoia and anxiety..."
f1q15i,6,2020-02-10,School/Work Dilemma,nickijs,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f1q15i/schoolwork_dilemma/,"Warning, this is a long post. My first time leaving the shadows of anonymous Reddit and making a post. I’m torn on what to do when it comes to school vs. work-life balance and want to hear from people who may have/be in my situation.

I’m 19, about to be 20 and live in America. I go to school full-time (4 classes, two in-person and two online) and already have my associates degree. I am pursing a bachelors in Business Administration/Accounting. I have no idea what I want to do with my life, leaning towards a CPA. I attend a community college and have scholarships to cover my tuition and books, still live at home with my parents. 

I work 40 hours a week (Mon-Fri) plus a 1 hour commute each way. Currently in the Real Estate field for a large corporation and make consistent income, about double the hourly rate than people my age. The work is monotonous and stressful. I got the job by knowing someone. I also have my Real Estate sales license, which I practiced for about a year before accepting I was not a salesman and thus moving onto my current role.

With all of this said, I love school and have come to hate my job. It’s nice to have the money to save/invest and to gain some experience on my resume, however I can’t see myself doing this all my life. I’m afraid that I’m giving up my college experience and the time needed to focus on my studies just to work at some place that sucks. I often rush through my coursework at the last minute because I don’t have time during the week to get it done and don’t feel like I am getting much value out of school. 

My family and friends think I’m a rockstar, it’s a hard facade to keep up and I’m truly exhausted. I’m actually miserable at this point. They seem to think I can do both but I really don’t think I can give my all to both. I don’t want to give up a job that makes great money but I also know that I need my education to become sustainable in the future. 

So far my idea has been to look at part time opportunities and internships at a different organization that would be more flexible for school and allow more study time. It all comes down to not knowing. I really don’t know what I should be doing right now. 

TIA, I appreciate any feedback and advice."

f1qahj,156,2020-02-10,Review of Investment Banking Recruiting at Cornell Johnson,LifeInDefault,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/f1qahj/review_of_investment_banking_recruiting_at/,"First, let me state the overall numbers upfront to put my commentary in context. This recruiting cycle (’19–’20) we are going to place 60 people into IB internships out of about 70 who were all-in on the IB track.

**Opportunities Available:**

The IB opportunities available at Johnson are second to none in terms of the banks that recruit here. Essentially every top firm runs a **structured** recruiting process. In no particular order: JP, GS, MS, BAML, Citi, Barclays, DB, CS, UBS, RBC, Wells, Evercore, Lazard, Moelis, Greenhill, Guggenheim, Jefferies, Houlihan Lokey, William Blair, Cain, BMO, MTS, and Piper all run structured recruitment programs at Johnson. There are also some programs that do not have structured recruiting processes but are still doable. For example, this year we placed at PWP, TD, and there were several folks in the process at FT Partners. The only notable places we do not place are CV and PJT. I have not done any investigation into these two firms but I would be curious to hear if other schools get offers there. To be transparent, a few of these banks (GS comes to mind) may make a cut from 70 to 30 after only one meeting or based on resume, however these firms still gave offers to Johnson students this year and last. I have heard GS is similarly Machiavellian at other schools. Cornell Johnson undeniably places into the strongest groups at nearly all the top banks in the world.

**The Process Itself:**

The process can be largely broken up into two phases: Phase I includes on-campus interviews, briefings held by the banks, and on-campus networking. Phase II includes weekly travel to NYC for informationals and interviews. Phase I kicks off in the first few weeks of the first semester and lasts until mid-October. Phase II lasts until mid-October and lasts until winter break. During phase II, most candidates take the bus down to NYC on Wednesday night and spend Thursday and Friday meeting with the banks before coming back to Ithaca on Friday night (Thursday classes are recorded). Again, both phases are highly structured. There are explicit instructions on where you need to be, what technicals you should be prepared to be asked, what emails to send, who to send them to, and even what specific time to send the emails. Each week, you may be cut from certain bank’s processes depending on your performance the previous week. Performance could entail a tech-screen, behavioral interviews with alumni, informationals, and all the other soft-skill interrogation that is par-for-the-course during IB recruiting from any MBA program.

If the above sounds exhausting to you, you would be correct. Cuts can feel like a kick in the throat and doing ten to thirty informationals a week takes an enormous amount of mental fortitude. Prior to business school, I worked in strategy consulting and then in risk for a bulge. I have experience working extremely long hours in error-intolerant environments. I would put recruiting IB on par with the most onerous weeks of my career in terms of exertion and stress. I realize talking about exhaustion from the privileged position of recruiting investment banking from an Ivy League MBA program sounds a little ridiculous, but candidates seriously should not underestimate the workload.

A large reason the process is so exhausting is the extremely high standards Cornell Johnson alumni have for their candidates. You are expected to be technically strong on an accelerated timeline. My friends from Wharton and NYU are blown away by our schedule. Each week, Johnson candidates are given a set of technicals to be proficient in. One half of the set is from the 400 IB technical guide, and the other half is from a Cornell specific IB technicals guide. This is on top of behavioral questions that are typical of round 1 interviews at banks. Each week, alumni are aware of where we are in the guides and those questions are all fair game to be asked in our informationals. Week one may feature less sophisticated questions (but no layups), like “walk me through how the redemption of a gift card affects the three financial statements.” Week five you may find you talking through how to construct a statement of cash flows from the balance sheet and income statement. Alumni want to know that you are a grinder who is studying every week.

**Evaluating the Process:**

The process is brutal, but our 85% placement shows that it’s worth it. Yes, the structure can be suffocating, but that same structure gives career switchers a clear path to follow. Yes, the technical schedule is demanding, but that schedule gives folks without valuation or accounting experience the chance to show how quickly they can learn. Yes, the travel schedule is exhausting, but the marathon creates a shared bonding experience with alumni. Those same alumni stick their necks out to create more seats for Johnson every single year. The results speak for themselves and the sum totality of the recruiting process is one that gives true career switchers the chance to recruit and receive offers from the strongest banks in the world. Anecdotally, I have a friend (a normal guy) who went to a higher ranked finance focused business school and ended up in audit at a bulge. Peruse the threads on /r/MBA or WSO for evidence of how commonplace M7 strikeouts in IB were this year. I cannot definitively state that our placement rate is higher or lower than comparison schools because those schools do not provide granular data but it would be surprising to me if Johnson’s placement was not on-par or higher. I did a lot of research on IB recruiting during my MBA application process and my informationals with alums from other school suggest Johnson far outpunches its weight class in IB placement.

**Competition:**

This is going to sound ridiculous but bear with me: **I did not feel competition with classmates while recruiting IB at Johnson.** I am not naive; I understand that at some level IB offers are a zero-sum game. However, at Johnson, the sheer totality of structured opportunities changes the thought process from “PrestigiousBank1 has X offers this year so I am competing with my classmates for those offers” to “There are going to be at least 12 offers from one of PrestigiousBank1, PretigiousBank2, or PrestigiousBank3 where I am in the running and if I stay on my game I can get one of them.” That attitude is emphasized by the finance club and behavior which prioritizes yourself above classmates (such as backdooring processes or telling multiple banks they are your number 1 choice) is explicitly discouraged by Johnson alumni at the banks. Your classmates are your support system and alumni expect you to go through the gauntlet together. This attitude creates strong connections amongst the class which translates to a strong Wall Street network. Alumni emphasized this point repeatedly in informationals.

**Negatives:**

Some people would consider the structure a negative if they are supreme networkers who perform best in entrepreneurial environments. That person is not me so I can’t really speak to it. I think the largest idiosyncratic “downside” to Johnson is that the structure and close alumni network make it neigh- impossible to hoard offers. Alumni will know through their friends where you are tracking so nobody is able to sit on 5-6 offers. 95% of candidates will only have 1-2 offers at the end of the day. Frankly, I don’t consider this a downside. By limiting hoarding offers, we maximize our placement across the street.

The other downside worth mentioning is difficult to evaluate. As of this date there are a few strong candidates without offers. Still, there should be at least two more offers coming through the pipeline. From talking with friends at other business schools, this was a down year for IB recruiting but apparently there are deserving folks who strike out every single year from every single school. I don’t believe the few deserving candidates we currently have without offers are inevitable, but I also can’t identify a specific weakness in the process that led to their outcomes.

**Overall:**

Anybody who wants to recruit IB out of their MBA program should send an app to Cornell Johnson. Although I don’t have granular data from other schools to parse, my multiple interviews with alumni from other schools and my experience going through recruiting leads me to conclude Johnson far outpunches its weight class in terms of MBA rankings vs Wall Street placement. It is an ideal safety for someone targeting CBS or Wharton, and if you can wrangle money out of Johnson vs going to some of the other strong finance programs at full sticker price, I think Johnson could be a no-brainer. If you are a career switcher who just wants to get into IB, Johnson will give you the opportunity to recruit across every name brand BB and EB on Wall Street. And if you are a finance stud who wants to work for the best groups at the most prestigious banks in the world, Johnson will let you control your own destiny.

**Final Note:**

I wrote this because it is the type of resource that I would have liked to have as I was applying to MBA programs. At Johnson, there are people that recruited better than me and people that had a harder time than me. This perspective is just a single data point. Thanks for reading."

He has two cats and a dog, I have three cats, a chinchilla, and a turtle. I just graduated college by paying for school out of pocket. My father had a stroke last year that impacted him physically. He's also been an at-least-a-pack-a-day smoker and a 30 rack every other day drink let for years. I know he is an alcoholic. He's been to rehab at least twice that I know of. He's gotten several DUIs in my lifetime but drinks and drives daily. I had a falling out with all of my family last year for various reasons, but they all came down to they did not support my choice to have a relationship with my father.

The past few months have taken a toll on my relationship with my father. I've had to physically pull him off of his dog when he's drunk and threatening to kill her. The dog was not hurt and my father apologized to my guest who heard it, but never to me even though I asked for an apology. Lately, he's been leaving his dog outside in the snow because she didn't do what he wanted her to do. The dog is terrified of him and listens to me just fine. While he's been drunk, he's also said some choice things to me. Including calling me a c*nt, telling me to f*ck off too many times to count, and making comments about not making any money off of me.

Yesterday, I went to talk to him about flipping ou the night prior and leaving his dog in the snow. He grabbed car keys and attempted to leave the house rather than have a conversation. He had just made food so he was not planning on leaving. I told him I would call the cops if he drove off. He has open containers in the truck he drives and does not have a valid license. He left so I called the cops. He came back and locked me out of the house, away from my animals. He baracaded himself in his living room by screwing doors shut. He slammed my foot into a doorway, crushing my foot. I was lucky enough to be wearing my duck boots so my foot is just really swollen and bruised, not broken. He then grabbed me and pushed me into the banister. 

Cops came. I couldn't press charges for him hurting me. They told me that I could get ticketed/sued for his driving because the truck is all in my name. They told me to surrender the truck back to the dealer. I have my own car and payments to deal with. 

So here is my predicament. I was offered a once in a lifetime internship I am supposed to start at the end of this month about 2000 miles away from home. It's a very competitive program and should guarentee me a job in my field at the end. It's three months long and my dad was going to watch my animals. I've given my job my notice and I had everything worked out. Ans now I don't. I know I need to get away from my father so I need to move my stuff out. I did have someone offer to take my animals and I'm looking into rehoming the dog, which breaks my heart. I just don't know of I should even still do the internship. I would come back with no place to live, not a lot or money, but I do have several part time jobs lined up to start working immediately. My friend reminded me that I wouldn't get my animals back until I could save up enough for my own place. So I'd be without them for about 5-6 months. 

TL;DR
my father is an abusive drunk I need to get away from. Should I take an internship thousands of miles away and come back to nothing or find a secure place for me and my animals and forfeit the internship?

Should I still do the internship? Or just focus on getting me and my animals somewhere safe and on our own?

Thank you for reading."

f1s2ry,2,2020-02-10,"I'm a student who received job offers for two different positions in one company, one in my field of study, the other one not. I'm afraid I won't perform well if I accept the former and that I will get fired. Which one should I accept?",chinga028,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f1s2ry/im_a_student_who_received_job_offers_for_two/,"First some background on my current situation:

I started working in a big corporation (Siemens Gamesa) as a student worker in November. I got fired from my position after 3 months of work with my manager saying I wasn't a good match for the job role, but that she would write me a recommendation letter and that I performed well. The timing of me being fired coincided with the department publishing the report for the fiscal year, so I'm suspecting that they only hired me to help them with that, and that I wouldn't be of much use to them after that.

I'm studying Software engineering and the job I was doing was working with key performance indicators and creating visuals and reports in Power BI.

My manager told me I will stay in their system for about a month and that I should try contacting hiring managers instead of applying for the positions online, and that's what I did.

I managed to land an interview within 3 days, in a different department but for a very similiar position, just more focused on doing the reporting in Excel, and got an offer for that position the day after the interview. I immediately accepted the offer, but I had to persuade the manager a bit that I won't leave the position after a month or two for a better job, because he thought I was overqualified for the position.

After I accepted the offer I was invited for an interview for another position that I applied for, the position being development in C# and databases, which is within my field of study and is what want to do after graduating. The interview went well and I got accepted for that position as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kinda lost on how I should proceed. Both of the jobs are in the same company, ableit in different departments. I'm having some worries there will problems with HR if I reject a offer I already accepted, or if I will ruin my relationship with the manager of the job for which I already accepted the offer.

The main factor though for my indecisiveness is me being afraid of getting fired again. I have a friend who told me a lot of good things about the manager of the department where I accepted the job offer, about the department being nice and friendly, and also him being a really nice manager. The work would also be within my comfort zone, and while it wouldn't challenge me that much, it is something that needs to be done every week for the department, with one task needing to be done once a month, so I'm not afraid that they will run out of work for me after 3 months.

On the other hand, it won't looks as good on my CV if I'm applying for software development positions after graduation, and I don't think I will learn much or grow and develop my skills in that position.

I don't know much about the software development department, and whether or not the managers and other members are good. I'm also asking myself what if I don't perform well on the software development position, or if I finish working on their project and then get fired like I did in my first job, and I also don't have much experience working in Software engineering besides my internship.

I'm graduating this summer, after I which I plan to pursue a Masters degree, so I would like to continue doing whichever job I choose.

Should I take the risk and accept the Software development position, or should I stay in my comfort zone?

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr:** Got accepted for two job positions, one related to my studies, the other one not as much. I don't have much experience working within my field of studies and I'm afraid I'll get fired if I choose the one within my field of sutdy, whereas I'm pretty sure I won't get fired if I choose the other job. Should I take the risk and accept the one in my field of study?"

They've given me 2 days to accept the offer and I feel that it could be a great opportunity. However, the pay just seems a lot lower than I expected- their Glass Door average for interns is between $18-$19. So, should I attempt to negotiate this offer to squeeze a few extra bucks out of it?  If I had other offers this would seem like the right thing, but I only just started applying a couple weeks ago and haven't heard anything from any other company.

I decided to go back to school at 26, and chose an Associates program in IT/Networking. I didn't have any prior IT experience, although I had always been pretty tech savvy. I excelled in school and graduated with my AAS at 28 with a full-time job resulting from my internship program. I am still with the company today as an IT Specialist. We're a three person team supporting about 130 local and remote users, and the position is unique in that I get to wear many hats including tech support, server admin, networking, phones, active directory and hardware maintenance. A year after graduating with my AAS, I decided that I was ready to go further with my education and enrolled in a Bachelors program in Cybersecurity/Networking which I'm about halfway through now. Throughout my learning and career experience, I've learned that I particularly love anything involving Linux, Javascript, any kind of database, embedded systems/electronics, and web development. 

On to my question... I have no idea where to go with these interests. I'm grateful for my job but it is not mentally stimulating and I don't think it's going anywhere. I really think getting into web dev would be fun, but I also think being a database engineer or designer would to really fun and challenging as well. I do plan on continuing with my Bachelors degree, but what else can I do to get into my fields of interest? Is it even a realistic goal for a 30 year old with minimal coding experience? 

Any insight is super appreciated. Also, sorry for bombarding you all with a wall of text, I just wanted to give some background info."
f1tuhw,2,2020-02-10,Conditional Readmission back in to ME Program?,michimoto,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/f1tuhw/conditional_readmission_back_in_to_me_program/,"Here to ask for your guys' advice. Whether you've been in this situation or have heard stories, please let me know to shed some light on my situation.

Long story short: I was admitted to the school of engineering at my university in fall 2015. My first year or so I was undecided about what specific engineering major I wanted to go into but it didn't matter since the engineering core was the same for all engineering students. I was taking those gen eds and core courses up until my 2nd year into the summer. I then decided ME was the best fit for me and I knew it was going to be tough. I knew I had problems with my out of class study habits and it was around January 2017 when I got my first internship for experience and to pay for school since money was getting tight( I was working in retail aswell since summer 2016) I knew math wasn't my strong suit but I was oblivious to this fact and really struggled with the more mathematically intense course such as Intro to Circuits and calculus/differential equations getting 2.0's which was just enough to fulfill the requirement.

Here is the embarrassing part, the one course that is the bread and butter of ME, thermodynamics was the course that really shot me in the chest. Over the course of 2016,2017, and fall 2018, I had to reattempt this course for a passing grade. I was so stupid and blind to the fact that I needed to pass my third attempt that I tried a full course load(Mechanics, thermo, mechanics of materials, and biology(gen ed)) I failed mechanics, got a D+ in thermo, C in mech. of materials and a B+  in bio to maintain my math and science GPA. My school has a repeat limit of 3 and my petition for a 4th repeat was denied(obviously).

I wish I had realized how big of a mistake I was making trying to go fast in school by loading up 3-4 (4 credit) courses, working 25-30 hrs a week at my internship and retail on the weekends. This was a severe misjudgment of my capabilities that I have had since Fall 2018 to reflect on this mistake. I can't stress how much I took my time in this program for granted. Sure there were semesters where I passed all of my courses but I always had a semester here and there that made me have to repeat a course over the summer, fall, or winter. After my fall 2018 semester, I was told  I could not purse engineering at \_\_ university a this time. 

The situation now: Looking back, I made a crucial mistake. I put my out of class time towards my internship, struggled to find a good balance between being a full time student, part time employee and everything in between. The fact that this was happening over the course of 4 YEARS is embarrassing in all aspects. My time away from the university began in Jan 2019 and I will say from the deepest part of my hear that I am a completely different student and person. Not only was it the most productive time away, I have a whole new outlook on how much it really takes to be a successful engineering student. I began another internship during my time away and the experience I have gained is so applicable to my final courses at \_\_ university that I really feel that I can come back and quickly bounce back from this situation. \*\* I am now taking the thermo course at another university nearby with the goal of the best grade possible\*\* This is in hopes to transfer it back to my original university to show them my academic maturity. I had to take its prerequisites (MATLAB course(A-) and technical writing for engineers(B+)) before I could take the thermo course there

With the goal of appeal to the academic standing committee, I have been thoughtfully creating documents in my support over the past year and two months in preparation for submission this March 1st. 

These are the items I will be submitting: my petition explaining this situation honestly(what went wrong, why didn't I fix my problems when I saw them, why it will be different now) and how I intend to never let this happen again; a portfolio of all the design work, projects, and studies I have done since my dismissal; a reference from my manager about the type of person I am, my quality of work; a reference letter from a masters student who I worked with on materials studies over the summer; a semester by semester course breakdown explaining my reasoning for how I grouped my courses to take and justification for the skills that I have to tackle that course(I have 10 classes left), and finally a 4 minute video recording of me to show my passion for one last chance at this major. There are honestly so many small details that are worth mentioning(my advisers discussions) but it would make this post unreadable. Feel free to ask me specifics in the replies and I can surely elaborate.

If you stuck through this post, I sincerely thank you so much and any last words of advice would mean the world to me. There's not much I want in life and thinking about how I have fore-fitted a childhood goal of mine to pure ignorance and ego really makes me want to overcome this situation with everything I can possibly do. It took a lot out of me to regurgitate all this in words even though I've done it 100 times by now(via similar posts or through oral discussion) It has humbled me to the point that I KNOW I am ready to finish my final 10 classes with my best ability.

f1tvem,7,2020-02-10,My boss is leaving the company,aspiringformore,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f1tvem/my_boss_is_leaving_the_company/,"So, this is a relatively long story. 

I work for a global Fortune 500 company, currently in the middle of a merge with another large company. I started working here about a year and a half ago as an intern. 

I was initially hired as a part-time intern. About a month later, I was given additional job responsibilities so they gave me a full-time intern position. 

In March, because of my performance and the extra effort I was putting in, I was hired on as a full-time analyst with benefits and all of that good stuff. 

Because of the merger, in December, my job responsibilities changed (for the better) and my department moved under a new SVP. 

Now, my direct boss is leaving the company, and the only reason I have learned as much and progressed as much in my career is because of my boss. I work in a part of the company that requires a lot of specific knowledge about very specific things. I still have to ask my boss questions every day. Our small department of three (soon to be two) people has a lot of responsibility, and I am really terrified that, now that my boss is leaving, I won't be able to live up to the expectations of my role. 

I do not know my new SVP (she is from the company with whom we are merging). With the switch up of SVPs and my boss leaving, I will be the last person who works in my office reporting to that SVP. 

There are no plans to replace my manager as of yet, and, even if there were, because of the specific nature of the knowledge needed to do her job, it would take a replacement months and months to catch up. 

Because of the merger, I'm also worried that, because a lot of people are ""land-grabbing"" and trying to take my department, without a leader who can fight for me, I might be out of a job pretty quickly. And, honestly, I'm so busy with my current roles and responsibilities that I can't really fight for myself. And because I'm very new to the corporate world, I don't really know how to fight for myself and get into the office politics, considering that I don't know any of the people who are vying for my department. 

I'm also in a pickle because I do not have a college degree, so it's not so easy for me to just look for another job. I am pursuing a degree, but I still have about 2 years until I'm able to graduate. 

I've put in a lot of work into my department. In my short time with my company, I've completely redesigned our processes and procedures to help with workflow. I just started getting into the meat of doing my actual job (outside of process improvement) just a few months ago.

TLDR: I'm not super qualified to be doing what I'm doing, and, now that my boss is leaving in the middle of a massive merger, I'm worried that I'm going to be cut - left without a job, only a year and a half of experience, and no college degree. Am I screwed? Any advice??"

Context:
I am a senior graduating this December 2020, with a bachelors in Human Resources. I am currently in my 4th internship that is set to last until December, which upon completion and graduation, there is potential for full time employment. I have only been here since January, it’s my highest paying job so far and the biggest company I’ve worked for (global), and I am mostly enjoying it. Without looking, a new internship opportunity was presented to me. I was referred by a fellow student and current employee of the company who tells me the program was really great for her, and that they re-hire 90% of their summer interns for employment (she was one of them last summer). It pays $8 more per hour, it’s closer to my home, BUT it’s only for the summer (about 10 weeks). I am absolutely torn about what I should do. The work sounds more interesting and the pay will help me pay off some of my loans and finally move out before I graduate. There will also be potential for future employment with them, but I hate any uncertainty and fear that I will be left without a job right before graduation. 

What should I do?

Should I accept a higher paying, but temporary internship or should I stay with my current, long-term internship with potential of future employment?"

So a week passed and I reached out to my recruiter to ask for updates. I was told updates could take up to 7 days. I waited for over a week AGAIN and reached out, and was told by the recruiter that they asked the team for feedback and will update me when they receive a response. This was almost 2 weeks ago and I haven't received anything from the recruiter.

I also had a deadline for another offer that I let the recruiter know about which was in January, and the recruiter simply ignored it and told me to keep waiting. 

Am I being ghosted by the company? Should I keep reaching out? Although I'm comfortable with my other offers the role at this company fits perfectly with what I want to do and it would be an amazing opportunity for me. It's kinda painful to be kept in the dark like this."

I'm looking for advice. I'm currently in my 3rd year as a Life Science student. Because this is my 3rd year, I have to do an internship. So last Wednesday I started at my internship at a institute. I'm doing a research with someone else about something that I can't talk about (because I had to sign a confidentiality agreement). I work every day for 8 hours and I'm not getting paid. But I don't mind getting paid though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sit behind my labtop for at least 5 hours a day doing research and the rest of the day I'm conducting experiments in the lab. I don't have experience in researching and my interest don't lie here after all. Before my intership I was given two options: do an intership at a clinical/hospital lab or do a research intership. I was always interested to work in a clinical lab, but I chose for an research internship because I wanted to get more experience in this field and the institute I do my internship at, is world-leading in it's field. So I thought it would be a great experience, even after the interview.

&amp;#x200B;

But to be honest I don't know if I made the right choice. I know it's very early to think about quitting, but I don't know if this is something I want to do the next 5 month. My coworkers are super nice and helpfull, but I'm already feeling overwhelmed and stressed. Even with all their help. It got so bad at a point that I almost started crying.  I'm also afraid to disappoint my parents, my girlfriend, my coworkers and the people who helped me getting this internship.

I'm not sure what exactly what to do. If I quit, I can focus on my 3 subjects I still have to do, but if I'll stay then I know I would not feel great the next five months with te feeling that I have to do this.

So does anyone have any advice?

Thank you!"

I go to a liberal arts school in a rural town in the Midwest, and chose this school primarily because of the ""diversity"" scholarships it gave me, so that I wouldn't have to take on a heavy student loan. I do eventually want to move to either Washington state, NYC or Northern Virginia / D.C area. That's where most of my relatives and connections are.

The academics at my college is good and professors are well qualified. However, after 3 years here in this small town college, I have realized there aren't a lot of CS / SWE related opportunities surrounding me even in a 100 mile radius as I am surrounded by farms and corn fields. There are not a lot of opportunities for growth and student organizations / centers nearby either, and I have to drive 2-3 hours to visit a large state university for career fairs with any decent companies, and even there the companies prefer students from that university. The career fairs at my college do not have that many computer science related opportunities or the opportunities are very elementary like building static websites. 

My portfolio is relatively decent with deans list all semesters, several high level CS and Math courses with broad psychology and econ focus due to the liberal arts curriculum. I also have some local internships and projects on my resume. I realize that a lot of people applying to jobs and internships at these locations via LinkedIn / Glassdoor / Handshake are from bigger state colleges in cities that have more opportunities near them, and are physically closer to those jobs while I am applying to internships and jobs thousands of miles away. I am wondering what I can do to make my location in a rural Midwestern town an advantage (as something that makes me a more unique candidate) rather than a disadvantage being so far geographically from the employers. Maybe there is a project that I could do, or start some kind of local initiatives regarding CS. Any feedback or strategies are appreciated!"

As a current freshman, A2C helped me a lot last year, especially the posts from then-freshmen sharing their stories, so I figured I would return the favor and share my side of the college proces. I feel like a lot of you guys on this sub have the same prestige-focused mindset I had last year, and I want to let you guys in on a different perspective.


I'm just going to preface this word-vomit with my stats:

1520, 3.8 at a (tier 2) NE prep school, 4.0 first semester in college 


My ECs:

Math Team Captain, MUN head delegate with state awards, and president of a microfinancing club. The only part of my application that actually mattered was the fact that I'm a dual citizen (US and a country in the middle east), I lived abroad for a couple of years, and I'm trilingual (with multiple national awards for one of my languages) 


My story: 

For as long as I can remember, my (first-gen) dad always pushed me to do more. It was a problem in elementary and middle school, but in high school, things really went to shit when his obsession with prestige bubbled up. Every August, like clockwork, he would make me apply to boarding school after boarding school. I spent three god damn years of my life on Exeter and Choate's waitlists (all of 9th, 10th, and 11th grade), and my dad still pushed me to apply as a potential PG last year. His obsession with the prestige of top boarding schools bled over to me, and the prestige (and the validation) became something I obsessed over.


Well, college apps were more of the same thing. He expected me to apply to Ivy's and top LACs, and would shit-talk my top choice because it was a small/niche program at an Ivy, and not a big name program that people would recognize (think Yale-NUS type of program). 


Anyway, come Ivy Day, I didn't get in anywhere and I was devastated. I got into a few decent LACs, but after getting rejected from my top choice, I seriously considered taking a gap year. 


After a while, I realized how big a mistake that would be, and decided on one of my match schools in DC (GW, Go Colonials!). I'm not going to bullshit you guys and say that it's been all sunshine and rainbows, and I have thought about transferring, but in a lot of ways, coming to DC has been the best decision of my life. 

A lot of the people I've met in college are just as fake as people I knew in high school, but the nice thing about college is that literally no body cares. Once you're in the door, whether it's at Harvard or anywhere else, everyone is so focused on their own pursuits that there's no time for the petty bullshit I dealt with last year. 


For me, what really cracked the rose colored glasses of prestige was realizing the opportunities mid tier schools can offer their top students. My best friend, who's now at Brown, had the highest GPA in the history of my school. Now, he's around the middle of the pack. I, on the other hand, was barely in the top 20%, but at GW I made Dean's list and get access to tons of special crap. 


Because of my academic standing (which I wouldn't have at an Ivy), I get priority registration for tons of events (I got to see Nikki Haley, Ronan Farrow, and a few other really cool speakers last semester), and first dibs at internships and networking opportunities. Right now, I'm writing this post on my lunch break in one of the Congressional cafeterias, because I was able to snag a last-minute internship on the Hill 3 days/week. This is not the kind of thing I ever imagined would be possible this time last year, to me, getting rejected from Ivy's meant that I was doomed to a life of mediocrity, which I've realized is so absurd and overblown. 


TLDR: Think you'll get rejected from an Ivy? Who cares, you'll just end up being a top student and kicking ass somewhere else"

Hi Reddit,

I am 26 years old living in the UK. I graduated from a metropolitan Uni with a 1st class degree in Computing, after graduating I joined a leading NDT engineering company as a Project Leader / Software QA. 

This role involved full management of Software Testing as I was the sole tester for a year and half. As the software development grew, I lead the software development and had various interns and devs taking direction from myself. Managing Innovate UK projects and many internal projects. Also various Sys Admin type tasks, adding, creating users. Setting up hardware. Leading to security related Sys Admin tasks.

I have taken a year off to go travelling. And will be returning August / September 2020. 

In my local area Web Development ( Javascript), C# is very big. However about 1 hours commute away there is also the above and DevOps and Security roles.

My passion I feel would be in Cyber Security, but due to living far away from work and not being able to relocate for personal reasons. Would this option be worth it? And investing into it?

Would I be better of working local and going down the Javascript Web Dev route. 


Thanks!

To Sum Up!
What are the pros and cons of going down Web Dev( Javascript) / Cyber  career paths?

Which will pay better in the long run?

Which will be easier to break into?

Any recommended  on certifications for either?

Would NETWORK+  be worth taking? My idea is it would benefit both?

EDIT: Are there any other career routes you would suggest going down instead or linked?"
f1yeac,34,2020-02-10,Accepted a job offer!! (UK),cryptocris,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/f1yeac/accepted_a_job_offer_uk/,"TLDR: I got a hired as a junior web developer after 9 months of full-time self-studying. Follow up from this [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/bhmm4w/dont_know_where_my_life_is_going/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

Let me just preface this and say I didn't just wake up one morning and decide I wanted to pursue a new career in this field. I put in over a year of thought into this decision as I knew I would be in this for the long haul.

As for how I came to this decision, I didn't fancy going back to college or university to study for 2-4 years, I have been down that path and dropped out as the environment just doesn't suit me. There was a fairly well-respected coding boot camp in my city however, I could not justify parting with over £5000 for 3 months work. Ultimately I decided on the self-taught route, utilizing the various online learning resources. I worked as a waiter for just under a year, saving up as much as I could before leaving to study full-time, I live at home still so I knew these savings could be stretched out to around 9-12 months.

A summary for what I studied,  I started out learning what most people doing web dev start with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. From there I went down the JavaScript framework route starting with React and then progressing onto Gatsby which I have been prominently using for the last 4 months creating freelance websites as well as my [portfolio website](https://www.crollacreations.com/) (**Project animations are broken on mobile after updating a recent package so would recommend viewing on desktop**).

Some advice I would give:

1. As I said in my preface, don't rush into a decision, whether it be going to university, a coding boot camp or learning by yourself. Most people won't be able to go down the same path as me and take 9 months off work so assess your situation irrespective of others.
2. If you're going down the self-learning route play around, start with something you enjoy. Do some research on the different professions that are linked to programming. Go on indeed and other job board websites and see what job postings are most common in your area and note down what tools and technologies they employ - this may also influence your decision on what base to start from.
3. Don't burn out. The first couple of weeks is where you learn the most and fly through the exercises and challenges and begin to think this can't be that difficult right? Wrong, you will eventually run into roadblocks which begin to slow down progress and you can spend hours working on a problem which only requires a simple obvious solution. These moments are what honestly bothered me the most, sometimes making me stop coding for over a week because I would get so frustrated and disheartened. Instead, take a break, go do something relaxing or leave the problem to the next day. Guaranteed you will figure out the solution a lot quicker after clearing your head and it will save your sanity.
4. Make your CV look professional. I started with a simple word document which looked just plain boring and something that was knocked up with no thought whatsoever. To improve this I used a site called Creddle, a CV builder of which there are probably many other options you could go for. I chose a template and adjusted it to my liking and within an hour my CV was transformed.
5. Make an eye-catching website. Spend some time making your website stand out, this is also a good opportunity to learn a design tool to plan out your website before you start coding (I chose Adobe XD). I built my website in Gatsby and used the animation package GSAP to create some more complex animations. I bought the domain and hosted it all on Netlify for free.
6. Freelancing can be hard. Having worked on solely personal pieces starting out, I didn't have anything meaningful to show companies to persuade them to let me re-build their 10-year-old websites. That is where I leveraged friends and family, asking around if they would like me to build websites for them FOR FREE. Yes, I could have asked for some money but I was very much using this opportunity to push myself, learn new technologies, run into problems I have never faced before and overcome them. I treated these websites as if it was a real-paying client, sitting down to discuss their needs, coming up with a prototype in Adobe XD, refactoring, then finally getting into development.
7. When finally applying for jobs I got more responses when I reached out to companies who didn't have any advertised job openings. The email was short, enquiring about possible internships or junior full-time positions available. It had a short description of where I was from, what tool and technologies I use, a link to my portfolio and an attached CV. This was how I got in contact with the company who would eventually offer me the job and as luck would have it they were thinking about hiring a junior developer. I was the only person they ever interviewed for the position and after a trial week, they offered me the job!

As for the job itself the company work predominantly with Ruby and Ruby on Rails which I do not have prior experience with, however, the company likes my portfolio and thought they could upskill me with no problems

I've been lurking here and reading many posts about being help desk purgatory or not knowing where to go, or even what certs to get, but it seems I am spreading my knowledge pretty wide, and not very deep.

I first worked at Geek Squad, and am currently finishing up my last 2 semesters at school with an MIS degree, and working full time as a help desk intern. My hope is that I am able to potentially skip out on at least level 1 help desk but I am not sure where and how I can transition to devops from where I am at, or if I should continue down the route of pursuing a SysAdmin job after building my knowledge a bit more in the area. I am trying to absorb as much knowledge and information from my current SysAdmin and asking as many questions as possible but I am stuck because I feel like I know a little bit about a lot of things.

I took 2 years of programming courses in high school which consisted of VB, Java, C#, HTML, and C++. In college, by the time I graduate, I will have taken Python courses, web development courses, as well as SQL courses, and then obviously the business admin side of the degree as well. On top of all of this, I have been self teaching myself docker and developing a homelab with Unifi networking gear, Proxmox, and Unraid with docker.

My goal is to make between $50k - $60k out of college so My main question from all of this, is if I wanted to get into devops, what is the entry level position, and how can I transition there? Additionally, if I wanted to continue down the SysAdmin route, with my knowledge currenty, what is my next logical step?

Is it logical for me to anticipate skipping out on at least Help Desk Level 1 with my internship?

Is my salary goal reasonable?

I have no internship and my GPA is not great at all, but at least still above 3.0. Also have been applying to places that is specific to a city (NYC/NJ) because of family related issues and the fact I go to school here.

I've applied everywhere- from places on LinkedIn, my school's career center, AngelList, BuiltIn, but for some reason, am getting barely any responses or getting rejected right away. I'm applying to literally any company that has a software related role and still no success. I'm not even expecting a top company, just any company that will allow me to build skills and do important work.

I switched my major pretty late, within the last year, which explains why I have no internship experience or projects. It's so hard to even try to do my own project because I don't know many people or have friends in my major.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong that is getting me hardly any interviews, and with graduation coming up soon, I feel hopeless and actually worthless and that my career will no where. Maybe this career path wasn't for me? But it's too late to switch now because I have to graduate..

f20y8q,19,2020-02-10,Being told that I don’t know the fundamentals...,Retro-Pulse,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f20y8q/being_told_that_i_dont_know_the_fundamentals/,"Hi everyone,

I am here to just seek for some insight and advice but is sort of a rant. None of my family happen to be any helpful resources and I’ve talked directly to my professors and they have given me a little more hope in term in finding a job. If at any point I sound like I’m being an immature guy ranting, then you can downvote and just go about your day. I just want to figure out the correct path for me to successfully work without being so anxious to figure out the future for myself. Also I apologize in advanced because a lot of what I wrote may not grammatically correct (sorry). 

I am a student that is on the last semester for my software development 2 year degree at a community college. 

Recently (late November - early December), I had a spontaneous interview opportunity with Target for a software engineer internship. I showed up with a bunch more people from other 4 year colleges who were also just finishing their 4 year degree in CS (while I’m only obtaining a 2 year degree). I felt a bit tense because this was the first actual interview revolving around the career that I was studying.  Moving past all of the orientation details, I go into the interview. Some of the questions that I was asked were -

- Tell me about yourself
- What coding languages have you done
- Have you done any projects outside of school. 

I felt like these question were question that I have been asked before from other jobs, so I felt confident sharing and being honest in terms of my personal level of experience. Things got dicey when I was asked to whiteboard. I have done some in class design projects that were used to plan out some of the sql-server management project and visually planning out VS designs so I felt okay but then I was asked to go through the thought processes of a project that I have done using data structures and sequence diagrams. At this moment I was instantly lost. I started explaining my thought process but not necessarily in the way that he wanted me to. While I was demonstrating to the best of my ability He kind of looked confused. Right then I knew that I was doing something wrong. He then stopped me in between each section of the project to ask me very direct question about a specific aspect of my project such as:

- What is a api. 
- What are you send you the api and what are you receiving back from the api
- what kind of files can be received back from a api

So even though I had a project that used api’s I totally didn’t understand them. He tried to further dumb it down by telling me to write a simple method that adds 2 values together. I completely messed up the method because eventually the interviewer was teaching me what I was writing on the board and what it meant. I sat back down in devastation thinking that I though I had something to offer, then to surely find out that I’m not ready at all. I essentially asked him what I needed to do and he told me to learn the fundamentals. He also said that sometimes people know how to program but don’t know what the meaning of a specific property is and how it is beneficial to the program. This mention was a direct fitting to what I feel like I am facing in my current state.

This really killed my confidence and it still is hard to recover from it. 

Like I mentioned earlier I am graduating with an a.a.s in software development and I forgot to mention that my associates isn’t transferable to any other schools. I just feel lost and sort of hopeless. I really do enjoy writing programs. I want to be useful, and I want to be able to benefit companies and be able to write my on projects on platforms like visual studios and unity. I have a lot of fun experimenting and investing my time. 

This spring semester I am in a capstone development projects class which is creating a portfolio of projects on my github. Again I am having a blast with being given a task and coming up with ideas and doing the research in making each project come to life. Even though I feel like I’m doing everything I am capable of for these projects, I still feel some form of hopelessness and just want to find ways to fill in the holes that I am missing when I comes to practices that I am not aware of.

I did find teachyourselfcs website and I was just reading over the summary to find that I’m going to have to invest a lot of time into learning the basics fundamentals. 

I just really am looking for an idea. Some of the options that I want to think about is:

- If I just went back to school for a compSci BA, is it worth it
- should I go through some sort of coderdojo?
- should I just teach myself?
  
If you read up to this far, thank you so much! I really appreciate you taking the time to let me vent here."

f23pgx,23,2020-02-11,Things I have learned along the way,trinitrocubane,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/f23pgx/things_i_have_learned_along_the_way/,"I am a couple of months from defending and am in the process of thesis writing for a chemical engineering PhD. These are a few of the most important lessons I have learned along the way.

1) If there is a control experiment you think of and you can do it in less than an hour, you HAVE to do it. It doesn't matter if you have been doing the same procedure for months and collected thousands of data points. If you think of a control that could invalidate your data if it doesn't go your way, you absolutely have to do it.

2) You know your project and your limitations better than anybody, including your adviser. You know the fundamental assumptions, experimental capabilities, and the level of certainty certain experiments can offer. Recognize when your PI assumes your data means more than it does, or that the system can be modeled a certain way when it can't. Push back when they are going to send you down rabbit holes because of their lack of detailed understanding.

3) Get a hobby, or cycle between them. At least for me, being able to progress in something else when the project was stuck kept me sane.

4) Depending on your funding situation, your PI might try to keep you longer than you really need to be there. You are most valuable as a researcher in your final year. Advocate for yourself and don't wait for them to tell you when you can graduate. About a year before you think you want to defend, give them a plan of all the experiments you think you need to graduate. This is the start of the negotiation.

5) Most of the literature (at least in my field) is produced by people in the same position as you, Grad students trying their best and making mistakes sometimes. Don't treat everything you read in the literature as unquestionable truth. If it doesn't make sense, investigate a bit to see if you are wrong, or they are, or both.

6) Do an industry internship if you get the chance. The money is often great (in engineeting) and it is a much needed break from the project after years. It will expand your horizons and help you to look at problems from a different perspective.


I am sure there are more, but these are the major ones that come to mind. If anybody wants to share some of their words of wisdom, I would like to hear it."

After several months, I had gone on an interview for a state job (I was advised to interview to get the experience since it would most likely that I won't be hire). I got a called several months later offering me the job. I accepted the offer, however, I started panicking afterward. I know I wanted the job, but I wasn't sure if I could handle it since a lot of my former classmates who interns there stated that the job was very stressful. In addition, it had a one year probation period so I was afraid and kept thinking ""what if I didn't make it"". I only ever had one job which was with ompany A for a period of 6 months so I didn't want to hurt my resume if things didn't work out. I guess anxiety and guilt (for quitting when we are understaffed) took the better part of me so I cave in when my boss asked me to stay because a lot of people from my department were leaving. I called the manager that interview me to inform her that I would like to renege my offer and explain the reason. I know I did something terrible and reason can justify my action. Also, I know she was not happy with me. If I were to apply for the position several years down the road, do you think they would remember me? Have you every renege an offer and what was the outcome.

I PRAY TO GOD THAT THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR ME WITH 2.65 GPA. IM WILLING TO WORK HARD AND LEARN. JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE GOD TO AT LEAST HAVE SOME FINANCIAL SECURITY OUT OF COLLEGE WITH THIS FUCKING ENGINEERING DEGREE.

&amp;#x200B;

AND THEN I CAN WORK BY DAY AND PRODUCE MUSIC BY NIGHT.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT SO FAR, I SUCK AT BOTH. MY GPA TELLS ME THAT IM NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I CANT PRODUCE A FULL SONG YET EITHER ON ABLETON.

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT THE FUCK AM I? IM JUST SO SICK OF IT.

I WANT TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO MUSIC, BUT OFC I CANT BE HOMELESS. SO I NEED THIS ENGINEERING DEGREE TO GET ME A STUPID FUCKING JOB SO I CAN MAKE MONEY AND GO HOME AND MAKE MUSIC AND BUILD A BRAND FOR MYSELF. THIS SHIT IS ALL TOO MUCH THOUGH.

&amp;#x200B;

IM 21 YEARS OLD. THE PRESSURES OF EVERYTHING.

I JUST WANT TO FUCKING KNOW THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR ME. IS A 2.65 GPA REALLY A DEATH SENTENCE FOR A CIVIL ENGINEER. IM STILL APPLYING TO INTERNSHIPS AND SHIT, BUT IDK IF THEYLL ACCEPT ME AFTER LOOKING AT MY TRANSCRIPT. FUCK THIS ALL."
f26op3,0,2020-02-11,Unsure about my future goals after graduation and ahead,porcssss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f26op3/unsure_about_my_future_goals_after_graduation_and/,"Hi everyone,

Before anything, I would like to tell you about my situation. I am almost 20 and am studying as a CE major at one of the UC schools (not the top ones tho). I plan on graduating at the end of my 3rd year with a BS in CE.  I have around a 3.4 GPA, I haven't had many bad experiences with classes till now and have gotten straight Bs and hopefully, that stays the case in future classes. Talking about extra-curricular stuff I have a research position where I work with ML datasets provided by companies for the project, apart from that I am involved in the rocketry club and also teach a few ML workshops for a club.

Because I am an immigrant (from India) and I have a weird visa situation (L2), where I cannot get a work permit for any internships or jobs I have had to make up for that by being more active in the other activities I can do on the side and gain experience. (If you don't know much about immigrant visas you can look them up and understand my situation better) I am sticking to this visa (L2) for right now because I have filed for permanent residency but there is a pretty high chance of me turning 21 before it arrives and if that happens my ""dependent"" permanent residency will be canceled because I won't be a dependent anymore. But there is still some chance I would say around 30% of me getting a permanent residency and being able to work in the US thereafter.

Coming back to my situation, by the end of my 3rd year, I will have graduated without any internships because of this reason but I am planning to switch my visa to international (F1) so I can stay in the US for a few years and gain some experience through internships and jobs. My plans over summer are to take classes, focus on one of the paths I am considering and prepare for post-college plans. Since there is no way for me to get any internships during my college career I have a few ways I can go from here ( considering I start focusing on my post-graduation goals near March of this year to be in a really good place end of college) and each of these two options have different options that I would want to consider  -

&amp;#x200B;

1. Start preparing for coding interviews by doing Leetcode problems and working the CTCI. Along with that develop a few side projects that can showcase what my interests are and get them up and running on my Github. Work on my personal site, maybe secure another research position and make sure I am able to become a good interview taker around the start of September. Then I apply for either internship like other college students and secure maybe a couple of them to guarantee internships 6 months post-college graduation or straight-up apply for full time positions OR apply for both and see where I get. I am unsure about that path but please mention this path if you feel it you recommend something like this. Also with that apply to jobs in Canada because I would be on an easier track to gain residency there while also living near my family in the US with whom I might not be able to live with if things don't go in my favor
2. Start preparing for the GRE test along with preparing for coding interviews. Apply for graduate school end of the year and also apply for internships so I can have an internship before the summer I start grad school. I would be applying for grad schools for in the US and Canada because if I am not able to secure permanent residency in the US I would like to live in Canada which is the closest to my family in the US and has good schools and living standards. A backup for this option is to apply for an additional year of school so I can graduate with a master's from the same university I am in right now.
3.  ? ? ? ? ? Recommend me other options !! what would you do if you were in my shoes ? ? ? ? ?

If you have any questions you can ask me. If you are still confused about how the visa situation, is unpredictable and it is just whatever happens over time. 

My goal is to eventually work in the CS field at an SWE role and over time explore the professional applications of CS and then pick where my interests lies. Right now I am pretty fascinated by ML and I want to continue learning it over time. Another one of my goals is to secure decent security of livelihood by having residency in the US and Canada so I can focus on other goals in life."

some more details about me:

interned  in a media company in egypt: 3 months 
interned in a edutech startup: 2 months
did a small time events organisation startup venture during undergraduate days: catered to about 600-800 students in total. 
Developed a couple of websites on the front end and pursued various certifications in data science(I know a thing or two about analysing numbers BUT it is not my stronghold)


I am technologically versed with various programming languages, and a couple of automation tools. 


1] My main concern is that if i apply for a job, then what should i put in my resume for the years in which i was inactive. 

2] Is there any way through which i should go about building my profile. if yes, then what are the ways? e.g. writing articles, blogging, creating other forms of content etc.

Learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript or go for cloud certifications? Need career advice bad!

Currently in IT. Learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript or go for a cloud certification and get into DevOps? Need career advice!

Resume: https://imgur.com/gallery/u51h9wa

So I am currently an IT guy with a Bachelors in Computer Information Systems. I have spent the last few years working IT Support and come to realize I am not passionate about “IT” anymore. The thought of networking, servers, IT troubleshooting doesn’t really motivate me anymore. My next step in my career if I wanted to “move up” in the IT world would be a role like a Systems Admin. Googling the daily roles of a Sys Admin... doesn’t interest me at all to continue that path. That’s why I have wanted to pick up coding and use my support background to pair with to make a career advancement/change. 

At my current company I have recently started helping out on the Software/Application Support team. This team has a lot of Tier 1 type questions but most of the knitty gritty stuff gets escalated to the Engineers and Developers. Seeing what they do, I find that doing coding work like that is WAY more interesting then my job managing the network and server administration stuff. 

I like the company that I am at and believe if I started to learn more about Web Development and picking up some coding skills - I could get some opportunity to help out. I came across an old job listing for an “Implementation Engineer” at my company and some of the requirements are knowledge with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and JSON/XML API’s. Also knowledge with PHP and SQL was a plus. 

I also was thinking of grabbing an AWS or Cloud certification and going down more of a DevOps Route... or into cloud. I have read that this is a pretty common transition for people in IT. This may be a little more of a learning period but DevOps jobs are growing. I am willing to study for these AWS or Azure certs like crazy in my free time. 

I am torn between which route I should take. If I go the HTML/CSS/JavaScript route, I am just a little weary for my long term career. I have a great opportunity in THIS current company, but I am not sure down the road if I were ever to leave this company - I don’t know if I would want to just be a Web Developer full time. I also am confused because if I spend all my free time studying DevOps / Cloud stuff - then I am missing an opportunity at my current company to potential move up in to a higher role and i’ll Be stuck doing low end Tier 1 / Help Desk style stuff. I am really interested in cloud technology and know in the future there will be a ton of jobs that are both available and lucrative - but just a little hesitant because of the opportunity in my current role. 

Can anyone help me out? This is my first job out of college so I am really looking to start making advancements in my career and picking up new skills. I just wanted to get someone else’s opinion or someone that has been in a similar situation. I have a pretty decent resume with 3 good internships on it plus a Bachelors (plus my current role at a established SaaS company) - so I know adding some coding skills will make me more marketable then just a typical “IT fix-it guy”. 

All responses are really really appreciated. I am very grateful for everyone’s honest opinions. Thanks!

TLDR: Should I learn web development skills to potential move up in my current support role, or learn DevOps to get a new job in the future — all to move out of IT

I am currently interviewing with other companies and have possible additional interviews coming up so I did not want to decide soon.

So I told the person who has been speaking with me from the beginning what I just said as a reason for that, and asked if I can be offered a spring internship instead of summer, so I don't have to pass on the offer they gave me and they don't have to wait. It wasn't like I gave an ultimatum or anything. I felt bad asking for it, but I do want to take my shot at other companies as well. I also told them that I was satisfied with the offer,specially regarding pay and thanked her and apologized for making things complicated(she's a sweet older lady) I also said that I can recommend a few people I know to fill in for summer. She was saying that I can do both summer and spring and it doesn't really matter too so hopefully I get it.

My main problem(The reason why I am still interviewing) is that I am more into high level software engineering, while they're an aerospace engineering company so they do more low level stuff. They offered generous pay despite being small company(Of course I didn't say that to her. But tiny company offering slightly more than what Northrup Grumman pays their interns)So I am really appreciative of their offer.

However, it makes me feel like I'm a bad person. Is this unethical or am I allowed to do this?"

\- the general quality of everything is not good: the office is in a relatively bad district, the office itself is okay, but not great, it's worse than my current one

\- I know that many people moved from the company to the competitor, I've heard that even whole departments move there

\- I feel and know that some people from the department I will potentially work in are not very trustable: one of the managers constantly try to sell you something (usually the most boring tasks, and yes, I worked with him a little bit of a research project) and it's clear that he is not sincere

\- He said that he isn't happy with the job and wants to move to another company. And another potential colleague seems isn't happy and wants to move

\- I know that some interns moved to other companies after internships

\- The director of the company (it's a branch of a big company in my country) was changed recently, I suppose it's due to bad performance

\- The staff from the company seems to don't participate in some local conferences on my topic

\- My current job is okay, and I have good amount of time for self-learning, so I can invest more time (1-2 months) and apply for better companies, I really want to work for, but I have high chance to lose, also there are not so many well-known companies in my country with vacancies on my topic

I'm afraid that they will not continue the internship with me, so I will be without a job, and my current company will probably refuse me if I ask to return. Also, I don't have a financial pillar.

Also, important, that my intuition doesn't say no completely, just bad feeling. Also, refusing this offer seems a mad choice for me, and currently, I'm going to say yes.

So this is my third formal work, the second one that it´s related to my mayor (International business administrator) 

Before this job I had a half shift intern job in a company that really sucked (I was 18 at the time), I had 3 different bosses, two of them were really nice and patient with me, they even would offer to help me with my homework that was related with the work I was supposed to do, but unfortunately, the third boss (which I had to spend more time with) was the definition of a b\*tch, she would at me if I had any questions of the process or tell me I was incompetent or useless, she even pick on my physical appearance, it was so bad I had to talked to HR and it kinda got better but she would give me a lot of work 10 minutes before I had to check out to go to school and warned me I couldn't leave without finish it, and well I end up quitting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I end up resting a year and focusing on school, but I got an email from the CEO to a company that it is rival to my last one but bigger (it is transnational company with the headquarters in Canada), and he was also interested in starting the program of interns, and since I was on my last year university I could use the experience, I accepted the offer and first advantage it was that was earning 2.5 more than in the last job, and let me tell you, everyone was so kind and understanding, when I was on a week on exams they would let me go early or even take the day off so I can focus on studying because "" finish school should be my priority"".

The HR department was always asking me about the school, and how I was doing with the tasks giving if I was comfortable with them, one month before I finish university I got a formal proposal of working with them, they wanted me to take control of the international purchases, I accepted and been learning a lot and since I been solving a lot of problems they had in the import process, I had been invited to go to several plants (outside my country) and explain the foreign trade rules in English so we have fewer problems in customs which it has been a success and everyone seems happy with my job. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, the CEO of the company in Canada came to audit us and she was ""impress"" with the change in the department and she started asking about myself, during the conversation she asked me if I wanted to continue studying, I told her that I would like it but my economy wouldn't let me afford to pay a master´s degree. 

 

Last month I got in a meeting with the CEO of this company and HR and they offered me a coordinator position in the company, I would have to supervise all the purchases, (national and International) in addition to all the exportations, I don't have to do it, just supervise it. The salary wasn't great compared with other companies in the area but they offered me to pay a Master´s degree in any university I want along with many courses of international commerce and a training o almost a month in Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told my boyfriend all of this really excited and he said they are taking advantage of me, they should be able to pay me more and the ""good jobs"" are just pads in the back if it doesn't have any economic incentive. He told me that I should I least expect the double income for the new position and they only offered me around 2,000 more ( around 110 USD) 

But my point of view it's different, I earn enough money to live well and I´m having the opportunity to visit many places without expending my money, besides I like the job, like the people I work with and they are giving me the chance to continue studying. 

Am I wrong for not focusing on the money? Am I really being take advantage of being so young and naive?"

f2f95u,0,2020-02-11,References for internship,cseli,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f2f95u/references_for_internship/,"I'm a CS junior, and I applied to a medium-sized company online for a programming internship this summer. In the application process, there was a page that asked for 3 references. I bypassed the page by choosing ""references available upon request"", but now I'm scheduling a phone interview and I'm worried about what to do. (This may seem really stupid, but given that an optimistic response rate for this stuff is like 3%, it was easy for my mind to convince myself to not even think about it).

I've never worked before or had an internship, and for the most part I've been a very shy student, though I have good grades. I know one professor would give me a great reference, but others I am not so sure of, and I haven't been in contact for a long while. The thought that an internship application would require references sort of caught me way off guard and is giving me serious anxiety. I also can't find much information about this particular company online and so I have nothing to go off of.

I feel like they probably use the same application process for all applications and references may not even be a part of this internship, but I don't like assuming that in case they do ask. I'm not even sure what a reference entails here because it was vague: letter or call / email? Would it be awful to list a professor and ask them at the same time?

At this point I don't have time to really get ""ok"" from 3 people before the phone interview. Can I have any advice on this situation?"

Okay, enough prose.  To the story:

This happened a few months after the other programmer left.  The other IT person didn't want the responsibility, so it was left to me to take on everything else.

So now I'm all on my own when it comes to programming.  And networking.  And help desk.

Wait, that's not correct.  I had a helper!  Ever since The Move, I had someone they hired to transport equipment.  Who was happy to help out with some basic help desk stuff.  So they got the simple things, I got everything else.  They're not the intern.  They're just someone who wanted to be useful, and actually was.

The intern was someone hired without my input, or even knowledge.  Just someone who showed up one day, and now I have to figure out what to do with them.

Me: ""Oh, hi.  Who are you?""

Intern: ""I'm the new IT guy.  I'm supposed to help you?""

Me: ""Okay.  That's news to me.  Can you tell me your background in IT?""

Intern: ""I've got a degree in networking.""

Me: ""Fantastic!  We can use that!  I'll get you set up, and I'll hand that off to you, and maybe you can help me figure out some of these stubborn issues with the servers.""

---

I only have a diploma from a local college.  In programming.  Everything else is more or less self taught, and applying face to wall until wall breaks.  So I know how to do stuff, but definitely not best practices.  So having someone with some more formal training should help out immensely.

So I get them going, and I start figuring out what they can do.  And find out fast why they were an intern.  They couldn't make heads or tails out of our network.  Or our servers, for that matter.  Some of that...I can understand; it wasn't anything approaching sane, but it wasn't a black hole or anything.

Okay.  No network help.  Onto servers.

Nope.  Doesn't know how to make things work, even with me walking them through it a couple times.  Attempts on their side to help out made things worse.  I had to ban them from the server room because of all the screwups I had to fix.

Phone switches?  Nope.  Those blow up if you look at them wrong, they'd already shown they couldn't be trusted with critical infrastructure.

Okay.  What am I left with?  Help desk!  Surely they've got the chops to at least handle some basic tickets, right?  ...Right?

Oh, how wrong I was.  To give credit where credit is due, I guess I can't really expect someone with a degree in networking to be able to handle help desk issues; they're not even close to the same thing.  *Some* basic knowledge of technical troubleshooting should transfer over to other areas of IT.

Got a ticket that one of the floor computers wasn't working.  Okay, great.  Release The Intern!  Who promptly comes back a couple of minutes reporting the problem, I ask for more information, they dutifully truck back to the computer, gather the information, and come back and report.  Rinse and repeat.  Great, I have a mobile appendage.  Eventually, just ask them to grab the box and bring it back to our area so we don't have to do all the back and forth.  Turn it on, and first thing I see is: `NO SYSTEM DISK OR DISK ERROR`.

Shouldn't have taken that long to get to that point.  Whatever.  Hard drive failed.  To be expected.  Pop it out, slap in a spare, reinstall Windows, keep on going.  I hand it back to the intern to swap the hard drive.

Who promptly spends *four hours* trying to figure out how to even open the case.  I had to ask what the hold up was before they'd tell me.  It wasn't a standard case, but one of those with a vertical front plate that opened out for the drive.  I think it had a back release to open said plate.  Neat design, and made our lives easier for hard drive swapping.  If you knew the trick, anyways.  Intern wouldn't ask.  Didn't google.  Didn't do anything but pull at the case, trying to figure out how to open it.  Couldn't even get the side panel off.  I reached out, pulled the release, and the plate popped open.  Pulled the drive, handed the spare to the intern, and walked away.

I went to the boss right after.  Told them that the intern wasn't my intern anymore, and they need to be kept away from any of our tech.  Boss tried to calm me down and asked me to watch them a couple more weeks to see if they get the hang of it.  I knew they wouldn't, but, fine, whatever.

Throughout all of this, I was doing some very tricky work on our servers.  This was years ago, so I can't remember exactly what it was, except that it was some sort of server fix that required an exact process to prevent the server from failing during the fix.  It doesn't take long, once you figure it out, but it was a little finicky to get right.  

I had a day off in the middle of the week, and management wanted this fix to be completed.  Intern calls me, asking for how to do it.  I tell them straight up that it's tricky, and if I tell them how to do it, they're going to screw it up, and then I have to come in and fix it.  So they can just wait until tomorrow.

A few minutes later, boss calls.  Wants me to tell the intern how to do the fix.  I repeat myself.  Intern will screw it up, I'll do it tomorrow.  Nope.  Tell intern how to do it.  Fine.  

Intern screws it up.  And now my boss wants me to come in to fix it.  *sigh*  There goes my day off.

Time spent on phone: half an hour.  Travel time: an hour.  Time to fix: 15 minutes.  And since I was there anyways, I decided I'd just fix the rest, and the company can just give me a day off somewhere else.  Instant protest.  I wasn't there the whole day, so I shouldn't get another whole day off.

Aftermath: intern was no longer in IT.  They got relegated to office data entry.  Good riddance."

Last summer I interned at a small tech company before heading off to grad school. The pay wasn’t very good (it may seem decent to most, but it was located at one of the highest CoL areas in the country and I was paid minimum wage for the area), but I felt getting my foot in the door was more important. They then extended my internship until the end of the year, where I was working for them remotely.

I learned a lot from them during the summer but generally felt unfulfilled with the work I was doing and the mentoring I received during those months I was remote and at school. I left with a good relationship with them, though, and the experience I gained from working with them paved the way for me landing an internship for this upcoming summer at a larger and well-paying company.

Recently, I got contacted by my former manager to continue working on the project I was doing before I left. He asked if I’d be available for one month.

My issue is, I hated working on the project they gave me. It felt like drudge work. I’m not hurting for cash, but it would be nice to have some extra money to throw at my student loans. The thing is, I’m not gonna bend over backwards trying to fit their work into my schedule for minimum wage. And there was no mention of pay in the email, which leads me to believe they expect to be paying me the same amount as before.

Is it reasonable for me to ask for higher pay since I’m no longer an intern and they are basically trying to hire me on as a contractor?"

Even though my original plan was to do a 3-semester co-op at the current company, due to hostile work environment I don’t plan to come back after this semester. I’ve started looking for summer internships back in October and I got sent coding challenges from quite a few prestigious companies but back then I wasn’t very prepared and I bombed almost all of the coding challenges. Since then I’ve dedicated all of my free time to do Leetcode and did every problems in Elements of the Technical Interviews, I feel quite confident now but since recruiting season seems to coming to an end, I don’t get sent online assessments anymore. I’ve managed to get made it into the onsite rounds for Capital One and Quora but due to horrible, overwhelming anxiety, I thought there was no way I can get an offer so I canceled both of them. Back then I thought I would commit 3 semesters at my current companies so I had an excuse to let my anxiety take over me, because worst case I still have a job. 
Now I’m back on the job hunt and I’m beating myself up for all the stupid decisions that I’ve made, especially for canceling my onsites. 
I apply to internships during my lunch hours and grind more Leetcode once I get home, but it really seems like I won’t get an offer this summer. The fact that its already mid-February feels like there’s a clock ticking because it seems like all the positions are now filled. Everyday I get home from work I cry for like 1 hour, then pick myself up and get back on the grind but I don’t know how long I can endure feeling so stressed out and anxious anymore. Since I have 6 more classes to finish my degree, my back up plan is to go back to school in the summer and take 2 classes and finish the rest another semester, my worry right now is what if I won’t get an internship in the Fall then I will graduate having only 1 internship experience and I won’t get a good job offer.

I was lucky enough to accept a great job out of college doing IT &amp; Software Support. About 5 months in, I realize that my heart really isn't in doing Tier 1 type Help Desk stuff (resetting passwords, program installs, recovering emails). I am starting to work with the software support team and realize all of these guys have a lot of coding knowledge in work in DevOps type roles. I figured I worked too hard in college and spent most of that time busting my butt interning to just be complacent with a job doing low level work. I am thankful for where I ended up... but I want to continue learning and climbing the ladder rather than be complacent.

My goal was to start studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. After that, I wanted to grab a better understanding and study up on Linux (I have minor knowledge in Linux atm). After I got those 2 down - I wanted to dedicate my time learning Python and automation.

Is this a good learning track towards a Junior role? Has anyone moved out of a Help Desk role into a Junior DevOps role?

I graduated last August with 11 months of internship experience and landing a full time job at the same place (public sector job) 4 months prior to graduating, which is currently where I'm at. Being in the capital of California, State jobs are pretty abundant, and most private jobs around here want senior level experience.  I want to move to the private sector, because they use exciting technologies, specifically React (that excites me!), whereas the public sector is heavily invested in [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET).     

However, I worry that the longer I stay here, and invest more time into learning [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET), the less likely I'll be a potential candidate on the outside. 

Not to mention, one of the uphill battles I face now/during interviews, is that because I am constantly dev-ing in [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) (8 hours+ a day), the few hours after work of React really doesn't show during interviews/self assessments/dev-ing after work, as I just get confused by little syntax issues (C# vs JS). 

Throw in the fact that, the longer I stay in the public sector, I worry that I become less and less valuable/sharp because of how different the two sectors move.   

So... 

1. What are private sector thoughts on applicants from the public sector?
2. Has anyone transitioned? Was it easy to do so?"

(For a bit of background information, I'm currently a senior in college with a degree in Information Tech with a focus in Digital Forensics. )

Last summer, I was accepted into the FBI Honors Undergraduate internship for the summer of 2019, and am currently still interning throughout the current semesters. I'm still so grateful to this day I had the opportunity to have even been accepted. I was recently accepted to graduate school, and informed my supervisor on the matter.

It's explained at the beginning of the internship that as a senior as long as you get accepted to graduate school you're allowed to continue the undergraduate internship. My dilemma is that I'd like to take a break upon graduating, maybe study abroad for a semester before returning back to start graduate school. I was informed that in doing so I would have to end the undergraduate internship. and that's completely understandable. I was thinking I could possibly apply for the Graduate program upon returning. I'm a bit torn about whether or not it's a good idea to actually take a break to go abroad and risk ending the internship, or taking that break and just reapplying for the graduate internship upon returning.

Has anyone ever experienced a dilemma in taking a break before starting a career during graduate school? Does anyone also know the difference between the undergraduate and graduate FBI program? Are they pretty much the same?

I learned a great deal over the summer and the fall which I greatly appreciate but as the end of my co-op program approached, I started to wonder what the long-term goal was for myself at the company as I didn't really receive confirmations on a full-time position or where I would be after I graduated.

I was offered a full-time position in early January, effective immediately at the commencement of my program, which I was ecstatic about initially. When I had viewed the offer letter, I realised that they weren't looking to pay me more. Instead they offered myself and the other intern that was in the same sector but different department the same ""position"" and equal pay, but at a lower pay rate than what we had as interns and during the co-op program (that we both partook in). 

Reading the offer letter, I was dumbfounded and unsure if I wanted to take this offer but I said yes over the phone as I was focused on a project and wasn't interested in the distractions from the phone call. I look back at this now roughly a little more than a month past my acceptance of the offer and I'm rather discouraged from staying any longer. 

The reasons I'm considering turning in my two-weeks notice is over a few various reasons. This reason is mostly my fault but I'm working rather difficult hours due to the way I had set up my schedule as I was unsure if I would have received a full-time offer at the end of my program. The amount of care that they expect me to put into the work that I do (over school at times) puts me in a very sour spot as I prioritise school over all else as I want to graduate on time and not risk taking an extra semester or even year. 

One of the larger reasons for why I am considering my resignation is that I also feel that my pay is vastly lower than what I had set for a graduated/full-time offer goal, especially with the amount of work that I do and the responsibilities that I've been given. I'm currently under a team that's conducting a large project in order to increase efficiency and capitalize on potential capacity. This project is in its second phase now, with myself having conducted a large majority of the planning and execution of the first phase over my fall semester. With the amount of hours that I had put in over the fall, I would think that any full-time offer would be met with more praise and benefits but it led to the same offer that my peer received (though for the record I don't know to the extent of what my peer has done completely over our internship and program. We've both equally slacked here and there when there was some downtime though).

I'm also trying to conduct myself professionally with my supervisors and managers, but generally I get treated poorly (in my opinion). There seems to be a lot of favouritism and/or leniency towards my other intern who is of the other gender (which I'm not sure if there's any relevancy here). I somewhat get bashed fairly often in the office when I'm working and often times it has gotten to the breaking point where I will walk out or send a snide remark back. This has contributed to why I personally do not enjoy the work environment and has been a very large factor in my consideration of resignation.

Overall, I was very enthusiastic with learning and even planning and conducting the projects and tasks I was given. I truly appreciate all the learning opportunities that they gave me but I feel like over time the feeling has diminished with poor attitude and etiquette from the people that I work in a close environment with. The pay has also led to some questioning as I feel that I will be low-balled heavily upon graduating and it's not a location that I think I'd be interested in working at upon graduation anyways.

Would anyone have any suggestions? I don't currently have a full-time offer for graduation readily available for me to take up and accept as of right now but I've been planning to apply to more places in the near future. I'm just nervous about not graduating with an offer and being a disappointment to my parents and family, but I also have my priorities in school and my own health and happiness which comes to much friction when I'm working at this company."

A little bit about myself: I'm currently a Junior studying Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle, I transferred to the school last year from a community college. I was not born in the U.S, and I'm not an international student, I'm just a green card holder.

As you see from the title, I couldn't find internship for upcoming Summer 2020, and I'm graduating in Spring 2021 which is really stressing me out because I know it is almost impossible to get a job in Tech Industry without having an internship. I started preparing for internship searching in September 2019, so far I've been to a couple career fair, apply to almost 200 companies, but I got nothing. All I've received was rejections and some coding challenges which even when I solved them all, I still don't hear back from the recruiting team.  Although the workload at school is pretty heavy, I've done about 100 leetcode problems so far, I did one internship for a small startup in Seattle. On my resume, I put one personal project and one class project. 

What makes me really me sad is that I couldn't even have an interview, it feels like I don't have chances to show people what I've got. I'm stuck in this cycle of tiredness and exhaustion, I don't know what to do to even get one interview. I'm not doing well in school, I can't eat, I'm lack of sleep, I always have headache, and other problems in my life is killing me. I love coding, the passion for CS and family is what keeps me going this far, but to be honest I'm totally lost now. I don't want to give up, but feels like I can't move forward. I just want to scream and cry, but I can't, I still need to act fine because I have other people relying on me. It's already February now, and it seems like I won't get any Internship for this Summer 2020.

If anyone has been in the situation like I am right now, please give me some advice. Otherwise, thank you for reading my post and listening to my story."

I am 25 and I am finishing my internship in a company as an junior IT Support. Unfortunately I can't stay in the company because 1st they don't have the money for another guy, 2nd and most important I have another person from my family and they don't allow that.

My supervisor was really helpful and friendly from the first day, trying to teach me and show me everything he can. He was supportive and pushed me hard in order to be able and express myself and act like a professional.

I want to buy him a gift as a ""thank you"" for these 6 months, but I don't really have an idea what to buy.

He is at his early thirties, tech guy of course. He likes movies a lot. I would prefer something to put in his office. I was thinking a funky pop or something like that with a budget of around 40e.

I graduate in May with a B.S in Biomedical Engineering from an ABET accredited university in the US. I was contacted by a consultant for this start-up company on LinkedIn saying she wished to gauge my interest in a position. After a phone call she informed me that the position is at a start-up company that has been around for 6 years. I answered her questions and then took an online personality test, and my would be boss wanted to give me a phone interview. I guess the interview went well enough, because I received an email requesting an on-sight interview. I don't know what exactly the interview will entail, but I assume I will  be introduced to some of the staff and meet the manager that I would be working for. The position has had a bit of high turn over, as some people in this position have decided to move onto medical school, didn't like the position, and ""got offered their dream job elsewhere."" I am hesitant because I hear a lot of start-up horror stories and people being out on their ass after a month of employment. I have 4 internships and a decent GPA, so I am not too worried about finding a job, but am unsure if given an offer, if I should jump at it quickly.

Don't know what to do with my life...,Mongrel06,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f2tmth/23m_going_through_the_motions_in_university_dont/,"I'm a 23M studying computer science at university and I don't know what to do with myself at this point in my life. Growing up, I don't think I've ever had any sense of direction as to where I wanted to take my life - I just always assumed that when I got older it would suddenly hit me, that I would one day find something to be driven toward. But here I am almost halfway toward my thirties - aimless, unmotivated, unambitious.

The reason I chose this major is because it was the only one I was mildly interested in, but I find that I don't seem to have as much of a passion for it as many of my peers. Many of them have extra experience with programming, have gotten internships or are atleast discussing what kinds of companies they want to work for once they graduate. But thinking about what I want to do with my life after university terrifies me, I have nothing to look forward to once I graduate.

The only reason I decided to go to college was because my parents were going to pay my way and I knew that if I didn't keep doing something after highschool, I would stagnate and become a useless person. And I've come to realize that my prime motivation to perform adequately through my studies is fear of failure - fear of letting my parents down, of wasting all that they've invested in me. For many of my peers, university is a stepping stone toward some goal in their life, but for me it's just something I'm doing to stave off failure - stagnation.

Last semester I struggled and endured a lot of stress just to pass my courses by the skin of my teeth and now that the new semester has started, I've found that my tolerance to endure more stress like that is dwindling. The new semester has started and already assignments are piling up, but I can't find the drive to do them. I just shirked off 2 homework assignments and a project because I rather play videogames and pretend that they don't exist.

Sorry if my issue is pretty vague or complex. I'd appreciate any wisdom or advice you guys could empart on me."

Hello everyone.

I have a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. During my studies, I have taken,among other courses, DSP , SSP, Image Processing and Numerical Analysis and loved all of them after learning the theory and having some basic practical labs.

After some digging and basic experimentation I decided on getting into computer vision. Sadly I won't be able to find a job or internship for at least a year and a half, due to some unfortunate circumstances that are beyond my control.

I do , however, want to seriously get into the field and I am willing to work hard and learn a lot. I would love to hear about your recommendations for resources - books, videos, courses, free or not - I want to learn the field theoretically ( I have no problem with the math) , and to get practical experience. What are the prerequisites I need (Image processing, programming , statistics etc.) to be fluent? What are the practical tools and what is the equipment that I might need?"
f2y53n,6,2020-02-12,Think I bombed my phone interview,wayfaringstranger2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f2y53n/think_i_bombed_my_phone_interview/,"So I don't think bombed is the right word, but I really feel bad right now. I'm a 21 year old college student studying IT. I went into college undeclared, and only recently went into IT, so I've only taken a handful of major related courses, and don't have a ton of experience coding and such, however I'm am more than willing to learn. 

My mom has worked at a company for nearly 20 years, and they offer an internship. I actually know someone else who's parent works there, and he got the same internship last year, and he isn't even going to school in a related subject. Based on all I've heard, it seems like a basic knowledge of coding is good enough to work there, and especially for an internship, you don't need to be a genius in programming. You just need to learn how to do what they do, which is a specific thing.

Anyway, the interview was a phone interview with two people who know my mom. It lasted a half hour, and was very awkward. They asked me plenty of questions I didn't think they'd ask, and my answers were mostly convoluted. They asked me what my favorite class was so far. I couldn't really think of one, so I just said my intro to C class, cause it made me realize that coding wasn't so scary. They asked me to elaborate on some projects we did, like maybe the final project for the class, and I blanked and could barely remember any specifics of the assignments in the class. After pretty much every answer I gave, there was seconds of silence, with one of them finally speaking up to just ask me to clarify something, or to explain my answer more. They seemed either unimpressed by my answers or confused. 

Maybe I'm just beating myself up because I don't have a lot of interview experience, but I think I kind of messed up a really good opportunity I had because I was too awkward, and just didn't really give them the answers they were looking for. Is this all in my head, or does this sound like I really just didn't do that great?"

I need some advice here.

I applied for a scholarship in my country that only funds MSc programs (except MBAs) so I also applied to a MSc in Finance at London Business School. Last week I received some news, my application for the scholarship was declined but I was invited for the MSc at LBS.

A little bit about my profile:

I have a major in business management from the best business university in my country (Peru). I have passed the 3 CFA exams. I've worked in small companies, in a brokerage firm (trader/portfolio manager - 1.5y) and currently in a family office (Credit risk analyst - 1.5y), besides having worked as an intern for 2y also for small firms.  


Overall, I think my professional career has not been successful, I have had trouble with interviews (failed probably about 50, not joking) and never landed on a job I wanted, also my salary is below-average since I just took whatever chance appeared.

My question is the following: Should I pursue this opportunity at this time of my career? I mean, I will have to ask for a loan to fund it right now, at the beginning I just wanted it because it would be ""free"". I know education isn't going to find you a dream job but studying in a famous college would be a nice chance, however I'm terrible with interviews. If I couldn't land on a nice job in my country how I can hope to get a good one abroad?.

Also, I'm wondering if this is the right moment because I could just wait 2-3 more years and apply for an MBA, cost will be a bit higher but MBA are better appreciated aren't they? I don't know if it's okay now to ask for a loan that is going to be huge for me (I made around $20k a year).

Sorry for the long post, looking forward to your insights.

Thanks guys!"

I would love recommendations for a wide range of fields, not just the typical ones you see in this sub (i.e. SWE or Data Science at FAANG).  While those are certainly most welcome, I'd love to see recommendations for fields where CS is still in demand but is slightly less mainstream as well, for example Quant Trading or literally anything else which could be interesting.

I'll start it off with some seemingly cool places which I've applied to, and hopefully you guys can help add to the list:

I am interested in applying for the CS Ph.D., specifically for Computer Vision research (I have a professor I would like to work within my mind).

If any of the current Ph.D. could answer the following questions, it would be much appreciated.

1. How competitive to get into the CRCV at UCF? I get my bachelor of CS (honours) in a Canadian University with an 8.42/9.00 GPA (or 90.1%) overall, and my GRE is decent (Quantitative 168, Verbal 152, Writing 3.5). What can I improve in terms of grades to get admitted?
2. How is the funding package for international Ph.D. students? I have noticed UCF offers admission and funding separately so it would be nice to know the general package beforehand. :)
3. Do you need publications for admission? I have been working as a research intern at a University lab for almost a year in computer vision research. I may not have a publication on a top CV conference, but a first co-author for a conference (more like an abstract because it is three pages) and the fifth author for a journal (if they all get accepted lol).
4. Do you enjoy the research in CRCV? I think CRCV is a very prestigious place to do CV research but it would be nice to hear the actual feeling of current Ph.D. students.

Thanks so much for answering my questions!"

I'm just wondering what you all think are some relevant ideas for simple GitHub projects that's at least something to put in my GitHub?

I've been learning online about Python and I want to put at least something on my GitHub so I can show employers that I'm competent. I'm trying to get an internship for this summer somewhere in my area. I think that my resume is very strong, even though I don't have much work experience.

f32x46,3,2020-02-12,How would you handle very large uploads on not so great internet connection?,manicmeteor,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/f32x46/how_would_you_handle_very_large_uploads_on_not_so/,"Hello y'all, I am an intern at a railway company and I am working with two other people on creating a website where users would be able to upload very large data sets (entire folders at a time that can go anywhere from 100 MB to 5 TB). Additionally, most of the time these uploads are being done from remote locations without great access to the internet so a very nice thing to have would be to somehow allow the user to resume an upload in case it fails.

So far I have looked into a few Node JS packages including Formidable and Multer although I have not seen any testaments from people who used them for very large file uploads (and as I understand Formidable is limited to 500mb/s which is a bummer for those users at an office with Gigabit connections). Alternatively,  we could use the ASP.NET method CloudBlockBlobStorage.UploadFromStreamAsync which integrates nicely with Azure. However, not a single a person I know as used this so I don't know how it performs.

In general, I am just asking for your recommendations. Do you have any sort of experience with uploading large files? Is it possible/worth it to provide the ability to resume an upload?"

Every time I try to make a connection with someone I am ultimately shut down and only feel to have acquaintances.

I do not hang out with anyone after class or have any social interaction after that besides here on the internet. I haven't made any true connections with anyone since I was young.

All the friends I have had only use me to fulfill there time and throw me under the bus when the chance arises.

I have this underlying sadness and lack of confidence because of all this. I am graduating from college soon and I feel an emptiness greater inside me than ever before.

I feel there is something fundamentally flawed with me or society that I will never understand.

I usually am first to talk with people to try to make friends. I get close to them and they see my weaknesses and use them against me. I usually do not make fun of others, even jokingly. But you know that's how MEN make conversations RIGHT! I have never been able to be like that and people have told me I am too nice.

I had a great internship this past summer at first, then I was confronted by an employee who said he felt bad for me and told me to cut my wrists.

I have had many jobs in the past where people were just bullies and have had coaches on teams I played in the past solo me out.

People being cowardly and saying harsh words the day before I left jobs or teams to move onto the next things in my life.

My own father and younger brother calling me a loser a few years ago in front of my family for not having any friends.

My older sister who labels me as the shy, anti-social brother to everyone she brings over.

Neighbors that are friends with my parents who have talked to me and tell me how their kids are better than me when I am by myself.

I am not suicidal, I want to see how the world evolves and I would never do that to my youngest sibling as well as my mom.

What is wrong with this world, I can hold my problems inside but it seems as most people I meet can not."

f33twl,1,2020-02-12,I am moving to another place that I don't know that well and this is my plan.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f33twl/i_am_moving_to_another_place_that_i_dont_know/,"I am a US citizen. Over 40. $150,000 in student loan debt. Just recently went through bankruptcy. Divorced. Recently became a convicted violent felon....

My life was on track and I had no problem paying off the student loan. I made a lot of money doing something I loved. Then I was screwed over by my ex-wife. I cheated on her and she ruined my life. If you have read the book or watched the movie Gone Girl, similar thing happened to me. I was wrong to cheat on her which fueled her hatred of me, but I am not sure I deserved to lose everything. Still, it was my fault.

It has been over two years and after 6 months in jail, I finalized my bankruptcy and I have about $10,000 left to restart my life. I can't get the jobs that I once had. I used to work in a mid-sized corporation making $80,000 a year and on my way to that six figures. My degree was unrelated to my previous line of work and it was in social work, so I can't use that for specialized jobs. My resume is filled with years of steady work and volunteering at charities for many many years, but that information is useless with my new label as an ex-convict.

I have worked as a server for a few months now to get by. Due to my good behavior, my 7-year probation will end in 3. I have never had a temper or violent tendencies or other criminal records. I was just pushed to the limit and my reaction was recorded on tape and used against me. In the past 40 years of my life, I had never gotten angry, but this one instance practically ruined my life. I was driven to a breaking limit and it was very obviously orchestrated, but I broke the law. At least I didn't have to go to prison for 5 years. I was given 9 months in jail, released in 6 for being good. I really enjoyed teaching other inmates GED materials and other life skills. Read a lot.

I am moving to one of the EU countries. I have a friend from college/work that can get me a visa in his country through his company for at least 10 years. He has seen me work and I am very professional when it comes to work ethics. It doesn't pay very well, but I should make about $30K a year to start. But without the $1500/month student loan payment, I don't see an issue.

I have a year left on my supervised probation. State of Iowa is tough on criminals, but the judge and the probation officer has been good to me as I have been a model inmate and probationer.

I am finalizing my bankruptcy. I owe over $60,000 in CC debt. Legal bills mostly.

I have 2 undergraduate degrees (dual major). Most of my debt came from 2 years of master’s degree program that I was getting ready to finish. I had 2 semesters left when this happened. I can't finish the degree because I can't get licensed or do the required internship because felony excludes any places I can go to volunteer.

Thought about taking on another graduate degree, but as I have no intention of paying back, it would be considered a fraud now. While I am a criminal now, I still am hesitant to break the law. I could rack up another $60K in student loans for another graduate degree I can't use in the US.

I make about $4 per hour plus tips now working as a server in a small restaurant that I was willing to overlook my past. I can't pay the $210,000 I owe. I am going to leave and never come back. There's nothing left for me here. I have 2 children that I can't see because of a court order for another 4 years. I can't afford the cost to visit the supervised visitation place allowed as I don't have a vehicle to get me that far and I can't really afford the $100+ taxi fare anymore. No public transportation goes there and I have to work weekends so I can't do the 2 hour walk there and the court only allows visits at their mother's convenience. This place was intentionally picked out of my reach. It kills me that I can't see them, but what good is a father who can't give them anything but grief and look of failure. I used to live on revenge, but I love my children too much to hurt their mother. Besides, I am not sure I can do it anyway. I am way more depressed than angry.

What money I have left, I will use to resettle in another country. I can get by for another year working at this restaurant. Thank goodness that I could find that job. Most places don't hire violent felons. I understand that it is risky for their business. I have been violent once in my life. But it is what I am to others.

I know it looks bleak for many and that's what drove you to search out this sub-reddit. It may seem like the bottom can't give out any further, but I wanted to share my story to let you know that maybe you have it better than I do. Not being able to vote reminded me that I can no longer be a citizen in the country that I held dear. Being ripped away from my children out of spite made me really hate myself. Not being able to pay back what I owe made me feel even more worthless. This is my story of why I am leaving. I hope you have a better luck with your life. Don't become a failure like me. I will die in a foreign land somewhere with the long-forgotten memories of my children whom I loved more than my life but I will never see again.

And for those that are wondering how I can leave my children….

I currently live in a group home. I can't rent any place as every place is owned by a company and they do background checks. The list for housing for people like me have a long waitlist. If I didn't have this job, I wouldn't be able to afford this group home. If I don't have an address, I can't get jobs. Can't imagine being able to afford a house anytime soon.

I figure this life is going to continue until I get hurt or otherwise disabled. I don't see more than 15-20 years of hard labor. By then, background checks will be mandatory even to become a criminal....

What good is a father that can't provide for his children? If I barely scrape by only to reach a point that I can't.....then what? Would I beg my children to feed me? Never. I wasn't able to give them anything and I would rather end it all than to be a burden on them. If I stay here, there's nothing guaranteed for me. If I leave and save for the next 10 years, I can give my children $50,000 each for college or to live a life. I have carefully calculated this amount and it is feasible. I don't expect forgiveness for not being around and I don't need anything in return, but I need to provide them with something because I want to be a father to my children. My ex-wife thought she could take this away from me to hurt me, but I refuse to accept it.

If it weren't for them, I would have just ended it all. I want to do this because I need them to know that I care for them. There will be years in between where I will seem worthless. I don't want them to live their lives believing that."
f3463t,0,2020-02-12,Why and when do companies drug test?,asstRegionalManager6,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f3463t/why_and_when_do_companies_drug_test/,"I'm a CS student looking for a software engineering internship. I'm from a state where marijuana is not legal for recreational use. I recently had a career fair at my university and one company in particular seemed to like me. They gave me an interview, everything went smoothly, and if I had to guess I'd say I have a pretty good shot at the offer. There's a catch, though - if given an offer, I would have to pass a drug test before working for said company. 

I'm not a heavy smoker. I'm a football fan who lives in the US, and on Saturday mornings I like to wake up, smoke a bowl, and watch the Premier League. I turned 21 a couple months ago. Sue me! I also like to work hard and learn as much as I can during the week. I really don't see what's wrong with taking a load off for a couple of hours and doing something I enjoy. 

I don't understand why the company insists on making candidates drug test before starting work. Marijuana is legal in 11 states now I think. Employees aren't tested for alcohol, right? Why should they be tested for marijuana now that it's legal? 

That brings me to my next question. In states where marijuana is legal, do companies drug test their interns? It seems like it would be even more ridiculous for them to test then. I was thinking if companies in states where it's legal don't drug test, I would just decline the offer and look for internships elsewhere. But...

I know that the CORRECT answer is to stop smoking weed so that I can pass any drug test that comes my way. I am not looking for ADVICE, as I understand this concept. I'm wondering why it's so necessary for companies to drug test, especially now that marijuana is legal, and I'm wondering if companies in legalized states still test."

Sorry if this type of post isn’t allowed, I just discovered it. I am having a tough time figuring out the direction I’d like to take my career and how to even make that final step. My degree is Math Econ with a Stats minor.

So far, I’ve been flown out by 3 companies for Super-Day interviews (These are within Banking, Management/Economic consulting firms), thought I performed well at the last round and still no dice on the offer. 

I have internship experiences in Continuous Improvement, Wealth Management, and a short stint at a startup looking at advertisement data. 

It feels like I have a solid education and work background, as well as an extroverted personality given my more quantitative background. 

I’ve had success networking with people within the companies I’ve applied, but have struggled again in the final “fit” interview after performing well in the first 3 stages. 

Looking after graduation, I’m open to all kinds of entry positions in many industries in Chicago- Consulting, Banking, Analytics, Advisory, Research Analysts, etc. 

My main questions are how can I best equip myself to lock in the last interview, how do I find more true entry level positions, and how do I get managers to resonate with my resume that I’ve been told looks pretty solid?

Any advice helps, I appreciate it."

I'm a bootcamp grad. It's been 7 or 8 months since I finished and I've applied to hundreds, probably 1000+ jobs. I am not the best programmer by any means (I have a business degree, worked for FAANG for a number of years on the business side), but Ive had an embarrassingly low return rate.. 2 on-sites, &lt; 10 coding challenges, maybe 30 phone screens at most.

It sucks because these fucking recruiters are so shit at their jobs, whenever I even get an invitation for a phone screen, I already know ill do my pitch, talk about myself, pretend to be curious and passionate about their company by asking questions, etc. , But I expect a rejection email after that I don't have the experience. Cool. Thanks for wasting my time. Not like you didn't have access to my resume beforehand.

I know project-based coding challenges are annoying for many on this sub but I want more. I like the practice, but no one will give me a fucking chance. Just discourages me because I'm barely getting on-site experience so if and when I finally do get another one I'll be just as nervous and not confident as my first 2.

Forgot to mention I'm in a highly congested and saturated area with a ton of competition, so while there are many jobs (hardly ANY junior level), there's a bunch of CS grads or mid level engineers outshining me. Also, i have invested time and money into this career change so I dont want to settle for Solutions/Technical Support Engineer roles. 

I can't even get a fucking internship lmao. I'd work for free at this point for the experience to build up my rep and shorten this ever growing gap on my resume.

f396ev,1,2020-02-13,Help me understand his perspective. Boyfriend's best friend doesn't want to be friends with me anymore?,floraell,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f396ev/help_me_understand_his_perspective_boyfriends/,"Hi all, This is going to belong, but I wanted to give all the basics and make sure I didn't leave anything out. I do ask to refrain from any mean/rude comments, this is a genuine question and a situation I want to fix and want everything to go back to normal if I can do so. However, I just want to understand their side more.

So my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. Naturally, I met some of his best friends and honestly, we all hit it off. It was really great how well we all got along and we had an older brother little sister type of friendship since they're all older than me by four years. I'm 22 and they're 26ish. One of his friends, who happens to be my boyfriend's best friend, we will call him Caleb, would joke that he was my uncle and it was a funny thing that we all bantered about. Whenever I say we all got along well, we really did and it was super chill and fun and goofy.

Well Caleb has a business, and I'm still a student but beginning to start my own business as a freelancer. I told him I could help him do some stuff for him. I ended up developing his website and then began creating a social media plan for them. About four or five weeks ago, they (Caleb and his brother) wanted to meet in person and we could discuss the final details for the website and then start on the social media stuff. I said sure, during this time, I was extremely stressed out with college, my internship and my mental state (i was having slight outbursts here and there that was between me and my boyfriend which we were working through). So eventually, Caleb and I agreed on a time 9:30 at a coffee shop we always went to, me, my boyfriend and Caleb, to hang out. He agreed. I stressed hey, I have a lot of homework and stuff I need to do that day so please make sure you're on time. He said bet.

The day comes, I call him and ask when he's left, he said he and his brother were leaving. I said when will you arrive and he said he hadn't googled maps it yet. I said okay cool. I stress to him again please be on time this morning and he says bet i gotchu see ya soon. Me and my boyfriend left, and I wanted to get their a little earlier because my laptop was dead and I needed to charge it and I wanted to have everything prepared by 9:30. We get there and and me and my boyfriend are chilling, but 5 mins turns to 10 and 10 turns to 15 and 15 turns to 20 and suddenly, it's 35 minutes and Caleb and his brother still aren't here. I'm getting fucking annoyed, (I grew up in a military family and punctuality is everything.) But I'm trying to remain calm and I'm trying not to be upset or annoyed because that's Caleb and yknow I don't wanna be mad at him.

He eventually texts me saying he's going to be 20 minutes late and now I'm already more annoyed because he had told he he was leaving, and now it 10:00 and he's going to be almost an hour late. I'm expressing to my boyfriend how rude and annoying it is especially because I was here to help and I kept telling him please be on time. Caleb shows up sits down and (before this I'd been texting him where he was, why he was late, what the story, he had a sick mother and frequently he can't hang out with us all the time so I was kinda worried something had happened to his other again, he'd been ignoring me). So he gets there, and we get into an argument because he's telling me I shouldn't be mad that he's late and I'm like .. don't tell me I don't have a right to be upset. Eventually, he tells me, if I'm going to bring bad energy to this meeting or this business, then he doesn't want me to work with him. We are still arguing and then he says well I don't want you to work with us anymore. At this point, I'm over it and I'm like okay bet. You've already wasted an hour of my time, and hour of our time working, now you're giving me attitude when I literally didn't do anything. Bet bro.

Fast forward, now, he doesn't want to talk to me. He apologized and said he was sorry. I apologized and said I was sorry for getting angry. He apologized to my boyfriend to, because my boyfriend expressed how it was kinda disrespectful to be an hour late whenever I was trying to help their business, especially for free and especially bc I'd asked for him to be on time, since im still a student and had other obligations. He said he had no reason to be late. He just woke up late and took his time getting ready. He didn' think it was a big deal to be late. He then expressed to my boyfriend, essentially he thinks it's best that Caleb and I don't really talk. This is weird bc Caleb and I goof around all the time and we chat and catch up on life, especially his relationship status bc he would ask for advice and stuff. Since then we literally haven't spoken. I've tried texting him to see how he's doing, he doesn't answer. He doesn't want to hang out. He says he's not mad at me, but thinks keeping his distance is best.

Which I just don't understand. We both apologized, we both said we are moving on. I would like to not constantly feel excluded whenever they make plans because we would usually all make plans together, and OF COURSE yes my boyfriend would hang out with his friends by himself too. My boyfriend told me it's nothing personal, but for some reason, I feel like it is. It's just so weird because occasionally we all hang out as a group with everyone's girlfriends and stuff and now I'm unable to do that or hang out with them.

I just want to be able to have everything back to normal. I don't want to feel awkward and uncomfortable. I feel like it's all my fault and I don't know how to fix it, and I don't really know what I did wrong either. My boyfriend keeps telling me not to worry about i and everything's fine, but everything is different now. Can you help me understand his perspective?"

I am really interested in studying CS to become a software developer.

Anyone here had success getting a CS degree from an online college? 

From researching this subreddit it seems that projects and internships are pretty crucial to land a promising job. Which I assume going to a traditional 4 year institution could possibly give.

Do companies care what college you graduated from and value one degree from x college over y college?

I would like to go down the educational route right the first time around. I was thinking of the possibility of going to a bootcamp vs. Online college vs. Traditional 4 year college.

The reason I am trying to validate the online college route is because I am currently residing outside of the US with my family. 

But if there is a person who has gone down this road and got an awesome career from it I would like to hear your story and any tips you can provide.

Thank you very much for your time."

My required internship for graduation turned out to be a programming internship where I had to work for free (since it was a non-profit), but ultimately I built something that is now in production. Currently I'm living in the DC area, and for moral reasons i don't want to work on anything that requires a clearance or working directly for the government. That being said, I'm building a side project that is military-adjacent in order to help friends of mine who are in the service. 

Due to a disability, I can't drive, and Uber costs are insane in some parts of the US. Not to mention the necessity of having a car in most cities. Ergo, I am heavily considering looking abroad. I have a few recruiters reach out to me every week about jobs related to React native, React, and broader webdev type of work, but in cities that I generally don't see as livable given my disability. Think Charlotte NC, some places in Ohio,  Kansas. I would never consider those places to be good for me, compared to Kiev, Riga, Berlin, Budapest. Growing up around NYC, I recognize how competitive it is and am not interested in sleeping on a couch in Queens for half a year as I look for work.   

In comparison, I have friends in Riga who are offering me 1.5kEuros a month, and a friend in Kiev who is American who is offering me around 2k Euros a month. Yeah, it isn't Berlin or New York, but it's work, right?

Is it inherently wrong to write off working in the US almost entirely, given my disability? I am aware salaries are higher here, but for those who have gotten out to work in the EU/Europe or considered it, how have things gone for you? 

I graduate in May, I imagine most companies are done hiring on new grads."

I am currently 24 years old, I graduated from a fairly standard university with my BS in ME that’s known for there engineering program. Got two internships over the course of my degree with the company I currently work for and am coming up on 2 years of full time employment. 

I am considering applying to an Evening MBA or Online MBA program (mostly since it is 75% paid for by the company I work for) and would like to hear some opinions on the benefits of each. I work a pretty standard 7-5pm with the exception of 4-6 weeks out of the year where I work 6-7pm or 7-8pm.

My weekends are normally free and I don’t have many obligations or financial responsibilities outside of my dog and my girlfriend who live with me. 

With all that said, I am also considering a Masters in Mechanical Engineering, as I don’t entirely hate engineering and do enjoy my work, but would prefer to be in a position with more project/supply chain management than simply doing calculations all day. 

Would anyone here be able to offer some experiences or advice on the avenue they chose, why they chose it, and how it has paid you back? 

Thank you."

Currently in IT. Learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript or go for a cloud certification and get into DevOps? Need career advice!

Resume: [https://imgur.com/gallery/u51h9wa](https://imgur.com/gallery/u51h9wa)

So I am currently an IT guy with a Bachelors in Computer Information Systems. I have spent the last few years working IT Support and come to realize I am not passionate about “IT” anymore. The thought of networking, servers, IT troubleshooting doesn’t really motivate me anymore. My next step in my career if I wanted to “move up” in the IT world would be a role like a Systems Admin. Googling the daily roles of a Sys Admin... doesn’t interest me at all to continue that path. That’s why I have wanted to pick up coding and use my support background to pair with to make a career advancement/change.

At my current company I have recently started helping out on the Software/Application Support team. This team has a lot of Tier 1 type questions but most of the knitty gritty stuff gets escalated to the Engineers and Developers. Seeing what they do, I find that doing coding work like that is WAY more interesting then my job managing the network and server administration stuff.

I like the company that I am at and believe if I started to learn more about Web Development and picking up some coding skills - I could get some opportunity to help out. I came across an old job listing for an “Implementation Engineer” at my company and some of the requirements are knowledge with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and JSON/XML API’s. Also knowledge with PHP and SQL was a plus.

I also was thinking of grabbing an AWS or Cloud certification and going down more of a DevOps Route... or into cloud. I have read that this is a pretty common transition for people in IT. This may be a little more of a learning period but DevOps jobs are growing. I am willing to study for these AWS or Azure certs like crazy in my free time.

I am torn between which route I should take. If I go the HTML/CSS/JavaScript route, I am just a little weary for my long term career. I have a great opportunity in THIS current company, but I am not sure down the road if I were ever to leave this company - I don’t know if I would want to just be a Web Developer full time. I also am confused because if I spend all my free time studying DevOps / Cloud stuff - then I am missing an opportunity at my current company to potential move up in to a higher role and i’ll Be stuck doing low end Tier 1 / Help Desk style stuff. I am really interested in cloud technology and know in the future there will be a ton of jobs that are both available and lucrative - but just a little hesitant because of the opportunity in my current role.

Can anyone help me out? This is my first job out of college so I am really looking to start making advancements in my career and picking up new skills. I just wanted to get someone else’s opinion or someone that has been in a similar situation. I have a pretty decent resume with 3 good internships on it plus a Bachelors (plus my current role at a established SaaS company) - so I know adding some coding skills will make me more marketable then just a typical “IT fix-it guy”.

All responses are really really appreciated. I am very grateful for everyone’s honest opinions. Thanks!

TLDR: Should I learn web development skills to potential move up in my current support role, or learn DevOps to get a new job in the future — all to move out of IT

I am applying to an internship at this company that I really really want to work at for the summer. I read up on everything I can about this company, follow it on the news, and met some of the workers for food to talk about the interview process, how its like to work there etc. And my background and interests are good match for the role and the culture, from what I know anyways.

The recruiter reached out to me to schedule to what I assume was a second round interview, and I provided them with a time window to call me. A very large window over 2 days. I was literally so nervous about this call that I kept studying up on my material and whatever else I could find. No Call. So I emailed them to reschedule. The recruiter was very apologetic and nice about it. And we rescheduled. Again, same thing, no call.

This went on for 5 TIMES over about 2 month. Normally, I would've walked away after the 2nd time, but I really want to work for them, I know it sounds like they are bad, but its not what the people who actually work there told me. AND I asked them about this situation, and they are as confused as I am :( 

Anyway, maybe its just not meant to be? 
Is this the recruiters' way of telling me to walk away?
Or maybe I should just relax and wait another month or two? 
I already have offers on the table, but I am not passionate about those jobs compared to this one :("

So 10 YEARS AGO I got bacteria poisoning in one of the hotels we went with school with (along with 200+ other kids) and at some point in time this lawyers steps in to represent all of us pro bono and a lot of the families signed the power of attorney at that time which my family and I NEVER did. 2 years ago they called my mom 4x a day to come and sign hers (which she didn’t). And Today they realized I’m of legal age now and they wanted ME to come and sign that document, so I went there with my step fathers dad who’s a reputable lawyer here and luckily we talked with one of the interns that didn’t know him so he didn’t mention that he’s a lawyer (he was going there as my grandpa cus my parents are at work).....They failed to prove the poisoning with 2 independent labs checking the hotel (someone payed those off) They apparently got an offer from the opposing side for settlement in which “we all need to sign the power of attorney document and we would all be given 200-1000e depending on us just being there or ending up in a hospital)””, The offer was not showed or given any power in court it was between the 2 sides, so my “grandpa” asked about the legal fees to which she answered “We’ll deal with that later”. When we gave them a CLEAR NO The woman told us “I will then have to take this as you rejecting the settlement and that you want to continue fighting the other side, and it basically means ur rejecting 1000e but you know you’ll have to pay legal fees anyway” to which I jumped in and said “OH..Sorry...Based on what exactly?, Like I said my mom doesn’t even know where’s your office and she NEVER signed anything for you and I was a MINOR so I clearly hadn’t signed off anything either....” -“Was it maybe your dad?” -“No, My mom divorced him when I was 2 he is in a different city” -“Well you know we could NEVER represent you without a document, the court would never let that happen and I do have your power of attorney papers signed I can send them to you if you want” -“Please do” (I would LOVE to see my signature forged and you basically proving me that u illegally represented a minor in the court of law). I think this 1000e “offer” is just a way for them to get a couple of parent’s signatures they miss to get out of falsely representing us for 10 years in court.......and now thinking about that I was wondering if there would be any good options to check on that and sue them maybe (they didn’t send the document that they apparently “have”) and Wanted to hear your thoughts."

So I come from a biomedical sciences background and did a bootcamp in Java and a bit of frontend technologies. 

Currently I have two job proposals: one in a small company for an internal project. The impression I got from the interview is that the management is demanding but they will give good mentoring. Of course you can never tell until you are there but that's what I felt. The position is for Angular for now with possibility of changing in a couple of months. There's a possibility of being alocated to an external outsourcing project though they make the effort to avoid that the consultant will have to work with boring technologies for a long period. The salary won't change in the next 9 to 12 months and it's an internship program. The internship has yet to be approved but the chances of approval are high I think.

Then I have another with a french multinational consulting company who does mostly outsourcing. I met the client and the position they offer is for tester, particularly automation of tests.

I worked with the consulting company before and know how it works. Its the typical big company, I don't expect they will necessarly care about what I like or not and take that into account if I ask to change to a different project (they say they have an internal mobility program but not sure if it is just propaganda or if it really works). I also don't expect to have a lot of tutoring from the manager, not sure about the client side. I think they don't ask for a lot of extra hours in this project. They pay roughly more 20% than the other company. 

However I will start a part time at some weekends to cash in some more money, but in the first offer i can not have this part time for more than 2/3 months because it is not compatible with internship rules. This part time will be roughly more 20 to 35% of my full time salary. I am not sure how long I will do it I am planning 4-5 months. If I can endure the work rythm then I will do it more months. 

What i want is 1) to learn so that I become confident that I am doing a good job and so that in the future i can work with good projects and eventually freelance 2) to save the most money possible so that i can invest in more training and so that in the future money is no longer an issue when considering my professional options.

I intend to stay around 12 to 18 months in the company I choose and then seek a position abroad or try to get some more training in other areas such as data science by attending a post graduation or taking online courses. I am also considering enrolling part time in the computer science course of a faculty nearby if its possible (its relatively cheap, with one month of the part time, I'd pay the entire tuition of one year at the course, part-time. Two months and I'd pay the entire year). 

The first proposal is more unstable contractually speaking and the value is lower. However I fear that being a tester will limit me to always be a tester and I won't be able to jump to developer or Business Intelligence positions due to the lack of a degree in computer science. I am also afraid the tutoring won't be good in this last one because its a big company. The manager from the smaller one seemed more pragmatic but as I said I don't know until I am there obviously. They also mentioned I can work from anywhere as long as I deliver the final product. Though lets be fair, as a junior I will have to go the office at least in the first months. 

Also a 20% difference is already a bit, but what really concerns me is that I can't do the part time and I was counting on that extra money for some personal projects.

In this case is it worth to take a cut on stability/paycheck to have the chance to work in a smaller project potentially better managed and a more direct developer role? Or should I take the other position that's better well paid and then try to get something else 6 to 9 months from now if I am not satisfied?"
f3e62j,0,2020-02-13,Just missed test!,Jantonsoup,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/f3e62j/just_missed_test/,"So this semester I have been on top of everything. I haven't always been the most organized or focused, but recently I've gotten my things together, and was just starting to do good. I got into all the classes I needed to. I was doing my homework, wasn't procrastinating. I had all A's in my courses leading up to the first Exams. The exams come around last week, and I ace the first one. The next one comes for my math class, and I got a 100 on that. The next one for my cyber security class comes, and I study my ass off for that one. Don't know if I got an A or not, but I'm definitely proud of myself for how hard I studied for it, and I think I still did alright on it. Then the weekend came and I worked (Uber), since I hadn't had any time to work during the week due to exams. Sunday comes and I still have some assignments to do. I have some quick math, and then a big project I had sort of been putting off for my Java class. Nonetheless I took care of both of those assignments, and still felt pretty good. 

Then this week rolls around, and I start getting my test grades back. Felt pretty good being so on top of things, and seeing the results. That Java project even got extended, which made me relax even more, even though I had already finished it when it was originally due.

I've been working here for a few years now, but there isn't any room for advancement. 

Recently, I've been put into a new role temporarily (without extra pay) and I absolutely hate it. The workload is 3 times as much as it used to be, it's stressful, I have to report to a new manager, and I hate it. They want me in the new role till the end of May.

I want to learn new skills, apply for new jobs, etc., but I'm so busy and stressed out that I can't do that anymore. 

My option is to quit and start focusing on what I want to do, but there's a chance that I may not find another decent paying job again soon, specifically in the field that I want to move into (data analytics). Financially, it wouldn't be too much of a problem as I live with my parents, but I'm just scared that no one will hire me again. I've been applying to different roles these last few months, but haven't heard back at all. 

My other option is to try to stick it out during the next few months, and then hope that I'll have more time later on to study outside of work and apply for new gigs, but I'm not sure how much I can take this.

I don't know what to do honestly... I feel burnt out, I hate what I'm doing, and I'm not sure what I should do. 

Any thoughts or suggestions?"

Everything I've heard indicates that the CompTIA A+ isn't worth bothering with at this point. I'm more curious about whether the Network+ and Security+ are worth my time and effort, or if I'm better off just working on my MCSA server 2016 next (I'm planning on moving in a server / sys admin direction next, and then working on getting cloud certified after that). The time and money investment for getting these certs is significant to me as I live more or less paycheck-to-paycheck, and I'd like to upgrade jobs as soon as I can. So if I can get more done going straight for the MCSA then I'll do that, but if skipping the N+ and S+ leaves me at a significant disadvantage then I'll get those first of course.

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you in advance."

I didnt do it for the money but I just realized how completely and utterly fucked my life is now. I regret going to college, i cant even lie to students and say its worth it when they ask me.

Im on the road to depression. I dont want to be tied down to one thing my entire life but they got me. They tricked another child into giving their life.

College wasn't meant for poor people. Especially if you're white, good luck getting any help, because every scholarship I ever went for (and finding them was even more difficult) denied me.

I was hoping for a little advice. I’m currently a Masters student at an ivy doing CS. I had switched careers from a biomedical engineering job I had for the 5 years since I graduated college. I’m just in my second semester of my Masters program, but I have a 4.0. 

I have been applying to internships for the last 2 months to no avail. The vast majority I just never hear back from, and the majority of the responses I get are rejections. I’ve gotten 1 or 2 invitations to coding assessments. I seemed to do well on them, but nothing came of it.

I have done a few leetcode questions, but school work and work (I’m still working full time) have taken up a lot of my time. 

I’m wondering if this is a normal response. Is there something I should be doing that I haven’t been? How important are cover letters in applications?

I understand that I have switched careers and that I have little to no experience with coding via jobs, but these are internships. I am a masters student doing very well in my work. What else could they possibly be looking for in an intern? 

My primary languages are Java, C, Python. I started learning Java in college, like 7 years ago. 

I feel like I’m missing something big, given the number of rejections I have had so far. 

Any guidance would be helpful!"

Thing is, I'm now 2 months from graduation and obviously is too sudden to try and jump into another internship and get a job that route upon graduation. Given that's how most of my friends and fellow colleagues are getting into the workplace, however, I can't help but feel like this is the ""one true path"" towards work (obviously a skewed perspective) and am feeling a bit angsty with no concrete plan.

In your guy's experience, how hard would it be to land a job dealing with back-end, game design, etc. only having the one previous internship dealing with front-end work? Am I too worried about potential difficulty? When applying for jobs rather than an internship is it more expected that I have my shit together and there will be less guidance/job training?

I'm going back to school in the fall to pursue a BS in CS after several years as a public school teacher. 

Since I have a previous bachelor's degree, I can transfer in almost all of the gen. ed. requirements; I'll just have to do the courses for the major. I should be able to complete the degree in 5 semesters. Great, right?

My question is about the best use of the two summers I'll have during the program. Obviously, internships will be the best thing to shoot for. However, for next summer (2021), I would have to be applying for internships during my first semester of coursework, right? Doesn't seem like I'll have much knowledge/skill under my belt in order to be marketable. If I'm not able to secure an internship that first summer, what would be the best use of my time? 

I'm doing some online Udemy courses in mobile dev and Arduino-type stuff right now, maybe I can leverage some of that towards a first summer internship?

If I'm only able to get a single internship (during my 2nd summer in the program), will that be enough to help me land a job?

I've always had little problems here and there but apparently that was normal. However I had the worst social skills I had literally zero friends, even the people I thought were friends I have now realized that I just followed them around and they just accepted it but we rarely talked. 
Some time later shit hit the fan and I realized my supposedly normal life was actually full of abuse, isolation, drama and all the other issues that come along with that. 
I was now more alone than ever and have to deal with a myriad of problems at once. I actually made a little progress at first figuring out my temper triggers and fixing that and a few other little things, but it wasn't enough I was still lonely, I was jealous of ppl with friends, loving partners/parents, my colleagues goofing around with each other, I wanted love, attention, and hugs. I wanted all these, but they would always seem to resent that I'm there, look very bored or ignore me (sometimes they'd play fight but no one would touch me so I just sat there watching them (yes I did try to take part many times, what a weird company btw)). I soon began crying myself to sleep at night as my mom shouts at me for some shit, self harming, contemplating suicide all that good jazz, I was also informed I'd be kicked out. Now I'm truly alone I was so depressed I posted my housing predicament in my only group chat on WhatsApp, one of the company's groups which is populated by my only 5 contacts. 

Surprisingly they asked how I was but that ended there for now. An intern dm me and we became friends, she helped me through a rough time for a few months but the depression was still raging on and one day with tears in my eyes at work another approached me and we're all still friends till now. 

Even though I breakdown constantly am a complete mess and push them away sometimes they show me unconditional love and support. which is helping me and develop healthier attachments to them (did I mention I was/am extremely attached to them? ) Even their families have essentially adopted me showing the same unconditional love and support. They trust me so much around their children showing no signs of insecurity (in the cult I was in some families would make their kids avoid me especially girls even if we were the same age like I was some kinda rapist or something even though I weigh like 100 ponds and have noodles for arms ). Despite having nothing to offer  them, they keep helping as long as I keep trying. I've never loved anyone more I feel so safe... 

But why now why did no one care before?? Why do ppl only care about someone when they hear your life's a complete shit show?? And What happens when I'm okay or stable would they leave me and go to someone else?? What if I fail too often would they leave me or stick with me still??😭😭😭 I'm scared to ask them because I feel like that's manipulative towards them. Sometimes I feel like a selfish little shit for wanting to be around them all the time, or when I ask for attention (they say it's ok n I like hugs and validation but it seems so narcissistic if me sometimes).

I've had 5 previous jobs and I have a technology internship in London this year as well as an on-going role with another top company. I have the opportunity to travel across Europe for free this summer due to a random draw. I have presented in front of thousands through debates and speeches. I've gotten a first (70% or above, highest grade in UK university) in every coursework so far.

I still feel lacking though. I feel like I haven't done  enough for whatever reason. I feel like I'm not smart enough. I don't know if my exams went well. I feel like my CV isn't good enough. I feel like I've stagnated since entering university.

I don't have many friends, and I'm frankly ugly (a three at best). Most people in my accommodation don't care about me. My love life is absolutely dead, which is entirely my fault due to anxiety and my ugly frogface. I don't go to societies out of fear of being ostracized again and due to a lack of money. I don't have a life outside improving my CV or numbing myself with Reddit, YouTube and porn.

I'm so damn lazy. I feel so pathetic. I can't seem to change. Why do the words that fall out of my mouth not make sense? Why do I have to be so ugly and short compared to those around me? Why does my CV feel like shit? Why can't I work harder? Why can't I be accepted? Why am I so poor? 

I went to a rich place recently, and the people there were fundamentally different from me in terms of culture. Even at university, the people are fundamentally different. They talk about going to Disneyland and Norway for their 16th birthday or about their new £5,000 watch. They act civil and kind at all times. They are organised and clean. They have parents who work internationally for reputable companies. They're posh and don't wear muddy trainers. They don't live in a council house. 

I'm just always going to be an outsider I guess. I'm too stupid to act civil and kind all the time. Eventually I'll say something rude by accident or mess up my words and slip away. I'm 19 and I still get anxiety. I thought I was suppose to be a man now. I thought I'd be sorted out by now.

TLDR I just want to die."
f3jb8v,1,2020-02-13,Computer Science vs Information Technology,Table_Salt13,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f3jb8v/computer_science_vs_information_technology/,"Hello everyone,

For a very long time I've been stuck on this issue I have right now in my life, and I've exhausted a lot of resources that aren't giving me the answers that I feel can help me, or helping me shape a decision. I've turned to reddit, so hopefully you wise people out there can help.

I \[25M\] went to my local community college after I got out of the military to become a video game developer, and started studying computer science. This was in 01/2018. I ended up getting an intern job at a local video game development company, but things went south and I was laid off for lack of funding. During my time there, I started to second guess whether game design was something I wanted to do, simply because it wasn't a great experience.

I continued with the degree, everything went okay, but now we're here. 02/2020, and I just absolutely bombed my first Calculus test. Mind you, I should have graduated by now. I retook Precalculus II twice, having failed it twice, and I'm retaking Calculus I for the first time having failed it last semester. I am NOT by any means a math guy, and math is my absolute weakest subject.

Looking into the job market around my area, I'm noticing there are NO jobs for computer science majors, it's all pointing to information technology as basic helpdesk, computer repair, security analyst, etc. etc. Which I'm fine with. I like programming, I like building computers, I like fixing computers. I enjoy a mix of software and hardware.

I'm so close to graduating. I have to pass Calculus I, then the only two classes left are Statistics and Discrete Math. But I *cannot* pass Calculus. It doesn't click, the algebra doesn't come to me anymore, all the stuff I learned in precalculus I and II are just gone from my brain. I'm a terrible test taker, and I'm feeling like I'm stuck at this school and my life is on hold because of math. 

I've considered switching my major to Information Technology, or Information Technology with a focus in Cyber Security. I looked at the course lineups for said degrees offered at my school, and they're what I'm looking for: a mix of software *and* hardware, not just programming. There are 4 CS classes that CS students have to take at my school and all four of them deal in *strictly* Java. Computer Science I (Intro to Java), then Java I, then Computer Science II (advanced Java), then Java II. Java, Java, Java. All I've learned as a CS student is Java.

Granted, Java is an O.K. language, I've learned how to program. But I want to learn MORE about computers. I've built two in my life, with the help of peers. So how do I build them myself? What components are needed for the best outcome? How do I help Mr. NineToFiveJob when he calls the IT department because his computer isn't working? 

Here is my dilemma: I don't think CS is the right way for me to go with what I'm looking for in life. My second dilemma is I don't know what *that* is. Programming? Yes. Computer fixing? Yes. Building computers? Yes. Helping people with their problems with computers? Yes. If I dropped out of CS and switched to IT, there's 2 years and all that money down the drain. I'm literally *one* semester from graduating, but at what cost, if all I know how to do is program? Granted, a lot of my core requirement classes and CS classes *will* transfer over, but I'll be at the school for most likely another year, year and a half. I mean, not the end of the world but *all that money* *and time* down the drain if I dropped it.

So I'm at a loss. Financially, staying in CS makes sense. Logically, it makes sense. But I can't pass Calculus. I don't understand the math, no matter how much I've gotten help, it's not clicking. (My brother, who is a mechanical engineer and math whiz, says it's because I'm extremely right brain dominant and just don't think the way that's required to think for Calculus. Not a bad thing, that's just how I'm wired). I want to be able to graduate and move on to a 4 year college knowing I'll have the tools that will land me a job given a good interview. I want to know that all my hard work was worth it, and I want to keep moving forward to get to the light at the end of the tunnel, which is rapidly dimming. Calculus is the barrier that I just don't see myself getting over. What do I do right now?

Help me Reddit-wan Kenobi. You're my only hope."
f3jr6q,1,2020-02-13,I'm afraid I'm gonna lose all my incomes in March and I don't know what to do.,Homesandholes,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f3jr6q/im_afraid_im_gonna_lose_all_my_incomes_in_march/,"Hi there.  
A little about me: I'm Italian, so I'm sorry if my English is not that good. I work in the digital marketing field and after a few difficult years (internships, bad jobs, bad choices and no money) I decided to become a freelance in order to make my own ""fortune"". This decision came with the fact that an agency that worked with me asked me to be a freelance and assured me they would take care of me while I was still new to this world (meaning that I would have had their clients to start with).

This happened 8 months ago; in the middle I got sick and I had a surgery and I spent 2 months in bed. Meanwhile this agency started to lose clients because they don't really want to put an effort in their work and they don't support the client nor me, so my incomes became less and less by months as I was finding other clients very slowly since I was recovering and in a terrible mental state (my desease is chronical and the surgery didn't solve).

I kindly reminded the agency that I went freelance because they asked me to in the first place, they told me they have a lot of things going on and I have to be patient, and today they sent me an email at 18.00 saying that I lost another client (that decided to cut the contract because of their bad work on his site, but I got involved as a part of their team) - and my income right now just covers my rent and something more. The agency is trying to monetize without giving me work (they use their intern for that), but they asked my cooperation in the first place and they still talk me about new clients that don't seem to appear anywhere.

Right now I'm having interviews with other potential clients, I'm working hard to build a site without no money so I'm learning how to do that on my own, but without a decent income I'm not gonna be able to go much further. It's a shame because after my surgery I truly wanted to grow-up as a professional, but it takes some time to gain new clients, build a reputation and so on, and with this income I won't have this time.

Plus, in Italy is really difficult to find a job in a short amount of time and my mental health is fragile lately, so I really don't know what to do. My future seems so dark and I'm worried about what could happen.

Tomorrow I will talk to the agency, that doesn't seem concerned a bit about this, and I really just want to cry but of course I can't call them and cry.

So I'm writing here because it's night here, I'm not thinking straight and any advice on what to do, what to think and how to think positive would be really appreciated.

Thank you so much."
f3kwvg,0,2020-02-13,How to be more competitive for new grad positions in USA for an inexperienced Canadian?,donkeyconfuse,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f3kwvg/how_to_be_more_competitive_for_new_grad_positions/,"**Background:**

\- Canadian citizen

\- relativity unknown university (UBC), computer science degree, graduated in winter last year.

\- low grade (\~3.3)

\- only 1 internship (8 months), and a couple of trivial projects (typical CRUD).

\- have been applying mostly in Canada only, had some interviews here and there.

\- there were not that many entry level openings in Canada, so I have been applying to anything that has upto 3 yr exp.

\- want to apply to US because there seems more jobs. Applied a few but all rejected so far.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions regarding new grad applications in USA:**

Do companies that look for new grad in America hire people with little experience?

Should I enter GPA on the application/cv if it's low? (eg, 3.3)

Is personal project the way to go to improve my resume? Should I keep making things in a different languages to hit the ATS? Do recruiters even take a look at your github? I am asking because almost no recruiters/hiring managers have asked about them during phone/onsite. I Just want to gauge my time on leetcode vs project.

Do I say I need sponsorship on application? (which I assume is Yes... but I've heard some people say No because TN is easier to get...)

Should I always write a cover letter if it's optional? Should I indicate that I am Canadian in CV?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading my long list of questions."

Unfortunately two of the requirements which are familiarity with microsoft power suite and experience in database languages, I do not have. And so I told him I will contact him later about it this week.

Do you guys think I should still take a shot of asking to join? I am willing to learn everything I can before it occurs for the internship and if not that then, learn while interning."
f3lkuc,7,2020-02-13,Moving Shapes [Part 1],Hagmosh,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f3lkuc/moving_shapes_part_1/,"Hello everyone. My name is Penelope, but everyone calls me Penny or just Pen. I’ve been asked to go through my memories to release any unhealthy emotions that I’m “bottling up.” I know therapists are trained professionals and all that jazz, but let me state for the record that it’s perfectly fucking reasonable for someone in my position to have unhealthy emotions. I think if you lived my life and were skipping down the road smiling you would be a goddamn psychopath. Also, before getting started, If anyone from group is reading this, please do me a favor and kindly fuck off. Rat faced fucks.

Anyway, here we go. 

The first time I saw the shape was on a family trip to Marlborough Sounds. I was probably around eight or whatever age kids are when they start to form coherent imaginations. We had rented a small cabin east of Havelock near Moetapu Bay, which the parents had told us was the ‘authentic experience,’ but in retrospect was clearly to cut down on costs.

We bought fish &amp; chips and drove uphill to Mahua Sounds, finding this great tourist spot with a pair of mounted binoculars that swiveled around for an entire view of the bay. All us kids quickly devoured our food so we could play on the binoculars, but my scavenging older brothers made a game out of blocking my vision. The whole thing devolved into yelling and my parents had to kick them off so I could have a go. They immediately found some other nonsense to occupy their minds while I was left sulking on the binoculars by myself.

I didn’t want to talk to anyone so I stayed on them for what must have been hours, exhausting every last drop of my imagination. I pointed them at the water and imagined giant squids bursting out of the water to attack huge wooden ships coming into the bay. I imagined huge bubbles boiling over with majestic taniwhas weaving through the water as if the bay was a dragon bath house. Those binoculars were like fucking crack to me and I played with them until the the entire sky fell away into darkness.

I had never seen the night sky outside of the city and had no idea how luminescent it could be, but it wasn’t bright enough to stop the ground from going pitch black. Everyone started to pack into the car, but I wasn’t ready to leave. I had seen a flash of orange on the other side of the bay, followed by a shuffling blur emerging from the water.

I couldn’t make out what I was seeing, but as I looked on, a peculiar sting crept over my tongue. It was this weird prickling sensation like nothing I had ever experienced before. It seemed to urge me to keep looking, connecting me to whatever was coming out of the water.

“Come on, honey. It’s time to go,” mum yelled out to me. “You can’t see anything through those things anymore.”

“Just one more second, mum. Please one more second.”

Dad came and pried me off the binoculars, scooping me over to the car.

“There’ll be plenty to see tomorrow.”

During the car ride back, one of my brothers saw a possum in a tree and it became a game between everyone to spot more. I didn’t want to let them get the best of me again, so I glued my eyes to the passing trees and any thoughts of what I saw earlier quickly left me.

It wasn’t years later until I saw the shape during a school trip to Halswell Quarry. We were taken up to the highest point by a ranger who was telling us about rock formations. I thought it was really interesting stuff but everyone else was too cool to pay attention and that little bitch Tammy was throwing stones off the edge when we had specifically been told not to.

We took turns going into the department of conservation lodge, which looked out over the whole chasm, and through the window, I saw a girl wearing our school uniform standing on a cliff ledge on the other side. The same prickling taste of Marlborough Sounds came rushing back, twisting misplaced memories into my head. I thought for a second I had seen a strange construction of orange shapes but it quickly vanished in a snap, leaving just the girl by herself.

I told Ms. Williams about the girl, and she immediately ran to the ranger, but when they went outside to look for her she was gone. Ms. Williams lost her shit a bit, rounding everyone up to make sure no one was missing and some of the girls who hadn’t expected to be chased after so suddenly were on their phones, which all got confiscated.

We all had to stand in rows and take roll call. Tammy threw a stone over the edge and Ms. Williams shat her goddamn panties, screaming at her that this was a serious matter and that a rescue helicopter would be called for the missing girl. The ranger stated that everyone was accounted for so there would be no need for any action, implying I fucking imagined it, even though Ms. Williams saw her too. Tammy started rumors that I was a crazy spaz who sees ghosts and all the girls who lost their phones had no problem going along with it. Petty sluts. It wasn’t my fault I saw her. It’s not like I’m the only one with eyes. Anyone could have seen her. Jess was the only one to stand up for me and she got dragged into the mud because of it.

Throughout my teenage years I started to see the shape more frequently, most often at Jess’ house, which I regularly went to after school. She lived up in Huntsbury and her bedroom had a wide view over the city as well as the Port Hills, and any time I looked out her window, I would get that peculiar fizzing sensation on my tongue. I didn’t always find where the shape was, as looking over the entire city was like a goddamn Where’s Waldo on expert mode, but most times I would catch sight of that orange flash and know where to look.

It took awhile for me to accept that it wasn’t just my imagination, as the orange flash happened so fast that I was constantly second guessing myself, but once I knew what to look for, I started to understand the patterns of what triggered it to appear. Firstly, I had to be inside, looking out through a window (don’t ask me why, it’s just how it was), and secondly, the shape was quite far away, so I needed a decent sized view to detect it, although I got the feeling that it was getting closer to me with each sighting.

There were many things I didn’t understood, mainly what the fuck it actually was and why I saw it, but the question that puzzled me the most was around the forms it took. They were often quite normal things; a person, a statue, a tree, a fountain, but they were usually one step removed from where you would expect to find them, rendering them totally bizarre.

Perhaps the most memorable sighting was when it took the form of a Greek column on the hill side. It was this giant monument that stuck out above the trees, and a bunch of other people saw it too, including Jess. Someone even took a picture, which got published in The Press, and everyone thought he was this adept troll who had mastered photoshop. In interviews he swore it was real, as indicated by the photo, but when he drove to the location it was gone.

The general opinion was that it was a publicity stunt and that he had assembled a bunch of unrelated people to make the story more believable, although no one ever ‘broke character’. It got talked about for a week or so, even making the six o’clock news, and never once did I open my mouth about it. How could I? Any explanation I could give would only serve to deteriorate an already ridiculous story.

Most sightings weren’t as dramatic as this or the Halswell incident. The shape typically hid in plain sight, taking the form of something people wouldn’t question and eventually I grew accustomed to it. I thought of it as nothing more than a secret quirk of mine, like how there are those classmates you’ve known for years but never really talked to, and then one day you meet them at a house party with their inhibitions shed and find out they have some really interesting character trait. Daniel, who I pegged as a typical beer and rugby bloke had been entering professional tango competitions since he was a kid, and Aaron’s whole crew, who everyone thought were the shy nerdy kind, all took acid together. I had this shape that followed me, taking on random forms. It was just this thing I had.

After high school, an immense energy surged into my life concerning the prospects of my working future. I had become a bit obsessed with computers in my later teenage years and spent a lot of time learning how to code. I managed to grab a scholarship for ‘emerging student talents’ which was intended to throw me into university with an advantage, but I didn’t even make it to uni, as an accounting software company hired me as a paid intern after a series of interviews stemming from a careers convention.

This was big kid stuff. Most of my friends were starting studies, while others continued their part-time jobs or just straight bummed it at their parents, but I had the makings of a career. It was like I had completely skipped potty training, going straight from shitting in my pants to shitting in the toilet. The problem was that my parents lived in the depths of the suburbs and I didn’t know how to drive, meaning I had to take two buses to work.

Commuting got tiresome fast, and I started looking for places to rent in the city, but according to my parents this was a step too far. We argued a lot, but in the end they agreed to support my decision, and by ‘support my decision’ I mean they accepted they couldn’t physically stop me so they had to pretend as if they approved, which they did a lousy job of.

Living in an apartment by myself at eighteen was really the cherry that elevated my life to be such a big fucking deal. Everyone made me feel like some godly Erin Brockovich character, taking the world on by myself. They were all so invested in me, which makes it all the more painful when I look back at how quickly my life collapsed into shit.

At work, my desk was on the fifth floor, right by the fucking window and almost every single day I would get that sour sting on my tongue and then proceed to search for the shape. It usually appeared in the window of another building, but sometimes I would find it hidden in the alcoves between streets that are only ever occupied by smokers making a decent effort to be alone. It managed to go unnoticed most of the time, but occasionally I would see someone come undone by confusion as to why a large bookshelf was down a service alley, or why an office room that gets no sunlight suddenly had an over-sized cactus.

It had become undeniable that the shape was creeping closer to me with each sighting. One Friday morning I arrived at work to find it in the window of the building directly across the street, which was no more than 20 meters away (or about 9 Shaquille O’neals lying down lengthwise / whatever the fuck American’s use to measure distance). I caught a glimpse of it before the orange flash, seeing a floating construct of gears that loosely formed a body. I only saw it for half a second, so I admit my imagination was given an abundance of blank space to fill in, but what I saw left me feeling horrific. Everything about it was so unknowable and a million different questions swirled around in my head. Was it alive? Was it conscious of its actions? Did it have a purpose? This was the first time I had given it the serious consideration it deserved.

After the flash, it materialized into something a bit stranger than I was used to, which didn’t help my unease. It turned into what looked like a modern art installment or strange prop you might see on the set for a horror film; this obsidian structure with sharp twisting, twig like limbs, which stuck out like knives. I think it might have been a fountain, as I could see liquid moving over the surface, although to be honest I had no idea what it really was, or if it was even something that could be named.

The office it appeared in was a small meeting room that rarely ever hosted people. I was praying that the room would remain empty as I felt responsible for the disconcerting object inside. It was like I had clogged a toilet at a stranger’s house and couldn’t bear the thought of someone seeing my mess.

A cloud of anxiety followed me through the entire day. Every time I left my desk and came back I hoped to find  the room empty, but like a massive turd stuck in a toilet, it refused to flush. I got to the home straight, with only a few minutes left before home time when I noticed a team of people had gone inside and were inspecting the shape. They swarmed around it, taking pictures, clearly in a state of confusion. They dragged more people to come in and look at it, but I could see that no one had an answer.

On Saturday I went back to the suburbs for a party and was going to sleep at Jess’ afterwards. I didn’t tell my parents, even though their house is much closer, which I know sounds like I’m avoiding them, but if I used their place to drunk crash then I’d never hear the end of it.

I got as drunk as you might expect a teenager with a new lease of freedom and money would. At some point during the party me and Jess went on a mission to get fish &amp; chips before Roger Street closed (you can’t beat a late night Roger burger). A calm night sky rested over empty streets. It could have been any other night. It almost was, but I went and fucked that up.

Ahead of us was a glass phone booth. It had been here for well over a decade, during which time it was used exactly zero times. I sloppily fell against the door, holding it for balance as I swung it open.

“Come in. I want to show you something,” I said to Jess.

She didn't question me. She probably thought I was goofing around. I thought I was too, but I didn’t appreciate the seriousness of what I was doing. I hadn’t seen the shape that day, and it was still on my mind from yesterday.

“Are you going to show me your tits?” Jess said, picking up the phone and mashing all the buttons.

I closed my eyes, pressing my forehead against the glass. I wasn't sure if anything was going to happen, and if something did happen, I had no idea what that would be. I was drunk and reckless and not thinking about my actions.

“Penny?” 

There it was. That sharp sting creeping over my tongue, like the metallic aftertaste of an unpleasant pill that sticks to your throat.

“Are you ready?” I asked, opening my eyes. “Something’s behind us.”

I gently took hold of Jess' shoulders and turned her around. The playful mood I had incorrectly been occupying immediately shifted into horror as Jess erupted into screaming. Behind us, standing under the streetlight was what looked like a young girl who had drowned, or should I say, had been drowning for hundreds of years. Her whole body was twisted and grotesque as if the weight of a million waves had pushed it out of shape, and her skin had a translucent, ghostly feel to it. Looking back on the memory, it’s the eyes that are the most haunting. They were a beautiful light blue color that gleamed forward like the watchful eyes of an owl. It made me feel that there was a confused little girl trapped inside a monster's body; a helpless creature caught inside a cage shaped in terror.

Jess clambered for the door, her hands shaking, as fear continued to spill out of her lungs. The chaos of her scream helped spread her fear to me, and I followed behind her, our footsteps echoing into the empty air as we circled around the block, back to the safety of the house.

Jess came undone that night. I tried to explain to her what happened and what the shape was, but there were no string of words that could be tied together to make sense of the situation. Everyone surrounded us, comforting Jess with gentle and calming voices while trying to get a grasp on what happened, but the details of the events were indigestible. Jess begged everyone to admit it was a prank, and everyone begged me to explain what happened, but what I said was everything I had. A lot of different people went away with different views that night: that I had committed some strange and evil deed against Jess, that Jess was a drama queen who couldn't drink for shit, that the pair of us were crazy, that we were attention seekers who had gone mad.

Jess went on to retract what she saw. She said she couldn’t remember what happened, which felt like a betrayal of what we went through together, but I later accepted that she was only acting normally in the face of something unbelievable. She wasn’t to blame. I was. I did that to Jess. It was all my fault. She had been my best friend since the first year of high school, and I did that to her. A part of her broke off that she was now forced to carry around forever, and it was all my fault."

I’m currently a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science degree in computer science at a school in Korea. I’m actually enrolled in a MS/PhD program, but I’m planning to opt out and get a job.

My question is, if I want to get internships or jobs at research-related fields, then how would I go about advertising my skills when I don’t have any publications? If it helps, I’m involved in research projects in ML/DL right now at a lab, but the projects I’m working on are still in progress. The only possibility would be a paper I wrote with two other seniors and submited to IJCAI earlier this month. But even that paper I’m the 3rd author with my two seniors being co-first authors.

I just finished my first semester and will be entering my second as of March. That means that I have around a year and a half to get something going, but I’m feeling anxious about it.

Anyway, what are some ways that I may advertise myself on a platform like, say, LinkedIn if there’s no hard proof of my skills?

Any tips or advice are appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I don’t think she knows the hotel I’m in yet so I’m okay for now but that can end at any moment. I am going to try to get everything out before my flight leaves.

Barb McDalien is a monster.

It started at the Christmas Party a couple of months ago when Gary the Intern ‘just up and quit’. Barb always makes sure there is extra money set aside so she can throw a Christmas party that people will fawn over. Anyway, the day before the party, she announces in an email to everyone that she’s on a new diet and that that shouldn’t stop us from bringing sweets and snacks to the party but we shouldn’t be offended if she doesn’t have any. This is something she pulled all the time because she liked to think we were all friends and not just coworkers.

Anyway, Gary groans from his cubicle (which was right next to mine) about how he doesn’t care what Barb is doing and why doesn’t she feel the need to announce everything like she’s our Queen. I chuckled a bit to myself and told him to chill, she’s still Queen of the Paychecks and if he wants his he would do best to keep quiet. He and I shared a laugh right as Barb started to turn the corner with a look of pure hatred on her face. I hunkered down in my cube and just listened as she whispered into Gary’s ear with, what I assume, was ferocious intensity.

I couldn’t make out what she was saying but I looked at Gary’s face when she was done and had left and he was pale, almost skeletal looking, which is not how he had looked before. I asked him what she’d said and he stared at me as if he’d just witnessed a murder. He opened his mouth, closed it, and he just went back to work. I kept trying to ask him what was wrong and he just shook his head. He worked in almost silence the rest of the day, keeping his head down. The only noises I heard from him was a quiet sobbing when I went to leave for the day.

Gary quit that night.

Or at least that’s what everyone was told. 

That isn’t what happened. 

I had been roped in the party planning meetings and hadn’t done much to help. I skipped a lot of meetings because the first few could have been emails and I felt the same about the rest of them, which meant I was volunteered for set-up the morning of the party and by the time I had found out it was too late to back out. So I showed up earlier than I was supposed to, thinking if I finished early that I’d get to take a nap in the break room. I had no reason to believe anyone else was there, the door was locked, and I went about getting everything set up with the least amount of effort when I heard a noise from the supply closet. It wasn’t a small noise, it was like someone had dropped a duffle bag full of oranges and was rushing to eat them all at once. 

I thought maybe the janitor was in early to vacuum and something had happened to him, but when I went to check the closet the door was already open just a notch and I could see Barb’s glossy fire-engine red wig moving sporadically from left to right but the copier was blocking her face. She seemed to be crunching something but the sound was inhuman, like a dog gnawing on a bone.

I watched as her head continued to move to the chorus of ripping sounds and grunting when a voice called out from the front of the office. My Boss, Clyde, was shouting that he’d brought doughnuts. Barbs head shot up and for a quick second, I could swear she stared right into my soul. Her face was caked in gore. Her whole face was red and dripping, her usually brown eyes were glowing yellow and had slits for pupils, and her uncannily straight white teeth were now a, more disturbing pointed mess; her jaw was dislocated and hung low. 

I about threw up but was quick to retreat into an empty office down the hall as she pulled the door open a split second after I’d pressed myself against the open door. I heard the door hit something, no someone, I’d seen what she’d been noshing on. Really, I had seen who it was. 

She called out to Clyde in her sickly sweet southern voice that she was just getting something from the back and she’d be right up. Clyde responded that he was going to start bringing things in from his truck and to shout if she needed anything. 

I thought I was done for. She stood between me and Clyde (and the way out) and all she had to do was take a few steps down the hall before seeing me. But she didn’t. She just closed the closet door and when I peeked around the corner she wasn’t there. I crept back to the door and heard a slurping and cracking noise coming from inside. I went straight to the bathroom and threw up into the sink. I spent as long as I could sitting in the stall after that, sweat was just pouring from me and I knew I couldn’t look all that healthy. When I heard the door open and Barb’s designer heels click along the time I held my breath. She hummed to herself, never approaching the stall, and was probably fixing her hair. She ran the water and blew a wet kiss to nothing, then left. 

Gary’s resignation was in everyone’s inbox that morning saying that he was done with this place and wouldn’t ever be back. I tried to soothe myself with the morbid humour that in reality, he had never left but that only made me think of his chewed face staring up at the ceiling from the floor of the closet.

I did what I could to appear calm and collected for the rest of the day and it took me a while to get up the nerve to even approach the supply closet. Dave from Sales was the first to go in and when he didn’t scream like he’d found a body in there and rushed in after him. Well, I rushed into Dave really. I did my best to apologize and make excuses as to why I had run in there and he scooted by me through the door with his hands up. 

The room looked like it always had. There was nothing out of the ordinary except for me. I quickly grabbed a box of pens to make it appear like I was in there with a purpose and that was when I saw Barb watching me across the room. She winked and smiled at me, wrinkling her nose as a little mouse would. I almost threw up again. 

Having the party meant our day was cut in half. Phones were turned off and everyone filed into the conference room that I had shabbily decorated earlier. Like most parties, everyone just milled about drinking the punch and nibbling cookies and whatnot: talking and laughing. I stood with my back to the wall. I held a cup in my hand and tried to just blend into my surroundings. Of course, that didn’t work as Mark, from Sales, decided he needed to try his luck with me. He’d heard that I was in therapy and to Mark that meant my marriage was in trouble and I might be up for a lay. While that may have been true a few days prior I was no longer interested in anything he had to offer me and I just wanted out of the increasingly warm room.

I was in the heat of the moment telling Mark that I wasn’t interested when Barb waltzed into the room. She was wearing a red and green Christmas sweater with a light-up Santa, on her head was a pair of jiggly antlers with bells and a spring of mistletoe was suspended above them, more bells on her wrists and the loudest pair of Santa Claus leggings. She bounced around the room and made a little speech about how Christmas was her favourite holiday and she was so happy to be able to spend another one with all of us. There was a smattering of polite applause and everyone had gone back to the conversations when her eyes, once again, found me. She smirked before starting into a conversation with Dave.

It wasn’t long until she made her way over to me, she was very careful about the way she did it though. She approached the food table, with her hands raised and fingers pinched together like lobster claws, eyeing the cookies and sweets. She stared into me and said words I don’t think I’ll ever forget:

""Oh, I was a little bad earlier, but now I'm going on the naughty list.""

She picked up a cookie from the plate and took a small bite before turning back to the room. It was like all the sound rushed back to me and I felt the urge to run. So I did. I excused myself from the party, saying I needed to get home to Tom (my husband who is probably filing for divorce as I speak) and there was an emergency. Barb offered to walk me out and I loudly declined; telling her the party wouldn’t be the same without her.

I called into work the next couple of days and insisted to Tom that we move. He was having ‘none of my bullshit’ and insisted that I go back to work, to leave him alone. He worked from home and apparently my anxiety was getting to be too much for him. I understood that. We weren’t meant for each other and were the literal definitely of “still trying to make it work anyway”. But I needed someone and he refused to be there for me, so I left. One night I packed a bag, took the emergency credit card and all the cash from the floor safe, and left. I was on the run. 

Tom tried to call me after that. A few times. Said that he didn’t want to get to police involved if he didn’t have to, but with the way I was acting, he thought I should see a doctor. Permanently. I tried to come clean and explain what I had seen Barb do but he wasn’t having any of it. He told me that Barb had called and talked to him and said I’d had an episode at work and that she’d like to check in on me if he knew where I was. He told her the hotel I had been in and told me that she was on her way over. My cue to leave.

That was in January, it is now February 14th, 2020 and today is the day I finally outrun her. I don’t think Tom knows I took the money, I don’t think he knows I knew it was there, he knows I have the card as it hasn’t been cancelled but he knows where I am. Tom must keep telling here where I am because she keeps finding me and the longer I stay in the States the easier it’ll be to find me. I’ve got a few places set up, a bunch of different tickets booked, so she’ll never be able to track me down though. She knows that I know what she did to Gary, that I know she isn’t what she says she is. 

Soon, I’ll be free."
f3msk0,1,2020-02-13,Which resume should I use? - looking technical support roles,Akai1up,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/f3msk0/which_resume_should_i_use_looking_technical/,"Typically I look for product/technical support roles as I feel I excel with these kinds of roles. At the moment, I have two resumes. One lists my most recent 3 jobs and the other lists 2 of my jobs plus an internship from when I was in college. 

My concern is that one of my most recent jobs was a contract job doing QA work for a major bank. It isn't really that relevant to tech support (I was trying something new), but I feel like if I don't include it, it will look like I had a weird 8-month gap between the other two jobs. In the second resume, I replace this bank job with an internship I had a while ago that felt more relevant. Which matters more, the relevance or the time gap? Which should I use?

I was placed at an internship where I literally did nothing most of the time. I feel like I did not learn much, and to make matters worse, one of the main employees supervising us made everything so confusing.


Eventually, I finished my internship, but apparently I did a good job because they offered me a position as a contractor. My job mainly consists of coding in SQL. However, due to my confusing supervisor, we rarely got stuff done. He overcomplicated things I feel.


To make matters worse, I am not good at IT. IT for me is very broad, and it overwhelms me. I would still like to stay in this field because I get paid decently.


In all, I am stuck. I am in a position where I am not learning or feeling accomplished (because of my lack of work), and I am not good at other IT stuff.


I want to find another position where I can learn and grow in my skills not just SQL, SQL, SQL! (Or at least where I get work, or where I have data that makes sense and I can work with it!). However, I don't know what to do.


Are there any certifications or courses you all recommend I do so I can change positions? To be frank, I am not looking to do college at this time.. so maybe a somewhat short course?


Also, are there any experiences you could share and how you overcame them?"

I can maintain a 3.5+ GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Does this affect my chances of being admitted ? (the degree is 4 year long, but I could finish it in less).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering to take few for-credit classes to help my application (**Intro to programming in C++, data structures, discrete math, calculus 1 for engineers, Computer Org and assembly**) since those classes are not part of my BS IT degree plan.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Would this improve my chances coming in with a bachelor in IT? or would I need something else?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

as far as experience goes, I've worked in IT for 4 years (Linux/Windows sysadmin mostly), I have a github account where I occasionally upload some small coding projects written in python/c++ and java. the reason I'd choose a masters in CS would be to have a solid foundation for future career in software engineering and also to take advantage of the internship opportunities while doing the OMSCS degree."

I have recently graduated from medical school and I am about to start my training program to become a GP in Italy

I wanted to ask you (especially those in the medical field) how is it difficult/unlikely to find a job in Berlin or at least in the surrounding area for a newly-trained non-German family doctor?

I know that of course the cities are saturated and it’s way easier to work in a rural area, but the thing is, I’ve always loved Berlin and the idea of living there (at least for some time) so it would be a dream come true.

And I get that being a GP is not the ideal job for the juvenile Berlin experience, but I’m just wondering if it could be possibile and worth the efforts. I would be willing to do some internships or work far from the city as a temporary measure

And of course I would have to learn German - right now I am at an A1/A2 level, but I could reach a good level before finishing my training

I would love to hear some tips or insights! Sorry if it may seem a silly question but I can’t find much information online"

I'm a final year university student who has just accepted a graduate position (few days ago) following an internship that I completed at the end of December 2019. In January 2019, I was offered and accepted a graduate position at another employer who offered the opportunity to work part-time during my final year. I accepted the January offer as that was the only offer I had at the time but decided after that the internship I completed in December was a better fit and accepted.

My question is would you work part-time at the first employer with the intention of resigning at the end of the year? 

I haven't told them that I will be rescinding my offer due to a better opportunity arising but would include this when I resign. Additionally, I would have to find another job if I do not work part-time at the first employer.

Thanks for your help."

&amp;nbsp;
  
As far as I can tell when performing firmware updates a new image will be downloaded which can then be written to a partition in flash memory while the old one still remains there as a sort of backup in case something goes wrong.
So when I have a firmware image at for example address 0x1F40 and download a new one which I write to 0x3E80 I will then have to start the application from address 0x3E80.  
However when compiling the new firmware a .cmd file is used in which the flash size and base is defined. In the comment above that line it clearly says that that is the starting address of the application.
So when I compile this new firmware with flash base defined as 0x1F40 but there is already an image at that location and it will be written by the bootloader to address 0x3E80 wont that break everything?  

&amp;nbsp;

I am also curious how the jump from the bootloader to the actual application will take place. I know there is a register in the vector table which will need the start address of the application and the bootloader can provide that register with the right address but after writing this value how will it switch to that location? Does this happen when the bootloader returns or when the system resets?"
f3qjk6,1,2020-02-14,Please somebody help me on career switch?,officialzofft,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f3qjk6/please_somebody_help_me_on_career_switch/,"Dear fellow friends,

First i am sorry for my english as im not a native speaker.

This post is about thinking of major career switch and any help would be great. This is impacting on my mental health a lot.

I am INFP 28 (M) and my whole life I have been interested in these things: music, people, animals and nature. My I is 52%, but my N,F,P have huge numbers around 95%, so I basically live in the clouds.

 When the time came at 18 of deciding what I wanted to study ( why on earth we decide this at such an inmature age is another topic..). I had no idea of what to do and because I liked travelling and I was creative I went for international business and marketing. After year 1 I wanted to quit as I did not like nor felt connected with the mindset of the people there. But my father who had a big influence in me convinced me to keep going and focus on exchanges etc. Stupid me followed the advice of who I thaught knew everything.

Few years forward, I got my degree. Then I started working in a big consulting firm as an audit intern. It was 4 months and I hated that experience so bad that I was physically and mentally suffering. I could not wait to finish. My internship finished and although I was offered an extension I declined it. Then I had a big revealing moment: I was not made for any type of business setting, I hate the word client, I think that anything you do in a business is usually irrelevant and I am far from being a coporate office player. I was done with it.

Suddenly all pieces of the puzzle seemed to come together: I wanted to be in healthcare so bad. Doctor, nurse, psychologist, vet in that order of preference. Caring for others seemed like the thing I have been born to and never payed attention that it was my path. I spoke to my dad again to see if I could have his support financially, he said no. He said I should get a master in marketing and a job and then when one thing is finished I can pursue other stuff. He supported me financially with that and I got indeed a master and a job in one of the biggest companies you can think of. One big tech player.

Money, high salaries, bonus, stock...I was rich. Yet completely miserable. I thought it was because this was a logistics role so I decided to quit after a year and look for a job in marketing, my field and more creative. Well, now I am at that exact point. Its been 2 months and again, I know i dont wanna be a 9 to 5 person doing some regular tasks in an office waiting for promoting to senior then director then more money and then retirement. I know this is not for me and I just wanna leave and stop this type of company jobs forever. I dont care about profit at all i only care about meaning. NGO is also not an option because i also dislike 

 This job is in the medical industry (devices) so I had a wake up call in a sense as I need to visit hospitals. I was seeing byopsies and autopsies, I just found it so fascinating. I love to be in hospitals so much but again thats onle 5% of the job. It was a confirmation that healthcare is my world.

Now here is the situation:

I have a 6 month contract with option to permanent if both parties want. People are great and the company itself is nice.  I need to do these months to collect some money. Again, I dont wanna grow in a corporate role.

What I want is to work towards my goals: being a professional in healthcare. Helping people and my huge empathy is what I need to do and I see it more clear than ever.However Im 28 and i see it as old to be a doctor or even psychologist together with money and time constraints. On the other hand, I can still start as I know time will pass anyways and I will still regret if i dont follow my true nature in a few years. 

I ask for feedback from you guys. My family is very judgemental and barely understand me. I feel very alone and I have struggled hardly with strong depression and anxiety during the last years. I feel like my life has no meaning at all if im not doing what im supposed to be doing. Then I wake up sad, go thru the day, go to sleep, live for the weekend do it again.

I am in a foreign country working and all I want to do is to comeback home and follow the path I have been ignoring my whole life. Its just scary to start over at 28 when my social circle is evolving so much, friends buying houses married and with kids...but I know how important it is to not compare yourself to anybody.

 I wonder have you ever felt this way? Would you recommend me to follow my dreams even though its late? What do you think or whats your story on this topic? I wanna hear it all.

Thanks a lot guys."

Not a sysadmin, but I am interning at a large hotel chain as an IT intern. I study Business IT &amp; Management so that might tell you about the level of technical skills I have (Or don’t have). I have to create a new workflow for the existing IT support that the hotel chain has. They outsourced almost everything from classier systems, to the managing of the network and security. The problem is that the office personnel of the hotel and the other employers that work with devices, and systems for their day to day jobs in the hotel don’t have a uniform workflow when it comes to reporting problems with different systems throughout the hotels. 

My first assignment is to create an overview of all the systems all the hotels throughout the country uses, what software that comes with, whether this is outsourced or not and who the first and second lines are when it comes to support. 

This is all quite new for me so I am not sure how to properly and professionally go about it and visualize it in a way it can help the design of a new workflow for the IT support.  

Any tips on a way to go about it or software I can use to visualize this is well appreciated."

f3swq9,4,2020-02-14,Student Advice Requested,p0eticnaturalism,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f3swq9/student_advice_requested/,"Advice for a Student

Hi all! I’m a junior student in a BASW program with a big decision to make. I love the social work program, I’ve met a lot of great people and learned so much. For senior year, we have to do an internship and I can’t help but think I’d rather do something else instead.

Money is a big concern for me and there’s a child welfare program at my school that pays your senior year tuition and in return, you have to work for CPS for a year. I find this to be a big risk, because if I hate the job, I’m stuck working it for two years. 

The other option is to finish my almost completed psych major and get a creative writing minor. My mom isn’t supportive of this and says it’ll be a lot of wasted money. I can’t help but think focusing on my writing will make me happier than doing an unpaid internship or an internship in child welfare.

I should add that I was abused as a child and I’m worried that the CPS job may be triggering. Please let me know any thoughts or advice you have for me."

I need your advice. (I graduate this may) 

I was set on becoming a middle school math teacher but now that I am a student teacher, I don’t want to do this anymore. My career goals have now shifted to something with data analysis. Even on the good days of teaching, I still think to myself “I want to do data.” However, all of my experience has been with teaching. The only experience I have with coding is teaching students Java and Arduino computer software. 

I have gotten in contact with someone from silicon labs to help review my resume and interview skills, nothing else. They are simply being a mentor to me. I also have a friend who works for Facebook and they also will support me and help me as much as they can. 

My programming skills are rusty and I have no experience with data. 

What are the next steps that I do to become a good candidate for a data job. I want anything that will give me experience. I’ve been applying to jobs that are for interns and those that don’t require experience. But I don’t know if I should go to a community college to take computer science courses. Should I take the Microsoft SQL certificate? Should I sign up for websites that can help me with my CS skills? Which websites? 

I need all the help I can get. Thank you."

Why was I rejected?,lotanto2,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/f3x2n2/got_rejected_from_usaa_jobs_although_they_have_a/,"Hi, I am a senior in college as an IT major graduating in May 2020. I had a phone interview with USAA jobs last Thursday for the ""IT College Hire"" role. They asked some behavioral questions followed by two large + analytical thinking programming questions (technical questions) where you would give pseudo code to them.

I had no problem with behavioral questions, since I read off a paper I had that had answers I would use in an interview, but I made it sound like I was not reading. They also asked me to elaborate on the two job experiences on my resume, which were 1. A help desk job and 2. An IT intern.

\\When they ask those large technical questions, I believe they want to see how you think. They want to test your technical analytical thinking, but obviously it would be tough to get the answer 100% correct. They seemed okay with my answers and gave me hints at times.

Programming is my biggest expertise in the field and throughout college where I had to help other students who struggled in programming.

I am starting to get concerned, because it is now Mid-February and I have nothing lined up yet. I am really desperate to have a job by mid-June, because I really hate living at home and I am desperate to move out and get my own place by that time (trying to relocate too!). I was not so concerned in January. February = slightly concerned. March = Moderately concerned. April = Really concerned May = I will be depressed af if I have nothing. I will not give up! I will keep applying! So far I applied for 315 jobs, since October 2019 (don't count the 2019 jobs)  at least had an interview (and a rejection for that) at one place back in Nov 2019, had an interview for Infosys, which I bs'ed through since it sounded like a shady job, another phone interview, which was not even interview, since the interviewer told me he was hiring immediately (I am in school still)."

I was waiting for some responses from other companies so I said I would decide in a few days. Last Friday was the last day they would give me to answer so last Friday I said I would like to return. They then set up an interview for me which would happen next Thursday, but I am almost 100% guaranteed the position. I have not yet accepted a written offer, but I have essentially accepted their verbal one (through email).

Another company (very high on my priority list) gave me an offer just now. I want to accept it, but I'm not sure if I would burn any bridges with my previous employer. The people at the previous company are all great, I enjoy the work, etc. but I prefer the new company.

Is there any way to accept the new offer and get out of the previous one without burning any bridges? Another thing I was considering is that there is a high chance for me to get a full time offer after graduation with my previous employer.

f3z32r,2,2020-02-14,Big companies - does GPA matter?,bci_bot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f3z32r/big_companies_does_gpa_matter/,"""No, they focus on personal projects / leadership in projects and how well you demonstrate your abilities"". The general typical response, but some companies like Deep Mind, Google, Morgan Stanley etc. ask for a copy of your transcript (for both internships &amp; full-time jobs).

So here's the deal: I've always felt super under qualified bc of my gpa when thinking of applying to companies (I'm quite literally just skimming by with my gpa). My resume is docked with projects and leadership experience but I always feel hopeless against companies that explicitly require a minimum 3.0 gpa for internships (like Cisco, Morgan Stanley, etc.). Does anyone know if most of the big companies (like Microsoft, Google, FB, etc.) actually lowkey care about how you're doing in school? (esp. if it's not explicitly stated as a requirement) People always say ""gpa doesn't matter, they look at projects etc."" but whenever I see a field in an application that says ""please submit your transcript"", I immediately back out cause I assume no one wants someone with such a low gpa, despite my packed resume. This fear doesn't really apply to companies that don't ask for a transcript at all, cause they're obviously not gonna see my depressing transcript if they didn't ask for it. Any advice or insight would be super appreciated!"

It starts off with POST, but then carries on to the process of finding internships,  having to deal with the mental stress of sending out 100s of resumes and getting maybe 1 or 2 callbacks, doing difficult technical interviews on top of the behavioural ones, the stress of both finding interesting projects that you actually have the technical background for and that haven't already been done, the constantly changing techologies that you need to keep up with, the sheer mental effort that it takes to make sense of an already developed codebase etc etc etc.

I feel overwhelmed by it all and don't believe this is for me.

I have no issues earning 20-30k a year after graduation if it means I don't have to deal with this rat race.

Any suggestions on what major to switch to?"
f404i7,0,2020-02-14,Dropping out of college to attend a coding bootcamp - what are tips for success?,throwaway00468,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f404i7/dropping_out_of_college_to_attend_a_coding/,"Long story short, I am no longer able to financially support myself and finish my Bachelor's in CS at this current time (I have \~2.5 years of school left). I just turned 21 and I would love to be able to get a development job to support myself without burdening my family by having to rely on them financially. 

So, starting in late May, I'm considering joining a 6.5 month long bootcamp located an hour and a half away (in Portland, OR. The bootcamp is Epicodus). I've done quite a bit of research and determined that it's one of the best local bootcamps for me (both in terms of content and affordability). 

For the past 3 years I've been making games in Lua, and about 5 months ago I picked up Python and have been practicing daily by making some simple projects &amp; reading books (Finished a few *freecodecamp* tutorials, finished reading *Python Crash Course*, and currently finishing *Automating the Boring Stuff with Python*). I'd love to dive deeper into web/mobile development, as I've also been making a few websites for local business for the past 2 months (mostly HTML/CSS but I've started incorporating some Javascript now, but I still have sooo much to learn). 

So, my current plan is this: 

* **Now - May 25th**: Take online CS courses to get certifications in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Databases (I've already started). Hoping this will be a good addition to my resume and help strengthen some skills that I otherwise wouldn't pick up during bootcamp. Will also continue learning Python and work on personal projects, as well as network.
* **May 26th - Oct. 11th**: Spend these 20 weeks at bootcamp learning (Javascript, C#, .NET, React) while working part time. Continue networking. 
* **Oct. 12th - Nov. 27th**: Internship at a company assigned by the bootcamp while also working on personal projects. After my internship, I will be moving back home with my parents until I find work. Assuming my internship chooses not to bring my on full time, I'll be applying for jobs.
* **Nov. 28th - Jan. 10th**: Continue networking, work part time, work on some personal projects, and continue applying for work. I would prefer to stay in the PNW; I know that Portland isn't too kind to junior developers, so I'm thinking Seattle would be a good place to start searching.
* **Jan. 11th - June 14th**: Spend two short terms taking online courses to get my Associate's degree in CS. I'm not 100% set on this just yet, hopefully I'll have work during this time, but I figured having an Associate's degree on my resume is better than no degree. Plus this will give me the option to pick back up and get my Bachelor's in the future if I choose to do so. 

I'm hoping that this will be enough to help stand out against other applicants with a BS degree. I'm a hard worker and consider myself to be sociable - if I can just get my foot in the door and get a face-to-face interview, I feel as if I can better represent myself in ways my resume can't. In terms of finances, this is one of the only options that is currently viable for me.

For anyone with a similar experience or advice, I'd love to hear it. This whole process is really scary for me and I feel severely underwhelming when comparing myself to my peers. 

Thanks reddit!"

I never ended up using my degree as I lost interest in politics. 

Fast forward to early last year and after working in a slew of dead end jobs I felt like I needed to gain more skills. I had practiced Python on my own on the recommendation of a friend. 

I looked into Master's programs, but I was under qualified for most of the ones I wanted to get into. The amount of prereqs needed almost equated to a second second bachelors, so I went back to school. Right now I am taking Statistics 2 and a class in Java. 

At the same time I applied for a coding bootcamp LaunchCode. Curriculum is focused on Web Development in Javascript. 

I started school in August, and I would graduate with a BS in Data Science in May 2021. Furthermore, I have a Data Analytics internship this summer.  Going to school is obviously very expensive.

I just got into this coding bootcamp. 

I have no idea what to do. Anyone have any advice? Both tracks interest me. I could try and do them at the same time. The bootcamp ends in August. School in Spring 2021. Bootcamp is cheap. School is expensive. I have an internship in Data Analytics over the summer already though.

Mostly cyber security. I have curreny enrolled in one program that if I become alumni I can go back to train for more advanced courses. Its from 9am to 1pm. I have another I just interviewed for another, per scholas but it would be from 9- 4 pm. The person who interviewed me liked me and said she would push for my application.
At my current job that sucks,  I was about to talk to probably getting a night shift close by in between commutes for both training areas. So i can do per scholas.

However I just accepted an offer for TSA.
And its a secure job. I don't start orientation for it until around mid april. 
The cyber security class would be around mid march

The first training course is just tech fundamentals and comptia a+cert.  I am in about week 3 or 4. All together about 23 weeks of classroom

Cyber i would get a+, network+ and security +

Pros and cons 

1rst training program 
Pros:
-Slow and paced learning environment.
-Relaxed.
- Job placement, apprenticeship and internship possibilities.
-Only 4 hours a day instead of 8 hours of my day
-the recruiter that talks with the company seems pretty nice.
-commuting costs is covered
I Could theoretically get an early offer and take it while im finishing the program.

Neutral- is 14 weeks of classroom and about 7 weeks of internship period (if you get one)

Cons
- 1.5 - 2 hour commute
- less and more basic certifications I would obtain
- internship, job, apprensticeship is not guaranteed 
-theres a couple of people who are returnees which gives me a bad feeling that I may not get an offer although Im not sure why they are returnees
-oppertunities are minimum wage I was told


2nd training program (per scholas)
Pros:

-earn more certs

-commute is closer

-was told about a slot for working at perscholas itself by the interviewer herself.

- be able to jump right into it directly

Cons:
-its 8 hours long, I have to work and do this for 17 weeks
-Im not sure what the learning environment is like


Note- i dont know the wages would be typically for this program. I'm a reach out and ask later on



TSA:
Pros: secure
- would start off at 18.88 right away above minuim wage
-its a fulltime offer.

-assuming i don't do nothing crazy and be a good worker, i get a gaurenteed promotion pretty much in a year finishing their certifications/training

-its a government job so I could transfer to another federal department or branch

-I get some some benefits, has union.


I was thinking i could take this and self study for TSA.

And then Id can he an IT or related field in the government.


But I dont know if Id waste my time doing TSA when I could have been certified. 

But at the same time Im worried about failing. I have somewhat of a foundation with computers. I basically upgraded a gaming desktop to a whole new computer, i troubleshooted malware from my computer before.  Im alittle familiar with so.e networking / internet security concepts, like VPN, fire wall, UDP/TCP, routers, hubs , switches, ping, arp mac addresses ect."

Or is it hard as I'll be at a disadvantage compared to the US students for example? And if so, how does the interview process work? Is it just phone and video call, or am I expected to maybe fly there or something like that? I'm sorry if those questions seem dumb, but I'm really new to all of this. And I won't be applying until atleast my first in university, so that I have some good projects and a good CS background, so maybe this is a little early to start worrying about those stuff idk.

I need to take this one class that isn’t offered in autumn but offered in Summer in order to start my capstone in the fall-winter period. 

However, I just got an amazing internship offer for the Summer and the class also has a lab section so there’s no way I feel my company would be cool with be being gone for 3 hours every Friday and then missing an hour all other days. 

But my counselor said if I take full time classes next year to graduate in spring I will hit a dangerous mark in credits. Basically the point where the university is like man you gotta GO. Also this would make me have to take 4 extra classes I really don’t need. 

He suggested looking in to getting FAFSA to let me do part-time for my last year without starting my loans since I won’t be full time. I’ll probably do 10cr, then 7cr, then 8cr to finish. Does anyone have experience with this? Do they usually grant it on a scenario like this? Any advice on where to find out more or how to approach FAFSA about this would be super helpful."

I had a project for 2 months on which 1 guy with whom I started working 2.5 years ago was also present. The project is repeatable each year and I have been working on it for 3 years now and in all 3 years this guy has been there too. First year was pretty ok, but on 2nd year he tried to seduce and was aggressively flirting with a very attractive intern girl. He failed miserably, the girl scolded him and they dont talk since.

This year he tried to do the same thing but with less attractive girl. Last year I did not give a damn about this situation because the rest of the team were really nice people and I could communicate with them and not care about the 2.  This year, the rest of the team was, let's say, pretty passive so I could not do anything with them but to watch how these 2 interact and I got really mad. To give you a small insight about how this guy flirts: He is very direct about things he wants to get from a girl, he flirts aggressively  - calling stupid nicknames and dragging the girl's chair around while she is sitting there.

One day this girl had a work-related question and came up to me with her chair, the guy grabbed the chair and dragged her to himself while she was explaining what she wanted to me. I got really mad but did not say anything. I had kinda decided that I would not get involved in problems and to just remain silent and wait for the project to end and then never to see these 2 again.

I was mad at the guy for being such a douche but what can you tell an attractive guy like that? Not to flirt with girls? Our direct supervisor with whom I talked about the matter also agreed with me but did not do anything about it.

And I was also mad about the girl not taking any action to stop the guy. One day she was so embarrassed by his actions that she turned to me and asked me to say something. I got really mad and wanted to flame her for being such an incapable person at handing rude people.

So anyway, I was to finish the project and never to see these 2 as I pretty much  hate them. But plans suddenly changed and now I am forced to remain with this girl for 2 more months. I told her that I don't like her for the reasons listed above and would not like her to be working with me. She dismissed all the facts and said it was just friendly banter and that she and the guy are just friends.

After that she started acting cocky and I had to talk her out of acting in such a way but my mental state is a fucking wreck. I do not sleep at night thinking what a miserable piece of shit I am for not speaking up and saying everything I thought.

I am thinking about fighting with her and telling what a whore she is, idk."

Most likely the schools I applied to made their first round offers for people who will get guaranteed fellowships/competitive at things like NSF etc. Now they're going to wait to see who accepts to understand their funding situation and then see if they can extend an offer to me.

Hey everyone,

Country where i live only has Microsoft office out of big 4. I'm third year CS student atm and my main goal is to get an internship or a job in the next year or 2.

I have a plan to make certain side projects in the coming months with Flutter and i was thinking of whether it makes any difference in hiring process of what technologies i put on my resume?

Obviously Flutter is Google's framework and is quite different from what Microsoft uses according to google search (C#, C++, Typescript).

I understand that difference won't be major but a lot of people wanna get in so it's very competitive and even if using their stack helps a little bit it's worth it.

I'm a career changer and I've worked for over half a decade as a science teacher.

I recently dropped out of a co-op program because I realized I wasn't interested in any of the companies. I left my prior career to do something I am interested in (I want to work for NASA or a space company), and I wasn't passionate at all about the stuff these companies were doing. (It was a toss-pot of random things like farm equipment, ICs, testing equipment, etc.) I've been dragging my feet on applying to internships. I applied to a couple of places I really would love to work for, but I may not get any responses back from them. The co-op would also make it take an extra year to graduate, and I'm already old and felt like I need to move on.

Meanwhile, my peers who stayed in the co-op program are raring to go to their internships. Others are interviewing like crazy and applying to other companies nearby. I'm not interested in any of them, but I do feel like maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot by not being as enthusiastic as my peers about getting into industry. Part of my plan is to go for grad school as well so maybe that's why I don't feel as stressed about this. 

I figure mostly what my peers are worried about is getting experience working in a professional environment, and not necessarily in the area in which they want to end up. Since I'm a career changer, I feel like it doesn't really matter for me since I already have proof I can be successful in a professional environment. Am I wrong? Should I be freaking out more about internships?"

What jobs am I actually qualified for (i.e. would get interviewed for)?",throwawaylifeat30,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f4gy85/applied_math_undergrad_with_some_programming/,"MY RESUME (paraphrased):

Experience:  

-  3- month internship at small company, programmed software in C/C++.  Involved testing electronics using instrumentation such as oscilloscopes and multimeters.  Did some breadboarding.

Did two projects:  

-one involving programming in MATLAB which took in an audio file, did some Inverse Fourier Transformation and other manipulations in the data from the file and outputted a visualization of this data in graph form.  (I did not design this code, just modified a pre-existing one to handle different parameters).

-2nd project was programming , in C/C++, an Arduino board to control two servo motors to move simultaneously depending on data from a sensor also connected to the Arduino.

Programming languages:  MATLAB, C/C++, R (brief R), and very little C# (I took a class but I have not programmed in this language in a long time so I stopped including it in my resume).  

Coursework:

Discrete math:  Advanced Linear algebra, Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Number Theory.

""Applied"" math:  Probability/Statistics,  Applied Linear Regression,  Operations Research, Mathematical Modeling (2 semesters, involving programming mathematical models in MATLAB and a lot of analysis of real world models).

MY GOAL:

I want to be an Embedded software developer but thats clearly not happening anytime soon so I need to pick up a temporary job so I dont become homeless while I do projects in my free time and self-study to accomplish my true career goal.

EDIT: Seems like other people are stumped, as am I, where I can fit, based on current skills.  This is depressing."

f4ifl6,3,2020-02-15,Part of a startup. Realized I won't do as much programming as I hoped. Also realized my teammates aren't really competent enough.,internally,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/f4ifl6/part_of_a_startup_realized_i_wont_do_as_much/,"So right now I'm part of a startup incubator where I was recruited by the founder to be on her team. We are college students as well. She likes that I am studious and she liked my resume (Hackathons, research assistant, various jobs, and a winter data analyst internship). We're a small team of four members and we're a diverse group. Now, regarding our times in college as undergrads, this is a breakdown:

My founder is a senior. She's about to leave college soon. She's an economics major with a 2.7 gpa (she's horrible at math) and the most experience she has is in real estate and babysitting. In high school she was the top of her class though, and participated in every club she could, including being the VP of track club. She's also a huge reader. She's a huge thinker, too.

I am a sophomore who's aiming for a field in CS. I will do anything if it means I can be experienced in my field. I don't do it for the money, but because I think it's an absolutely wonderful place. I'm only carrying multiple duties for the team for the experience (because it's good for a tech person to understand the business/customers imo). My founder says I'm the right hand man because she interacts with me the most about the startup and trusts my research and communication abilities.

The other two, the other marketing person (sister to the founder) and biochem guy (her boyfriend, who is a junior himself), are fine. They do the work, but perhaps not to the level that I anticipated at first... but they still do it. And they're very kind and wise, too.

I was invited to be the 'tech officer' of the startup. Soon, my founder kind of bounces between roles, and now I'm the 'marketing lead' of the team. As the tech officer or marketing lead, I was given the task of data organization and web development, along with research and interviewing people online and on the streets, which I was psyched for because I get to learn new skills. Yay me!

With time, my roles still shift around, and she tells me I can start working on gathering features for the website. Yay, now we're getting somewhere!

Now, I don't know why she gets this idea, especially after a few weeks into the program, but she soon tells me, ""I don't think you should work on the website..."" Pause. What? I ask her why, and she doesn't really respond, but she has been talking to her cousin's father who is a web developer himself. In the past I asked her numerous times if I can get in touch with him so he could mentor me. Hasn't happened. Not even an email. Fine, I'll leave it alone for a while and do my own self studying to research (on top of difficult but enjoyable STEM classes). Maybe I can prove to her that my passion for learning will drive the business.

Now, can I just say something. I'm not very confident in the idea of this startup to begin with. We have so, so, so many competitors, all of who's single flaw is one thing... not being advertised well enough. However they have a lot of credibility and their teams have plenty of expertise. We discovered this AFTER the startup began, which my founder started thinking of THREE YEARS AGO. 

There's too much to really say, but deep in my heart, I don't think my founder has it in her to actually do a good job with this. She's very responsible and passionate, and even won another incubator's competition, but she yet to consider her positioning in the market and what makes us stand out. This is not a tech startup either... it's in the field of skincare/pharmaceuticals. She has a difficult time balancing organizational skills, and when I watch her get stressed out over things that are quite solvable, I start to relinquish a little bit of confidence.

One other awful thing is that whatever I tell her, she dismisses it until she realizes that I'm right. Every single thing I've mentioned, she says meh, until someone else mentions it or until she realizes the consequences of not following it sooner. For instance, we had a pitch recently that we were given weeks in advanced to work on. Three weeks before the pitch, I tell her we have to start preparing for it. Two weeks before, I tell her we have to start. I create a Google slides.. I'm told we shouldn't worry about it and should worry about our 'customer insights' and 'research' instead. Okay, sure. That second week, I see groups practicing. Whatever. One week before the pitch, I tell her. Nothing. Two days before the pitch, we all scramble to start doing it, but she's still not worried.

Day of the pitch. It goes terribly. One of our members was reading off index cards so obviously and I was jammering my entire way through. We get a 2.4/5. She says that isn't too bad. Wtf? It was TERRIBLE. We didn't even get our business model right. No one understands what we're trying to do. Great.

Today, I talked to my founder's sister. She tells me the other day they were talking with the wed developer in their family. He says the father laughed it off and said, ""Why didn't you get someone overseas to work on the website?"" 

Can I just say something? I don't know a SINGLE damn time I said I couldn't work on the website. I don't recognize a single damn time I showed incompetence over it either. I don't know why they are feeling doubts. They aren't communicating to me effectively. No one is ever on the same page of anything! There are certain things I don't know yet (I never worked on an eCommerce website before) and I told her that if she needs one, she should keep a real developer at bay at least, but I always tell her I'm striven to learn about tech. It's the only thing I care about. As long as I put work into it, I can try to get us where we should, and I'll do it for free b/c I know developers are expensive.

Another thing, I think we're too focused on the solution than the problem. I mention certain things over and over, and so do other people (mentors, team members...), but she doesn't understand what we're saying with her heart!

We also do home assignments last minute too. Huge turn off. I mention assignments a few days before the due date (because sometimes I don't have time) and no one responds (via text sadly) until the last day. My founder's sister doesn't come to the same college so it's difficult to meet up and discuss to-dos as well...

I just feel like we're ridiculously amateurish. I don't necessarily want to quit and I do want to see this towards the end, but I also want to practice tech projects as often as possible so I can get better at my field. I also want to be listened to. I have a few startup ideas of my own, so that's why learning is important for me. I really don't know what to do. In a way I feel like a terrible co-founder for having so much doubts. Maybe it's because I'm going to get my monthly (oops). I express this with our mentors and they tell me to talk to her more, but when I display my sentiments, all she says is, ""I know,"" but does she really...?

I might write a TLDR later. Sorry. I'm just so tired after this. I'm so tired of being incompetent and I just want to be successful and listened to for a change. This might just be burnout. We do have the most points out of all the other teams in our track (it's a competition type thing) but I'm not really feeling it. I also have ADHD btw so maybe it's because I don't stick to projects long term normally that my body's trying to pull away.

Oops. This was very long."

I'm hoping my LoRs and writing samples (and obviously SoP) will save me. If I press on with applications this season: do I have a decent chance? How do I fluidly bring up and explain my quant score in my SoP? And I don't know what I don't know, so add anything else to consider! Any insight is welcome!

I went for a Media Production degree, and started with the Film Production career path because at the time it sounded interesting. However, I switched over to TV and Media production path because at the time I was interested in sound and audio, and this path had more classes relative to that. Those few classes weren't very interesting, and my interest in audio as a career dimmed a bit. Because of the change in classes, I took around 3 years instead of 2 to finish the degree. The thing is, my final class was Film As Art, and it REALLY got me more interested into film as an artform. I feel like I would enjoy doing film as a career, but because the majority of my classes were focused on TV/News/Media, I have no idea where to go. I started out college doing a few film classes like Lighting, but the majority of my classes were focused on radio, editing, etc. Since i wasn't very focused on film during my classes, I never really networked or tried to make anything. Meanwhile all of my fellow students have tried stuff out. There was an Indie Grants film being made on our campus, and we had an opportunity to sign up to work on it. However, at the time I was busy with my first school internship and other things, so I admittedly fell through on applying. I essentially spent 3 years being taught only how to record an interview and edit a news package, with minimal film experience, which worries me. I could start out working in TV/media, since that's the bulk of my teaching, but even what I was taught there was pretty basic too. I read about directors like Scorsese and others, and they all started out networking with classmates in school and making short films. I feel like I screwed myself over by being too shy, or not really knowing what I wanted to do at the time.  I've also recently developed an interest in art, specifically installation type stuff, which I'd like to pursue as a hobby/possible second job, but again, I have zero experience or knowledge.

Or retry next year?,one_bolshevik,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/f4mhda/apply_to_ms_applied_econ_programs_with_a_very/,"I'm applying to some top 30 Ms Applied Economics programs, so the quant score is important. The deadlines are coming up around the March - April window, so retaking the GRE for this round is not an option. I took the GRE a second time today: 165V 151Q. My first score was 159V 150Q. I didn't really study the first go. On the second go I studied for quant for 3 months and studied the verbal for maybe one afternoon tops, so I'm feeling discouraged that the one score that matters didn't really improve. I just... don't test well in math. Actually I should say I don't test well in any subject- I had to have test accommodations in undergrad due to a learning disability- but especially math. Anyway, while I'm licking my wounds and all that, I would love some insight from y'all about how my application season is gonna look with this new drawback.

Here's what I look like on paper: I am 3 years out of school. I haven't worked in my field; I've been a bartender in my small town because I had to move back near my parents to take care of my dad. But I've taken (and aced) some coding classes to re-enter academia and to learn industry-specific technical skills, started a coding club at my community college, and interned for a law firm in the meantime. I want to apply my skills and experience to an applied econ program with a focus in public policy. I have a 3.46 undergrad GPA, I did well in my math and stats classes in undergrad (UC Santa Cruz), I have a solid LoR from my internship, and a solid LoR from a comp sci professor that I hope will bolster my math cred. I'm hoping my LoRs and writing samples (and obviously SoP) will save me. If I press on with applications this season: do I have a decent chance? How do I fluidly bring up and explain my quant score in my SoP? And I don't know what I don't know, so add anything else to consider! Any insight is welcome!

I am an It certification instructor AND former CompTIA employee. I was their Manager of Training Operations in 2017-2018.   
I'd like to give you a little insight to the soul of CompTIA...  
CompTIA is a non-profit organization. If you visit CompTIA headquarters in Downers Grove, Il, you'd find a LARGE group of liberal degrees and interns that have ZERO knowledge of the IT world. That's a cold, hard fact.   
The good people who make the exams are VERY segregated from most of the CompTIA staff.   
The certifications are an amazing bridge that allows people to break into the IT world and gain crucial IT FOUNDATIONAL knowledge in the IT world. Don't hate the certs because of this political stance made by WHOEVER at CompTIA.  Get your certs, and remember that you're using them to better YOURSELF. My advice is this......    After your CompTIA A+, Network+ and Security+, you can now decide which field you'd like to focus on...     A+ is a lot of hardware..   focus on servers...   dive into CLOUD tech! (AWS, azure, whatever!)   
If networking is your passion, Cisco CCNA and beyond offer you unlimited career advancement...   
If you love security...  CompTIA offers more Security certs, but don't forget about others...  (e.g... CEH)  


Please, fellow nerds, IGNORE the politics. CompTIA's opinion of political issues means nothing. TRUST ME.   


Stay motivated and get certified!"

I think I had a 2.7 and lower  at some points. Part of it was I didn't like my major nor my classes.  Another part was &lt;me&gt; trying to accumulate, and my friends the  structured group I grew up with... was gone. In short summary, I fucked  up, but I adjusted.

About  2 years ago, I realized things weren't gonna work out. I mean who would  want a 2.7? Hell, not even labs wanted me for free work. So I switched  my major even though I was maybe 2 (max 3) semesters from graduating.

I  liked my new(er) classes. I enjoyed the material. Part of it was that I  learned how to struggle through something(s) I didn't like, to force  myself to  go through the content and master it. I joined a research lab  my 2nd semester transferring (into the new major), and eventually got a  PURA grant, which in the scheme of things isn't much but it is *something.*

I maintained a 3.5+ my last 5 semesters here, and now have a \~3.04.

Now all I have left is 2.5 months till I graduate. Problem is, I have no clue what I am going to do.

I've  attended all the last few career fairs, company events. Have written at  least over 500 applications to positions I been interested and  partially interested in. I've heard back, but nothing solid with some  ghosting. Some companies havn't even checked my resume when I look online, I probably got  filtered.

I  would like to attend grad school I think. I realized that I know so  little, and bachelor's has basically given me a crash course on the  things that happen within the industry. I've delayed my grad school  apps, my gpa wasn't the greatest anyways and maybe I can make it to a  \~3.1, which to me sounds a whole lot better than a 3.04 or a 2.98. I've  been studying for the GRE in my free time, and while it has been slow I  think I can do well.

I am not sure what I ll do at this point. I guess it's time to start applying to stuff I *don't* like. Maybe look for some other productive/experience outside of internships while I apply for Spring/Fall 2021 Master's programs or Jobs.

But  this post isn't about that. It's about where I was and where I am now. 2  years ago, I was at the rock bottom, about to get another C in a class I  didn't particularly care about. Don't give up. It'll get better. Be  proactive and it will make a difference. (Special Thank you to the  professor who gambled on a kid who had a 2.8 and randomly  wanted to  join his research)

Glad that's off my chest. THWG and may you do well on your midterms.

TLDR: I fucked up my first two years, fixed it somewhat in the last two years. Now looking for a job or masters program. Hopeful, I am even graduating on time. Even if you screw up you can fix things (mostly\*)!

Please share. See mine below.

TL; DR

I completed a local coding bootcamp in 2019. I did not feel prepared for the local job market after completing the program, so I spent eight months learning on my own afterwards before actively looking for work. After about five weeks of aggressively applying to jobs in four different cities in my region of the country (SoCal &amp; Southwest), I found a job in my own city. In 2020 as a bootcamp grad, you will likely need to be open to relocation to wherever you can find a job, depending on your circumstances.

Full Story

Prior to the bootcamp, I had what most people would consider to be a solid career complete with a nice six-figure salary. But I didn’t love my job, and after a while I realized I just didn’t want to do it for the next 30+ years. After considering various career options, I decided to give coding a shot by doing some online learning with CS50. I really took to coding and found it was something I would love to do for work. Unfortunately, my job was too demanding and time-consuming to realistically become a job-ready programmer on my own time, so I chose to go down the bootcamp path.

Choosing a bootcamp was easy because my options were limited. I wanted an in-person bootcamp that would maximize my chances of employment in my local area soon after graduating. I live in a large-ish city with an ok tech scene, but without any big-name bootcamps. The program I chose was a local no-name that would accept anyone with tuition money and a pulse. It seemed to be connected to the local startup scene and guaranteed an internship at the end. The program was 12 weeks + a 4 week internship (although this could usually be extended). The bootcamp itself was a React/RoR full stack program. I completed the program including the internship in May 2019.

**Here is when I had a reality check.** I started looking for jobs, but the market for junior developers in my city was thin. I also found there were hardly any Rails jobs, let alone junior Rails jobs. There was plenty of React work, but it was mostly mid-senior level, and I felt like I was less than a junior. I applied to a few jobs here and there, and I got a couple of tech screens, but I bombed the LeetCode-style algorithm questions (they both involved recursion/BSTs, which I knew little about). After this I spent some time aimlessly practicing LeetCode and building a project, but it really didn’t get me anywhere because it didn’t solve the problem of not qualifying for positions to begin with due to my lack of knowledge outside of the React/RoR tech stack.

Around July 2019 I realized I was hopeless unless I learned a technology that had more demand for junior devs in my area, so I ended up settling on C#/.NET. I spent the next six months learning C# and .NET full time (50+ hours per week) through a bunch of Udemy courses and building a few projects on my own with .NET Core servers and a couple of different front-end frameworks. I also stumbled into learning TypeScript and gained a much deeper understanding of JavaScript through various courses.

In late November 2019 I started becoming anxious about finding a job, so I fired off a few applications and landed a local on-site interview for a junior Angular position. I had a lot of time to prepare for the interview due to the holiday schedule. The interview ended up lacking any algorithm questions whatsoever, and I felt that I had performed pretty well overall, but I still didn’t get the job. What I did walk away with, however, was a better understanding of the dev interview process. I had been so nervous about being asked to write searching and sorting algorithms because of my first two interviews, but I didn’t realize that most interviews don’t even touch on this stuff.

As soon as I got home from that interview, I came up with a new strategy, which was to apply to literally every job in my tech stack that I felt remotely qualified for in SoCal and the Southwest. I really didn’t want to move to a different city because my wife cannot leave our current city, and my relocation for work would certainly cause undue stress on our marriage. But at this point I was completely prepared to move if offered a good enough job. I would just need to rent a room in the new city and take a cheap flight home every weekend at my own expense for an indefinite period of time. The reality was that I needed to start my dev career, and being unemployed this long had made me very anxious about the future of my career. If anything, applying to jobs I qualified for, even in other cities, provided a therapeutic benefit.

Casting a wider net in terms of skillset and geography proved to be a success. I started getting calls, and then interviews and all of the practice that comes with interviewing. After five weeks of this strategy, I accepted an offer from a small company in my city for a higher salary than I had hoped for. Lucky me.

I can’t help but believe I had an advantage in obtaining interviews to begin with compared to your average bootcamper. My resumé includes a BA from a very well-respected university and a track record of success in a couple of serious non-tech roles with plenty of responsibility. Other than certain types of technical questions, I was never afraid of interviewing because previous roles acclimated me to interacting with c-level executives. The same cannot be said about some of my cohort-mates. I believe with every bone in my body that the ones who don’t have degrees, don’t have real professional experience, and who can’t fake an outgoing personality, are facing an uphill battle. The bootcamp experience may have been a ticket for these folks in the past, but I believe the market has since shifted.

Overall, I’m ambivalent about the bootcamp experience. On the one hand, I found a lot of value in the environment and guidance it provided upon my entrance into this industry, and I’m sure I learned far more quickly than I would have on my own. It also gave me legitimate experience to include on my resumé, which I believe was incredibly valuable when applying for real jobs. On the other hand, I feel somewhat cheated. What bothers me most is the large disparity between the job placement numbers they provided prior to enrollment and what I’ve actually seen. Also, the wages of the few graduates that have actually landed dev jobs after graduating seem to be very low, but that seems to be more of a problem related to my expensive, but low wage city.

My Lessons

* The market for junior devs is flooded due to the volume of bootcamp and CS graduates. There is no “tech shortage” for entry level positions. Competition is fierce.
* A student with limited coding experience prior to entering a bootcamp is very unlikely to be prepared for the job market upon completion of the program.
* **Bootcamps may not be as successful at job placements as they once were**. My own experience and research since completing the program reveals a totally different picture of outcomes compared to what I found prior to enrolling. A year out, most of my cohort-mates still haven’t found dev jobs. One point worth mentioning is most of the bootcamp success stories I’ve read about on Reddit are now several years old. I haven’t read about as many success stories in the last couple of years.
* Your bootcamp’s tech stack is very important. I probably would have landed a job much sooner if there was more demand for the tech I learned in the program. Bootcamps shouldn’t be teaching RoR these days. It’s more of a distraction than anything. Full stack JS would probably make the most sense.
* Not all dev interviews are the same. They vary greatly in difficulty and style. I had interviews that were 100% technical and 0% behavioral and others that were 90% behavioral and maybe 10% technical.

Advice

* You need to think long and hard about what will work for you. How much of a financial runway do you have and how willing are you to relocate for a job? There is an inverse relationship between how long you can afford the financial and emotional costs of unemployment and your need to cast a wider geographical net for more job opportunities. **If you insist on staying in your current city, you may be unemployed for a year or more AFTER you complete your bootcamp. Are you prepared for that?**
* Even if you don’t intend to leave your local metro area, apply to jobs in other areas for the interview practice, if nothing else. Practice may not always make perfect, but you will perform a hell of a lot better in the interviews that matter once you’ve gone through the routine with a few companies that don’t matter to you. You will also avoid burning bridges with local companies and make those local interviews really count when it’s game time.
* Don’t believe anything your bootcamp tells you about job placement statistics. Just assume it’s all bullshit. **If your main concern is a quick job placement, attend a selective bootcamp (e.g., Hack Reactor, App Academy, etc.) and be willing to move ANYWHERE once finished.** If you can’t leave your city of choice, keep saving money and study lots of JS, HTML, and CSS on your own until you can afford a long stint of unemployment.
* Learn about the most popular tech stacks and determine which ones have the highest demand for junior developers in your local area. If your city has a bootcamp that teaches that tech stack, choose that bootcamp (all other things equal). I chose to learn C#/.NET after my bootcamp for a couple of reasons. First, there seemed to be some demand for juniors with these skills. But more importantly, C# and .NET are not often pursued by new developers because bootcamps and CS programs usually do not teach them. Bootcamps tend to focus on the hottest JS/Ruby/Python/FOTM frameworks and CS programs tend to use a lot of Java and Python. You need to find a way to differentiate yourself.
* **If you’ve completed a bootcamp (or a CS degree) and are now looking for a job, stay positive, and for the love of god, don’t fucking give up.** There were many times during my journey when those negative thoughts crept up on me. What helped most was to shove those feelings away and keep grinding. It may sound lame, but often when I had hints of negative thoughts, I would simply think about whatever I was currently learning. It feels good to think about something you learned today that you didn’t know yesterday. When you’re dwelling on the bad, you’re not working towards your goal. When was the last time you worked on an app or solved a LeetCode problem WHILE you fretted over not finding work? Probably never. Give all of your effort to succeeding.
* For most people, building projects will go further than practicing LeetCode. I understand this is different at top firms, but whiteboarding/algorithm questions are pretty basic at most companies. No interviewer will ever care about the last LeetCode you solved if it wasn’t specifically for the interview, but you bet your ass they’ll be interested in your project if you can bring it up in an answer to one of their questions. Not only do you learn a ton from building projects, but they are also wonderful conversation pieces, and you can use them to show your enthusiasm.

Anyway, I really hope my story can be helpful to somebody, and I'm also very curious about experiences other people have had in the last couple of years (no older than 2018, for example)."

For the sake of brevity, I'll give you guys the cliff notes.

26m outside of NYC. Undergrad Marketing and Information Systems 12-16' from decent private catholic uni in Maryland, 3.5 GPA, lots of student loans. Started small business out of school while concurrently pursuing MBA, graduated in 17'. Continued the small business which overall didn't amount to much more than freelancing- all profits went back into the business so I didn't really get to save much. \*Almost\* hit it big with a very large entity in my area (long story short drone technology business- almost got a contract for construction monitoring a very large ongoing project in my area.)

Around Summer 2018 had a psychiatrist rapid taper me off Klonopin and my adhd meds which put me in an absolute depressive/anxious tailspin nervous breakdown I've struggled to recover from to this day (primarily because I'm tapering off SSRI slowly which keeps ripping open that original psychological wound from jumping off klonopin). I wasn't able to answer the phone, answer texts or even leave the house for about 6 months. I did in fact make a bit of a recovery but there's no doubt I still struggle to this day. I started an IT job in Summer '19 to help pay off debts (mainly credit card but student loans are very much lingering). I don't want a career in IT but this was the fastest thing I could get to help get me back on my feet after 6 months of basically unemployment. I still have the ""business"" alive on the side as a mature side hustle I do on the weekends but think it would be smart to pursue a career in NYC; it would go a long way to help my depression as well.

1. Looking for feedback as to bouncing back from intense depressive periods.
2. I had a great internship 5 years ago now in Product Development, and I'd love to continue down that route but it's honestly too much of a gap to even qualify for an analyst position.
3. Should I just suck in my ego and apply for internships? I'm still wide open as to my ultimate path.
4. How bad does this look to potential employers and how can I spin the really ugly period of mental health. It's also somewhat of an ongoing battle.
5. I feel ancient at the age of 26, am I being silly?"

I graduated from telecommunications and network engineering last December, I have a Cisco CCNA certification and studying to get a CCNP cert, I'm 30 yo, I'm from Latin America and I would like to work in Ireland.

Now I'm in the middle of a two-months internship at a university working as IT support technician but I need a real full time job and I don't like the idea of starting my career in my home country for a bunch of reasons.

I've got a limited budget to make it to Ireland, just enough to get there, live for a couple of months and pay for the immigration fees. The thing is that the work permit (Critical Skills) requires a job offer or a contract for 24 months at least and a wage over EUR $30.000 per year. I've been applying for a lot of jobs but in two months I haven't even passed the first filter on any of them. And I understand why I'm not a good candidate, I don't have experience, I don't have a legal permit to work there, I'm not even in the same continent to get a presential interview. Plus, the work permit takes 12 weeks to be approved so I wouldn't be an option even if the company is desperated because I won't be able until 3 months after.

I know there's the student work pemit but it creates a very complicated situation for me. I don't think it's worth it. That's why I'm asking if anyone knows if going there would improve my chances."

It’s pretty simple but I still have my doubts and everyone seems to have their own different opinions on the matter.

I work for my university on the cyber security team and more or less do a good job every day (This is relevant later on) 

About a week ago I’m at a forum discussing internship opportunities for cyber security. At the end I asked some questions about the field, what tools this company uses to investigate crimes, etc. After I finish a guy who I know who also works in IT comes over to me and says “Man, do you really work in the SOC (Security Operations Center)? Because your questions and things you said really suggest otherwise! Haha like I can’t believe that you don’t know what tools the industry uses! You made so many weird decisions during our game (we played a security game there too) and I’m just not convinced you really work for the SOC.” 

I stayed quiet and said things like “yep” and “mhmm”. What I wanted to say was “dude, did you only come over here to tell me how bad an entry level guy is at his job?” I knew I wouldn’t be able to articulate this in time though and would end up looking even more dumb if I tried.

What’s best in a given situation? Should I try and think of witty comebacks for when people insult me or tell me I’m not good enough? Or is it better to just say nothing?"

I stopped interviewing with other companies after getting the job offer in which has been delayed without any tentative starting date. 

As an international student can not afford the luxury of just sitting home and waiting for their call hoping to start my job as soon as possible. I have been planning to pay my expenses from work which supposed to start two months ago, instead i got email say “due to delay in project they can not get proper funding for my position”, btw this is one of the top IT companies. 

I’m in position that is too late to go back to school and all my peers are working while i am desperately waiting. I could not just start looking for part-time job because they have been pushing it every week. 

I feel like the company could have notified me earlier so i would have a chance to go back to school or apply for other jobs before it is too late.

I strongly believe i should be compensated for the time and opportunity and financial burden that this whole situation has caused me. 

I was wondering if I have a enough reason to get compensated for my time?

Tldr: co-op company have been delaying start date for two months, now I missed my chance to go back to school or apply to other jobs. Do I have enough reason to get compensated for the loss of time and opportunity?"

I want to be an investment banker, before that I may go to pursue a Master in finance in UK.

I just got two internship offer for this summer, the first is Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office at London, responsible for Economic research. The second one is ibd intern in a Chinese Bank, for Equity capital markets.

What HKETO attracts me are the international exposure and the unique working experience in UK.

And the ibd intern in that Chinese bank is very straightforward that I need some ibd internship experience to start my career in investment Banking.

Which one would you recommend me to take? My future ibd employer would prefer someone with more international exposure and unique experience? Or simply want someone with experience? 
As well, would the internship experience in London give me a higher chance to get into the top master in finance in UK? 

Btw, I hv not yet let that chinese ibd employer that my school is ending in July because I am having exchange study in Europe. So I may only be able to work for less that 2 months. Or work till September if they are willing to accept. Would it affect my offer? Does the ibd employer reli care the availability or it is flexible and subject to candidate?

Thank you if u have read all my enquiry and Please help! Many thanks if someone is willing to share with me. Thanks!!"

f588hb,4,2020-02-17,College Student Asking For Help,tacolover9719,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/f588hb/college_student_asking_for_help/,"First, I’d like to say hello and thanks for looking at my thread. I’m not sure if I’ve posted in this subreddit before. I know I’ve posted on a couple different mental health-related subreddits over the last year or so. I apologize in advance for my long post: I’m a naturally long-winded person.

Some background: I’m a junior at a four-year state university studying journalism. Throughout my entire teenage years (high school and time here) I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety, which runs in my family. I was medicated and receiving regular treatment until I lost my insurance in June 2018. Ever since, things have been rough - especially last year. Last April, I unexpectedly lost my mother. In addition to that traumatic experience, I had to endure the fallout (and threats, demeaning remarks, etc.) from her family. Around the same time my mentor was forced out of our university, making him move; I lost my job and also most of my friends graduated.

It was a really rough time. I was able to manage and after months of counseling (thankfully our school offers some on-campus solutions to students for free) I eventually was able to get over my mom’s death and the fallout from her family.

Last semester was somewhat of a struggle. Ever since summer 2019, I’ve lost almost all interest in journalism. (It was almost like someone flipped a switch; I went from being really interested in journalism and active in our student newspaper - where I worked, to having no interest in journalism and not being active in anything.) The journalism professor who replaced my mentor is a stickler who I don’t get along with on most days. Unlike my mentor and most other professors, he regularly writes condescending and demeaning remarks on my work. Although there were times where he was nice and helpful. I finished out the semester with a 3.8 GPA for the semester; all As except for his class.

This semester has been even worse. My burnout/disinterest has progressed, and I’ve felt really exhausted this semester. Even though I’m only taking 12 credit hours (last semester I took 14 hours, and before that I usually took 16 hours) it feels like I’m taking more. I’m constantly exhausted and worn out, regardless of how much sleep I get (and how good that sleep is.) I’ve been eating well and trying to get exercise when I can.

I have the same professor this semester for a higher level (4000 level) journalism course, and things so far haven’t been going smoothly in that class. He wants us to do an article every two weeks, and wants us to write blog posts every week. In addition, he wants us to do video packages, slideshows and other things on top of that. As it is, it’s a struggle just doing the two assignments for his class. (I work two on-campus jobs, which really restricts the hours I can do interviews for his projects.) 

To make things worse, we haven’t started the semester on the right foot. The very first assignment went well. However, the blog posts did not. He gave the assignment at the end of a class and I must have missed the assignment word limit. I went onto our student portal and couldn’t find the assignment guide listed anywhere. After submitting the assignment, he wrote me an extremely condescending email. I met with him and it didn’t go anywhere. I told him how I felt about the email, and he essentially played the “reverso” card and made himself look like the victim - claiming I wasn’t paying attention, etc. Essentially, the meeting ended in an impasse and didn’t help anything.

I made great strides last semester in improving my GPA and I’m afraid this semester is just going to destroy that progress.

I also have to find (and complete) an internship before I can graduate. I’m not sure if I can do an internship, at least not in my current state.

Sometimes I get upset about the burnout and disinterest in journalism. I used to really enjoy doing it, and a lot of people liked my work. A lot of people got to know me because of it. Now, I’ve become another face in the crowd and have no interest in it. It feels like a chore just to do it for class. I sometimes feel like I was replaced. Now the student newspaper is thriving under new leadership and I’m not a part of it (and don’t want to be), whereas when I was a part of it our staff was quaint and struggling to stay afloat.

On top of classes and journalism, even things that I used to enjoy in my personal life have become a chore. Before this class (even before I became a journalism major) I ran a personal blog where I talked about things I wanted to talk about. I used to really enjoy it. Now, I don’t have the energy, time or desire to add things to it. Ironically, I now **have** to do it for my class.

I’m constantly exhausted. I feel both my memory and thinking/cognitive skills have declined over the last couple years, especially recently. There’s sometimes where it’s hard to remember what I had for lunch that day, or remember what I need to do.

If you’re still here, I guess I’m just asking for advice on how to manage my stress levels and how to solve my exhaustion problem. Also possibly how to deal with this professor and my burnout. I’m currently working with an on-campus counselor (though, TBH, not a very good counselor; it’s a grad student) to get some assistance until I can (hopefully) move on to a more professional local clinic that has a sliding pay-scale. (I was going to do that over Winter Break but couldn’t get around to it.)

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I’ve talked about my anxiety a little bit over on r/Anxiety but have got very few responses.

Edit: Also forgot to mention that I’m also under a lot of financial stress, as well. Last semester I had to take an ER visit, which has put me over $3k in the hole. I’ve found a way to pay the debt under a (somewhat) affordable monthly payment system, but still nonetheless an issue. One reason I have to keep my two jobs; I can’t afford to lose any hours."

- I tried a bit of coding, and I kinda like it. What should I do to get better at it?

f59iks,164,2020-02-17,Im so lost right now I literally have no idea what to do with my stupid life,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/f59iks/im_so_lost_right_now_i_literally_have_no_idea/,"Hello, I'm 22 Years old male, English is not my native language so bear with me please. 

I took a professional electrotechnician course on high school and that was totally not what I was looking for but was forced to do because of the thing I wanted to do at the moment was full of students, I wanted to take a course on IT, which is a thing I really like. 

Im also not really physically built or a fan of physical activities so yeah, I'm physically weak even if I workout... I've been also depressed these last years, Im an introverted guy and not haven't motivated at all but I've been trying my best these last years to move on with my life.
So I ended up finishing the course anyway, and ended up doing an Internship on my fathers place (motorcycle shop) which was in this case not a thing I was willing to work all my life on as well but I decided to give it a try because the course I took in high-school was definitely not for me because I discovered I had acrophobia (fear of heights) I really become paranoid about it and I can't even cross bridges without fearing for my life.

So fast-forward the ending of the internship, it was totally not for me and my relationship with my father wasn't that great either and my parents are divorced etc...
After all that I had my high-school done, I thought about getting my drivers license, which I did later even though I'm not a big fan of driving and tried job hunting... It never led to nothing, only some years later when I had 20 Years old I got something and all the ""jobs"" I got was basically from people I knew, like working part time on a grocery store loading and unloading trucks with stuff for 10€ a day from 3AM until 12 or a full time restoration job which I got 1 year ago which paid 30€ a day with rights to basically nothing which I eventually quit because I got sick and almost got in an accident , I had no insurance and all that stuff people normally get on these types of jobs, so I opted out.

Now Im completly lost, I have 22 Years old, I've been leeching of from my Mother on the house of my recently deceased Grandmother and I need to find something to work on, which motivates me and keeps me going.
I feel like everything is so damn complex to join in and even people which take years studying for their dream job and what to do never even get a job for what they want and if they get it its because they know people working on the place.

I've been thinking about studying coding, IT related stuff, since I'm an introvert as well this might be something for me, I heard Python coding is a really nice way to start but I'm having my doubts, should I do it?

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Life of a 22 Year old introverted, depressed and physically weak guy went wrong so far, took a course in high school about something he totally not wanted and isn't competent enough to do because the course he wanted was full on all the schools around him, took a internship on his father place which went wrong because of family issues as well and only got shitty jobs... Currently he is leeching of his mother on his recently deceased grandmothers house and has no idea what to do with his life, thinking about IT, Python coding but has no good idea of where to start and if it will eventually get him a job."

I started coding for fun when I was around 8-9, and seriously pushed around 13-14. A couple points I need advice on though: 



**0.5. Should I even be trying to find an internship right now?** My parents are pretty against the idea, and told me that getting an internship at my age won't be any good. They will support me if I do go through with this though. 



**1. I don't know how good/bad I am.** I'm familiar with unit testing, MVC, AJAX, Generics, abstraction, DI, decorators, general basic stuff I guess. I'm mainly familiar with Python, Java, and C#, but I've gone around and dabbled in C++(UE4), Typescript, ruby, Arduino (by the way, do people actually care about how many languages?). Haven't touched many frameworks though. I have no frame of reference for how good/bad I am relative to other people, hopefully someone could help me get a more accurate perspective.



**2. In my country, 99%(not actual stat) of internship positions are open to college students only. Should I ignore this and apply anyway?** This is because high schoolers that want to pursue college within the country have to take a huge entry test, and in our culture higher education is very encouraged, so high schoolers are told to take free time to study. I've already decided to go to college out of the country, and won't need to take this entry test, so the reasoning wouldn't apply to me. 



Any words of advice are appreciated, encouragement or not, I just want a more realistic and accurate view of everything, please help"

I have been planning to focus on Business Intelligence as a career, which would require me to do Masters after my bachelors.

I had chosen to write my bachelors about Business Intelligence. I have only had 2 lectures related to this, one of which was programming, which means there were not that much conceptual aspects related to the topic.

I have taught myself some programming in SQL/R/Python during my free time and had experience as Business Intelligence intern. I thought I have interest in this area and can write a project about this and learn a lot by writting. However, my supervisor gave me a lot of theoretical contributions that are way too technical for me right now.

I have read around 300-400 pages of material i have never covered in my studies and I do not understand a lot of things there. It is more like 80-85% Computer Science and 20-15% Business. I have written aroun 10-15% of the project, which mainly just intro to research methods, concepts etc.

I am not sure what can I do, I am stressing out right now and I am very anxious and depressed of this. I was hoping that i chose a topic i am interested in, but realized i dont know anything about it (purely from theoretical/academical perspective).

Am I overexaggurating? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you think it is too late to change the topic (I have 2 and half months left until deadline to write 100k characters if i started from scratch)? What else can I do , any tips ?"

I've had to do a few internships where I work 40+ hours/week and I just fucking cannot. I get depressed a month in and stay home and eventually leave with my tail between my legs after working just enough to get credit for it and pay off rent. I've tried working in my field (CS), working at a factory, working retail, so much shit and it's all awful. Any time I think about working full time for more than a couple months I absolutely consider putting a bullet through my brain to be a much much better alternative (I won't, I'm not currently suicidal). I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do for the rest of my life, but I don't think I can."
f5i5tk,3,2020-02-17,"Given today’s economy, is it expected to intern before even being considered for FT?",theCavemanV,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f5i5tk/given_todays_economy_is_it_expected_to_intern/,"Hi all,

I’m a recent grad from a Master’s program in Montreal, Canada. I have noticed that companies don’t hire for FT software devs anymore, only retaining some of the interns that they like. 

Is this just in Montreal or Canada? 

Does anybody else feel the same?

I used to see job posting for new grads, but now either hiring for senior devs or interns. I reached out to a recruiter at a big Canadian company headquartered in Ottawa. the HR even confirmed that they expect new grads who never worked there to get an internship in order to be considered for FT afterwards.

TLDR: Would you have to complete an internship at a company just to be considered for a FT opportunity at the same company?

Edit:  I have done 3 internships already. I’m talking about breaking into a company that I haven’t interned at."
f5ip3w,0,2020-02-17,Think I may have taken on too much responsibility this semester,xavierelon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f5ip3w/think_i_may_have_taken_on_too_much_responsibility/,"I’m a senior CS student. I’m taking classes part time (20hrs/week), I run a business to the pay my bills which takes about 15-20 hrs/week and I took on two unpaid internships, one which is a local non profit (18 hrs/week) - they put me on the backend of a web app that has barely been worked on. The backend entities were completely wrong from what they showed us in the UI so me and one other intern are expected to recreate an entire backend for a huge project very similar to LinkedIn in 2 months and they don’t seem to understand how hard that is and how much they are demanding from INTERNS in such a short period so I feel completely overwhelmed there and it doesn’t help that I don’t have much backend experience. 

My second internship is unpaid for also but it’s for an AI company creating an application in python for a smart crypto trader which is a minimum of 20hrs/week. The boss is very nice but has said how hard this internship will be as the content is very challenging. I was thrown a bunch of content to learn which I did and then thrown their repository and things that need to be done with very little guidance or explanation so I haven’t written any code yet, it’s mostly me trying to figure out what the hell is going on. 

So I feel like I’m constantly working and always behind. It’s overwhelming and stressful and I’m really starting to wonder if I’d be better off and happier dropping one internship and studying things that would help me get a job later in the year when I graduate and working on my own projects. What do you guys think?"
f5ipev,1,2020-02-17,"A $75,000 mistake...",40bergJ,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f5ipev/a_75000_mistake/,"Hi. So this past August I started law school, a top 50 school. I have a reasonable academic scholarship, but I still have to take out about $75,000 in loans throughout my first year. I did well on my first semester, while working weekends, and admittedly not giving it my all. Only problem is, I hate it. Even more so I am realizing I do not want to litigate at all. 
I have “wanted to go to law school” since I was a child. I was always a precocious kid who loved reading and writing. School always seemed too easy for me. My mother went to college, but never did anything with her degree, and my father dropped out of college. I am a first generation law student. I’m not sure I even really spoke to a lawyer before I began law school. 
I’m not sure what prompted my desire to go to law school. It definitely was a combination of being a good writer, loving reading, and having a strange fascination with America’s Constitution and founding since I was a child. I even did a research project in the fifth grade where I dressed up as Sandra Day O’Connor. 
Whenever I said I wanted to go to law school over the next ten or so years, I received nothing but encouragement— I was so convinced it was a good idea that it became part of my identity. I began seeing myself with a career in Constitutional law, thinking this was way more of a lucrative “career” than it was.
When it was time to go to college, I went to a decent school in Washington, DC because this is where I wanted my career to be. I chose to major in philosophy, thinking it would make me standout to the other students who would later apply to law school, who would mainly be political science majors.
College was amazing. I majored in philosophy, I minored in history and German. I completed the honors sequences in philosophy and theology, I worked as a German tutor and a writing tutor. I loved it. I loved learning, I loved writing research papers. I LOVED DC. I had a pretty good social life, and a great academic life. 
As I started my senior year, registered to take the LSAT and began working on law school applications, I started to feel a nagging suspicion that something wasn’t right, a feeling I continually pushed down. I’m not sure why— maybe it was the admissions websites of law schools, which seemed to advertise their schools towards people who had no interest in the history or theory of the law, which had nothing to do with really being passionate about jurisprudence at all. In my darker moments I wondered if I would be happier eventually getting my doctorate in philosophy, going into academia. I had professors tell me I was suited for this, that my love of writing and my love of hanging out long research papers for no reason other than an enjoyment in reading endless articles and books and revising my own work incessantly would help me do well in the “publish or die environment”... but still. I was going to law school. It was part of my identity. I figured, I would keep a career in academia, in philosophy or history, as a backup plan, if I didn’t get into law school. So, I only applied to a few. Three reaches, a safety, and two middle of the line schools. I got waitlisted to a four, accepted to two. I chose the school I did based on the academic scholarship offered and the cost of living in the area— i was leaving DC. 
I started law school, and a few weeks in I realized with an awful, sinking feeling that yes, it was as much work as people say, but not because it was intellectually challenging, or even stimulating... but because it was a huge volume of extremely dry, didactic, monotonous work, under a very high pressure environment. Law school is an endurance test. At first, I took solace in reading that the first year’s classes are just boring, they exist to pound out the fundamentals, teach you pattern recognition and role application. I hoped it would get better, but it’s so formulaic, the education....
And it’s not even the Socratic seminar style that bothers me, Like some students. As a philosophy major, at least two or three classes every semester were Socratic seminar style.’lm comfortable with that. I just feel like I’m dragging my feet, like I’m sleepwalking. 
I was also starting to feel socially isolated however. Aside from the non traditional students, most of my peers seemed to be extremely privileged. 23 years old and still having their parents pay their rent, and such.
Meanwhile, I bartended weekends, and even with my loan, scrimped and saved and agonized over things like buying a blazer or nice shoes for a networking event. A lot of them were also single, enjoying getting drunk and then gossiping about hookups with the people in my section. I am in a loving, committed relationship. I tried to relate, but couldn’t. Soon, my friendships that I had begun to make started to falter, as my peers all bonded over going out drinking, breweries during the day on weekends, going to bars and throwing parties at night, while i served other people drinks for tips. I hate to say that even if I didn’t work, I sort of hoped that social atmosphere was behind us all. I had a wild social life my first two years of college, which I soon realized my junior year that I had outgrown— it began damaging my mental health, it was unsustainable. I settled down and left it behind, and couldn’t be happier.
On top of that, I had always assumed that as I found “my place” in college, after feeling like a loser all through middle and high school, I would feel like I belonged even more in law school. But I was wrong. I still came off as weird for posting on social media about politics, for loving constitutional law and history. No one seemed to care as much as I did. They all wanted to compete, do moot court and trial advocacy. Want to be in a trial atmosphere, be prosecutors. Everyone, even my career advisor, seemed to find it strange that I did not want to litigate at all. That I wanted to do research, to read and write. That I was more interested in policy, and the “how” and “why” of the law, than practicing it. My feelings of isolation and doubt grew. Walking into the library, class, and even through the halls feels like walking into the high school cafeteria and having no table to sit at, accept unlike high school, I don’t have my AP English lit professor or history professors classrooms to go eat lunch in instead. 
I began to do research, and find websites and blogs about how law school is a vocational school, it’s meant to teach you how to practice the law, it’s not meant for people fascinated by the law, by the theoretical underpinnings of it and our legal system. I began reading about “JD advantage” jobs, jobs you don’t need a JD for, but that it helps with. Some appealed to me, like legislative analysts in committees for congress, for think tanks, for lobbyists. But then I would read stuff about how you have to start out on the bottom, even with a degree, work with undergrads on Capitol Hill,’doing work you’re overqualified for, earning less money for, while saddled with thousands of dollars in student loans.
My doubts grew. If this is what I wanted to do, maybe I am in the wrong place.
And to be in academia, in law, your odds are pretty terrible if you did not go to an ivy, and to work In constitutional law, you pretty much have to go to an ivy, and excel. 
It has not helped that I have had several family troubles/tragedies in the past few months, that have severely impacted me mentally.
I was able to “compartmentalize” for a while, but between my doubts, my social isolation, losing my job because I requested too much time off to study for finals, trying to budget while finding another one, and some ongoing health problems of my own, I’m cracking.
The only joy I’ve found this entire time, that’s academic in any way, is a research paper I’ve voluntarily been working on, that wasn’t assigned for any class, or have any bearing on me at all.
I’m struggling to apply for internships because I have no desire to litigate, and outside of DC, internships that aren’t in practicing law are few and far between.
I found one, and I interviewed for it, but if I don’t get it,
I don’t know what I will do.
I can’t sleep, between my health, finances,
My family and these concerns. I can’t focus on reading case after case, trying to find some sort of interest in property law, some kind of passion in criminal law. I’m terrified. I’m terrified that I’ve made the wrong choice, that I’ve made my family proud of me for something that was a mistake, something I cannot see through. I’m terrified that I uprooted my amazing,
Wonderful significant other’s life for a mistake, as he came with me to this new city. My only solace in that is that he received a wonderful job that he quite enjoys and pay well.... so at least he benefited from this move, somewhat.
I’m terrified. I know I could push through, so pretty well, I have less than two and a half years left. I know I can buckle down and get my degree. But if it’s to go into legislating, to be a legal analyst, where my salary would likely be half of what my peers going into practice would be for the first several years, and my earning potential, while good, would still be lower, I worry that all these loans may not be worth it for just an advantage.
I seriously wish that I hadn’t gotten into any law schools, that I applied to continue studying at my undergraduate institution, to advance my degree and work towards a career
In academia.
I know I’d be happier, after talking to professors, and doctorate students I worked with in the writing center, countless times about their experience in their doctorate experience. It’s grueling and stressful, and a test of endurance too, but they were all also intellectually stimulated, and felt a spark and passion in their dissertations and work, a spark I could feel in myself whenever I was assigned a long research paper. 


TL;DR I miss writing papers, I miss philosophy.
I miss feeling engaged in my
Education, Passionate, happy. I miss relating to my peers. Even worse, I fear I made a horrible financial mistake. I fear that I am not who I thought I was my whole life. I should have never gone to law school.  I don’t know what to do."

Been taking a bunch of CS courses at Community College including the following:

* Fundamentals of Programming

* Advanced Programming

* Data Structures / Algorithms

* Discrete Math for CS

* Object Oriented Programming

* Computer Organization and Assembly (In progress)

I am about to finalize my application to the Georgia Tech Online MS in CS program for the Fall. However I am not sure if my application is strong enough. And if my some miracle i do get in, I still think i would benefit from taking additional undergrad courses, which is why I was going to take a few classes at a 4 year school (NJIT). I could take the following this summer:

* Programming Language Concepts

* Principles of Operating Systems

I would really like to get an internship / junior dev job before i finish the Masters. Would this be more achievable if i take as many undergrad courses as i can? I could possibly push the Masters start date to Spring 2021 in order to take a few extra NJIT courses in the fall. I don't want to finish the Bachelors because there's other gen ed courses i would need that i just don't see the point in taking. I just feel like i lack the foundation needed to get a job right now.

My current job is completely unrelated and I just want to leave and get into my career already."
f5j5jy,1,2020-02-17,Looking for advice going into cybersecurity.,AlexDBZ,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/f5j5jy/looking_for_advice_going_into_cybersecurity/,"As of right now I am starting my junior year as an English major but I just can't see myself do anything with it so I decided to do cybersecurity. I have no experience nor knowledge in cybersecurity but I am fascinated it what you guys do. I can see myself behind a computer so I'll be interested in the technical aspect of it.

I'm going to change my major to B.S in Information Systems and Technology and take the introduction course (Introduction to Information Technology). If I continue with this major I will be taking IST classes as well as business classes with it. 

My college has a great program for cybersecurity and have projects available every quarter and participates in competitions, so that will be the experience I can get including internships. I just feel as if time is running out and I need to make a decision right now and was hoping for some input. 

Finally after doing some research I've noticed Computer Science is a major I should go for but I hate physics and math is something I can do but I'll definitely hate my life. 

So my question is, should I be worried in what specific career path I should go for, or just do the classes and see what interest me before thinking about it. I know cybersecurity is very vast and and to say I want to do cybersecurity is very vague. I've seen all the different types of job under it. (Specifically cyberseek.org). As stated my main concern is just figuring out what to do and how to continue from here. Thanks for your guys time and if you need any more information I'll be happy to provide."

   $Me should be obvious.

   $SIT is student IT. Has held his position longer than $TIT.

   $TIT is teacher IT. Has held his position for ~4 years.

   We're all in the same room.



   I am what's essentially an unpaid intern at my high school. At least, that's what I say for simplicity. What I do has mostly been replacing various parts on laptops used there. They are student versions, which is a fancy way of saying that you could drive over it with your car and only the LCD will be broken. (True story.) Simply put, they're sturdy. Sturdy, however, does not mean fun to work on. They are frustrating. In order to replace a keyboard, everything needs to be taken out. Fun, no? Basically, having to replace multiple things to fix one laptop is tedious and quickly frustrating. 

   During the school year, a student's laptop stops charging. $SIT takes it for repairs, and gives the student a loaner. The broken laptop is given to me to fix. A common replacement is the system board, which is basically a MOBO, a CPU, RAM, and an SSD stuck onto a single part. Convenient and cost efficient? Debatable. Back on topic, though. I proceed to do the deed, and replace the board. Still doesn't charge. Fun.

   The next logical step is to make sure the new system board doesn't have an issue out of the box. I unplug everything, then put the charger back into the system board. Okay, so it blinks. Plug in the battery? The light says happy computer. So the problem might be something else. I plug everything back in (after removing the power) and take one thing out at a time, then plug in the power again. I got lucky on test 2. Ended up being the mousepad, which is connected to the part with the keyboard. Like I said, not fun. I replaced the new broken thing, and... it doesn't work. It charges, but it won't turn on. It won't bloody boot now.

$Me: It's cursed, I swear!

$TIT: What's wrong with it?

$Me: I've just replaced the upper case, after the system board still didn't work, having checked all my connections and unplugging things until it charged, and now it won't even turn on!

$TIT comes over and presses the power button. Nada.

$TIT: Well.. shit.

$Me: I know!

$TIT: Alright, maybe $SIT will have some clue for you when you come back.

   Like a good boy, I scurry off to class. When I come back, I am told by $SIT that a potential culprit might be the button board, but it usually causes charging issues, not boot. Armed with another part, I replace it. Anyone wanna guess what happened next?

   Yeah, still didn't boot. This time, it's the LCD at fault. Evidently, a bad LCD can cause boot issues. Alright, so replace that, unplug these tiny little cables, that awkward ribbon, and tha-

   I pulled too hard. Ended up breaking a cable. In my defense, it was very thin, and it separated from the connector. I tell $TIT the issue, as $SIT is out getting lunch, and a new part should be ordered soon.

   I come back, and $TIT says that $SIT said the cable was fine. I point again to the broken part of the cable. $SIT didn't look at the right part of a branching cable. Damn. The Cursed One is put to the side, as normal laptops still need to be repaired. I had developed a theory that the user had the aura of a Luddite. I even brought up a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1586/).

   I forget about The Cursed One. It had been a while. But suddenly, a box appeared on my desk when I came in. A box I wasn't familiar with. A box with a foreign part number. Could it be? I look at the laptop in front of me. It is! A replacement, finally! I get it all hooked up and ready to go. It was like finally assembling an engine and putting in the car. 

   First time I started it, it wouldn't turn over. It's a different bloody part. Again. I've replaced the system board, the seemingly faulty keyboard, the buttons board, the LCD, and the LCD cable, in that order. The battery was about to have a transplant from another broken laptop with the same original issue: not charging. Transplant says The Cursed One is charging, but still not booting. I replaced the system board on the new one, and then I had an idea. I stated my opinion on it: it was stupid, and probably won't work. I replaced the system board again. I let it charge, pressed the power button..

   ..and it started up. It lived again. Through what felt like two months, and days of working on the same thing, it worked. It was finally fixed. My torment was over, and I learned something. The moral of this story is don't trust the manufacturer to send parts that aren't faulty. Especially not ones that start with L.



   Bonus: during this time, an LCD from the same company was shipped to replace a broken part on a desktop. Not to be confused with a tower, it was an all in one deal. The ribbon cable going into the LCD wasn't plugged in properly. $TIT was not happy to take it apart just to correct the factory's mistake.

I'm fairly experienced with programming (for a high schooler), and I've learned python, java, node.JS, and swift over the past few years. If anyone knows of any opportunities, I would appreciate if you could let me know. Also if anyone just has advice in general on how to land CS-related internships in high school, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!

I also cant seem to find a solid place to find salary reports for people in this field. I could careless for the most part, but I would think 50K would be my lowest ""want"" income wise.

They would rather me do computer science, which i have taken a few programming classes, although i didnt do bad, they werent my favorite. I think a major in IT with a minor in CS will be more enjoyable to me.

So for the last couple of months I [M] have been seeing this dude [M] and all in all things are going well. Soon enough after meeting, we ditched the condoms since we were both recently tested and not seeing anyone else. This is where the fuck up stems from. 

I was offered a temporary internship in the Middle East (we’re from the Pacific North West), and we decided to spend my last day together. Everything is going well, we have sex before we have to get ready to go to the airport, and like a champ I bottom for him one last time. 

We say our goodbyes, and I’m sitting at the airport feeling sappy when I feel a tiny fart coming. I let her loose and this is when the fuck up happens. I feel this dude’s entire load coming down my thigh immediately.  My flight is boarding as this happens. I run to the bathroom in a very awkward stance as I hear numerous calls from the speaker that my flight is boarding.

It was a mess. It was just everywhere and I had to make due with toilet paper to be dry enough to spend the next 19 hours on a plane with this same pair of underwear. By the time I left the bathroom, I had to sprint to the gate and I was the last person to board the plane.

My advice? No matter how much you like the guy, wrap it up before taking a transatlantic flight.

TL;DR: Bottomed before my flight and almost shat myself and missed my flight because of it."

*DISCLAIMER* I was not chosen

I'm a Fraud and Financial Crime major with a focus on forensic accounting currently going to school in New York. A few weeks ago I applied for the Loss Prevention department of Amazon, yes the Amazon. I was lucky enough to be chosen based off my application and resume to move towards the interview process. I figured that some of you may be applying or looking forward to applying for an internship with Amazon and I'd just like to share my experience with the first interview process.

Here's what the first interview will be:

Not an interview. 

I say that jokingly and literally, because your first interview with amazon will not be with a person, but with a selection of questions on a screen, where you record yourself responding and then submit it. It sounds simple enough, which is what I though as well, but when it came down to it that lack of personal interaction that I usually thrive with in interviews was just completely absent. I was alone and stressed out, and it really showed. They offer 3 practice questions that you can run through as many times as you want. Don't get too comfortable with them, because they won't be featured in the actual interview. Each question you have 30 seconds to prepare, then the camera starts rolling and you have 3 minutes maximum to respond. I read online from other applicants to never use the full three minutes, and if anything keep it on the shorter side because these hiring agents are going through hundreds of these interview videos. So I did my best to keep each response around 1 minute. However that was my personal strategy, and obviously that didn't pay off for me, but my responses were by far the weakest responses I've ever given in an interview because of the nervousness of the digital format. When doing the interview, make sure you allocate a few hours to complete it. I practiced for about two hours, and the actual interview only took about 10 minutes. You only get one shot to record your responses, so make sure you are ready, and if you mess up or trip on your words, don't let that stop you.  My biggest flaw was that I could not focus on my reaponses while I was watching the playback of myself on the screen. It's hard to interview with yourself. It's harder than any actual interview. But it's for the most well known company in the world, so that's expected.  I won't put the exact questions because they may be different than what you get, but what you should expect is: 

1) a question about you and why you are a great fit for the position 
2) what is a big risk that you have taken that paid off
3) what is your biggest career accomplish 
4) what flaws do you see in yourself
5) what experiences do you have in (what ever department you applied for)

Hopefully this will help you guys, let my failures be your triumphs!

Good luck, internship season is coming!"

I am 21 years old. After my graduation I will be heading back to my home country to get married and will be back mid-august. To add on some more information, I do not have any internships and as far as projects go only my school projects. 

I have 2 Java projects created using javafx on my Github, a data structures and algorithm package scheduling program using python and my final capstone project which is a heart-disease prediction project using python, jupyter notebooks, and some basic JS hosted on heroku.

Now I know all that is hardly impressive and I am just like any other mediocre CS student. I don’t have any visions of grandeur or any interest in Silicon Valley. I would like to point out my lack of internships is due to me needing to work full time to support my mother, sister, and fiancé since my father passed away during my first year in my degree. I couldn’t risk my current job to look for summer internships.

My current job isn’t anything CS related either it is just a basic office admin job that helps pay the bills and allows me to support my family. So I guess my question is then what is the best location for average new grads like me to apply? Forgive me if I’m being generous calling myself “average” as I’m sure even average new grads have a couple of internships.

I am ideally open to move anywhere except for high col places like New York, California, Seattle, etc. I also do not mind working as a SWE for non-tech companies or average tech companies either. Ideally a junior java developer position, I am currently taking a course on spring through udemy and plan to dive deeper into JS and Angular after I am done going through the spring material. I also have some basic oracle sql knowledge and basic ability to utilize the oracle developer IDE.

I am hoping for a job that pays at least $60k with periodic promotions, I do not need a lot of money or a super high level job. I just want my family to be able to live comfortably and in peace. Any advice regarding my situation is appreciated. I could use all the help I can get. I apologize as well for the huge wall of text, I just have some concern regarding my families future, as they mean everything to me. Thank you so much for reading this far."

I’m stupid and screwed up some things in the past years. Should I go to a ""worse"" (university of Houston) CS school with a fresh GPA or go back to Texas A&amp;M where I screwed up my GPA - how would this effect internships? I am confident with the fresh GPA I will do well.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I’m just going to explain my story from the beginning, I made some stupid mistakes and bad decisions along the way which is why I am looking for advice. I am 21 at the moment.

Freshman year of college, in a major that I had no idea what I was doing with (allied health) at TX A&amp;M Kingsville, first semester made the dean’s list to my surprise, second semester I still did pretty well while I frantically searched for a major I was more interested in outside of physics (for some reason computer science never even came to my mind, and no one around me even mentioned it even though I have loved computers since I was 7 years old). I decided I wanted to be an entrepreneur and open an online business and I may have gotten a little ahead of myself, possibly the confidence came from how well I was doing in school when before in my life I had never done this well and I finally had seen what I could accomplish if I was determined.

After this I became obsessed with this online business and spent all day every day attempting to be successful, this obviously takes much time but I am obviously very impatient. After this I transferred to TX A&amp;M and couldn’t care less, only trying to make my parents happy while I grinded away at my online business. That’s when my grades dropped and many family fights happened, I ended up completely dropping school without telling anyone and left A&amp;M with a 0.8 GPA (second semester was a big fat 0 GPA), after leaving A&amp;M Kingsville with all As and B’s. A lot has happened since then and I realized how insane and impulsive I was being. I soon found the world of computer science and coding about a year ago and decided this is what I wanted to commit to and have been learning on my own pace on the internet. I am now in my community college and have made quite good grades, also in a chemistry and bio “harder” classes I got a 4.0 last semester with 24 credits and I got on the presidents list at my community college.


I now do not know where to apply to college, The University of Houston would be very convenient as that is where I live and could drive there from my parents house and I'd have a fresh GPA, but I have heard that A&amp;M is a better computer science program, would it be worth it going there in terms of internships if my GPA has already suffered?"

I recent started my job in one data agency at the entry level after graduation. The data agency is doing sort of social listening. Ironically, they hired me because I had written script to automate  the process of producing PowerPoint. It was my MVP to show them while I was dloing internship, but at least it works. 

Anyway, I am really confused at my job where all my colleagues don't have programming background and they use data science tool/platform to process data or filter data. From my point of view, it's quite not what I learned in uni. School projects are focusing on classification ,  optimization, algorithms, etc. However, it's more predictive datasets and my job is to deal lots of descriptive data. ( i.e. text data) 

I'm pretty upset about this situation where I didn't enjoy that much. It's pretty dummy manual stuff. I still don't understand these values of data science tools. What should i combine python or simply use python ?

The worst thing is the company expects me to do innovation outside working time.


Would like to hear more opinion from you experts on reddit?


Thanks


Edit: 
I don't think my current company has the spirit of innovation and pretty much out of date. The type of data is not suitable for many ML techniques as far as I am concerned. Perhaps, natural language processing? Possibly.

Funny thing is the company used to sell their unique database of storing one specific type. The pitch is like "" it's all validated by humans."" 

We used go have team to manually select data. But A.I is all about automation, due to my limited knowledge. I think it's interesting.


What I actually worry is the career future. Because one of senior can't find data analyst data science job  as he only knows excel but none of other tech skills. (He's rejected by lots of firms) 

Is there anyone having similar situation as me?"

f5wp4x,10,2020-02-18,Mentally Ill Mental Health Professional,Spiral_Architect63,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/f5wp4x/mentally_ill_mental_health_professional/,"Warning, long post, but I need to get this out. Hopefully this is the right place for this. I'm not really sure where to start. Also severely sleep-deprived (another ongoing problem), so I apologize for any mistakes. I was never diagnosed with any disorder as a child, although I did see a psychologist and Asperger's (Now Autism Spectrum Disorder) was mentioned several times. I know the criteria well and have felt for a long time as if I met the criteria for an Autism Spectrum Disorder, although I know that I would be considered high functioning. Up until graduate school I lived a mostly normal life. I did have a lot of social problems in school, and have always had difficulty understanding people and how they are supposed to interact with one another. I also have difficulty recognizing faces, and hypersensitivity to certain noises.

I've also always had very specific and intense interests, and am rarely interested in talking to people. I have always had high intellectual (versus social) intelligence, and was often able to do well in high school, college, and even graduate school with minimal effort. I would rarely pay attention in school unless it was something I was interested in, but never had any academic problems. I loved being in school, actually, because everything was structured. There were classes with set criteria, and so long as I completed those criteria I succeeded. I'd write a 10-20 page term paper in a day and get full points, or study for an exam the night before and ace it. Everything was so simple to understand. Anyway, that's not the point.

I became interested in psychology, and looking back it was probably to figure out what was going on with myself. I completed a Bachelor's in Psychology, but the program was geared towards research psychology instead of clinical. For multiple reasons, some known to me and others I'm still trying to figure out, I decided to pursue a Psy.D (Doctor of Clinical Psychology) and work in the clinical field. At the time I thought it was something I could do, and I didn't have any understanding of what that field was really like. First year of grad school was basically undergraduate part II, and everything was great. I passed classes and did well. But in second year I began my first clinical practicum, and started having increasing problems sleeping. I eventually got sleep medication, which treated the problem for a while.

As I progressed in the program I began to realize that I did not like clinical work of any kind. Due to that and other life stressors I began smoking marijuana, and towards the end of the program I was smoking heavily. I want to clarify that I do not blame the substance, I believe marijuana can be used responsibly, but with my personality, it became my new ""intense interest"". It made all my doubts and anxieties go away, so I kept smoking more and more of it. TV shows, music, and food were so much better when I was stoned. Also not the point though.

By the time it really hit me that there was no area of clinical psychology I was interested in, it was too late. I had already racked up way too much student debt to quit, and so I finished the program. I was initially interested in forensic psychology, which led me towards correctional psychology. I completed an internship at a jail, which I hated, and then tried to get out of the mental health field by being a tutor. But I still had a substance abuse problem and just wasn't making enough money. So I got an unlicensed postdoctoral position at a prison, moved across the country, and tried to start over. I convinced myself I could do it. I quit marijuana for awhile, but, well, the state I moved to was California, so I was there for barely a month before I started smoking again.

Working at the prison nearly drove me to suicide several times. I worked four ten-hour shifts, with Saturday, Sunday, and Monday off. I would start dreading the coming week on Sunday morning, before my weekend wasn't even half over. Monday nights I would stare at my bottles of Ambien and clonazepam and think, if I took all these pills, at least I wouldn't have to go to work tomorrow. I never did, though, just kept smoking increasing amounts of marijuana along with THC vape cartridges. I still have nightmares about that place, not even just the inmates but the administration and correctional officers too. Everything was just so horrible. After a year, I decided to move back to where I got my Psy.D and take what I thought was a lower stress and much lower paying position. I quit marijuana again and moved back, and for a little while I was recovering.

The supervisor at that position was absolutely terrible, and made not just my life but most of my coworkers' lives a living hell. She was incredibly passive-aggressive, micromanaging, and controlling to a ridiculous degree, and my mental health just continued to worsen. I started thinking about suicide again, and on top of everything there was far more financial stress than at the prison. I began smoking marijuana again, and just kept smoking more and more of it to cope. I decided that I had to get out of that position and managed to transfer to a different position with the same behavioral healthcare company that was somewhat higher paying. I had and still have no motivation or interest in becoming a licensed psychologist, even though I have the postdoc hours. Just the idea makes me nauseous. It's just too much work in a subject area I despise.

The new position was an assessment position at a crisis walk in center, which I thought was a better fit for me. My role would be to obtain information, not therapy or counseling. Again, I convinced myself I could do it. But I've been in this position a little over 6 months now, and I absolutely hate it. I don't know what made me think I could deal with mental health clients in crisis, but I was desperate to get away from a supervisor I can only describe as pure fucking evil. I hate working in the mental health field because I am too mentally ill myself, and I hate clinical work. A lot of what I wrote I didn't have insight into until recently. I still can't sleep. I quit marijuana about a week ago (which I know contributes to the sleep problems but my insomnia exists independently of that). Hopefully this time it will be for good. But now I'm at the end of my rope.

I hate my job, had to declare bankruptcy last year, and am still broke. I haven't had a girlfriend or any kind of sex in years (I'm a hetero male), and I'm so depressed I'm not even interested in sex or women anymore. I have over 400k in student debt from my degree, and the only field I'm qualified for is mental health. I can't even become a professor because I have a Psy.D and not a Ph.D. I'm just not emotionally equipped to deal with clinical work, and it keeps breaking me down. The administration here, while not quite as bad as in the other places I've worked, still sucks pretty hard.

I have also always had difficulty navigating the social aspects of the workplace, and that coupled with what is probably past and re-occurring trauma has caused me to become dysfunctional in many aspects of my life. I feel so bitter towards the mental health field that I don't even really want therapy. I've tried it, and I can see through every stupid therapeutic technique the therapist uses. It's like trying to enjoy a magic show when you are also magician and know exactly how the tricks are done.

I am beyond burned out and although I don't think I'll ever kill myself, I wish to die on a daily basis. My real passion is creative writing, and writing is probably one of the few things that keeps me alive, the hope that maybe one day I can get published and make a semblance of a living doing that. But I also know how incredibly difficult it is to make a living off of just that, especially with my goddamn student loans. I would give anything to go back in time and stop myself from entering that Psy.D program.

I don't know what to do anymore. Right now I'm just trying to make it until early March, when I'll have a two-week vacation to visit family. I can't do this job much longer, but I'm terrified of losing it and becoming homeless, like many of the clients I see. Sometimes I just go into the bathroom at work and cry. I think my current supervisor hates me, and I'm not too fond of her either. I hate my life, I hate my job, I hate my shitty neighborhood and shittier apartment, where I could never bring a woman back to even if I could get a date.

I didn't even talk about the living environment stressor, but I'll just sum it up by saying that I've woken up to gunshots many times, and once someone shot at someone else right outside my bedroom window. I also have serious issues with noise and the people in my neighborhood blast their music at all hours of the night, or blast it from their cars as they drive by. I grew up in a small town and have also really come to hate living in a city. I have regular nightmares about the jail, the prison, and even my current workplace. I wake up multiple times during the night with anxiety, and have had bags under my eyes for years. I don't even remember what a full, restful night's sleep is like.

I have very few sources of happiness in my life, and again, most of my time off is spent dreading the coming week. I don't know what the point of this post was. I just felt like getting it out. I don't care what anyone thinks of this. Maybe this is just a self-indulgent pity-party, but whatever. I am still trying to move forward, I've stopped eating junk food, because when I would smoke I would just go to town on bags of chips, candy, chicken wings, anything fried, greasy, or sweet. I've gotten back into exercising, and I force myself to get at least an hour of fresh air and sunlight a day. I'm going to move in with a friend at the beginning of March in a much better neighborhood, and I plan to stay away from marijuana for the foreseeable future. I think it's finally sunk in that it's not good for me. I'm also actively working on finishing a novel I hope to publish one day.

I've thought about maybe becoming a peer specialist. That's the last and only clinical mental health position I think I might be able to do, because it is geared for people with mental health and substance abuse disorders, and I know I have both. I've decided that applying for disability will be my absolute last resort. I don't feel like I deserve it because of my education and because I feel like I should be more functional, more responsible, stronger, I don't know. I recognize that I made many bad decisions that led me to this point, and I'm also struggling with a lot of self-loathing and regret. This may be the only post I make.

Tl;dr: I'm a mental health professional realizing that my own mental illnesses make me incapable of working in the clinical field, but it's all I'm qualified for. Trying to recover and figure out what to do and how to move forward.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the support and the karma. Even if I don't reply to all all comments I am reading them and listening."

Should I take it?,jump_off_a_building,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f5wrv1/offered_internship_nasas_jpl_w_lower_salary_than/,"I'm in my mid thirties, a self taught software developer and generally happily employed. I'm about 5 years into my career, and have worked mostly with web agencies. I decided to complete a CS degree while working, for job growth but also because I just wanted to do it. In the middle of my degree now, maybe 10 months left.

My original plan was, finish school, and then go through the whole interview process. I like my company fine for now but the projects don't challenge me enough and I expect to leave in a year or two. My pay is below market, but it isn't a huge deal to me. My company is small and good, respectful of me, very flexible and working remote is great for school.

Working at JPL has always been like a dream to me. I applied to JPL internship's mostly on a whim and because I wanted to see if they would even reply (as I've worked at small companies before. Was kind of using this as practice). Lo and behold they did, and I had a great conversation with the head of the team I would be working with, and the project he described seems really awesome, using a tech stack that I really like (and would like to do more of in the future).

Basically I got an offer for internship. It's a 10 weeks over summer.

Initially I was super excited about this. But now I'm not so sure. My current company is a really good fit for where I am in my life currently - finishing school, figuring out my next steps. I haven't spoke to my company about this, but I think there is *some* chance they would let me go and come back. But if they don't, I'm torn about taking the offer.

The salary cut isn't the most decisive factor, but whether I will have a job after. I can afford to be out of work for 3-4 months I guess, but would really prefer not to. I have an idea that having this internship with JPL on my resume will be a great thing (and would possibly help me work there in future). But maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot?

Would you take this opportunity to see where it would take you? Or ride out the next year or two at current shop, and then take your time in the interview process?"

I'm a CS senior at a state university with a 3.6 GPA. Last summer I had a summer internship at a larger tech firm out of town, they paid for my housing and everything. It was a great experience, and they offered me a full-time job after I graduate on my last day. I was really exited to hear that offer.

Fast forward to this past winter break, and I'm having serious second thoughts about moving away from all my friends and family. I started doing applications to any company in Albany that had software engineer listings on Indeed, Ziprecruiter, etc, and no responses from any of them. 

Around Christmas, I got in contact with a recruiter (a friend of a friend). He told me not to apply directly anywhere, and he will get me some interviews. We talked regularly between now and then, and he sent me an email today telling me to just accept the out of town offer and that he has nothing for me. 

I feel like I wasted my time, and my deadline for accepting offers and preparing to move is running out. I scroll on Indeed and I can't believe there's no real opportunities for a fresh out of college programmer. Is this true? Are there really no entry-level jobs? Am I missing something about this town? Should I see if another recruiter can place me?

I am about to changing my job and I have two different options. One of them is back-end web development and other one is embedded C++.  I am pretty confused about which way to go. I don't have any inclination for any of them, I can do both of them and be happy. I am just not sure which option would be wiser.   


Background: I have bachelors of Computer Engineering with 1 year experience. I did my internship on embedded software development with C but after graduated I started working as a full-stack developer.    


What do I expect from the career: Reasonable working hours and being able to switch jobs when I am unhappy with my job or the city.  


What do I think:

Web development seems to have nice perks like bigger job market, remote working -I really hate open floor plans- etc. But there are lots of web developers.  
   
Embedded developers seems like shorter supply but I guess there are also fewer jobs. I guess you won't be on-call if you are an embedded developer. And as I can see there is less hype stuff in embedded.

To briefly introduce myself, I am a college undergraduate earning a degree in CS but I found out that I don’t really like what I’m studying. I found a brighter and better interest in IT and managed to get an internship working with Infrastructure Operations!

I’m only an IT help desk student worker but I miraculously landed the infrastructure job even after telling the hiring managers that I have zero experience with any other related IT fields besides help desk. 

I really just want to know if the task requires a lot of previous knowledge or a lot of brainpower because I’m a pretty slow learner and I do not want to disrupt anything of the company I work for. Time is money! I like things that are in a routine everyday and that’s where I can keep practicing my crafts and learn to master my role. I’ve been at the help desk for 2 years now and I think I’m able to figure out all sorts of problems mainly due to the fact that I’ve seen and worked with it before (mostly just front-line questions), thus improving my crafts through the same routine everyday. 

My question is, if this is the case when working in Infrastructure? As a matter of fact, what IS infrastructure and what does it do? Are things going to be routinely based where I can mindlessly do things and get it done fast? Or are there going to be tasks where I will have to critically think and tinker through some things? Is it stressful?

I (21F) am a dual citizen of the USA and Mexico. I am in my last year of my bachelors at a big state school in the US and am set to graduate this August with a degree in Political Science and Global Studies, and a minor in Anthropology. I am a native English speaker. I was raised speaking Spanish at home as well but I would say that I only have a C1 proficiency because i have no formal Spanish education and am severely lacking in academic &amp; professional language skills. This is something I am currently working on, as I hope to be as fluent in Spanish as I am in English. I am also currently B2 in German and learning. 

In truth, I have no real professional/research experience in my field (I am applying to many post-grad internships for the fall) but I have worked in restaurants waitressing (and recently bartending) since I was 14. For a long time, I hoped to work for the foreign service, but over the past two years I’ve become detached from the idea of working for the state department. I’ve realized that my greatest interests over the course of my studies are in the fields of international justice, humanitarian law, and cultural anthropology, and I would love to pursue a career in one or some combination of these fields. I would also really like to get my masters, but I plan to take a year or two to work/ do an internship and figure out what exactly I’d like to specialize in before going back to school. I have no post-grad plans set in stone, although I am certain that for a number of reasons I do not want to settle in the United States. I cannot see myself living, working, and potentially starting a family here. 

In terms of location, I am strongly leaning towards Germany or Spain for a number of reasons. I have been privileged enough to live in Spain, Germany, and now Italy. 

Two years ago I worked as an au pair (nanny) in Madrid, Spain. It was an incredible experience and I fell in love with the people and the culture. I also had the chance to spend time in other Spanish cities which I adored just as much. Although I only lived in Madrid for three months, I genuinely see myself living in Spain long term. I would love to work and/ or pursue a masters degree in Spain. The issue is, I am not sure I would be able to complete an advanced degree in Spanish. The program would most likely have to be in English. \*\* I realistically cannot pursue a masters degree in the United States. I would not have been able to get my bachelors without a scholarship and I would not be able to afford a higher degree at an American University. Taking out thousands in loans is not viable for me either.  \*\* It’s my understanding that it would be relatively easy to become a resident (and eventually citizen) of Spain as a Mexican citizen as they have some sort of agreement with former colonies. 

Thanks to an academic scholarship, I have also had the opportunity to go on exchange twice during my undergraduate career. Last year I spent a semester in Munich, Germany where I was able to further my language skills. I loved living in Germany and would be delighted to live there again. The organization and opportunities really appeal to me. Right now, I’m thinking of getting my masters there as there are many programs in English and they are tuition free, even for foreign nationals. If I could find some sort of job of practicum there, that would also be ideal. However, I am by no means fluent and am at a disadvantage relative to native German speakers. I would certainly continue my study of the language 

I have also looked into teaching english abroad, but I would prefer a career move. In this area, I’m particularly interested in a program run by the Spanish government for US (and canadian citizens) to live and work as a paid English teaching assistant for a year. This is not a long term option though, and I’d have to find other work with my degree to continue to live there. I see myself doing this as a sort of gap year. I am also strongly considering becoming an au pair again anywhere in Europe when I graduate in order to give myself some time to plan and think, but I do want to start gaining professional experience within a year of graduating. 

All of this being said, I am also open to other English or Spanish speaking countries around the world, not just within the EU. If you have any suggestions for other places, please let me know. I’ve learned that I value living in a large city, preferably somewhere diverse, with good public transport, and close to the beach (obviously this isn’t a deal breaker).  I don’t have anything tying me down anywhere and I want out lol.

I guess I would love to hear any experiences/advice y’all have to share, and sorry for the length/any confusion in my post. Thank you!"

I currently am a sophomore pursuing a cs associate degree to transfer. 

I am still in the baby stages of learning (currently in the middle of taking a Python and C++ class).

Is this too early to look for, lets say, IT or software development internships?

Im worried I will be too inexperienced for some of these positions.

Anyone have experience with this?

However, I am also in the stages with other teams at the same company x for different positions. 

I only have 1 day to answer. But I am also more interested in the other positions at this company. 

It is a big company so I’m not sure what would happen to my application for the other positions if I accepted this offer? 

To be more clear, I am excited about this offer but am also (more) excited about the POSSIBILITY of the other positions (obviously they are not guaranteed).

If I take this offer, will the company automatically “cancel” my other applications for the summer term? If I decline it, It is a big risk.

Please note: during the interview, the hiring manager asked if I was applying for other positions within the company and I said yes. I don’t know how this affects my situation.

Any help/advice for someone who has been here or has insight?"

It would be a really good start for my career path (the work is more in line with what I'm interested in). I think it would be stupid to turn down their offer.  I'm just a little hesitant about reneging my offer to the first company. Beside being blacklisted by them, is there any other factors I should consider?

f64r3t,1,2020-02-18,Workplace issues: am I overreacting?,my-blood-is-ink,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/f64r3t/workplace_issues_am_i_overreacting/,"I work at a grocery store’s coffee shop, and there are more than a few things that are driving me nuts: 
1. My higher-ups refuse to train me on the clock, and tell me I need to study Quizlets. I’m a full-time college student with multiple other extracurricular activities. Also, due to an internship I’m required to have in order to graduate, I only work 10-15 hours a week. I just don’t have the time to learn how to make coffee off the clock. Other coworkers help though, which would be nice... if they weren’t high school students who only show up in the last three or four hours before we close up. Additionally, I am only allowed to wash dishes and run the register because my boss has to test me apparently... she’s been on vacation for the past week and I’ve only been here for a month. So nobody is letting me make coffee, which is how I learn: by DOING. 
Yet, one of my higher-ups (a full-time employee) complained that I wasn’t learning coffee quickly enough and reported me for being “slow.” This leads to another issue...
2. This full-time employee is incredibly rude to me. I am urged to communicate and ask questions, but when I ask questions this coworker rolls her eyes, huffs, or visibly grimaces. For instance, I had closed once before and but could not remember the exact procedure, so I asked her what she wanted me to do. She just stared at me, sneered, and then kept working. That night she also made a mess, and I cleaned it up for her. While I was cleaning up the mess of mocha mix she made, she asked me to get the teas so we could dump them out. I told her that I would get it in a minute (I did not specify that it would be after I was done cleaning up a sticky pool of chocolate), and so she repeated it again. I told her again, thinking maybe she had misheard me (I’m a bit soft-spoken), “give me a moment.” She was staring at me cleaning up her mess, but that did not stop her from huffing, stomping over, and grabbing the teas that I would have dumped within the next couple of minutes. 
The thing is, I am frequently paired with this coworker who is technically my superior. She does not like it when people take lunches. It is my legal right to take a half-hour lunch during my shifts, but she says lunches should only last fifteen minutes. When I ask her if I can go on lunch, she rolls her eyes and says, “I guess.” I then have to ask her if another time would work better. Sometimes, I don’t end up going on lunches at all. I don’t work many days a week, but I always work long-shifts. 
I’ve tried being nice to her. I try to do small-talk with her because frequently we are the only two there at night. Being around her though gives me a tight, heavy feeling in my chest. I dread working with her. I always feel guilty for asking questions, even if I logically know I can’t learn unless I ask. I’m just sick of the visible disdain she has towards me, feeling that she thinks I am an idiot, like I am not even worth a simple “yes/no” response. 
3. This all came to a head yesterday. I woke up to a voicemail from my HR manager (let’s call her “J”) saying I was fired from an inappropriate text-message I had sent to my boss. Now, the last time I had texted my boss was two weeks before, so I was both incredibly befuddled and upset. After looking through my phone records, calling Verizon, and scheduling a meeting with my HR manager, I figured out the issue. It had been a spoofing incident, which means someone downloaded an app and targeted me and my boss by saying awful things (which, in turn, means that this person knew my boss’s number as well). 
This morning, I went in to HR, and sat down with J and a manager. J told me that they had known the message wasn’t from me after I had called her sounding rather upset. She also said somebody else in the department had the same issue. She showed me the spoofed-message, which read, “I quit and I been fucked your wife.” Something occurred to me then; if this message said I quit, then why fire me at all (especially over a voicemail, since my marketing courses have taught me to NEVER deliver bad news over the phone)? I asked J, and she said that she needed to see if I would call back so she could confirm if I had done it or not... basically I had cried all day yesterday thinking this could affect my career in the future. I’m 19, applying to graduate schools, and trying to get an internship. I don’t need a black mark on my resume, especially for something I didn’t do. She never apologized for this, and only said I was a “perfectly nice girl,” and then immediately diverted the meeting towards my failings. My boss had told HR to talk to me about it rather than talking to me herself. 
But when I tried to ask questions, she cut me off only to ask me to communicate better and also speak up because I’m really shy (which I will acknowledge is an issue, but I am trying to get better and more assertive). 
It’s only been a month, but I really feel like a cog in a machine. There’s no empathy or compassion, just people covering their asses, while claiming (no joke) that they want me to be the successful and happy. I am not some little worker bee. This place pays me $10/hr, expects me to train myself off the clock, buy fancy black clothing (they don’t provide work clothes except for a hat and apron), take less-than-legal (I think?) lunches, and I am belittled/interrupted for asking questions but still expected to ask them. I live at home still, and my parents don’t want me to find a new job because that’s a quitter’s attitude. 
I need advice... lots of it. How should I deal with my passive-aggressive coworker? Should I be upset about how HR dealt with something that wasn’t my fault? Am I being paranoid for feeling violated and like I was targeted by somebody over the spoofing incident? Is this a toxic environment that I should escape? Or is this just me? 
I’m sorry that this is so long and rambling, and I apologize for any grammar mistakes. I just had a lot to get off of my chest, because the past couple of days has been a chaotic whirlwind of stress."
f6504q,1,2020-02-18,How can I make a career switch from technical support to data analysis/GIS?,jerguy1928,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f6504q/how_can_i_make_a_career_switch_from_technical/,"Hi reddit,

I want to make a career switch from IT support to data analysis/GIS. Here's a bit about my background. This post is going to be long so I'll try to include plenty tl;dr's along the way :).

**My studies:**

I'm a 24-year-old from the US with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. My university program mostly covered computer systems and hardware (classes like digital design, electronics) with some software related courses mixed in (computer algorithms, computer networks). During my time in university, I spent a lot of time abroad, I was probably home for maybe half of the time. Still graduated on time in 4 years though. More on that later.

*tl;dr Computer Engineer from the US*

**My internships:**

I had two major internships during my time in university (both around 6ish months each). I had one internship at a university where I did helpdesk support (slow computers, reimaging machines, password resets), I liked the pace of the role and did very well at it, but it felt a bit like a putting out fires kind of job. I did get some opportunity to innovate which was nice. At the time our team was using Microsoft Lync (now Skype for business) to communicate, and messages never went through, so I and another intern unveiled Slack to the team as a pilot, and it later got rolled out to our whole team.

My second internship was at an energy efficiency startup outside of the US. Looking back on it, this role was a bit half baked, the company founder wanted some IT stuff fixed (new conference computer, fix internet connections, make some basic website changes, create some basic charts for presentations) which I was able to do, but there wasn't much more to this role. Luckily, there was an opportunity for me to help with the company's online marketing a bit, so I got the opportunity to run some LinkedIn, Google AdWords, email campaigns, make some inbound marketing content, manage the company's social media, etc. There was a lot more I could have done with the website, but I didn't/don't have a lot of web development experience.

I had an additional role where I worked as an advisor part-time for a few months during classes at my university's study abroad(student exchange/ERASMUS) office, where I advised students on studying abroad as well as got the opportunity to innovate a bit (created an online quiz, set up a system to alert office members when a visitor was there using IFTTT (if this then that) software), although unfortunately I was graduating and the whole office kinda dragged their feet with getting on board so I don't know if the system ever got used.

*tl;dr I had several tech support related internships with little experience doing programming while in university*

**Post University Mid 2018 - Mid 2019**

I graduated in May 2018. Since I had spent so much time traveling/living abroad, I wanted to do it some more. My friend and I were planning to start a videography travel business and live abroad. We had bought all the gear, I registered the business, did the paperwork, etc. The business didn't really end up working out. My friend was more interested in traveling and less in the business, and he told us not to worry about certain things about the business, that we would just figure out while abroad. He ended up leaving to go travel to Australia. I had wanted the opportunity to travel a bit more too but also work at the same time. My girlfriend and I (I'm American she's not), had the idea that we would go to Australia too.

During the midst of this, when we realized the business wasn't really going to work out, I realized I was pretty interested in Urban planning/GIS. During my time in university, I didn't really like programming that much, I always would get hung up with debugging and not knowing the exact syntax I needed, and I didn't really know about GIS before this time. 

I got my [working holiday visa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_holiday_visa) very quickly, however, my girlfriend (now fiancee) was still waiting to receive her visa. I tried applying for Urban Planning/mapping jobs while still outside of Australia for a few months but had very little success. I didn't want to leave for Australia until I had secured a job because it would have started the clock on my visa and my fiancee hadn't gotten her visa yet. I ended up waiting with her until May 2019, until we went together. During this span of nearly 9 months, I managed to get a few basic freelance jobs (Upwork), and taught English online for a couple of hours a day.

*tl;dr I did online classes/freelancing work related to GIS/programming while waiting for my fiancee's visa to Australia*

**Mid 2019 - Dec 2019**

After leaving for Australia, it took me a while to find a job. I had tried multiple ways of applying, Linkedin, cold emails, job apps online, but didn't make much progress until after 2 months I managed to get a role doing python scripting for a GIS company. I liked the job mostly, but I felt under immense pressure to work quickly. I had some GIS skills and some python skills, but I wouldn't consider myself very seasoned and was definitely less proficient than everyone else there. They ended up letting me go after about 3 weeks, there was someone there who could continue my work who had some free time, although from their reaction I think they would have been keen to keep me had I been more skilled. I asked them how I did they said ""You did about as we had expected, we knew it was going to be a learning curve for you"", I had taken that as they weren't happy with how I did.

After a couple of weeks, I found another temporary job. I worked as a customer service agent for a transportation authority here in Australia for a few weeks while they needed some extra people. After that, I got lucky and one of the companies I applied for a job for a few months ago offered me a job doing GIS field data capture. I did this for a couple of months until the end of the year. This was good, but got very repetitive very quickly, and I didn't see any career progression. The company does inhouse office GIS work as well but I didn't want to work at their office because I saw technologically they were very behind with the times, a coworker of mine told me 'a lot of people more talented have left', and their office is 1h30min away from where I live. I decided I didn't want to work with them again.

*tl;dr Got some contract work in various GIS roles that were short term*

**2020**

After spending a few weeks home and doing a bit of traveling, I'm back where I live in Melbourne, Australia. I've been job hunting for about a month now. I reached out to the old company I worked with, some other companies/people, and applied for some jobs online. I had one informational interview, but haven't had much luck otherwise. I've tried to balance my time between networking/job hunting and online classes in GIS and programming.


**My questions:**

1. What can I do to help make a shift to more of a data analysis/GIS related role even though I didn't do a lot of programming/data analysis work in university? 

2. (Slightly pertaining to Q1) Should I focus more on building my GIS/programming portfolio? I've made a few things, but they aren't very advanced?

3. Should part of me just try to get a job back in an IT helpdesk? I could do this but I know I wouldn't be very happy.

4. Any other wonderful career advice you'd like to give would be most appreciated.

**Other notes**: Financially speaking, I'm pretty good shape and don't need to rush to get a job, my fiancee is working (she's a chef), but it's stressful not working and we are trying to save up money for next years plans :

Mid 2021

My fiancee and I plan to move permanently back to the US in mid 2021. We are trying to save for our wedding/the costs of moving back. We will be returning to where my university is (Boston, Mass, USA), and I still have a good amount of connections there.

 
*Sorry if I included way too much information, I just wanted to give a good amount of information about my background.*

Thanks in advance for any advice. Let me know if any more information is needed."

I also minored in mathematics. I recently got a consulting gig that I would be starting in a few weeks, but I'm pretty nervous about whether it will be a good fit for me, and I'm wondering if there might be fields or paths that I haven't yet considered. I've been meaning to make this post for a long time, but better late than never. I don't have any internship experience, just school projects, which I think has been making it especially difficult for me, although I hear a lot of people have trouble regardless of this. Part of me regrets going for computer science, but deep down I do enjoy it. It's just that I struggled with a lot of the later courses and I think I may have received the wrong impression of what my early career would look like.

I like programming, but I'm not sure if I could spend all day doing it. I'm not ruling it out and would happily pursue those types of jobs, but variety can also be nice. In terms of specific tools I'm familiar with, I'm comfortable working with Python, C++, Java, and SQL. Python and SQL are my favorites to work with. I also like working with numbers. So far, I've been applying to positions like ""software developer,"" ""software engineer,"" ""data analyst,"" ""python developer,"" and ""java developer."" It's harder to find some more specific stuff aimed at entry-level employees.

I also really like filmmaking and have a deep passion for the craft, but little actual exposure. I've been teaching myself an editing suite (DaVinci Resolve) to try and learn something more marketable, and I have basic exposure to Adobe Audition. If there are any unconventional paths into the industry, whether in creative capacities or not, I would be interested to learn more about those.

Any advice on career paths or other information relevant to be would be greatly appreciated."

Just some background on me. I am currently a sophomore at a competitive university and was diagnosed with ADHD a long time ago but it's been a while since I was last treated for it.

My classes in college have been kicking my ass this semester, especially since most of the work is reading rather than things I need to physically turn in. I've been having some extreme problems focusing and actually getting stuff done. I could go to the library and take three hours to complete an assignment that realistically should have taken me 20 minutes. This is what happened to me today. It's especially hard and self-depleting since all of my friends have their shit together with school and have no problem buckling down to focus on assignments.

I feel like I haven't actually been completing any of my assigned readings and have instead been bs'ing my way through the classes. Sitting down and actually doing my homework has begun to feel like an unsurmountable task and I have lost all motivation to try in school. I'm just tired of going to class, which worries me since I still have two more years left. But I feel extremely motivated to do things like applying to internships, networking, and other professional development things. I could sit down and do that for hours with no problem, and it's the main way I procrastinate school work.

This lack of motivation has not affected my social life. The only time I really feel great and energetic is when I am being social or hanging with friends. This is the only thing I ever feel like doing anymore.

I really don't know what to do here and how to go about fixing this issue and would appreciate any advice that anyone can offer, as it is much needed.

I am from an upper middle-class  family, and am a freshman at a university prep style school. I don't know where to start as I'm applying for grade 10 courses this year and it's starting to hit that point where it's dawning on me, about how much I need to do to make the right life decisions. I am much more math than English brained, and can sustain myself well in it. I am thinking of accelerating this year in precalc and foundations math 10 over summer in order to take precalc 11, which is good for business and economics which I feel I like is what I want to do as I am strong in math. I want to look into a life planner but I'm not sure if it's worth it. as well, I am pretty much expected to take post-secondary education at a good and ivy league school. as well, my dad runs a big real estate company, but due to fuckups and abuse of one of the founders which prevents me from ever having even an internship at the company.

My situation is unique and I would really appreciate your advice. I'm not a privileged guy by any means. My parents are immigrants from Vietnam and work blue collar jobs. I got in this school by writing a really good essay, applying early decision, and getting into one prestigious summer program and being president in some clubs at my very bad public school. I don't have the benefit of affirmative action, I'm Asian and male.

I got in as a biology major, so basically all my experience (bio research at a college and clubs/volunteering basically) I can't really leverage because I don't really want to do the premed track. First semester I took premed related courses but this semester I changed my mind and started doing computer science stuff.

I'm concerned that I'm not intelligent enough to do comp sci without losing my shit, most of my peers are ahead of me bc they didn't switch from premed and skipped courses bc of AP credit as well. Seriously I had to take the SAT like 5 fucking times to get over a 1500

All the dudes into econ and shit are tall white or asian international kids and have connections and shit and from wealthy as fuck backgrounds and I'm not very gregarious but I'm working on it. 

I just recently made a LinkedIn and have been looking at the resumes and experience of my peers, especially ones that are sophomores landing investment banking analyst internships at those big firms like Morgan Stanley or whatever, like fuck me I'm so behind, how the fuck did I get into this college. And I'm not really good at socializing and networking, I don't really have anyone to mentor me on this shit, on what to do for my next steps.

I'm dead-set on a STEM major with a business minor, and I'm almost certain when it comes to transferring to a 4-year, (UF, fingers crossed) but I don't know which option would be better in ensuring a blend of experience, networking opportunities, and overall education in the fields I'm interesting in pursuing. On one hand, an AS in info-tech would be a whole lot more practically oriented, not to mention that the college I'm going to has an internship for students pursuing AS degrees. On the other, UF's in-state transfer program appears to be more friendly to those with AA degrees, not to mention the opportunities I'd have to brush up on my higher-level math and English skills prior to transferring.   
I've also done some snooping around payscale to look at the general differences in pay and the job opportunities offered with each degree, and while a BA seems to certainly beat out an AS, it'd come at the cost of having a more vulnerable AA degree for 2 years with fewer internships available, making for less experience for those pesky entry-level jobs.    
I'm a little over my month into my first semester, and both the courses I'm currently taking (currently on the AA-CIS transfer track) have plenty of overlap with the AS degree. Do I jump ship? Pursue two degrees at once? Stick with the one I have and keep pushing forward? Help!"
f68s9b,4,2020-02-19,Perpetual Civil War Inside One's Mind,awholeplateofpizza,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/f68s9b/perpetual_civil_war_inside_ones_mind/,"Having conflict inside your mind (or civil war in my paraphrase since I love watching and reading war history) is one of the most hellish kind of ailment to the mind.

Right now, I am 23 years old, male and my development to this state is not a smooth ride. I am the type of person who woke up to reality rather late than most people. That's why, I do have a track record of being viciously bullied, which culminated in the utter destruction of my self esteem in the end of my high school period.

In college, feeling resentful of ALL PEOPLE, and having no confidence in oneself's ability to socialize without being disrespected in some way down to road, I tried to evade social interaction as much as possible. I began liking anime before college, part of it being an act of defiance towards the mainstream world. I was undoubtedly whipped in my school history, whether it was middle or high school, wanting to be popular, etc so I made drastic moves to change my identity fully that I don't need to do all of those things anymore. I was thinking of becoming hikkikomori even, so I went to college rather hesitant with a major that I didn't even like, hospitality management.

I also trained boxing a lot during this time, and somewhat found that being in top of your physical performance makes you feel a lot better. My main motivation of starting boxing is, of course, to be familiar to getting hit so that an event like complete humiliation of the past did not happen anymore. But it doesn't help much either in the end (physical and mental strength are two different beasts).

I do receive some sort of bullying here, but I also learned a lot from it. A colleague who used to be a foreign student in France viewed me as an immature person, and that was definitely true. I didn't view it as bullying as first, but then as time goes and as my eyes to reality opened little by little, it became apparent to me that whatever this person is doing is doing some kind of damage to my emotional well-being. Constantly being mocked in an indirect manner and also being pressured so I can fall with my knees bent. It was around the late half of 2017 that this escalated to a large scale. 

We were assigned to do internship to industry, but me fearful of social interaction with rough folks like in hospitality industry so instead, I opted to do ""internship"" in family business where I'm helping managing websites for family's real estate agency business. I didn't tell anyone about this.

But then, the unfortunate happened. A picture of me training boxing was discovered by a colleague also did intern in Japan. Then it became apparent to him that I wasn't doing intern in a hotel or such industry because if so, I wouldn't have any luxury to do most of anything besides working in internship program. Then at this time, the pressure became relentless through chat. Since his way of insulting is rather indirect, opting to use quips upon himself to make me feel bad, I just can only stoically stand my ground, saying ""Oh, yes! Good luck with that!"", ""Oh! I'm glad that you're good with that!"" but I know for a reason that the intents were ""malicious"". At one point, he said that he admired my ""persistence"". To me, this reinforced my belief that his self-beratement was actually a form of bullying and indirect insults hurled at me. I struggled REALLY hard to stay stoic, even though I put a front of being not affected at all, my heart was burning relentlessly. What do you think? Do you agree on these facts?

The entirety of 2017 was a change for me. In fact, the end of 2016 saw me opened my eyes on a large portion of reality. The reality that I was merely ignoring reality and that upwards to that time, I was being a complete utter failure in dealing with other people. Exercising, indulging myself in anime and stuff was merely an escapism. The end of 2013 was an ""end"" to me, where I was bullied relentlessly that the feelings of humiliation still lingers. I can say for certain that from late 2016 until now has been rough times for me. Where reality opened up its ugliness in front of me and me struggling to reconcile with it.

In the year 2017, I also started studying mushroom cultivation relentlessly because I saw prospect in medicinal mushroom cultivation to earn money instead of getting a career in hospitality industry. But in the end, it didn't manifest itself. I made the wrong approach of not clarifying fully that a feasible market exist that I have an easy access to (even though it does exist in other countries). And then 2018 come, and I met again with colleagues. When I say about mushroom cultivation and all, they bullied me, that time more relentlessly, and I decided at that time it was the last straw. I burned the bridge and I didn't even come into graduation ceremony. 

Then the entirety of 2019 concluded with me being depressed, almost a complete shut-in. Then my parents decided to discipline myself by sending me off to study jewelry trading in relatives' home (November-January 2020). In the end, I'm glad that I was able to follow the schedule, being somewhat responsible, and the end concluded with my relatives saying to my mom and dad that I was diligent and all. And now the year 2020, I'm back to my family's office doing real estate web admin and all. And now, I have decided to learn to code to open myself up to new possibilities. 

The civil war that I am stating about is the fact that, I for one, wants to live in a ""correct"" or ""good"" way but at the same time I found constantly seeking validation from others is degrading to one's self worth. I was bullied not without a cause. I had many flaws in my personality that I struggled and am struggling fixing. I am disgusted by my past self who relented everyone to evaluate myself. But at the same time, my other part of self is constantly blaming myself for being unwise, for being arrogant, etc. Is it a form of arrogance to want nothing out of other peoples' mouth on yourself?? A lot of people implied that having other people say to them ""you have changed"" is a cathartic moment for them. But based on my opinion, it's a form of weakness and if I want to go to extreme, I would rather deliberately present myself to people who saw me as an inept entity in the past as inept as possible as a disguise so that I won't get intoxicated in the drug that is other peoples' validation. Because how good you are, is up to you to decide.

This is a long post. But it's impossible to get to where I am now without showing the complete history. I know that there are many gaps in my story and questions, suggestions on these gaps are encouraged. It's very difficult to construct everything coherently. Thanks."

Not sure if anyone else has encountered something like this before but I am facing some nerves about an upcoming internship opportunity.  I go to a (pretty much) no name school for CS and this past semester I applied to a ton of internships and never heard back anything, not even a phone screen.  My GPA is kind of trash and I could seriously improve my extracurriculars and my only saving grace was that I have had a job for 10 months doing IT work that I dislike.  I figured I would have to work there for the next summer too which would be slightly better than having no job but I figured I would reach out to a connection I had (family friend) with a really competitive company for a CS internship.  He was high enough on the totem poll that when he put in a recommendation for me a recruiter contacted me and I got an interview.  I spent the next two weeks reading CTCI cover to cover, leetcode, posting my personal projects on github, etc.  The interview went very well and they loved my work experience even though it was IT.  I was contacted a few days later with an offer.

I know for certain that I wouldn't have gotten an interview (tens of rejections from companies on the same level, no phone screen) without the recommendation which makes me feel a bit shitty for potentially stealing this opportunity from another student.  Just looking at people's profiles on LinkedIn with ""incoming \_\_\_\_\_ software engineering intern"" I can see they all go to better schools, had previous SE internships, 3.5s etc.  I'm getting a bit nervous going the program, explaining where I even go to school, potentially being outpaced?  I haven't even told anyone I know at my school where I'm interning because I'm afraid their first thought will be that I got lucky. I'm also wondering if my recommendation was taken into consideration when making the decision to give me an offer and I would really really rather know that it was because I did well in the interview, guess I will never know.

So, question is do I have impostor syndrome or did I get lucky and l will I be able to compete?"

To summarize, I recently created a blog with the aim of documenting my journey as a newly-recruited ML Developer Intern in a relatively young startup which focuses on Computer Vision. The content of the blog is rather lacking as of this point as I have been rather overwhelmed at work recently, but I will do my best to get it up to speed over the next few days when I have the time. Through this blog, some things which I hope to be able to document include:

1. The day in the life of an intern from my perspective in a company which focuses on Computer Vision.
2. My personal learning objectives and how my role in the company allows me to fulfil them.

Over time I may add some personal projects/tutorials once I am more confident. As always if anyone has any comments/advice, please feel free to drop me a PM. I am very new to blogging as a whole so mistakes and kind comments will be greatly appreciated. Thank you all!"

I recently started a position as a GIS intern while I finish my program. I have never used AutoCAD and my supervisors say I'm better off searching the internet for help with it than asking them.

They would like an aerial image of the county in AutoCAD so they can have a template ready-made to include in their drawings. I think I have that part done. I added a layer from the county ArcGIS Online to ArcMap and exported it as a TIF layer. 

That layer, though, doesn't appear in the folder. It shows up in the catalog view, but not the actual folder when I go through File Explorer. It also doesn't appear in my folder when I open AutoCAD and try to use the Attach tool, but another TIF that I used for a different project shows in the folder. 

Now I'm stuck; I've done some searches but haven't come across the fix to the problem. Appreciate any advice."

The title might be confusing so just to quickly explain.  I am a Masters's student at Georgetown with a half-decent amount of computation and coding experience.  I have a past internship at CapitalOne, which while they are a regional bank, is something like 70% fintech and focuses a lot on that area.  I don't have any IB experience, so I think it's fair to say I missed the boat on getting into high finance until maybe after an MBA.

Anyway, since I have experience and a genuine interest in firms like Capital One, I was curious if there are any other financial firms similar to Capital One that I may not have heard about in the US, UK, or EU (Irish-US dual citizen so I can work any of those places, even w/ Brexit).

Also probably worth mentioning, I don't have enough coding knowledge to do quant trading. Although maybe I should deep dive into learning that since most banks will have something along those lines.

EDIT: Also probably worth mentioning, I went straight from undergrad to this 1 year masters, so I am a young and probably qualify for most early career development type programs.  

I am also aware that it was a poor choice, but I also went to a little barely known school for undergrad and my master's is at a target, so I am hoping that helps a bit."

The boss then called me in and gave me a brief coaching, but I’m sure they’ll remember this and that it will erode whatever trust they have.

They replied to my email saying there are some steps to complete before the written offer which will be sent out later in the week. That week past and they sent me an apology saying HR was out of office and that it should be sent early the following week. Another week passed and I sent a follow up email asking if there was any updates and they apologized for the delay saying HR is really backed up. At this point I understand and think its reasonable since the I saw they have opened up multiple new positions so maybe they really are backed up. Then another week passed and they keep telling me it should be ready early next week. Note I have been applying and interviewing with other companies but I really want to work there and I don't know what else to do other than keep sending emails for updates.

Is there anything I could do right now to get this position?  
Thanks for hearing me out, if you have any feedback/advice it would be appreciated!"

I worked there for about 4 months* and my pay was $25/hour but they calculated it as a salary rather than hourly pay. Someone told me due to that, i might’ve gotten paid less given I worked less than a year. I tried calculating my net pay online with $15,600 as my gross income per year (15,000 + 4% vacation pay) and all sites show different figures, but all above 14k. However, I only got paid $12,815. 

I’m assuming I wasn’t paid enough, but how can I be sure? How can I calculate the pay? And how do you suggest I tell this to my manager?

EDIT : the gross pay that I was paid is actually $15,427 (including 4% vacation pay) Is that correct or no? I calculated $15,600 but not sure anymore..."

f6iaqk,4,2020-02-19,Young'n trying to break into hardware field,TrumpetSounds,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/f6iaqk/youngn_trying_to_break_into_hardware_field/,"Hello I am currently a sophomore in a major state flagship university pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specific program being Computer Engineering. I have a couple questions and concerns that I would greatly appreciate if addressed by people acquainted with the industry involving computer engineering.

For some background, I am currently trying to find an internship for the summer but I am worried I am at a disadvantage because I don't have any prior work experience. But my GPA is good. 

I specifically am interested in finding an internship more on the hardware side of things, or very low level software or firmware. I am not very interested in things like software applications development for example. 

Now, my questions basically boil down to this, with some added concerns:

1. I am looking at job boards and I see most full time jobs asking for people with graduate degrees, and most internships asking for people pursuing graduate degrees. I can only afford a bachelor's, I think graduate school is out of the picture for me. Is it possible to get into some sort of hardware field with only a BS? Not just generic computer hardware, but also like digital electronics and similar.

2. A lot of the jobs are posted for the west coast and maybe a smidgeon on the east coast. I am in the Midwest. How likely do you think it would be that a company would help me relocate temporarily in the event I do get a position ?

3. I have heard a lot of negative things about the outlook for computer engineering, such as how Moores law is dying, the rate of growth rate for computer hardware engineer is declining, ""software is the future"", many family members doubting my decision to do computer engineering, employers at my schools career fairs  saying they are looking for more hardware or software specifically focused people, I even heard a Texas Instruments person say they stopped hiring computer engineering majors, and people at my school in ECE say the computer focus is the weakest. Also it seems like computer engineering is a niche area with not a lot of demand and a lot of it figured out in general. Basically, what I am asking here is, why should I stay in computer engineering and not switch to electrical engineering? (I would not switch to CS). 

4. What kind of positions, fields, and keywords, etc., should I be looking up to find a type of work that a computer engineer with only a bachelor's degree (or pursuing one in my case) might be considered for?"
f6innr,1,2020-02-19,"Recent engineering grad in the DC area torn between ""don't be greedy"" and ""know your worth""",Stomachbuzz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f6innr/recent_engineering_grad_in_the_dc_area_torn/,"TL:DR; Got a pretty decent job offer, but feel I'm too early in my job hunt process to accept. 

Hi there,

I have somewhat of a unique situation.  
First of all, I'm 25 and recent grad with bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. I have fantastic mechanical intuition, but not nearly as good 'playing the game' of school. Constantly a 'hammering round peg into square hole' situation, so my GPA is a lukewarm 2.7.

My extracurriculars and internships are nearly nonexistent due to me owning/operating a landscaping company I started at 15. Approx. 70hrs/week during the summer, I bust hump doing landscaping. Mostly regular lawn mowing, but recently diversified into larger projects and incorporated newly learned engineering concepts and practices into projects.   
I've kept with it to afford tuition and living expenses. Over 10 years, I've gotten pretty decent, with \~40 regular mowing customers, and several larger projects under my belt.  
This past summer, I hired 1 full time employee, and 1 part time helper.   
During peak months, I grossed \~$8,500/month. Pre-tax net around \~7,000

To give an idea of my skills and experience, I do everything from cleaning/repairing gutters, tree trimming, laying sod, putting in flagstone walkways, leaf clean-up, etc. 

I am an entrepreneur and tinkerer at heart, so I've focused on those strengths. 100% of the business has been facilitated by myself: all vehicle and equipment maintenance/repair, advertising, bookkeeping, building a website, customer relations, negotiations, doing the physical work, etc. Literally everything. 

I also flip cars in my spare time. Buy/fix/sell vehicles, motorcycles, off-road toys, etc. Again, reinforcing my hands-on mechanical abilities and reverse engineering machines to better learn how they work. 

I've fiercely pursued personal development and relationship/communication skills to grow as an individual, and see myself as significantly more mature than the average 25 year old, and leagues more mature than nearly any recent graduate.

I only say this to show the comparison between me and a typical 22 year old graduating with very little real world experience. 

So I've graduated, and want to pursue something more intellectually challenging than landscaping, so I've been job hunting.   
I went on 1 interview. Great conversation. Emailed me an offer letter 2 hours after leaving. $55k/yr (50hrs/wk, no overtime) with meager benefits. A job I felt was better suited to someone with a 1yr trade school, or associate's degree rather than 4yr engineering degree. 

I spoke with my school's engineering career counselor and he said they were gouging me. He stated 2019 engineering grades had a mean starting salary of $68.5k, and median of $66.5k, not even adjusting for higher cost of living in the DC area.   
I went on 2nd interview. By comparison, blew the 1st company out of the water. Much larger company with international reputation. 2 months of paid training, company vehicle, 18 days PTO, and other benefits. Offered me the job on the spot for $62k/yr.   
I countered with statistics, and they called 2 days later and came up to $63k (40hr/week with overtime opportunity)

I'm torn between not wanting to be greedy, but also knowing my worth. I'm 25 years old, not married, no children, no drugs, no alcohol, no criminal/driving record. I'm squeaky clean. My experience is overwhelming and my interview/communication skills are phenomenal. 

I want to accept the 2nd offer because it's 'adequate' pay and great benefits, but I hate settling. I've only gone on 2 interviews, and don't want to accept prematurely. But I also don't want to blow a good offer.

&amp;#x200B;

What say you?"
f6irva,1,2020-02-19,IBM or Capital One Software Engineering Internship,AModeratelyFunnyGuy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f6irva/ibm_or_capital_one_software_engineering_internship/,"I've been offered software engineering summer internships at Capital One (part of TIP) and at IBM. This would be my first internship, and I don't have any connections in real-life to people in the industry, so I'm finding it difficult to assess which will be better for me. I'd greatly appreciate any advice/insight. I've decided to include a long-ish text post below providing context and what I'm looking for, but please feel free to skip reading it all and just provide your two-cents if you'd like.



Regarding what I'm looking for, my number 1 priority is an internship that will help me to obtain a good software engineering after graduation (I will be an incoming senior this summer, so this will be only internship prior to graduation next year May). Working with and learning interesting technologies and compensation are probably my number 2 or 3 priorities, respectively (of course if there's something else that I should be prioritizing that I'm forgetting, I'd appreciate it if that could be pointed out to me). I'll also note that due to planning on staying in my hometown for a year or two following graduation, I would not be accepting full-time offers from either of these companies immediately following graduation.


Regarding compensation, Capital One is offering about $44/hr, while IBM is offering about $30/hr. $30/hr is more than I was expecting going into this process, and as I said I value how an internship will help my career prospects more than the short-term income, but the difference is pretty substantial and I'm finding it difficult to not be influenced by the money.


At IBM I would be working on Watson Health in Research Park, NC, while with Capital One I would have a choice of working in Richmond, VA, Plano, TX, and Wilmington, DE. I have requested additional details from both regarding exactly what I could be expecting to work on (in the case of Capital One it would somewhat depend upon location). With that being said, at least in theory, the idea of working with expert systems and NLP sounds very exciting and is something that I could see myself getting into (which makes me lean towards IBM Watson), but I have no experience in any of this stuff so I'm not sure how highly to weigh the fact that it ""sounds cool"". It also remains unclear exactly how much my work on Watson would actually align with these interests.


I had originally thought that an internship at IBM would be more prestigious and thus more beneficial for my career, but after looking around online, IBM is increasingly being viewed as a dying force in the technology sector while Capital One is increasingly being viewed as a growing one. Even if this is true, how big of a difference will any of this make in the eyes of a recruiter? Should I interpret Capital One's pay as them highly valuing their engineers? Anything else I should be aware of?

Thank so much ahead of time!"

I was injured and so inebriated that i couldn't blow into BAC machine, so refusal to blow was also put on my record. This obviously made my insurance go up but im more about it hurting my chances of getting certain jobs. right now im an intern in an office handling fleet vehicles. I had to have a driver disclosure form done to see if i can drive the cars, i failed but they still hired me. They said i need 2-3 years of having a license to operate the vehicle, i've only had my licence around 10 months due to it being suspended for the failure to blow. The driver disclosure form only said convictions were a problem. i was not convicted, again it was dismissed with a prejudice. im wondering if the reason i failed the drive disclose check was because of me DUI or lack of time with a active license. I love this job and really want to be hired. Also im wondering if getting it expunged would be worth it. i live in North Carolina and here a DUI stays on your record for 7 years but im not sure if that's for convictions or all charges. from what i remember my attorney said people can only see my failure to blow on my record. Will getting my record expunged remove this or will employers still be able to see the dismissal and failure to blow. thanks in advance for any advice."

f6n91z,15,2020-02-19,A guide to finding research opportunities &amp; cold emailing,vaevict1s,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f6n91z/a_guide_to_finding_research_opportunities_cold/,"Hi everyone! I'm a high school senior most likely matriculating to my EA school, and I've received some questions on my main asking for advice about research and cold emailing. Since I now have some time on my hands, I wanted to pass on advice that I've picked up over the past four years, especially to any current sophomores and juniors trying to find something to do over the summer. This is focused towards STEM research, but I think it can be applicable towards the social sciences as well.

For the sake of anonymity, I won't be more specific here about my credentials, but feel free to PM me. 

**Do I need to do research?**

I want to stress that research is not just a box to check off to get into a T20. You should enjoy your ECs and find them meaningful. If you're going into research solely with the goal of winning ISEF and getting your name on a paper, you're likely doing it wrong and will find it a terrible experience.

**I want to do research. What exactly does that mean?**

Ideally, the goal of high schoolers in research is developing some sort of independent project that 1) answers a research question or 2) designs something new, supervised by a mentor, who can be a professor, but also might be a PhD student, postdoc, grad student, etc. Very rarely is this ""independent project"" totally independent or entirely new. More often, it evolves as a spinoff or side project of something that your mentor is already researching. Before you even get to an independent project, there's a significant amount of learning to be done in terms of the science itself and in performing techniques. 

**How do I find research opportunities?**

1. **Connections -** ask around! Your parents, extended family, science or math teachers, pediatrician...
2. **Cold emailing** **-** the dreaded cold emailing. Much more on this below.
3. **Summer programs -** these are great ways to secure a lab placement, and many guarantee that you'll leave with an independent project. Unfortunately, they can be pretty competitive, especially if you don't have a lot of research experience already on your resume. 
4. **Independent projects -** especially great for CS/math or engineering-type people. There are tons of publicly available datasets that you can analyze, or you can try engineering a solution to a specific problem. After doing some independent work, you can email a professor asking for some advice or guidance -- this is another way into finding a prospective mentor.

**How do I identify labs to cold email?**

1. Find a general field of science that you're interested in (e.g., molecular biology, organic chemistry) or a problem or subject (e.g., climate change, leukemia). 
   1. A note on this: some fields of science, by their nature, are more accessible to high schoolers than others. For instance, a pharmacology lab conducting a lot of *in vivo* studies or a theoretical physics group probably won't give you great opportunities for independent research, so consider this. Keep an open mind and be willing to explore out of your comfort zone: you'll have plenty of time in college to pursue these other fields.
2. Look through departmental websites of colleges, universities, research centers near you, or google things such as ""leukemia research FSU."" Don't worry about prestige -- in fact, this can be a detriment. Large, well-funded labs at Ivies with plenty of PhD students, postdocs, and lab techs don't need or want to train high schoolers. In contrast, as a motivated high schooler, you can make a big difference and contribution at a smaller lab at a regional college.
3. Identify 10-15 researchers that sound interesting. Go to their websites. Read some of their recent abstracts and take a few notes, look through pages of their lab alumni -- have they had high schoolers before? does the lab culture seem supportive? are they turning out a lot of papers? Narrow it down to 5-10.
4. While you're identifying researchers, do some reading about the field. This will be overwhelming at first. Remember that AP bio has nothing on years and years of experience in a highly specialized field. Try to deconstruct these articles and rephrase them in layman's terms. Read about common techniques and the theory behind them. The more you understand about the science, the more you'll be able to impress and to do when you secure a lab placement. 
5. Write the cold emails.
6. Send the emails! I recommend sending two each week until you get a response (hopefully within that first set of 5-10). Send them at reasonable times of the day: I like midmorning, not on a Monday or Friday (when professors will likely be grumpy), and far away from any holidays (when they might be on vacation).

**Okay, what do I actually write in the cold email?**

Throughout my high school career, I sent 3 cold emails and received 2 responses. I don't think I got incredibly lucky -- if you're sending a hundred at a time and they're all exactly the same, you're doing this wrong. Mine followed a short three-paragraph structure, around 250 words in total:

1. Introduced myself, my high school, the field of research I was interested in, and why
2. Said something specific about the prospective mentor's research, usually noting a specific article, that I found interesting. Asked some sort of spinoff question: e.g., ""because of your finding W, is it possible that X could contribute to the upregulation of Y and thus antiapoptotic activity, and could this be investigated through Z technique?""
3. I would appreciate the opportunity to speak more about your research and possibly discuss a summer internship, thank you for your time, etc etc
   1. If you have skills or experience applicable to this lab's work specifically, you can advertise them here. Be specific and list techniques: ""I have prior experience in plasmid design and cloning, and am proficient in Python 2.7.""
   2. If you have enough for a resume, attach a resume. If your overall GPA isn't good, recalculate it for only math and science classes and give that as well. List your relevant coursework, any other STEM-related activities, previous research experience, languages you speak...

**So, I got a response. What's next?**

Earlier, I talked about how an independent research project is ""ideally"" the goal. However, different labs will vary in the amount of latitude they'll give you. In my first (very prestigious) lab, I essentially ended up as a lab tech. It was actually a really valuable experience in the long term, since I ended up with an enormous skillset that I was able to market in getting my second lab, but I didn't get the opportunity to branch out independently. When you speak to your prospective mentor for the first time, show that you're ready and willing to learn, but also be clear about what you want from this experience. Find a lab that works for you.

**What's the timeline for all of this?**

For summer programs, it's a little late: you should start thinking about those in the fall, for application deadlines mostly in the winter. Luckily, you have tons of time to cold email! I don't think it's ever too early to start cold emailing: my first time around, I sent mine in November, interviewed in December, and had a lab placement by January. In May I touched base with my mentor via Skype and started working in June.

Depending on the lab and its location and your schedule, you can also ask to work over the school year. For instance, if you can start learning the lab's techniques in April or May, you can fully dive into your project when the summer hits, and continue into the school year if necessary.

**What about research in the humanities?**

Great question! It's less common (and imo, harder) for high schoolers to break into, simply because the academia is structured differently. I did speak to one prospective mentor in a humanities field, reaching out in a similar three-paragraph structure as above. He said that while he could offer me a position as a research assistant, he thought it would more worth my time as a high schooler to independently continue honing my skills in that subject and take summer courses. So, YMMV.

**How can I be successful in research?**

Being motivated in research is really, really important. It's easy to unwittingly spend your entire summer sitting around in the lab doing nothing. Write down the techniques you observe. Read the literature and familiarize yourself with the theory behind the research. ASK QUESTIONS when you don't understand. Be persistent about that independent project -- the worst your mentor can do is say no.

Also, a solid 90% of research is failure, p-values over .05, troubleshooting, fixing centrifuges. There's an element of luck in the creation of Regeneron-worthy projects. Again, don't lose motivation when you encounter this for the first time. As long as you're proactive in creating opportunities for yourself, you'll be successful. Good luck!"

I'm a business degree uni student in Canada working as an SAP basis/security intern (both S4hana and ECC) at a big oil n gas company. I'm bout to graduate and been thinking a lot about whether to stay in the SAP world (by tryna stay at this company) or to jump ship to a small tech consulting company that specializes in MS D365 (they have an entry-level functional position open)

I haven't applied to the tech company but I think I can at least get an interview with my experiences in SAP and network security.

I guess what I'm tryna ask is whether a career in SAP or D365 is better for someone like me in 2020 and moving forward.

Is there anyone who had experiences in both here? My boss (20+ years in SAP) is the one who actually suggested I look into D365 cause he hates SAP lol.

Thanks in advance.

ps. these two ERP systems are the only ones I'm interested in"

This sub helped me with my job search and I would like to give back by sharing my stats and tips.


I graduated from a ~~ivy league~~ good university in May 2019, was a very bad student, did the bare minimum for most my 3rd and 4th-year courses and had to retake two courses. I spent most of my time playing video games and by the time I graduated I had no recent projects or internships on my resume.


**Stats**:

Duration: May 24th, 2019 - Feb 18th, 2020. In this duration, I applied on 46 days.

Area: Vancouver, Canada.

Applied to: 173 jobs.

Phone interviews: 6.

Coding challenges: 3.

On-site interviews: 4.

Offers: 2.


**How I got my shit together**:

1. **Created a resume and kept improving it over and over**. Asked some of my already-employed friends to share their resume with me and compared it to mine. This showed me what I'm lacking.

2. **Worked on 2 projects and added them to my resume**. This was time-consuming and it's what I started with after I realized my resume is trash.

3. **Studied data structures and algorithms every day for an hour from Dec. 2019 till now**. This really helped raise my confidence as I slowly started solving Leetcode mediums without peeking at online solutions.

4. **Practiced interviewing with friends and family**, both the behavioral and technical parts. I made sure I can confidently speak about each of my projects and what made them challenging.

5. **Go to career fairs and meetups**. The first offer I got was from a startup I applied to in a career fair (didn't accept because of the way they treated me in the on-site was very unprofessional). The second offer I got was from a meetup I went to; I said hi to a random person and asked about his company, he gave me his card and I landed the interview and got an offer that way.


This whole process took around 8 months. At times I felt it was impossible to find a full-time when I got rejected from intern roles. Towards the end of 2019, companies stop hiring and that's when it was most difficult. I was full of hope again in Jan 2020, started going to meetups every week and said hello to every person. I wish I started going to meetups back in May.


I realize my stats are nothing compared to what others posted here. Having a good school on your resume with a few projects and a lot of luck and helpful friends is important. I salute those of you who are making the best of dire situations and I hope 2020 will be your year too!"

I've been following this subreddit for a couple of months now. My background: I am a third year CS student at a target school in Canada. My GPA is not the greatest, it is in the high 60s (My school does percentages). I have had three internships so far: full-stack (not shown on resume), back-end, and dev-ops. (One being at a decently well known company) I also recently took a remote position part-time doing Android and I am loving mobile! I am very proud of two side projects I built that are actually being used every day at my local high school. I also take the time to prep for coding interviews/whiteboarding and it is something I continue to get better at. I have applied to many positions in Canada and the US (maybe 100+) by using my school job portal, applying on glassdoor/linkedin/company site, and messaging recruiters directly. I do not seem to be able to land any interviews. I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection. A lot of the companies did not ask for my grades so I don't think that is a large issue. I even got referred to Zynga by one of my former direct co-workers who always thought highly of me, only to not get any response from them. I am really frustrated, I am not even getting the opportunity to show these companies my enthusiasm and excitement because I can't even make it to the phone screen! Is there something I am doing wrong? Should I rethink my approach? I feel like I am really unlucky at the moment but I am always striving to improve. I would appreciate any feedback and advice.

The work is (mostly) dynamic and interesting, but the travel is proving taxing on my well being. I spend much of the year abroad, and in austere contexts (conflict zones, mainly) so im looking for a career change that is based nearer home - London.

I have worked in very dynamic contexts and was recently head of mission for an emergency response setup to a recent natural disaster in Africa. My role also has a very strategic element as I often work with the Director on where the organisation should focus its efforts for new missions and programmes.

However, like i said, I'm finding this work to be very taxing on my social life and well-being. I feel dislodged from my home and increasingly distant from friends. It has also (understandably) played a role in upended a relationship. So i cant keep doing this long term and would like to do a job in London.

My problem is I don't know what else I can actually do. I look online for jobs and dont see things that my quite odd range of experience fits in well. I'd rather move out of the humanitarian/development sector and was wondering if anyone on this sub-reddit had ideas for industries/roles i could look at? I'm just ignorant of what else is out there.

In highschool I went to a vocational school for software development and had a internship as a web developer. Then I spent about 3 years working in infrastructure positions for a decent size company. A few months ago I was able to get into doing software engineering after picking up a IT support role and a manufacturing company.

It's only a contract role so I've been on the lookout for more work. I then got a phone interview for a junior devops role. I think i did pretty well despite falling short on aws and docker skills. I have the linux, infrastructure and software development experience so I feel like I'm a great candidate. They ended up offering me an onsite interview! :)

So I've been obsessing over AWS and docker the past few days to get ready. I'm extremely anxious because honestly after they described the role to me and the fact that it uses so much of what I learned in development/infrastructure/and linux.. It seems like my dream job..

I'm anxious mostly because I only have vocational school and no degree. Most of my side projects have been lost through distro hopping... I'm afraid I'll fail at a code screen if it's whiteboard, because I've used so many different languages the IDE is what keeps me from mixing up syntax sometime..

Indeed said they had tons of applicants and i'm not sure how many I'm competing with in the onsite interview. I'm extremely nervous because this is my dream role....I don't think there'll be a single candidate that wants it as much as me..

How do I not completely fail? :("

Hello everyone, I have quite the problem to unpack here, so, here goes:

I am 25 and I am a third-year university student. I was planning on graduating this year, but things took a different turn. Long story short, the first minor programme I followed was not to my liking (journalism) so I wanted to change minors and I took the minor in education course instead. But, as it required me to do the entire minor course in one semester, I decided to postpone writing my BA to prevent a too high of a study load (35 credits per semester is my limit, in terms of being able to realistically pass every course). 

The problem is, now I want to quit the programme for the minor in education as well (three weeks in).  

I followed a similar programme in the past for about a year and a half before deciding to go to university instead, but I quit that programme as well, as I was unsure whether I wanted to be a teacher or not for the rest of my life (after being an intern for 14 months). Now, about three years later, I've got that same feeling again and I don't know what to do about it. If this would have been 'my calling', why do I feel so incredibly stressed after each day at my internship? Yeah, teaching is very difficult, but I shouldn't feel so incredibly stressed right? I highly value the education and I was genuine in my pursuit to become a teacher, but I am thinking that I am just the wrong kind of person to teach. I only have to teach four hours a week and it is only making my anxiety worse (I have seen a therapist for social anxiety in the past) and it is making me very unhappy. I feel dejected and I am not getting any joy from it what so ever. Should I listen to my feelings or am I being unreasonable? 

Translation studies: 

After my first two days of teaching at my internship, I felt completely exhausted and my anxiety skyrocketed. I was not able to properly function for the remainder of that day. The weekend that followed was also very stressful because of that. This led me to search for alternative career paths and translation studies seemed like an attractive choice. I  never thought about becoming a translator before as it seemed like that were no enough jobs out there, but it turns out there are a reasonable amount of options out there and according to some sources there is even a small lack of translators where I am from (The Netherlands). I love languages and it is so stupid that I never explored this career option before, but now it has gotten my attention and I can still obtain a master degree that way. The thing I don't know is if I am overreacting about teaching or not. I kinda feel lost. 

There is also a financial catch:

I only have 14 months of student tuition left to finance myself (housing, groceries, tuition fees) and that is just enough to get my bachelor's degree next year (as I fucked myself with graduating this year by switching minor), but not enough to get my master degree by June 2022. This is not too big of a problem, however, as I can fairly quickly get a parttime job to be financially independent. 

Minor in education:

Getting that minor in education would mean I can get a teaching license for middle school, which translates to steady employment for the foreseeable future, yet should I? I can't think straight and I am prone to just drop this minor as well and start over next semester to finish my BA. 

Can someone please help me? 

Long story short:

\- swapping minor study programme led me to postpone my BA graduating by a year

\- teaching is incredibly stressful to me, making me feel like complete shit, exhausts me mentally

\- not sure what to do instead, translating has piqued my interest

\- slight money problems

\- quarter-life crisis much"

I have no internship experience, but I've worked on a couple personal projects, and I've recently gotten involved in my city's chapter of Code for America. I have a pretty high GPA, too. My question is, how much of my previous chemistry background should I mention on my resume and in interviews? I don't think I have enough experience to really set me apart from my competition without mentioning anything about it, and it might look better showing off my previous work experience. But it's not really that relevant to the jobs I'm applying for, and might make me seem like I'm not committed to CS.

The three options I've thought of, are: 

1. Don't mention anything about chemistry at all, and play it off like this is my first degree
2. Mention my bachelor's degree and lab work, but leave out grad school
3. Leave my chemistry background off of my resume, but mention it in interviews if it's relevant

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone, I'm a 2nd-year high school student (16 years old) from Croatia. I've been interested in tech and engineering for quite a while now (about 5 years), I did a ton of programming since then and recently got into electronics and more broader engineering. I understand lots of programming concepts and know \~10 programming languages (C/C++, C#, Java, JS/TS, etc.) and am learning about electronics design. In these 5 years I tried all kinds of programming, from web dev to game dev, OS/kernel dev and now embedded/firmware dev. I'm also able to program various other things and hopefully design a mostly digital PCB (currently in the process of doing that, will see how it turns out).

But I have one huge issue, I have never finished a single project. I have started literally more than a hundred of them but never truly finished any of them and just switched to a different project and forgot about the last one. Most of them are just local at the moment but I also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/nufflee/) with some of the better things I made. I'm really trying my best to change this in 2020 but we will see how that goes too.

I'm really only looking for the experience of working in such an environment, money is a nice bonus for working on my own projects and getting a lab set up but it doesn't matter a whole lot honestly.

Their HQ is relatively close to where I live and they're probably the most popular high-tech company in Croatia. I briefly looked at their website and saw that they do offer internships and have over a hundred open positions otherwise. I tried going through the intern sign up process but they are obviously requiring a CV and what not which I don't really have and I'm pretty sure that's mostly made for university students.

I reckon my next step would be to e-mail them directly and ask them about the possibility of something like this happening. I would basically include everything I said here but I'd expand more on the technical parts of it but this is getting pretty long for Reddit already. I'm posting here because I thought it would be a really good idea to ask actual engineers and possibly HR people about how they'd approach this/want this to be approached.

Is this even worth a try and would they actually get me seriously or just brush off? Sure, I don't have a ton of technical expertise or experience in this exact field but I think I have a really good starting point to learn and build on top of. I would absolutely do my best to complete whatever tasks I'd be given since I'm incredibly passionate and have been doing these things literally every signal day for 5 years and never stopped having fun and learning.

In the case it would be worth a try, does someone mind out pointing out what else I should include or exclude from what I've said here. What do I do to better show my skills and passion for this? For example, do I tell them I have a huge issue with finishing projects or will that sound too bad? I also stream programming on Twitch occasionally, is this something that would be worth mentioning? Of course it doesn't give the best example of me as a programmer or of my actual productivity but it's just more ""proof"" that I kinda know what I'm doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone, I'm a 2nd-year high school student (16 years old) from Croatia. I've been interested in tech and engineering for quite a while now (about 5 years), I did a ton of programming since then and recently got into electronics and more broader engineering. I understand lots of programming concepts and know \~10 programming languages (C/C++, C#, Java, JS/TS, etc.) and am learning about electronics design. In these 5 years I tried all kinds of programming, from web dev to game dev, OS/kernel dev and now embedded/firmware dev. I'm also able to program various other things and hopefully design a mostly digital PCB (currently in the process of doing that, will see how it turns out).

But I have one huge issue, I have never finished a single project. I have started literally more than a hundred of them but never truly finished any of them and just switched to a different project and forgot about the last one. Most of them are just local at the moment but I also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/nufflee/) with some of the better things I made. I'm really trying my best to change this in 2020 but we will see how that goes too.

Now, there's this really cool Croatian company called [Rimac](https://www.rimac-automobili.com/) which designs and produces electric supercars and various components for EVs in general. I learned about them a year or so ago and have been since following what they're doing and watching their YouTube videos.

I am planning to make some big changes in my life in the next 2 months and would be grateful if I can get some advice and wisdom from other developers. To give you a little background, I have been a lone developer for the last 7 years. I’ve had a partner and few interns for a period of about 2 years during that time but for the vast majority, I’ve been a one man show. 3 years ago,  I started learning React and NodeJS and really advancing my skills. Today I can confidently say I’m a full stack developer. I’ve worked on some good projects and have a good reputation with clients. I get quite a lot of enquires through word of mouth and my website. I some how handle it all on my own. I’ve now reached a point where I’m coding almost all day. I recently got a project to solve some major tech problems of a luxury fashion retail company. Like integrate POS, Product Information Management, AI based product recommendations on the e-commerce website are some of the features. I know after this, my portfolio is going to be very strong and I’m going to get some huge deals. 

Now my major concern is, I have been a freelancer ever since I started working. I have never worked for an agency/company to know how things work. I wonder how it is going to be to build and work with a team. If there’s anybody here who has transitioned from being a developer to a business owner, I would love to connect with you and learn how you built your team, how you managed multiple projects, what software tools you used to collaborate and what kind of a structure your company/agency has. I would be grateful if even people who work for companies could shed some light about how a web dev company is structured.

I know most of the discussions here are tech related. I hope I’m not asking these questions in the wrong place!

Thank you all!"

To my surprise, i’m not sure if ill be asked any coding questions like any leetcode or hackerrank assessments so for the most part, I think it is just pure phone interview questions. The dilemma that I have is it worth it to move out there for just an average pay. Its not a FAANG company or any huge company but I believe it does have a good name. (Its an Anti-virus company, you probably heard of it at least once in your life). The bad thing is, that they don’t provide any type of relocation assistance or any type of stipend. I would have to find my own housing and transportation to work. When I say average pay, recruiter said its in the range between 25-30$ an hour. So it’ll be the same as what I get here in the east coast. The position name I’ll have  (if I get it) is “Cloud Engineering Intern”. Like initially I’ve been applying to SWE or SWD positions but this is what I got so far. Will I still be considered for SWE positions after graduation, like will it be easier? Or will it still be hard as if I didn’t have an internship. The duration of the internship is about 12-14 weeks and I don’t know how hard it is/how expensive it is for the San Jose area.

Both would be phenomenal opportunities towards my future and I hate to say no to either. Here are some of the immediate pros/cons:

Capital One will pay like 2.5x more *and* offer free housing which would make my life so much easier. Capital One would also be a great chance to experience industry and would be a good opportunity to potentially receive a return offer as a possible career post graduation (I am a Junior in Math/CS currently). 

With NASA I already know my project and my mentor and it sounds like a super cool project. When else would I get to write machine learning models that might be used on a future mission to freaking space?? But this is on a government salary without housing support. Is the coolness of the project worth the sacrifice? Also taking NASA would mean me graduating with only research internships at universities and research in the public sector. I would be missing out on a true industry internship experience. 

Obviously, I can’t go wrong and I’m so grateful for both opportunities. Has anyone else been a part of Capital One’s TIP program or been a NASA intern? Does anyone have any thoughts on how either would impact/benefit possible post-graduate opportunities? Any thoughts or experiences would be so so helpful. Thank you all!"

I just recently had to sit out a semester because I didn't pass my last CSET in time, I'm 3 classes away from getting my credential. Anywho I just passed that CSET and my RICA at the same time. Now I'm taking CAFS classes to get a TK authorization for my credential and I have committed to subbing this semester and it was going GREAT. I had a mentor ask me to work at this school I've never been to (I mostly teach middle school because they are chill and stress free on a good day lol). My credential is going to be elementary I just wanted to see how middle school was because I've been in so many elementary classrooms.

The first 2 days in this classroom last week were AMAZING, those 1st graders listened and did all of their work. I was warned about a few problem students and how the teacher could not manage her own classroom AFTER I taught the first day. 1st grade is not a grade I truly want to teach but I took this job as a favor to her because everyone turned the job down (now I see why). After Valentine's Day, I saw the students for who they really are haha. It's a few problem students that I can manage but there is ONE who is an evil spawn. This student will be so nice and sweet one and the next she's throwing chairs across the classroom. I only told her to put the chair on the floor and to sit in the chair and she had the audacity to throw it, throw everything on her desk to the floor, storm out of the room before screaming at me telling me I'm UGLY haha the students were so sweet and caring they kept calling me beautiful. I have had a problem with her everyday since Friday, I had to call the vice principal to come get her because no one was coming and she was harming other children. I did not want to touch her because I knew she would lie and say I did something else. Yesterday, she did not want to participate during ELD so she sat in her chair and ate food she wasn't supposed to be eating, while I was reading to the students on the carpet she decided that she was bored enough and went through the teachers things in her desk, thats when I drew the line and stopped her. She proceeded to go to the Promethian board and mess it up, I still can't fix it. Then she took the teachers stickers and ripped them all up. I had to call the office yet again, someone came and got her and boy she did not willingly. The teacher next door who teachers 4th grade had her for the rest of the day. I was so grateful I almost cried, I have high blood pressure and I could feel may chest getting tight after dealing with her.

The other students in that classroom are angels compared to her and she comes to school EVERYDAY, I have no clue what to do with her. She screams in class, talks over me, hits other students, does what wants, leaves when she wants. It makes the other students think they can do the same thing and I feel like today I lost the respect of all of them because she was with me for the whole day just terrorizing everyone. She makes the other bad students act CRAZIER than they normally would so it makes for a very long and stressful day. Today I didn't put her in another class because I want to show the admin I can do this but the class was acting crazy because of her, I got so fed up I put on Clifford for the last 45 minutes of school because I needed to sit down. None of my credential classes taught me how to deal with this and none of the classrooms I have been in have had a child like this in them. What would you do? I want to let go of this job soooo bad because I feel like I have anxiety waking up knowing I have to be there with her but then the other part of me doesn't want to let it go because now I can be an intern and have my classroom in August and this would be a good school to work at and I need the money lol but my sanity and mental health are at war at this point. I keep telling myself I have 2 more weeks after tomorrow but damn it's hard for me to stay there. How would you deal with a child who acts like this? Any tips?"

I graduated back in Dec 2018 from an Australian University as an international student. Majoring in Data Analytics. Overcame all challenges. Managed to learn coding from scratch. Landed a summer  internship at a bank which led me to working on 2 industry projects (1 with an online company and 2nd with my own university). Graduated with above distinction grades. Managed to land a job before my graduation ceremony. My momentum was really good.

The first job went like this. I was working with a team of 4 people that were a data science consultancy company. I was hired as a support analyst. This meant I was doing all the backend work theses guys didn't want to do. It mostly involved writing pipelines, doing quick EDA reports, debugging code, compiling all their home made functions into a library and then writing documentation for it.  Their codebase was in R language. I was also involved in creating databases and made web apps. All done in Agile work environment. I was quite the slow one as I took me more than a month to get used to their code base and basically never worked a full on coding job. I was also learning on the job as they got me a datacamp subscription and I would also borrow books from their shelf to study them during my commute. My contract meant I would work 3 days a week.

I passed the probation period of 3 months. The contract remained the same as there was not much work that I could do. 3 of the employees were excellent mathematicians &amp; statisticians who could code. 1 was a senior developer who was their best programmer (decade of experience). Together these people would work on client solutions and come up with in house machine learning models and statistical solutions in a matter of weeks that my brain couldn't even comprehend as a couple of them had PHDs and over decades of experience. There wasn't much I could do besides do my tasks write code. I wanted to be more useful to them but there was simply nothing else that I could participate in.

**The Fall**

  
As a couple more months pass by. On my monthly review, one of the staff who is also a co-director had a discussion about my skills that I could focus on so I can be more useful to the team. This meant I would need to get more comfortable with math and stats as well as deeper knowledge of CS (Algorithms). She also spoke of increasing my pay as I seemed to be putting in the work. I was happy.

Then following the meeting came the Easter break. On my first day back to work, I opened my sprint cards and couldn't see any tasks left on my cards. She asked me its time for a chat regarding future work. We went to the meeting room. Then came the bad news.

She goes, ""I have to let you go. I feel awful to tell you this. But you have been working so hard.""

I said, ""It's okay!""

She said, ""I am sure you can always get into some graduate program where the pacing of work is much less harsh and you can work your way upwards"".

I packed my belongings and left the office trying to hold back tears. She offered me a taxi, I rejected it and did my farewell with the team and left. I cried on my way to train station. Went and ate my favourite burger. I understood why I was let go. Being a small company I wasn't making enough money for them to break even. Even though I was just working 3 days a week.

**The Limbo**

  
This was back in April 2019. I got out with 6 months work exp. Ever since then I have been applying to 100's of jobs. Got called only for 2 interviews and failed them both. Since I was an international student graduate. I only had a 2 year work visa. I also took help of recruitment agents to land me interviews. However, once I was past the 1 year mark on my visa. Everything came to a halt. Only rejections from here on. The recruiter agents discarded me. In the months that followed. I got anxiety and depression. I stopped applying all together. Opening LinkedIn and other job sites would give me anxiety. Reminding me how bad I am. My friends from university were all shocked at my downfall. I used to be guy who would enjoy coding and help my friends with their assignments. Those friends of mine landed jobs and are happy. I helped a lot of friends in university and would teach them programming.  I took up a job of tutor in university to pay my bills but thats about it. In the mean time I learnt Python and C# (I am working on building a game using Unity). I love to code.

Can you guys please go through my resume and tell me how can I ever get out of this LIMBO. Honestly I prefer to go for developer type roles rather than an analyst. Its getting near impossible to land interviews as my job gap keeps going higher and higher by the day.  Thanks a lot for taking the time to read this far.

A good internship will be my launching point , i'm really looking to learn from it alot since all i have seen during school is merely theoretical , my current skill chart doesn't look so promising but there is much room for progress:

2 Scala projects :

I'm honestly quite frustrated with my options. the program I was admitted to does NOT meet the 90 credit requirement that most states have to get a counseling license. this was discouraging and the advisors have not been very helpful. 

the other school that I was going to apply to has a program that would meet the credit requirements and most of the internship and practicum requirements for the states, it would take 3.5 years to complete and cost $40,000.

my friend got her CPA and tells me about how she loves her job, makes good money, and suggested I look into. I love business and math and am an organized person and she said I would be a great fit. the requirements seem like I would just need 24 plus 12 credits of tax / accounting classes and work experience and I could sit for the CPA license process. it would take me about 1.5 years or classes which would be under $10,000. there are work experience requirements as well.

has anyone else gotten their CPA with a non-accounting degree? is it worth it? should I go for it? or should I just enter a counseling program?"

I am a double major in Econ and CS and am thinking a little bit about a career in finance. I have so far spent my entire focus with regards to internships on the CS side of things and will most likely have at least 2 software related internships by the time I graduate, including one at a big 4 bank. But, I just wanted to ask, say i decide that I may be better suited to a career in finance, how exactly could I go about being considered for more traditional banking positions after I graduate? Should I try to pursue further education such as an MBA or an MS or is there some other way with just the above experiences as an undergrad? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I haven’t touched GIS since last semester(Sep-Dec) because I couldn’t fit any GIS courses in my schedule. So I might be a little slow if I’m asked a technical question. 

I have an interview set up for this upcoming Thursday and I’m not sure how to prepare for this. I’ve had internships in the past as a software engineering intern but nothing GIS related. I was able to do fine with the CS interviews because I’m always programming since it’s my main focus. 

I have three more classes to take to get my degree for GIS but I am able to get two of them dropped leaving me only with a senior seminar to take.

Also, I tried looking up the company to learn more about them but I have no idea how since it’s a government job and it’ll be working for a city, not a company.

If wondering what courses I took for GIS:
-Intro to GIS
-Map Design
-Theory and Methods

Classes left to take:
-Quantitative Analysis(able to drop because of an advanced stats class and advanced data vis class)
-Analysis and Modeling(Able to drop because of advanced data vis)
-Senior Seminar

f7adbg,1,2020-02-21,How can a person with a degree in marketing from an unknown university get a job ?,itzAaryan,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f7adbg/how_can_a_person_with_a_degree_in_marketing_from/,"Before you read, this post might be long so please stick by. And try to answer as if I don't know anything. Thanks

First of all, I am a student studying for Bachelors of business in marketing at a small university (probably no company knows about it). It is due to financial reason I could not go to a big university. 

And I am planning to get a job in digital marketing. Probably focusing more on social media marketing including graphics designing and creative designing. But it is not necessary, the main focus was on marketing manager.

But I am in a fear that my degree from a small university might not land me a job as I have heard that in business related fields, companies look at the university prestige and people from better university degrees get a job first.

Also, I know that internships help a lot. But how do I get them? Many seniors that I know couldn't get an internship because they either did not get an answer from the company because of their unknown degree and second, they couldn't prove themselves worth.

I am purely determined to show my worth. I have started working on projects I can show. I have started getting the maximum GPA I can get.

I have family members living in a big city. Will it help?

Is there any way a person who has just got a degree from a small university can gain experience. Internships and start ups tend to look after degrees (not my opinion). And MBA programs too require minimum 3-4 years of experience.

What projects can be show on a resume in Digital Marketing?

I don't want to hit six figures right now. I am ready to work long time and make a reputed post in a company and then hit the probable six figures.

So the main question summarized if you didn't read- Will a person with a marketing degree from a small unknown university get an easy job? Do the companies look at the prestige of university? What is a way to get internship with a less reputed degree? Will great GPA help? What is the best way to get a job in digital marketing with good income?

Note - A huge thanks to everyone who answers as I am pretty lazy in replying back 'thanks' Also, it would be a huge help if you can clear out all my doubts in the questions as I am pretty tensed with my future."
f7bbcr,72,2020-02-21,[Post Exam] Got back your A level results? What now?,Maxxhh,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f7bbcr/post_exam_got_back_your_a_level_results_what_now/,"I will be splitting this whole thread into a few section and it should served as a general guideline for probably most students here.

**1) Perfect result. Better than your expectation. Definitely able to get into your choice of university and courses.**

Big big congrats if you have fallen into this group. All the countless hours of muggings, revisions, consultations, time trials paid off. Your future seems bright and you are all ready to take on University in August, not unless you have NS to clear off first.  But question is, how do you make your life even better?

For those who know what course you want to get into, good for you! For those who are still not so sure, go to University open houses. But because of the Ncov situation, many open houses are becoming E-tours, so do your own research, look for courses you are interested in and the potential careers aspect. Search through reddit, forums, you should get a fair point of views if this is a path you want to head down in the long run.

Next, start looking for scholarship opportunities, Universities themselves give out scholarship, but these scholarships are a little hard to get since they are no bonds to it. Private companies, MNCs, government bodies are giving out scholarship too. Do your own research, it should save you tons of school fees and some still give allowance of covering your school fees or hostel fees!

From now till university starts, you have a good 4 to 6 months. Orientations starts in June. Get a internship to expose yourselves and start building your portfolio that is related to your uni course. For guys, you can do the exact same thing once you ORD. Building a good portfolio will allow you to stand out from your cohort once you start looking job! You can do this for your all your university holidays or even take LOA for more prestige internship opportunities.

**2) Barely scraping pass the 10th Percentile of the course you want to get into.**

You are probably scoring about 68 to 75 rank points. Your score seems to be able to get you into university but might not be able to go the course(s) you wanted to get into.

For guys - You have the luxury of trying to applying 3 times due to NS. So you can make full use of all 3 years opportunities and apply for the course you wanted to. Percentile grades are just a rough gauge, so please still go ahead and try applying to the course you want.

For girls - Unfortunately you only have 1 application this year before you officially starts, it more of a matter of luck, so try to apply all university for the course you wanted to get into and hopefully you can secure a spot for interview and a chance for you to ace the interview.

*Should you be applying for a course that you have total no interests just because your grades only allow you to get into it and you want to get into a local university?*

My recommendation is a big no. You most probably will get into University, enjoy your friends company but hate your day to day lectures, tutorials, projects due to your lack of interests in your course of study. And most probably end up doing an entire different career of what you studied.

**3) Bad result. You feel like it's the end of the world.**

You gotten back your result, you saw multiple Cs and Ds. You felt like the world is crashing down on you. Trust me, this feeling is probably worse than your first break up. But hey! It's not end of the world, your life is not going to end here, you still have to move on so pick yourself up and look through different options you have!

Option 1: Go overseas!Overseas universities requirements are much lower and you definitely can get into a course you want to. But of course, it is probably going to cost you a good 3x to 4x more than what you will incur in a local university. So if financially your family is able to afford, then yes overseas is probably one of your best bet here.

Option 2: Can't afford overseas, how?NTU, NUS, SMU are not the only universities in Singapore. UniSIM, SUTD, SIT do provide a good wide range of courses just that their school fees are a little higher but hey, you still get to experience the local vibrant university culture. Private universities (SIM, Kaplan etc) are an option too!

Yes in terms of prestige wise, local public universities might somehow gain a better recognition with companies out there, but if you have a stronger portfolio (more internships experiences, work experiences), you are definitely going to outshine someone with zero experience.

Option 3: No, i still want to go to only NTU, NUS or SMU.Okay fine! The only way this going to happen is if you retake A levels either as a private candidate or if your school allows you to join back your school current JC2 batch.

For guys if you are to retake as private candidate, you will not be able to disrupt your NS cycle and have to do it while you are in NS. If you can join back your school, then yes, you can disrupt your NS cycle and you can focus on doing well for your A this time round. BUT as a private candidate it won't be easy, whether you are heading to command school or not, you are most probably busy with ur NS life and won't have much time and simply not much energy to do well as a private candidate.

For girls, likewise, joining back a school will gain you all the assistances from school teachers and resources. If you are doing it as a private candidate, you might want to consider getting external help (Tuitions etc).

Feel free to comment below if you have any further questions, I will try my best to give you best possible advices!"

I understand core concepts like OSI, and TCP/IP, how some protocols work. I also understand http vwry well. Still I don't feel confident around concept like NAT, DNS, DHCP, network interfaces ...

The problem is that most of the guides/tutorials I found in the internet are either for beginners or for network gurus.

What I need is a checklist, roadmap of what a good sysadmin should know about networking. Some good resources (books, articles, courses...) to learn from would be great too.  It would be greater if they are practical and in relation with linux."

I (21F) am wondering , ""What am I doing wrong?” I work in an AMAZING work environment- A THEME PARK!!! I interact with people all the time at work and made some good relationships with my co-workers. I am in a special internship program so I don’t stay in one general area. I am all over this theme park. So I get to interact with thousands of people a day.
   Well, my job is now closed for 2 1/2 months due to weather and repairs (like every season). I have found myself as a hermit. I don’t go out. I only talk to my bf and grandparents (because I live with them). I’ve gone out once to go to a small house party with my co-workers and after that... No communication. I’ve tried reaching out. I’ve even tried setting up gatherings and outings and nobody seems interested . You may ask, “Why don’t you go out with the bf?” Well, he just moved to another state months ago. He occasionally sees me but only for a few days then it’s back to his new home. 
   It’s easy to make new friends, but maintaining them is not. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Any tips? Any “rules” I should know about?"

In college, I really wanted to go to law school. I did a lot to prepare myself. I was so interested and EXCITED and somewhere along the road my passion for anything has fizzled out. I can't even stick to a hobby. 

Right after college I had a challenging time, I lost two family members months apart that were extremely close to me. I had to move home for a while to take care of everyone, do arraignments, etc. When I came back I was living alone in the city, working a front desk job with too much down time, and dealing with constant panic attacks. I lost so much weight my friends asked if I had an ED. I found a therapist and worked through a lot of it and things have improved within the last 2 years, but there's been many setbacks along the way.

 I've always been an independent person - whether that be out of fear to rely on others or because I'm the person my family relies on and I'm scared to fail or let them down. Never had time for a relationship but now I'm in one. And it's been a while so slowly I feel like I can rely on him and it's new to me to work as a team with someone else. I love it, but it's easy to get lost in rose colored glass when things are good. My life for once feels steady and I feel comfortable and at peace. I'm secure in the sense I can afford rent, a vacation, pay bills and loans. Money's always been an issue in my family, we'd never gone on a vacation growing up and I'm very scared to lose that security and pile on debt again. What if I can't make it through law school? What if something happens and I fuck up? 

I've applied to a few law schools for this Fall but now I'm not sure if it's really what I want. I've never been a lawyer so how do I know I'll like it? Also, the workload is extremely daunting. I did fine in undergrad with balancing internships, waitress job, clubs and honors but this isn't undergrad. Everyone who's gone to law school makes that crystal clear. They tell me about their breakdowns, living in the library, and feeling like they're losing their minds.. I just had that!! Why would I voluntarily go back to suffering? It was awful. I finally am on steady ground and it's like I don't want to leave my safety bubble. Like that episode of Spongebob where he won't leave his house. But thats not ok either-  I also don't want to wake up one day 40 years from now resentful because I never did anything for myself. Living for my kids or living for someone else and just letting life happen to me all those years. 

How am I suppose to make such a judgement call when there's so many risks involved? What if it's making a mistake? What if I hate it and then have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt? How the heck could I ever pay that off? But also, what other options do I have? Slowly work up the ladder from the job I hate now, doing something I never wanted to be doing with the hope that an opportunity comes around that will just ""work out?"""

My background is several years self-learning before touching university. I started off wearing sys admin and dev ops hats. Played my hand at a few tech startups working alongside a developer. The last two years I've spent wearing the dev cap. I've worked with close to a dozen languages at this point, far from mastering any one. I don't have an issue reading documentation, google-fu, getting up to speed given enough time. I can figure out space/time complexity, know the concepts of most basic data structures, but implementing on the fly for an interview? Not happening yet.

I'm being afforded 6 weeks to prep for a technical interview. Not looking to jump right into a FAANG, but definitely don't want to have a lack of confidence and blank on technical questions all the same. So I figure learning a bit of system design, standard leetcode/hackerrank, and working on a portfolio piece side project is a good bet. I'm not entirely sure what exactly entails the system design question, but get the feeling that will take the least amount of time to study. I've provisioned a ton of services over the years and had to plan out systems for the startups. So I'm thinking perhaps a 20/40/40 split which might translate into an 90 minutes a day on system design and three hours each of algos and three hours a day on my personal project.

That brings it out to about 60hours total working through system design and 120 hours a piece for algos and my personal project. Nothing perfect, things can shift around as need be. I figure outside of FAANG, mostly static arrays, linked lists, the most well known trees and hash table problems are about all that needs to be done. Add in some graph problems because they're fun anyways. Is this sounding sane at all? I'd like to read through this book as well: [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)

Basically I rushed through the CS degree in 4 months through WGU, and that meant focusing on one course at a time and slamming them out. So some of those courses were programming where you'd need to complete a (relatively) large project. That's cool you're coding all day every day for those courses. Then you get a few without any programming in between. So it's been on and off the last several months. I need to be coding every day, a mix of algos to build up more foundational, and personal project to build up the portfolio. I'm just making sure my general plan is decent enough use of my time.

Any thoughts here?"

The way I see it I should just ride out as long as I can here and if I get laid off then I’ll start applying. I’m not living near any faangs and not in a position to relocate right now. What would you do in this situation?"

Would you share your experience to me?

———Below is my personal experience, you can simply skip it if you don’t want to read —————-

I’m 25 and have worked a year after graduated from my bachelor degree in Government administration and international relations. I have always loved technology and I’m pretty good about it, but I would like to know more about the world after I graduate from high school, so I choose to study the degree I mentioned instead of any tech related degree.

A month ago, I honestly didn’t regret about it. I have learned many things from the bachelor degree....geopolitics,management,economics,political science, lots and lots, and I have a great time. But I truly failed to consider the impact of the degree to my career and postgrad studies.....

My original plan is : Government Bachelor -&gt; Find an entry level IT job to gain experience and explore the industry for a year, attend IT courses and get certificates -&gt; CS/Information System/Information Security Master

So things run pretty smooth at the beginning, I attend MCSA courses and get the certificates and I had found a job as IT helpdesk at a large casino and I found that this position is super boring for me, I had learned very limited IT related knowledge, mostly soft skills and the users are really dumb, asks very stupid questions everyday and the team is not valued by the company at all, so I wanted to find a position that is more creative and can squeeze my brain juice. I had only worked the helpdesk job for 3 months. 

After one to two months of job searching, I joined an internship program and later get a job offer as system developer in a digital marketing startup and helped the company build an social media management platform. The platform controls different social media accounts(e.g facebook, instagram) and have various functionalities. That time I work super hard and learn how to use Python, Qt, Google Cloud Platform , MySQL, Html css js php.....so literally I suppose I’m walking toward the path as a web app developer. However, the company does not last long, it closed at October last year and I have been unemployed since then. My lifespan in this job is around 9 months.

I didn’t particularly worry at the time, I think it is a good chance for me to prepare and apply my postgrad, so my girlfriend want to study computational linguistics and it is really famous in Uppsala University, Sweden. And I like that place too, I have exchange experience to Sweden and have lived there for a semester. However, almost all IT postgrad program require previous credits in Bachelor studies.....so I really have very limited chance to get in (my Swede friend say I will have NO CHANCE, I still want to have a try anyway)......

Now is almost March....So it is almost half a year, I have applied around 30 positions(I dont have much opportunities in my city) that I think I’m qualified, but I only have a few feedbacks and then no shows at all. I believe it is because most jobs require to have IT related degree, so I didn’t get selected. Now I decide to wait one more month and keep applying IT jobs."
f7gzyg,545,2020-02-21,My girlfriend is terrified of deer. I didn't believe her until it was too late.,Sea_Witness,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f7gzyg/my_girlfriend_is_terrified_of_deer_i_didnt/,"I live in the woods, but not the way most people mean it when they say “I live in the woods”. I don’t just have a bunch of trees in my backyard -- I live on about 10 acres of woodland near a local nature center, in a house my grandfather willed me a few years ago. It’s an area I’ve lived in and around for most of my life, so I’m used to the quirks that come with it. Mostly the wildlife and bad cell reception, but sometimes downed trees, or snake infestations.

My girlfriend Annie is what a lot of people around here would call a *city slicker.* She lives half an hour away in the closest college town, has an internship at a publishing company, and drives an electric car. We met through some mutual friends who go to the same college, and she doesn’t have a problem with driving out to visit me, so we see each other a few times a week. She’s a good sport about the bad cell reception, too, and the insects that are constantly trying to get into the house. She doesn’t even mind the truck I drive that’s older than me, or the *suggestion* of there being snakes around.

In fact, there’s only one thing on my property Annie has a problem with, and I didn’t notice it until a few months ago. She was driving me back to my place after we’d gone out for dinner and a movie, and it was dark out - the kind of pitch dark it can only really get in the woods. The high-beams of her car lit up my gravel driveway as she turned off onto it, lighting up the corridor of trees around us as brightly as if it was still daytime. Annie hummed along and bobbed her head to the radio, and I leaned back in my seat, checking whatever text messages I could before my cell service took a dive.

Suddenly, Annie slammed the breaks. I looked up sharply to see if we had reached the house, or if an animal had run across the road, but there was nothing out there. Just more gravel road. I looked to Annie for some kind of explanation, only to find her recoiling from the windshield with an expression as though she’d just seen a big, fat spider skittering across the kitchen floor. Her gaze was locked on something just to the side of the road, and I followed her line of sight to a spot where the high-beams were reflecting off of a handful of wide, glowing eyes like glass marbles. A couple of does, and what looked like a young buck, just starting to grow antlers.

“They’re not gonna cross,” I said, thinking that Annie was afraid of hitting them.

“I know,” she said.

“So what,” I said, “you’re afraid you’re gonna catch Lyme’s disease?”

“I’m just afraid of them,” Annie said, setting her jaw stubbornly.

I’m ashamed to admit it now, but I might have laughed.

“They’re just deer,” I said, leaning across her to smack the center of her steering wheel. The car horn sounded in a sudden blast of noise, and the deer scattered back into the woods.

“I know they’re just deer,” Annie said, very clearly annoyed with me. There went any chance of her spending the night at my place. “And I’m still afraid of them. I don’t like the way they watch me.”

She said it like she knew it was silly - and I was tempted to make fun of her a little more, or to tell her a couple of stories (from experience) of just how stupid deer could be, to reassure her that there wasn’t much of anything going on behind those reflective eyes of theirs. But part of me could sense that Annie was genuinely freaked out, and I should just leave it alone. Besides, people have all kinds of weird phobias. Being afraid of deer was probably nothing compared to some of those.

---

I put Annie’s phobia out of mind, except for the few times she drove me home and I watched her anxiously checking the darkness around my house for deer, recoiling the same way she had that first night whenever she spotted any. Watching her watch the deer made me begin to realize that I had no idea how large the deer population on my property really was. During the day, I would occasionally see groups of nine or ten deer grazing on grass at the edge of the treeline near my back porch - deer of all shapes and sizes, from huge bucks to the tiniest fawns that looked as though they’d just been born. I started trying to keep track of them, to see if it was the same group every time, or different families, but it was hard work. A lot of deer look exactly the same.

Even in spite of realizing exactly how many deer lived on my property, I didn’t think of them as a problem until the hunter showed up on my doorstep. He drove a truck bigger than mine - a hulking, white thing with an American flag decal plastered all along one side of it - and said he and his buddies had been asked by the nature center to cull their deer population. My property butted right up against theirs, so he offered to send a few guys my way to clear out the woods around my house.

“You’re *culling* the deer?” I asked, sounding maybe a little more outraged than I should have been. “Why?”

“Just cuttin’ down the population,” he said, giving me a look like I had no idea what I was talking about. It made me like him less. To be fair, I didn’t know what I was talking about in this particular instance, but I’m not fond of that look. It’s a look I get a lot, being a woman who lives alone in the woods.

“Why?” I asked again. Surely there weren’t that many deer in the woods.

“Overpopulation,” the hunter said, still giving me that look, like I was asking questions I should already have known the answer to. “Too many deer at the center. Screws up the ecosystem. More chance of people gettin’ Lyme over there, too. And eventually, the deer’ll run out of food and starve.”

When he put it like that, I got the idea that this was a lot kinder towards the deer than the alternative. I could probably deal with seeing less fawns in my yard if it meant the ones still around had plenty to eat. And less deer meant less for Annie to be afraid of, on the nights she came over.

“Alright,” I said, with a curt nod. “You can sweep my property, too. What do I owe you?”

“Nothin’,” the hunter said. “Our deal with the nature center is we get to keep whatever we kill. Now, you’re free to pay extra if you want the meat -”

“That’s okay,” I said quickly. I thanked him for the offer, then, and retreated back into my house as he walked back towards his truck.

---

I found out from a friend who worked at the nature center that the culling was scheduled to take place early the next morning, practically before the sun came up. I slept with headphones in that night, intent on ignoring any gunshots that came out of the woods behind my house - if there were any to begin with. Did most hunters still use bows? I’d only been hunting a few times with my grandpa, when I was in high school, but I remembered being taught to use a bow.

Despite the headphones, I woke up close to the crack of dawn like I usually did, when the sun started to pour in from the window next to my bed. I don’t go to school, and I have an IT job that lets me work remotely from my laptop, but there’s always house chores that need doing, and I like to get them out of the way in the mornings.

I was putting out food on the porch for the stray cats that like to come around when I saw it. A trail of fresh blood in the grass right near the treeline, and a deer crawling its way across the ground, all the way down on its belly, like a scared dog. I’d never seen a deer crawl like that before. There was something unnatural about it, something that made me wonder if it was rabid. Judging from the blood trail, it was at least wounded.

I stepped back into the house, and grabbed my grandpa’s shotgun out of the garage. It was old, and I wasn’t sure it had ever actually been used. My grandpa had told me it was more for scaring off trespassers than anything. Still, there were a few boxes of shells in the garage, and I loaded the gun with buckshot before taking it outside with me.

The deer I’d seen before had vanished, leaving only the trail of blood behind it. I steadied my hands on the barrel of the shotgun, my fingers feeling a little frozen in the early morning cold, and walked into the woods as quietly as I could, mindful that any twig I snapped underfoot would likely send any deer - even a hurt or rabid one - running.

I’d been in the woods around my property before, but not often, and following the blood trail led me deeper inside than I’d ever been before. It was strangely quiet back there, except for the occasional rustling of foliage, and the canopy of trees blotted out the sun in a way that left me perpetually in the shade. The blood trail on the ground never dried up, though - in fact, it got wider and wetter as I continued to follow it. I was sure that any moment I would come upon a deer that had been half-eviscerated, and somehow crawled all the way back to where it thought it would be safe.

What I actually found at the end of the blood trail was something worse. Something I still see painted on the backs of my eyelids at night, when I’m trying to clear my mind enough to fall asleep.

The blood trail didn’t belong to a deer - rather, it ended close to a hollow in the trunk of a large tree that a man lay inside. At least, I thought it was a man. I could only see his legs sticking out. A handful of deer stood over him, occasionally lowering their heads down to sniff or lick at the man, and several had mouths that were shiny with blood.

I moved closer, cocking the shotgun. The noise startled the deer, and all of them bolted but one, a large doe who stayed right where she was. Watching me. A glistening rope dangled from her mouth that I thought might have been part of a hunter’s  trap, but later realized was a bit of intestine. I took a few more steps forward, watching the doe watch me, until I stood over the hollow in the tree.

The man inside was the hunter I’d met the previous day. His bright orange coat was soaked with blood, his chest and abdomen bitten open in more places than I could count, the skin torn away in lazy strips. His skin had turned a sickly gray, and there were strange, round wounds in his neck, like he’d been stuck with a stake or a screwdriver. Antler wounds, I realized, my stomach turning over. I reached out to lift his coat slightly with the end of the shotgun, and recoiled as I caught sight of his ribs through one of the holes the deer had bitten in him.

A twig snapped next to me. The doe was still there, still looking at me with her big, glassy eyes. Still munching on the rope of the hunter’s intestines. I raised the shotgun, and unloaded buckshot into her.

---

That was a few days ago, and I haven’t left the house since. I called the nature center to ask how the culling went, and they said that half the hunters who went into the woods never came back out. The police came by to ask if I’d seen or heard anything from my property, and I lied. Who ever heard of deer eating someone alive?

I’ve been thinking, though, about what the hunter said to me when he came by. About how when there are too many deer on a property, they start to run out of food. Starve. I’ve heard before that a lot of herbivore animals will eat meat, if they’ve run out of options. What I haven’t heard about is animals like that doing it in a vengeful way. An *intelligent* way. Not eating the nature center employees, but the hunters, instead.

I haven’t seen the stray cats that live around here all week. The food I left out for them that morning hasn’t been touched. But I have seen the deer. They’ve been circling my house all week, crawling on their bellies in the grass like the one that led me to the hunter. I can’t help but feel like they know what I did to that doe somehow, like one of them saw me shoot her, and passed the knowledge on. Like the deer think I’m a hunter, too.

They haven’t gotten up to the doors yet, but some of the bucks are on my back porch, looking into the windows. I drew all the curtains in the house, turned off all the lights, but I can still feel their eyes on me, right outside. It can’t be long before they try to break the glass. I swear I’ve heard them tapping on it with their antlers, testing where the weak points are. I’ve peeked out of the second floor windows at night, trying to catch them at it, but all I ever see are their reflective eyes shining up at me out of the dark.

Annie was right to be afraid. I’m sorry I doubted her."

Okay so I'm a creative person, always have been and everyone around me knows this. From a very young age I started writing stories, painting and drawing and designing. As I've grown older the rest have kind of turned into hobbies but I've always worked on my writing.  

However, now I'm in a place where I'm doing things that aren't in line with my creative self. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering in uni and I hate it. So naturally, being the overachieving go-getter that I am, I decided to change things. 

In the first three months of last year I learned the Adobe Creative Suite because I'm very interested in graphic design and motion graphics and I wrote a few articles. I managed to get two internships later that year as a graphic designer and another as a writer. I got myself a side job as the assistant to the creator of a trivia show where I do some editing, direction among other things all while going to school. So at the moment, my CV isn't looking too bad (I don't mean this in a proud or arrogant way at all)

Now with that being said, I feel like a waste of space. I feel like I'm not doing anything important and everything I've done or am doing at the moment feels so inconsequential to me that sometimes I'm like wtf. 
Mainly because when I go online I see people doing things that I'd rather be doing. They've built a huge and dedicated following of people who are so invested in them and their work. I want to have that. 

For instance, I'm gay and live in a country where homosexuality is criminalised and I'm in a place with myself where I want to do something about that. I want to write stories that matter (and be recognized for it, vain as it may sound) There's another gay guy in a similar situation living in my country who has actually turned it around and is using his writing as activism. His stories have been published in international magazines. I'm very very proud of him. I'm basically a fanboy. I want the same thing. I want to write stories that matter and help other queer people. 
Same thing with the YouTubers that I watch.

 I don't know if I only want to do that because I've seen others do it. I don't want to be a copycat but it seems that's the only explanation I can come up with for what I feel. Or is it jealousy or am I just seeking validation or follower count. They've all found their niche and are being recognized for it and I want the same thing. But I don't want to be a copycat so how do I figure out what my thing is? I have a lot of interests and I usually think of pursuing them separately. I'm really big on interdisciplinary endeavors (polymath here, if that wasn't clear already 😄) but when it comes to me I don't know how to marry all my interests because I've never seen it done anywhere. Sure it'll be say that I'm a pioneer in whatever I come up with but that's not it. I don't know where to start or what to even do.


Whew! This question has taken so many turns even I did not expect. I just started typing and everything came spilling out. If you've read through to this point I want to tell you that I deeply appreciate it and that whatever thoughts you come up with in the comments are very much appreciated.
Thank you!😊"

I will be doing an internship this summer. I've found a company, got accepted, but my internship counselor from the uni forces me to develop a project based on the technologies that the company is currently using. He says that he wants to make sure I find a legit place, and not do the internship based on the paper. Long story short, I have contacted the company to give me a homework project, but they said that they can't because of privacy protocols. So I need you guys to advise a project for me to complete based on these criterias:  



-J2SE / JEE knowledge

-Server side techs (JSP, Servlets, Web Services, Spring, Hibernate etc.)

-Application services (Apache Tomcat, JBoss, Glassfish, WebSphere, WebLogic etc.)

-Database systems (PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server etc.)

-Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery knowledge

-Preferably Linux knowledge



I got these from the company's ""Java Developer"" job offering. I'd appreciate greatly anyone who tries to give me a project idea. Thank you."

I then end up not understanding it and getting demotivated and asking myself questions like: can I even do this? is this right for me?

I guess I need to properly divide the problem into smaller pieces and disallow myself to continue to the next piece until the first are finished. I was wondering if you had any other tips.

Maybe important to note that I haven't really struggled during my studies and I am ambitious to do a masters degree after this. I have gotten all my study points so far and I average on 75/100 for all the tests which is pretty good (imho).

f7j9k9,1,2020-02-21,Seeking Career Advice for a 4th year Computer Science Student,Mean2B,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f7j9k9/seeking_career_advice_for_a_4th_year_computer/,"Hello,

I'm 27M who's in the final year of Computer Science degree in Canada. I was introduced to C programming back in 2016 and that's how my journey began. As I'm studying CS, I realize how inadequate I am for any software developer position (mostly internship positions) and how interesting various fields of CS are to me everyday.  However, I have several problems at the moment.

1. Specialization/Career Path
2. Interviews &amp; thinking process

First of all, people say specialization will make oneself competitive. It's been 5 years since I discovered CS and every field of CS to me is so interesting - Software Engineering, Web Development,  Machine Learning, Data Science, Mobile Development, VR/AR, Computer Vision and more. As I'm interested in many areas with shallow knowledge of many, how should I go about choosing a specialization before I graduate?

This leads to my second question: Career Path. I've only had 8 months internship experience as a DevOps Support Analyst at a giant retail company in Canada. I wrote lots of queries for log analysis to create analytics dashboards, which helped me improved my analytical skills. But, I wanted to learn about software development which didn't match to the demand of the company at that time. So, I'm currently applying to software development specific positions (internships) without any personal goal, but just to get industrial experience as a developer to see if that is a fit to me. I've been called for in-person interviews at a big  and a small startup company, and found some difficulties along the way. I've been programming in such wrong ways that I focused on picking up languages, writing programs using them without knowing much about those languages, and not thinking much about time complexity - just to get assignments, projects done on time.  As you know, interviewers ask ""trivia"" or ""in-depth"" questions specific to their technology stacks. I suck at it and understand the intention behind it. So, how can I help myself when applying to jobs and/or having interviews? other than memorizing?

Also, I'm seeing myself being stuck in the way of thinking. For example, given a string of this format: ""act|I  want to act better"", ""speak|I need to speak"", that is anything before the pipe symbol is a command and what's after the symbol is data. How can I write a function to return the number of words when the command is ""act"" and the number of characters when the command is ""speak"". Other conditions need to be checked optionally and how would I write the program if I were to put my code on github to be shared by people - this was an interview question I was asked.

I often think iterating through the string character by character and store subsequent characters before the pipe symbol is detected into a string and continue with the rest. This kind of approach will make my program complicated. Instead, I could get substrings before and after the pipe symbol and write conditional statements. But I can't think at interviews and this bad habit of mine has failed me at interviews many times. So, how can I think better?

To summarize, I'm seeking your experience/advices to better understand:

1. How I  should go about choosing my career/specialization
2. How I can think better
3. How I can prepare myself to be a competent developer before graduation - I do personal projects and LeetCode questions at times
4. How I can work in US / How difficult is it for non-US citizen to work in US with no industrial experience? The tech market in western Canada is really small and I want to be part of active tech market to stay motivated.

Thank you for your time to read my thread. It was my daily thought that troubled me much these days and wanted to seek real advices from expertises working in the industry."
f7l152,2,2020-02-21,graduated with a CS degree - switching to front-end?,aeglon97,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/f7l152/graduated_with_a_cs_degree_switching_to_frontend/," I've had more experience in software engineering and project management throughout college. I have exposure to Python, Java, C#, C++, data analytics in Python, etc. However, I didn't really build up my portfolio, which contributes to my sense of incompetency in the industry despite my degree. Now I decided to switch to front-end because I find it to be a good outlet where I can balance out both my technical and creative skills.

Right now my goal is to ***land a front-end web development internship*** by May.

I'm trying to weigh some factors to predict whether or not my goal is achievable:

* A year ago, I completed a web dev course on udemy. This means I have 3 vanilla JS projects and a fully deployed web app created with Node JS, Express, and MongoDB. However, I don't really consider this ***my own*** work because the course was a majority ""code-along"" type of mooc.
* I will develop and launch my own web development blog soon (just bought the domain name) to benefit readers, increase my employability, and establish a presence in the web dev industry.

In the meanwhile, I'll be building up my portfolio and applying to internship positions at the same time. This means networking at a lot of tech conferences and learning new technologies.

Do you think my goal is realistic given the short time span? If not, how would you change my approach? Is there anything else I should know, or tips on landing a first job as a front-end web dev?"

I didn't do badly, but I didn't do very well either - which fucking sucks, given the amount of effort that I had put into my studies. I would call myself a person who believes in hard work and consistency - I've been studying really hard even during J1 year, and that didn't stop into J2 year. So what went wrong? I'm honestly so fucking sick of seeing people who fool around a lot or only begin to cram at the very last minute always perform better than myself - it seems like it's been a common occurence since secondary school. My O level results weren't bad, but they weren't that great, either - I really hate that I have failed to make that change for my A level. This applied even for the SAT test that I took the last year - I did so many practice tests and studied so rigorously, only to end up falling short again, caught in between the good and the bad. I hate feeling so fucking disappointed in myself over and over again. I hate that I'm seeing the same pattern repeat itself over and over again. I have another test that I'd signed up for in a few months' time, one that I've been working really hard for -  I've been trying to move on and keep my mind of yesterday, but my feeling of self-doubt and self-hatred has been relentlessly thrumming in my mind and keeping me up all night - I'm honestly so terrified to see myself fall short again. It's becoming a recurring trend that I can't seem to have control over, one that I can't seem to change.

I know that I'm not stupid - I have a lot of interests, I can pick up and do a lot of things, I know how to work my way around things, I do alright on block tests. I'm a runner, I'm a dancer, I'm an artist, I'm a writer, I'm a violinist, I like animals and volunteering at animal shelters, I like singing and listening to music  So what is wrong with me? I used to think of myself as a relatively academic person, though definitely less so in the recent years - well, I guess I never really knew myself after all. After seeing my results yesterday, I know that I'll have a very low chance for getting a scholarship - I didn't think it was necessary nor did I need to hear it to know, but here's what my father scoffed at me yesterday, reiterating my worst fears - ""Yeah, you try to apply with these kind of scores, see who wants you???"" It was very unlike him, making it especially disheartening and heart-wrenching to hear coming from him. I later overheard him telling my mum, ""We give her so many thing and so many resources and she still can produce these kind of results???"" and I honestly feel really, really bad - like, I'm sorry that I'm not good enough, I'm sorry that I'm constantly disappointing you over and over again, I'm sorry that I can never seem to be an ideal daughter that you can be proud of. I think that he hates me now, but I really don't blame him at all - it's true that he and the rest of my family has given me so much, in terms of love and support - and all I've done is let them down over and over again. It really fucking sucks that I never seem to be able to break out of this vicious cycle of me constantly underperforming even though I have the potential to do better - I don't blame him at all. I completely understand how he feels - I do hate myself too.

I'm doing an internship right now, one which leads up to a potential scholarship, but even though the company has reassured us that grades do not matter that much, I know that deep down, they do and it's something they're definitely scrutinising - I'm pretty sure my grades has already put me at a severe disadvantage alongside all the other better and smarter candidates, and that it won't be long before I'm completely kicked off the list. On another note, I've been having doubts about a career here as well, which would me mandatory should I be offered and accept a scholarship from this company - I feel stifled sometimes by the traditional and conservative way of things. So I'm honestly stuck and conflicted about what to do now - should I just stay on for the sake of gaining more internship experience and just see how it goes with the scholarship? Or should I just leave already and do something else sincr I already know that I'm already at a disadvantage as compared to my amazing friends?

Even though I have done well enough to enter quite a few university courses, I'm honestly considering taking a break from academics to work for two years and earn money to fund my own university education - I'm so done with the Singaporean education system and I really do think that I need a breather sometimes. I cannot count the number of times that I have relapsed into bouts of depressive and suicidal thoughts rife with self-hatred and self-deprecation, into bouts of panic attacks in the school toilets, into night terrors or insomnia that keeps me up awake throughout my JC life - I'm really scared that this, akin to my constant inability to perform up to expectations even though I know deep down that I have it in me, would as well become a recurring pattern that would haunt me into adulthood - I feel like I have the right now be selfish and do things my way for once. To not follow the conventional route and way of things, the one that our society has engineeered each and every one of us to gear towards - I want to be in control instead of being controlled for once. 

So sorry for the really long rant, but I honestly can't keep it to myself and hope to know if there's anyone out there who can relate and feel something similar. I've never been an expressive or emotional person in real life, so it's really difficult for me to pour out my heartfelt thoughts and feelings to anyone in real life - it's so uncomfortable for me. So, here I am, pouring them out in the form of words to strangers here on Reddit - hoping to know that I'm not alone."

f7rb1c,0,2020-02-22,REU Personal Statement Help,BStheHD,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/f7rb1c/reu_personal_statement_help/,"Hey everyone. I am in the process of applying for an REU in astrophysics. It sounds late in the process but this specific one is due on March 1. I finished writing my personal statement, and I was hoping I could get some help and insight as to whether it's good or needs improvement. Basically my main concerns are whether it's too anecdotal or not anecdotal enough, if my phrasing needs to be more concise or not (I get that criticism a lot in my writing), or if anything just doesn't sound right. Any advice would help, thanks! I'm replacing any professors' names from my university with ""Dr. Blank"" for privacy reasons I guess (not sure if it matters). 

**The prompt summarized:** **In two pages or less, describe your educational achievements to date and objectives looking forward. Make sure to address: why you're applying to the program, how the REU program will relate to your long-range career and educational goals, what personal or ""non-academic"" qualities you will contribute as a conscientious participant to the learning and social environments in the REU program, what prior experience you have with the research topics, what initiatives you have taken to expand your research horizons.**

On the morning of April 10, 2019, I woke up to a news report about the Event Horizon Telescope taking the first photo the world has ever seen of a black hole, specifically the supermassive black hole located at the center of galaxy M87. My roommate was getting ready to go to class, and one of my other friends had just sent me a message about a movie we saw a few days ago. Transfixed in thought, I sat there in awe and told them about the monumental achievement mankind had made. I could describe the exact same scenario for when gravitational waves were first discovered: My parents came home from work, my sister was doing her homework, but I was reading about the observations made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), overjoyed at the idea of Einstein being right. Observations like these are what drive mankind forward and reinforce my passion for astrophysics. This morning, I remembered the plea I made to myself when I first read about the discovery of gravitational waves: that I will help further our understanding of deep space and what really goes on out there. That being said, my goal as a physicist is to, ultimately, conduct research for a leading industry or research institution in the field of astrophysics, namely LIGO. More so, I want to be able to contribute to our understanding of gravitational waves and high-density bodies in space, and having prior research experience in gravitational waves would help pave the way for a successful career in the field. For these reasons, I am applying for the REU program at RIT. On top of that, the mentorship from the RIT faculty would be invaluable for me, as I would be communicating my goals and research progress with someone who is knowledgeable in gravitational waves. 

As someone who has given mentorship in the past, I understand how valuable it can be for anyone looking to improve a skill or learn a new subject. When I was in high school, I entered a stage in my life where I debated between practicing business or pursuing astronomy, or an amalgamation of the two which I still consider today. I decided to explore entrepreneurship by starting a chapter of MIT’s “Launch,” which is a program that provides founders like me with the supplies and resources to teach students the basics of entrepreneurship and to give them the tools to start a business for a global competition. In starting this program, not only did I grow as a mentor, but also as an individual. All the material I had to teach, I also had to learn myself. In doing so, I have learned a lot about startups and how people bring their ideas into fruition; that is, I have come to learn the importance of value proposition and estimating the utility of a business idea, as well as designing business models**.** I still think about these concepts today and how businesses make products and execute ideas in the field of astronomy, which is a topic I want to bring to the table at RIT. In addition, I have come to realize how crucial a teacher’s role is in a student’s life, as well as how difficult it is to effectively communicate foreign concepts to people. As additional support, a team of students who choose to compete in the Launch program are usually assigned an online mentor who volunteers for MIT. Since graduating high school, I have practiced mentorship by volunteering as one of those aides. In other words, I value entrepreneurship and mentorship as much as I do astrophysics, and I want to utilize them in the REU program. I want to use this experience as an opportunity to help make the research environment at RIT a cooperative and collaborative one, because in the end, everyone would benefit. 

Within the environment at my university, UT Austin, I have taken many steps to gain research experience in a broad range of subjects in order to gauge my interests. In September 2018, I began working on a small project with Dr. Blank1 on using spectroscopy to analyze transit light curves and to distinguish planets from their host stars. Without a doubt, my work with Dr. Blank1 has had a significant impact on my research capabilities. This project was my first introduction to collegiate research, and upon completing it I was able to teach myself the basics of Python and the Astropy library. The next semester, I wanted to take a crack at a theoretical research project, just to see if I would like it. I applied for the Directed Reading Program in the Math department, which is a Research Training Grant (RTG) program that pairs undergraduate students with graduate student mentors to undertake independent projects in mathematics. Of the available topics, I chose to do my project in mathematical physics, specifically in Lie algebras and how to use them to model quantum mechanical systems and distinguish particles from one another. At the end of the semester, I gave a short talk about my results in one of my proudest moments of my undergraduate career thus far. Completing the project has not only given me insight in a field I had little experience to prior, but I also developed a new appreciation for theoretical mathematics that has convinced me to add math as a major on top of physics and astronomy. This past Fall, I worked on a project in Dr. Blank2's High Energy Physics lab, which is a particle physics laboratory that works with Fermilab. The team I worked with was tasked with measuring the light-yield of electrons through scintillators supplied by Fermilab. As much as I enjoyed working on this project, I decided that I would rather do research in astronomy than in particle physics. In fact, I had the opportunity to continue working in Dr. Blank2's lab, but being given the opportunity to try working in a different field of research, although unforgettable experience, has reinforced my primary passion in astronomy. Later this semester, I will be joining Dr. Blank3's High-Redshift Galaxy Evolution Vertically Integrated Project, a long-term project which will focus on researching galaxy evolution using data from the HETDEX experiment and the James Webb Space Telescope.

Besides research, I am an active member of the Astronomy Student’s Association, which conducts weekly meetings on astronomy topics and hosts outreach events in the local area. Through this organization, I have met and communicated with faculty who work on gravitational wave detection at LIGO, including Dr. Blank4. Since meeting him and discussing his research, my interest, knowledge, and aptitude in independent research in gravitational waves has only grown. In addition, through the astronomy departments at UT and Southern Methodist University, which is near my hometown, I have been able to attend lectures by and meet Drs. Rainer Weiss and Barry Barish, who are both pioneers of the LIGO experiment. All that is left is to meet Dr. Kip Thorne, and I will have met all the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics recipients. That being said, I do not have formal research experience in gravitational waves. Yet, the opportunities UT gives me to indulge myself in the field continue to illuminate it as my ideal career path. 

Thus, I believe the Multimessenger Astrophysics REU program at RIT is an ideal choice for a pertinent, valuable, and exciting summer research internship for 2020. I bring a unique set of skills and past experiences which have allowed me to affirm my career goals and find my place in research at UT. The reputation of the research programs at RIT leads me to believe I would be an asset to the program, and it would be a critical and transformative part of my pursuit of a research career in gravitational waves."

It is for a MS in Computer Science Online  
[http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/program-info/admission-criteria](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/program-info/admission-criteria)  


**Background Statement:**

I finished my three-year bachelor from \[Redacted\] Mathematics and Applications, and I am currently attending my fourth year in Statistics. Computer Science has been a major part of my bachelor with nine CS courses in total including six in C/C++.  
 Currently, I am attending two intensive courses in Python related to programming with a focus on complexity. On top of that, I am working on a supervised research paper on text representation and clustering. The aim is to identify the best language model for semantic similarity between insurance contract clauses. This is a real use case and good results are expected. Thus, it involves using some of the most recent NLP models like BERT (Google 2018) and FastText.

Similarly, my background in mathematics and especially the courses in linear algebra, probability and statistics have prepared me well for the program.  
 Moreover, I have been a continuous student for four years now, so I am used to learning new things daily even online since I passed a few MOOCs. This summer, I will have to apply more of my knowledge in an internship that I am planning to do in data science or machine learning.

**SOP :**

After High School, I worked for three years in supermarkets alternating with periods where I was unemployed.  
 I did not feel satisfied with my professional life because I wanted to do something more useful and stimulating in my day-to-day life. I finally decided to take my life at hands and I started looking for options to do it : It naturally led me to apply for a bachelor in mathematics as they were general enough to be applied in many fields like industry, finance, health and « big data » which was a hot topic I read about at that time and really interested me. I prepared during my free time for the mathematics major and fortunately, I was in the next year.

It has been four years now since this project started. I always prioritized CS courses for that period because of the power it has when combined with mathematics and its entanglement with data science. Today, I need to specialize, and I cannot think of a better option than machine learning because it is at the junction of mathematics and computer science and because of its impact on society. I take pleasure explaining people about it every time I see it. For example with customer service chat bots on some websites or the way I was graded on my TOEFL exam for the speaking and writing part which respectively used speech recognition and natural language processing.  
 I find computer vision to be the most interesting application of ML. It has a huge potential with autonomous cars, and I want to be involved in this field professionally as a ML engineer or a software engineer. This position is very stimulating and fulfilling because I would help improving people’s comfort. I am also interested in becoming a ML engineer in a big company.

I know that a master’s degree in CS will help me achieve this goal, especially if it is OMSCS. There are several reasons for that.  
 First, the Georgia Tech Institute has one of the best computer science faculty in the world according to Shanghai Ranking. This shows that OMSCS delivers top quality courses. On top of that, OMSCS allows me to choose to develop the skills I need for my career through course selection from a great list. I have seen the career prospects on Linkedin for OMSCS graduates and job descriptions for the roles I am interested in and OMSCS perfectly suits my ambitions.  
 Moreover, I would like to start working again because I cannot afford to be a full-time student anymore. The flexibility of the Georgia Tech OMSCS would allow me to do that, at a very affordable cost. To sum up, OMSCS would help me start my real career and reach my career goal once I graduate."

Does this seem like it would cause any culture clash problems?

To start off, I will be graduating this May with a Computer Science decree (from a no name nothing school). I have currently 3 projects that I am proud to showcase, all are class projects, except one is a senior capstone I am currently working on. I have a pretty bad GPA, I am at a 3.0 (so new grad positions are a no go). The worst thing is that I have no internships or job experience, and ever job ever requires job experience so I won’t ever get hired anyway. 

Honestly I have been applying for awhile now, and I don’t ever hear back usually nothing ever comes from it. I don’t know what to do anymore, I am starting to think I fucked up my chances, so I’ll have to get an unrelated job, and try to go to trade school because that’s what my brother does and honestly he instantly got a job. 

I used to think I was a pretty good programmer, and I thought I knew what I was doing, but to be frank I am on the lower tier and I really don’t know what I am doing. I’ve lost a lot of confidence, and I’ve lost nearly all hope. Any last second suggestions on what I can do? I have people who have been telling me that I should have gone to a different major or go to a better school. So that’s nice."

I have worked at a local restaurant 5 years, since I was 18, to get myself through college. Working mostly weekends but full time at holidays. There are about 10 colleagues I have worked with from the start, and the other 10 or so spots have changed, let's say once a year over the past 5 years. I have always had a great working relationship with everyone there, thought of many of them as family. I even came back after an internship because I missed the work and many many regular customers that I have built a good relationship with too. 

6 weeks ago, a new person started. Lady in her 30s, supposed experience in many restaurants previous. Her first day was a Saturday, when I work a 10 hour shift. I got a strange feeling around her from the get go. I have trained many of the new staff over my years, so I proceed to help her along, try to show her the way we do things (can be different from place to place). She was having none of it. I think it was because I was much younger than her or something. Nonetheless, gave her the benefit of the doubt, continued with the day. She's new, she could be nervous, right? Nah. Here starts the snide remarks about me and my co-workers.

Now clearly I was in the wrong for assuming she didn't know what to do (sarcasm). The rest of the day, she did not take a table order, answer the phone for takeaway orders, and barely served a customer. Meanwhile a full 25 table restaurant and a function in the back.. I broke under the pressure for the first time ever, snapped at her and just had to leave. My manager was there the whole time, and did nothing. 

You'd think that, this is her first day, she is on some trial basis. Not so. I voiced my issues and concerns to my manager, and she ""talked"" to the new girl the next day. No warnings, no trial basis. Since then, new girl is so sweet and nice around manager. She has been working with me every weekend since then, and the same bullsh*t when the managers back is turned. I am sick to death of my issues, and my colleagues issues with her falling on deaf ears. It has only gotten worse since the first day. Today, she laughed at me for using hand sanitiser. She mocked my passion for my degree, not knowing what a postgrad was. She laughed at another worker for being on a diet. And all through this continued to basically not do her job, just like the first day. So not only useless, mean and rude too. The restaurant has been getting more and more bad reviews on the days she works too, mostly rude staff and the like.

The owner noticed today and asked mine and another workers opinion of the girl. After dealing with the sixth week of it, I told him everything. He was away when she was hired, and is not happy with her. He said he would speak to the manager, who is just being pally with the new girl and it's not going to do anything I'd say.

I've never ever felt like handing my notice in here, and this is what's done it. Maybe I just wanted to vent here, but I'd like to think I'm not the only one that's gone through this. I think there will be a staff meeting and I'm afraid I'll be in the firing line, considering I am close to the end of my degree and will most likely be finished working there within 6 months. How should I tackle a meeting like this? I honestly want to just go in all guns blazing, but I know I shouldn't. I'm just at a loss right now."

My work experience basically consists of an internship where I wrote network automation scripts in python to do audits on Cisco switches and routers and organized the data in a mssql database. This was achieved using Linux cron running my python script. 

As for my capstone I wrote a webscraper and crawler to pull data from websites then stripped the data to what I needed then wrote it to google cloud firestore. And using swift I filtered through and pulled data from the firestore based on user input. 

I don’t feel confident in my coding abilities since I never took any sort of algorithms or data structure courses, and I don’t really know what type of job suites my skills.

f81pw1,1,2020-02-22,Is it worth cutting myself off from parents for a out-of-state summer internship?,ibiza790,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f81pw1/is_it_worth_cutting_myself_off_from_parents_for_a/,"I'm currently a 19F college student majoring in Computer Science at a school in California. I live at home and commute four hours to and from campus everyday because it's cheaper and my parents want me living at home. They're currently paying for all of my things (food, housing, tuition, insurance, clothes, whatever else I need) and as a result I'm completely dependent on them. As a Computer Science major, it is highly recommended that college students intern at least once prior to graduating because when you apply for a full-time job, it becomes really difficult for companies to hire you if you don't have prior internship experience. I don't have any previous internship experience yet.

I applied to a ton of places and eventually received an offer from a well-known company at their office in Colorado, which I was thrilled about. The pay is $22 an hour plus $1500 for relocation. I, however, kept applying to other more local positions since relocating would be expensive and inconvenient, but didn't get any other offers.

My parents are aware of this offer but aren't even considering it because they don't want me living somewhere else. It's a bit of a long story but my parents are super strict and they have a lot of rules that I'm required to follow if I want them to continue paying for my things (no dating, no drinking/smoking, no going off campus, no hanging out with friends, I must share my location with them at all times, no getting in a car with anyone, I must text them every 2-3 hours throughout the day when I'm on campus with updates on what I'm doing, no driving anywhere if a parent isn't in the car, no leaving the house unless I have a valid and parent-approved reason to). I've followed 90% of these rules, and there have been a couple times where I broke the rules and my parents found out. This has not only completely ruined my college experience but has really strained my relationship with them because they don't trust me and I feel really suffocated by the level of micromanagement. I have no level of emotional connection with them and the only reason I'm putting up with this is because they're paying for my college and I would rather deal with their rules for another year than fall $40k in debt.

Back to my original point -- I've already expressed to my parents that I really want to do the internship because it's going to be a kickstart for my career and the position is something I already am really passionate about. It's at an amazing company, housing is very cheap there, and if I do well at the internship, I might be able to get an offer for a full-time position next year. I told my parents that if they're concerned about me living in Colorado on my own, they're welcome to come and live with me over the summer -- it's not the freedom and ""living alone"" that I want, it's the chance to do the internship. But they've given me a definite ""no"" and now I'm considering pursuing the internship with zero financial support from my parents.

I have about $1200 in savings from earlier jobs but it's in my parents' bank account. I definitely need to make my own account as soon as possible, and I'm in the process of doing that right now. Assuming I make my own account and transfer over the money, it would be enough for a round-trip plane ticket and about a month's worth of rent. The company is also offering $1500 in relocation, so that's also another cushion. I'm just concerned about whether it's financially practical for me to pursue the internship because it would involve moving to Colorado, buying necessities, paying for groceries/transportation/other costs on my own, etc. I want to use the internship as a means of earning money and saving up but there's really no point in it if all my money is going to be spent on expenses. This might seem like a really stupid question but this would be my first time stepping out of the house on my own and I'm terrified that something goes wrong and my parents aren't there to help me in any way. 

I'm also worried about my parents getting upset about me wanting to do this and potentially kicking me out of the house. They've threatened to do this multiple times and it's been causing a lot of anxiety for me. At this point, I have no social life, I feel unmotivated in my classes, I have zero freedom, zero room to breathe and it feels like all I'm doing is fighting this uphill battle where I put my parents' wants over my own mental health and they couldn't care less about it. I feel so lost because I'm 100% dependent on them and I don't know the first thing about living on my own.

I'm trying to figure all of this out right now and any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR: I'm considering doing an internship out of state against my parents' will and paying everything out of pocket. The internship is going to be a big career boost for me but I'm not sure if it's financially practical/realistic or even possible for me."

There are parts of it that I understand, but I hit bumps and need to ask for help quite often. I find learning how to write code very frustrating at times, but whenever I get a program to function properly, it puts a smile on my face and I feel really proud of myself. So, there are signs that software development as a career is, to some extent, going to be fulfilling for me.

What drew me to this career at first was how well it paid and would allow me to be self sufficient, and at this point, it seems like it's the only option if I want to achieve the kind of life I have planned. Liberal arts degrees either don't interest me or have very little return value, other STEM careers (mechanical engineering, natural science degrees, math degrees) are either too intensive for my liking or don't have decent career options (such as bio or chem degrees. Research jobs and academia jobs for these majors are either few and far between, not well paying enough, or very competitive), and no trade pays as well as I would like, unless I start a business, which I don't want to do. So, I've got to stick with CS, and I'm okay with that.

However, I am nervous that I won't be good enough at it to be a viable programmer. I need a lot of help learning how to write code as it is, and I'm going to need to be able to write in on my own in at least two years if I want to get an internship and build a portfolio. It's not like I can devote my full time and attention to learning how to do it either, I have a math, bio, and english class to worry about on top of learning how to code. I could do a boot camp over the summer, but they are expensive and far from where I live.

How do I learn how to be a proficient computer programmer in such a relatively short period of time when I have other school to worry about? Is there anyone who started out not being very good at coding when they started college and still wound up being successful at it?"

I met the founder of a software startup at a networking event at my school. After the event, I sent out my resume to every recruiter there. A couple of weeks later, this startup founder connects with me on LinkedIn and messages with me, expressing interest in my side-projects. He then asks me what I'm looking for, job or internship. I tell him I'm looking for an internship. After some more back and forth, he says:

&gt;Hi \[me\], sorry been swamped. Summer internship, if that's what you're looking for, works fine.

After this, instead of offering me an interview, he adds me to the project's GitLab, Jira and Slack. In one email, he gave me all the links, talked at length about the current state of the project, and finished the email with this gem: 

&gt;As for where to get started, I recommend testing any of the issues in the 'ready for review' column on the Jira Kanban board. You can report back with your comments directly in Jira.

At this point, it seems like he wants me to start working already. I replied with: 

&gt;Thanks for all the information. I'm excited to get familiar with the project and join the team. I'm afraid I might not be much help right now as it's getting close to the end of a very busy semester. In the meantime, is there any way I can help you with setting up the co-op through the school? 

And the end of his response, he says:

&gt;I can't commit to a full 4 months yet without knowing the scope of contributions you'll bring to the project. Thus, we can spend from now until the summer to figure that out, or alternatively when you are ready to start, we can go week to week and see how things go.

I'm definitely a little sketched out. My gut says I should just ghost him, but I wanted a second opinion. Would it be worth asking for an interview still? After this experience, I'm not sure I would like to work for this company, but I really do need a co-op. What should I do?"

Anyway, I know 86.25 can't get me an interview through the usual route, so if I even want a fighting chance I would need to apply via EIS (or is it DA). 

The issue is that I'm definitely not a truly exceptional individual lmao. While I do have long term volunteering experience (4 years at the same hospital) and some healthcare internships, I'm definitely not a national athlete and didn't hold any leadership positions while I was in school. I do have some notable academic achievements but it's not biology/chemistry related, and it's at a national not international level. 

Given that, I know my chances for DA is pretty low. I would say it's almost non-existent in fact? (Or is there a possibility? Someone please enlighten me in the comments below.)

I know that apart from undergrad Med, there's also the Duke-NUS pathway which allows me to pursue post grad Med. But I know that if I do intend to go this route, I would prefer to study life science or pharmacy (correct me if I'm wrong, but I heard that a lot of modules for pharmacy overlaps with those of medicine), which would better prepare me for the postgrad degree. 

I've been exploring my other options and with what little information I know, Computer Science seems to be a very interesting course. I've been watching some CS modules online and really like them, and I do know that it's quite a versatile (?) degree and there's a large spectrum of jobs I can pursue in the future. Admittedly, I can't say I truly know what I'm getting myself into, but I do intend on doing more research and familiarizing myself with the course. 

If you've read my ramblings until this far, THANK YOU. 

I guess my questions would be: 
1) I'm almost certain that I would perform better if I retook A levels. Is it stupid to retake just to get into Med interview(not even actual Med lmao), when I still have a lot of other options? 

2) What are the chances of doing postgrad Med? I would prefer having a CS degree to a pharm/lifesci degree, so I guess my motivation to take the latter is only fueled by the possibility of postgrad Med. 

Also I know that 86.25 is a very tentative score for pharm haha.

f83ycx,3,2020-02-22,Not sure what step I should take next in my career path; I'm terrified of becoming a teacher but don't want to feel like I've wasted my education.,rosediamond420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f83ycx/not_sure_what_step_i_should_take_next_in_my/,"I (F25) went to college (USA) with intentions on becoming a middle or high school English teacher. I got my bachelor of arts, majoring in English (Literary Studies to be exact) and minoring in secondary education. I also got my teaching license which to my knowledge has not expired yet, but it probably does soon. By the time I started doing internships and my student teaching, I realized that I may not be quite cut out to be a teacher. I have anxiety and depression, but its for the most part managed with medication, but whenever I would get into a classroom, my nerves were hard to suppress. I am also not great being an authoritative figure being 5'1 and terrified of confrontation.

Fast forward to after graduation: I tried substitute teaching which was awful; I landed a job at a high school where I was half a library clerk and half an instructional assistant. Specifically, I had 2 school periods (out of 7) where I was in the library and I would do very little, as there were two full time  librarians and they liked to do things a certain way and just wanted me to focus on the other part of my job.

The other part of my job was the other 5 periods where I supervised a class of 8-12 students each that had failed a class (or several) the previous year, and they were ""retaking"" the classes they failed through an online program that was just a bunch of open note quizzes that they would retake until they got an 80% or more and then move onto the next one until they did them all. It was an awful program and incredibly not engaging for the students (who where already not the kind of students who did much work anyways).

To make matters even worse, I was paid horribly. I was paid once a month and my paychecks would be around $950. I was extremely depressed working there, I barely got by financially, and after a year and a half I finally was able to leave by jumping ship completely and taking a job as a teller at a local credit union. I didn't have any banking experience but plenty of customer service and money handling experience from working in restaurants, so they decided to hire me after one interview. In March, I will have been there for a year and I am so much happier than I have ever been. I get paid a lot better, and weekly, and my job is very consistent and I like my coworkers. It definitely gets redundant, as I do see mostly the same people every day that come in to do their transactions, but I'm very much at peace right now. I was even able to buy a house with my boyfriend.

Recently, a coworker at the credit union left because of a great opportunity. We are all extremely happy for her and she is an amazing person who we are all going to miss greatly. However, her leaving suddenly has me thinking about how I've kind of become comfortable and haven't been looking for more opportunities. I feel like I am wasting my education (and money from loans) by being in a job in a completely different field than what I went to school for.

I've been looking at online Master's programs trying to figure out what I want to do next. Part of me is thinking of possibly getting the necessary course work and other requirements done to teach elementary school. Middle schoolers and high schoolers were quite intimidating to me, but I honestly have no idea if younger children would be any better. I like kids, but I've never been in charge of any. I've also considered doing some program for librarianship either in schools or public libraries. But I also like what I am doing now so should I just stay in the field I am, maybe take a few finance classes, and work my way up at my current job?

I know it's a weighted question, and I don't even know if this is the right subreddit for this kind of thing. But, if there are any teachers, bankers, or anyone that has been through this kind of predicament or something similar, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also this is my first ever reddit post so go easy! Thank you in advance.

f84d0r,142,2020-02-22,The Secret of the Hawthorne House,PeaceSim,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f84d0r/the_secret_of_the_hawthorne_house/,"My mother raised me on a tight leash. She had good reason for doing so.

No mother should have to go through what she did. Her husband – my father – disappeared seventeen years ago, leaving her to raise me and my brother Samuel alone. She talked about him as an open, honest, and sunny person, and claimed that those traits had rubbed off on me in the few years we spent together.

Once my father’s status changed from missing to presumed dead, his sizable life insurance policy at least provided my mother with enough to live on while she cared for us. When I was old enough, I also did what I could to help look after Samuel, who was five years younger than me.

Then tragedy struck again. Samuel was on his way back from a Cub Scout camping trip when he vanished from a gas station where the car he had been in had stopped.

I was thirteen at the time. My mother comforted me as I cried, something I have come to appreciate more now that I realize just how profound her own sadness must have been.

From then on, she acted like the father from *Finding Nemo*, monitoring my every move and requiring me to follow a strict schedule.

During high school, I had no life outside of academics. I was friendly and on good terms with my classmates during school hours, but I would never see them elsewhere. At lunch, I heard talk about things like hookups, alcohol, and partying. But I knew that, for now, my life would not involve any of those things.

That was okay, I thought. I have a whole life ahead of me. I was obedient and worked hard, and I graduated with terrific grades and the “Teacher’s Pet” superlative in the school yearbook.

My mother was understandably upset when I left for college. But I was ready to escape her grasp. You can imagine the friction caused by the way she ran my life, as much as I sympathized with her and shared her grief at our family’s bad fortune.

My upbringing put me in good shape for the aspects of college that mattered most. I excelled again with my academics and got along with people superficially. But, I had terrible social skills and did not build any long-lasting friendships as I had hoped.

I envied the way other people made friends, dated, and seemed to live a more wholesome life. My own attempts at socializing went terribly, and one of the only two times I was invited to a party with alcohol ended with me vomiting profusely.

In the summer after my junior year, I was home from college and staying with my mother. A summer internship at a local community college’s research facility kept me busy during the day, but I had nothing going on at night.

Late one Friday evening, I got a text message from Tucker Hawthorne. Tucker is a classmate of mine from the wealthiest family in town. He’s next to me in the yearbook with the “Biggest Partier” superlative chugging an imaginary beer in the photo.

“Hey, David, want to come over? I’m home for the summer and a bunch of our old classmates are spending the night at my family’s place. We’d love to see you!”

Actually being invited to hang out with the most popular (and richest) members of my high school class excited me. Now, I’m not caught up in high school popularity. I know people change. But I was eager for social acceptance in general and saw an opportunity to be around people my age.

I was almost twenty-one, so I obviously did not enjoy having to argue with my mother about how I spent my free time. She yelled at me that it wasn’t safe to go out that late. Eventually, I marched out the door and to my car and drove off with her still screaming at me from inside.

It was nearly 11 p.m. when I arrived at the Hawthorne residence. I’d seen it plenty of times from the outside. It was a huge, imposing building that screamed wealth. It was in the richest part of town, yet it was at least twice as large as the other houses in that area.

I had driven in complete silence, but as soon as I pulled up the long, fancy driveway of the Hawthorne house, booming music flooded my ears.

I took a deep breath and knocked at the front door.

A pale man with grey hair and a black suit opened the door. “David?” he asked. I nodded. He appeared to be a butler. He let me inside and led me down a long hallway adorned with paintings and containing dozens of doors to different rooms. I sensed a deep, groaning sound that I figured was the bass from the room with the music reverberating through the building’s massive structure.

Seven of my old high school (and in some cases middle school) classmates were in the room the butler brought me to. It was a massive, oak room with its own mezzanine. They greeted me excitedly.

“We haven’t seen you in forever!” said Maggie, a blonde, athletic girl I’d briefly had a crush on in sixth grade. She had gone to a private school after getting a scholarship for playing lacrosse. “How are you?”

I smiled awkwardly and murmured that I was doing fine. She still made me blush a bit.

“Let me get you a drink!” said Tucker. He wore clothes one would associate with a rich kid named Tucker Hawthorne: a backwards cap, a light blue collared shirt, and pink pants. He ran off.

The others were the twins Lukas and Michael, who both played baseball in high school and continued to at the private school they attended in the northeast; Margaret, the daughter of the CEO of a local brickmaking company who had treated me dismissively my whole life; Katherine, a girl I had gotten along with in school but hadn’t been in touch with since graduation; and Peter, Tucker’s best friend who lived in the same neighborhood.

“David, my man!” said Peter. He walked up to me and patted me aggressively on the back, as if we were old friends. It didn’t make much sense, but I didn’t mind. I smiled and asked him basic questions about how his life was going, doing my best to raise my voice over the pounding music.

Tucker handed me a beer. “But hold off on that for now, it’s time for tequila shots!” he yelled.

I noticed that the butler had returned, holding a tray with eight shot glasses. Everyone else excitedly took one. The butler stood still, with tired, dead eyes. Maggie took two and handed one to me. “Come on, join the fun!” she said.

Mustering all my strength, I managed not to choke or cough on the tequila. Still, I noticed Lukas and Michael smirking at my pained face.

“How do you like the place?” said Tucker. “You haven’t been inside before, have you?”

“Oh boy,” said Margaret. “Don’t get him talking about his house. He’ll never stop.”

“I don’t mind hearing more,” I said, trying to be friendly. “No, I haven’t been here before.”

Tucker turned to the others. “It’s tour time! Keep partying, y’all! I’ll be back in a bit!” Tucker then motioned for me to leave the room.

“A full tour would take all night,” said Tucker. “Plus, it would require disturbing mom and pops. They’re upstairs, by the way, leaving us alone.” He took me down the same hallway I had entered and a door, revealing an empty room with wallpaper that was colored baby blue and decorated with clouds.

It looked like where a toddler or young child would be raised. “Is anyone in your family expecting children?” I asked.

“No, no,” said Tucker. “Not as far as I’m aware, but you can never be sure,” he said, smirking at me. “This room is not currently in use. It’s still quite nice though.”

He took me through at least a dozen more rooms. Each looked completely distinct. One was a bright yellow room with couches and a television. One had pool and foosball tables. One had a pool. Another was packed with laundry machines. Several were bedrooms. By the time we reached a sunroom with a small patio, I was completely lost.

The whole time, Tucker yapped at me about his family history, about how long each room had been there (the Hawthorne house seemed to be frequently renovated), and about how important maintaining and expanding the residence was to “mom and pop.”

He led me back to the room where we had been partying and, when I entered, we engaged in round two, and then round three, of tequila shots. I felt a little dizzy and euphoric, but I was still in control of myself. The butler arrived with red cups of beer, which Tucker announced we would use in an upcoming drinking game. I noticed that Tucker, as obnoxiously friendly as he was to all of us, never acknowledged the butler in any way.

“It’s the game of vice,” he said, passing out a paper pad and pen to each of us. “The way you play the game is that you write down answers to the questions I ask on your sheet of paper. And you *don’t* write your name on it. Afterwards, we put each sheet of paper into a big pile and draw one sheet from the pile – just be careful not to get your own. Then, one at a time, each of us has to guess whose paper we are holding. If someone guesses yours correctly, you have to admit it and then chug your beer. If not, just say no, and the person who guessed wrong has to chug their beer.”

A sense of dread fell upon my otherwise cheerful state, as this game promised to be quite embarrassing for me. Still, I was enjoying myself and willing to play along.

Tucker called out the questions: whether we had ever cheated on an exam or a significant other; the ages at which each of us had had our first kiss, first given or received oral sex, lost our virginity; how many people, if applicable, we’d had sex with; and whether we had ever thrown up from drinking, smoked marijuana, used cocaine, or used heroine. My sheet read no, no, 19, N/A, N/A, 0, yes, no, no, and no. Most of the others giggled at the questions, with Lukas and Michael hooting at the sex questions and joking about how long it would take them to compile some of the answers.

Then, the tone of the questions changed abruptly, as Tucker asked whether we’d ever covered up a crime and, lastly, whether we’d killed anyone and, if so, how many people. A silence followed.

“You okay, David?” said Katherine, seeing alarm on my face following the last set of questions.

“I’m fine,” I said. Surely this last part was a joke, I thought.

We placed our sheets in the middle, Tucker shuffled them, and I then selected one that was not my own. Tucker announced that he was guessing first, so I put the sheet of paper I had drawn away for the moment.

Tucker read out the information on his – this person had lost their virginity at 18, had had sex with two people, had smoked marijuana, and hadn’t used heroine, covered up a crime, or killed anyone. Tucker looked around the room. He locked eyes with me briefly before smiling and shaking his head. Then he pointed at Katherine, who smiled and nodded. “Drink!” shouted the twins, Tucker, Maggie, and Margaret. Obediently, she chugged her entire drink.

The game went on. Lucas went next, followed by Michael, Maggie, and Margaret. I won’t bore you with the specifics of what they read – lets just say that the people who had filled out their sheets (one turned out to be Margaret; Michael incorrectly guessed another to be Maggie, prompting his brother to smirk) had all done a lot of things in middle school or high school that remained foreign to me now in college.

It was Katherine’s turn next. She was woozy and struggling to keep balance. The answers she recited from the paper she held were similar to those from before: this person had certainly had some fun in middle school and high school. But then Katherine read out the final answers: they hadn’t killed anyone, but they had covered up twenty-six crimes. She put on a concerned face as she looked around the room.

I felt worried, too. Deep-down, I felt like that person hadn’t written that as a joke. I reminded myself that covering up a crime could be a simple as hiding evidence or not reporting a minor vehicle accident. It didn’t have to be anything serious.

Katherine pointed at Lucas, who shook his head. “Drink!” said Tucker, joined by Lucas and Michael.

“You guys, I think she’s had enough,” I said. But nobody listened.

Katherine looked down at her drink and shook her head. Peter walked over to her, lifted her hand, and maneuvered the red cup so the beer she had recently refilled fell onto her face, most of it landing in her mouth. Michael, Lucas, and Peter cheered. I shuddered.

Peter was up next. As he spoke, I noticed Katherine’s eyes closing, like she was drifting off to sleep. I hoped this game would soon wrap up.

Peter had my sheet, and it took little effort for him to correctly point me out as the person who had filled it out. As embarrassed as being singled out as inexperienced (something I took more personally than I probably should have) made me feel, I played along and chugged my drink as required.

My turn was next. I felt my body turn weightless and a sense of exhaustion creep over me. Still, I did my best to complete my role and finish the game.

Even as the image before me shifted in and out of place, I read out the sheet I had gotten. The answers were in-line with all those after Katherine’s – an early start to certain activities coupled with drug use – but then the final question, for the first time, was not zero. This person had written that they had killed twenty-six people.

“This is a joke, right?” I said. But no one was laughing.

I lost balance and stumbled back against the wall. I must have had far too much to drink.

“Who is it?” asked Tucker. “Who is your guess?” He looked uncannily serious. 

I looked around the room as best I could. Katherine was passed out on a couch. The others were watching me attentively. “I think it’s you, Tucker,” I said, my subconscious speaking out as sleep overcame me.

As my eyes shut, I heard the sound of cheering. “He did it!” said Margaret. “Won’t do him any good,” said Peter.

I awoke with a massive headache. I was tied to a chair, my arms bound painfully behind my back.

I looked around. Ahead of me was a library. Next to me was Katherine, similarly restrained.

“You’re awake,” she muttered. “I’m assuming you also have no idea what we’re doing here?” 

I shook my head.

The door opened a moment later. Peter and Tucker marched in. Peter carried a shotgun.

“Looks like your knots were as tight as ever,” said Tucker to Peter. “You can step outside now. I’ll let you back in once it’s over, and you can clean up like usual.” Peter nodded and left the room.

Tucker turned to Katherine and me. “You are probably wondering, among other things, where Lucas, Michael, Maggie, and Margaret are. They’ve gone home. They’ve done their part and had enough fun for tonight. They certainly won’t be helping you.”

“What the fuck are you doing to us?” asked Katherine. I demanded, in the most aggressive voice I could muster, that Tucker let us go. Tucker laughed and rolled his eyes.

“Believe me, David, tougher people than you have demanded that of me.” He turned to Katherine. “I’m going to feed you to this house.”

Katherine and I exchanged a confounded look.

“You don’t have to believe me,” smirked Tucker. “It won’t make a difference. I’d guess at least twenty of the people who have been in your situation haven’t believed me. But it never made a difference. Not even once.”

Tucker walked over to a library shelf and pulled out a thick book. The shelf suddenly split open, revealing a shaft. Tucker pulled out another book, causing two large saws within the shaft to start rapidly rotating. “This is where you will be cut up,” said Tucker. “And, then, the Hawthorne House will be two rooms larger.”

“You’re crazy,” said Katherine.

“That’s bullshit,” I said.

Tucker walked towards me. “Is it?” he said. “You didn’t wonder how new rooms keep appearing in this house? You didn’t recognize your own brother’s spirit in the baby blue wallpaper of the children’s room, or your father’s imprint on the sunroom?”

I had no response to that other than horror and confusion. I was still processing this situation.

“Why?” asked Katherine. “Why are you doing this, and why us?”

“Ah,” said Tucker. “Well, you see, if you live at the Hawthorne house, you begin to get a sense of its wants and needs. If you don’t please it, it gets angry. But if you do please it, it gives back based on what you feed it. I’ve lived here all my life. I have a sense for what it wants. And it wants you two.”

Katherine and I exchanged a glance, both wondering what he meant.

“You, Katherine, you sweetie,” said Tucker, “you’re perfect for that conservatory we’ve always wanted. Respectable, caring, and as transparent as glass. And you, David. We need someone smart for the study we want added. Mom and pop want it with pure white walls; the best way to get that is with the blood of an innocent – someone at an adult age, but protected and chaste. You obviously came right to mind for that, though I had to confirm my instincts were correct.”

I shook my head in disbelief. How crazy was Tucker? Surely none of this could be real.

But then the floor started moving underneath Katherine. The wood itself shifted her closer and closer to the shaft and the rotating sawblades within it. Katherine screamed.

“Tucker, please, stop this!” I yelled. I begged him in every way I could think of to stop what he was doing.

Katherine cussed out Tucker with every combination of words she could come up with as the floor brought her up to the shaft's entrance. Then, the wood underneath her bulged upwards suddenly, sending her and her chair into the shaft. The surface of the metal shaft continued her forward. I closed my eyes as blood flew through the air and rained over me for a full thirty seconds. When I looked again, the shaft was soaked in red and she was gone.

“Still don’t believe me, Mr. Valedictorian?” said Tucker.

“Let me go, please,” I begged. Unbridled hate filled me as I thought of the fate that had befallen my brother and father. 

Tucker laughed. As if reading my mind, he said, “Your brother begged far more. Your father, on the other hand, he was stoic. Took it silently.” Tucker shrugged. “It made no difference in the end.”

I heard a knock at the door. “Allen’s here,” said Peter’s voice.

“Let him in,” said Tucker, looking annoyed.

The door opened and the butler walked in. He looked over the scene and showed no corresponding sign of shock. He must be in on it, I thought.

“What is it?” said Tucker.

“Sir,” said the butler. “I wanted to tell you something.”

“Well, spit it out, Allen,” said Tucker. “I’m a bit occupied at the moment.”

“Well,” said Allen. “Peter has told me that this is the brother of that boy I took from the gas station seven years ago.”

Tucker nodded.

“You see, sir,” said Allen, “Given that I have served you diligently for your whole life, and your family for my whole life, I hoped that you would grant me the wish of saving this poor young man. You see, sending his brother to his death – by passing him along to you – was the most difficult thing I have ever done in my service to the Hawthornes. I seek to undo some of that harm, and save his poor mother from yet more grief. I want to offer myself in his place.”

Tucker looked at Allen blankly for a moment. Tucker then giggled, then laughed loudly right into Allen’s face.

“You know what I think?” asked Tucker. “I think you’d better get out of here right now. Got it? This loser David – he’s about to make us the study we always wanted. He’s about to contribute to something meaningful for the first time in his life. I’m really doing him a favor, not that I’d expect a subservient dumbass like you to ever realize that.”

Allen looked on woefully. “I understand, sir.”

“Good,” said Tucker. “Now scram.” Tucker turned back to me as my heart faded.

But, Allen didn’t leave. Instead, Allen drew a knife from the sleeve of his black suit and slashed Tucker across the neck. Blood seeped out and covered the floor.

I looked on wide-eyed, unable to move or do anything useful.

Tucker dropped to his knees, but Allen quickly pulled him up. With a swift gesture, Allen threw Tucker into the shaft. Tucker let out one final scream as he fell upon the blades, which caused a new burst of blood to splatter across the room.

Allen walked up to me and cut the ropes binding me to the chair. “Your brother…I’d helped Tucker and his parents before, but that was too far. It made me realize the monster I had become. I am so sorry.”

“Just get me out of here,” I said. “We need to call the police.”

Just as I became freed of my bonds, the door slammed open and Peter stepped into the room wielding his shotgun. “I heard Tucker scream,” he said. Looking over the room, he quickly grasped the situation.

“You bastard,” he said to Allen, who still held the bloody knife. Peter raised his shotgun.

A loud *bang* resounded. Allen’s head exploded in front of me, covering me in a whole new layer of blood. I dived behind a bookshelf as another shell shot through the air. Its pellets barely missed me. As Peter pumped the shotgun, I darted into a door and out of the room.

The house was not happy with these events. Its floors rumbled and its walls shook. I ran and ran, recognizing that each room seemed to have resulted from someone meeting the same fate as Katherine, my brother, my father, and Tucker – the only one who’d actually deserved it.

I heard Peter shuffling behind me. “You’ll pay for what you did to my friend!” he shouted.

I stumbled into the sunroom. As I arrived in it, a sense of warmth flowed through me. The glass door before me slid open, as if by magic, revealing the patio, which led to the outdoors. I ran down a flight of stairs, though hedge maze, and into the woods that surrounded the house.

It’s been three days that I have been hiding. I ran as far as I could and jotted this all down on a computer in a public library and posted it online. The Hawthorne’s are well-connected. They know everyone in the region. My fear is that the local authorities cannot be trusted. I am posting this to spread word of the horror I faced and the truth of the Hawthorne residence.

I am trying to decide what to do next. I’m leaving my mother out of this, as devastated as my unexplained absence must be to her. I’m also certain that someone is watching her house to see if I return there. Instead, I have been staying motels as I travel by foot farther and farther away.

Even if I make it far enough to find authorities who are not bought off by the Hawthorne’s, how will I find anyone who believes me? I fear that even the most well-intentioned state or federal agent will think I concocted this story as a way of dealing with the losses within my family, and the last thing I need is to be implicated in the disappearance of Tucker Hawthorne. (What kind of room did the house create out of him, I wonder.)

I want revenge. I want to go after Michael, Lucas, Margaret, Maggie and, especially, Peter. They all knew what Tucker had been doing. I also want to go after Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne. But I’m not sure how to go about it or what to do next.

If you’re reading this, I warn you to never go to the Hawthorne house. And the next time you’re in a mansion, consider what cost went into building its rooms. If you fit the right profile, you may just become one."

Compared to something like a math or a chem degree, I see this as being a lot more applicable to actual work. Plenty of people I know without these kind of STEM degrees, however, have just as easy of a time as me scoring internships and jobs with no experience that pay similarly to mine (a friend of mine works in insurance as an intern and gets just as much pay as my CS internship). 

Are we lying to ourselves? I feel like the amount of work and studying and effort you have to put in to this field to get a job isn't any different from other fields, or is even harder. I have to make personal projects, learn new languages and tools like Azure, keep myself updated on what I already know, and learn a lot of different algorithms. Meanwhile, friends of mine make a good resume, answer well behaviorally at an interview and then get a job.

I personally wanted to be a math major because I like it, but did CS because of how applicable it was. Yet I feel like I put a lot more work into job hunting then others, and still get the same dismal results any average Joe would get."

I started programming(C++) in 2014 I was not consistent, it was always like I would code for some months or maybe weeks and then sit back and relax this happened for the next 2 years and then I totally left coding for the period 2016-2018. 

I started coding again in January of 2018, it was C# this time. I learned C# from scratch(followed the Yellow Book) and then built some GUI using WPF, the codes I wrote for the GUIs were not totally mine because I didn't know how to load a directory in C#, etc, but I also read the documentation for the codes that I used. After building 3-4 applications in C#, in April I decided to move on to HackerRank. 

I solved hackerrank and leetcode for the next 3 months and became a 5 star on hackerrank and solved around 90 questions on leetcode then, I joined a college in July and stopped solving the problem. (Learned C in first semester)

In January of 2019, I and my friend developed a game using Python and Tkinter for an event. The code we wrote for the game wasn't totally ours, we had to look for how to make a button in Tkinter, how to use click event, etc. 

In March of 2019, I started learning about computer vision and I did 2 courses on image processing on Coursera (Course by University at Buffalo), the courses were not up to the mark, but I had nothing else to do so, I followed the courses and completed them. From May to June I contributed to a Github repository that was related to computer vision. 

In August of 2019, I found that competitive coding is very much important so, I got back to hackerrank and leetcode and solved some questions. Then, I joined Codechef and did 2 long challenges (September and October) and became a 3 star. Since I had to maintain a good GPA I left competitive coding as my mind was always busy with the problem statements throughout the day. In December of 2019, I completed AndrewNG's ML course (in 10 days). 

Since January of 2020, I have been learning Python from scratch. Yesterday I had an exam related to a job and I had to write 2 programs in C++. Since I didn't code anything in past 3-4 months in C++ I was able to solve only one question (the question was easy) the other question was related to : [https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/alg/maze/](https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/alg/maze/) , I was very much near to the solution, but succumbed to the pressure of time (75 minutes to solve two questions). 

Even after coding this much it hurts to see that I was not able to do the questions. I was just thinking about Machine Learning and Computer Vision (procrastinating) that I failed to realize that I have spent so much time in something that is of no use for now because in my country (India) people with mostly post-graduation or PhD are preferred for the positions related to Machine Learning and Computer Vision. So, now I am finding something new that I can work upon and apply for internships. (Maybe Python+SQL?)

While applying for internships I mention the projects(the GUIs) that I have done and the courses that I have pursued. Since I did everything a long time ago now, I don't remember much that is the same case with competitive programming, I knew DFS and BFS, but now I don't remember them properly. I even forgot STL of C++ that I knew before. **What should I do? and whatever I am learning now how to remember it until the next interview? Do you guys revise everything that you've learned after a certain period of time?**

Any kind of help will be appreciated. Thank you!

I'm currently a third-year student who just transferred into the engineering faculty (studying computer engineering) from general sciences and I'm on track to graduate in 4 years. After my 4 years at university, I'll be coming out with a year's worth of internships (mandatory at my school) and a degree, but I always planned to take a gap year to travel as a last hurrah before entering the workforce. 

Hearing about how some engineers already struggle to find jobs after graduation, I was wondering if this would greatly harm my chances at a job. My biggest worry is that recruiters would avoid hiring me after seeing that I haven't done any engineering related work for a year after graduation. I was considering to maybe delay my graduation by a year by traveling and then returning to complete my final semester, that way employers would see that I'm entering the workforce immediately after graduation. 

As a side note, I hope to be working in a programming or software development position in the future, and realistically, I may have a hard time practicing my coding skills while I travel.

What do you guys think?

I was hoping to get some advice before I get really deep into researching and planning out my next move.

So I'm graduating with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering from a Midwestern ABET accredited university this May.  I've accepted a job offer in the states and I foresee working there for at least a year, possibly two, in order to pay off some of my student debt and save up for moving abroad. Additionally, during this time I'll be attending German lessons at the Goethe Institution where I'll be living so I'm expecting to have maybe a B1 German level at the time when I'd move. Now my question is, would it be smarter to attend graduate school in Germany and look for professional jobs afterward using the university's resources and connections that I would be making in school? Or would it be smarter to start looking for jobs now due to recent changes in German immigration policy and how it's now easier for Non-EU citizens to get jobs?

If I were to go to graduate school:

* Am I correct in guessing that it would be easier for me to find a job?
* Would part-time engineering-related jobs (e.g. engineering technician, manufacturing engineering intern, etc.) be willing to hire me so that I could work my 20 hours if I were on a student visa?
* Is there a significant pay increase for engineers with their master's versus those without?
* I'd be at least 27/28 by the time I'd graduate, would this result in me being significantly behind when it comes to retirement/salary/etc.?

If I were to go for a professional job:

* Do they accept online international applications that much? I know in the US, I almost never hear back from a company after I applied to their online job posting - is it a similar situation in Germany? I'm wondering if I'd have to move to Germany first and try and find a job in the first 90 days?
* Is it commonplace for working professionals to pursue their master's part-time while working like it is in the US?
* Where should I be looking to figure out what my salary should be on average when considering my experience and education?
* Would I be too far behind in regards to my German language level - especially working in a specialized industry like engineering?

Sorry for all the questions, but I appreciate any feedback you're willing to give me. Thanks!! :)"

However, the reason I made this post is that my friend has an APM internship with google this summer, which puts him in prime position for the full time APM program at Google. How often do companies hire people into their APM programs who did not intern with them?

I’m now considering:

* Product Analyst at a tech giant (FAANG) - While I would probably have minimal impact or strategic involvement at the company, the pay, benefits and growth opportunities are excellent. Coworkers are technically savvy with prestigious backgrounds. FAANG prestige.
* Biz Ops at a tech unicorn - Kind of splits the difference. Less prestigious but still notable and well paying; somewhat more impact and at least one guaranteed promotion. However, it’s late stage, so while there's some instability there's no interesting story. I also assume there will be a lot of biz ops/consulting people applying and it will be hard to stand out.
* Product Management at Disney+ - Disney isn’t very prestigious as a whole and offers decent but comparatively poor pay and benefits. The company is allegedly stingy with promotions and raises that might improve my app. However, Disney+ at this specific time seems like a really interesting story/experience; it’s simultaneously new yet hyper-growth and internationally expanding; a startup-y vibe yet part of a very traditional F100. There's a lot to do and a fairly small team so I should have a high degree of ownership.

What looks best, interesting and impactful projects or prestigious names and promotions? I'm still interviewing for some positions, but I'm debating withdrawing unless I come up with a reason not to."

I've been trying to keep it afloat, but it isn't working. I am in the middle of my semester with midterms upcoming. Really need to get out of an emotionally abusive/manipulative situation and focus on school and my future.

I really need to know what my options are. I have no clue where to start and am unsure if this qualifies as a ""crisis"" (in terms of contacting crisis organizations/offices)

Here's my situation:

1. I have no family near me and my family is unable to help financially.
2. I am a full time college student.
3. I do not own a car, but have access to one (conditionally by significant other). Car is gone if I leave this person, obviously. I may have options to get something cheap from family (work in progress). Still, I do not have money for that currently.
4. I commute to school via public transportation, which only works due to my current living situation (close-ish proximity to public transportation)
5. I do not have a permanent living situation/housing in my name. By leaving my significant other, I would become homeless, as it is all theirs (I rarely contribute to rent/utilities given my current situation). I do have some options due to some very good friends opening their home to me, but these options put me even farther away from school than I already am with no public transportation available nearby.
6. I have tried to touch base with residence housing on campus but have not heard back. I cannot afford this currently so it's not really an option. This would be most ideal.
7. I have a part time job but get very minimal hours due to school schedule and have to drive back and forth. At \~$150 every two weeks, it doesn't cover much. Less than $150 in bank account at all times. Usually put everything on credit card.
8. I am running up credit cards to pay for basics. Can barely pay down any of the debt (\~$6000 and rising). Credit is still good for now (\~740)
9. I have three full time semesters left to complete my degree after this current semester is over.

Some options I've considered:

1. Moving back in with parents. But they are likely selling their home and are not in a stable situation. Would need to uproot and start over there (wherever they end up)
2. Moving in with a sibling (both are out of state). Would need to uproot and start over there.
3. Move in with a friend (most realistic, as they are at least within about an hour and a half from campus). I can continue my education this way, but would have no transportation to do so. My current part time job would be out of range and there's not a lot of work opportunities around them (at least close).
4. Moving on to campus. Contacted residence services and haven't heard back. Would need to figure out how to get loans outside of federal loans offered through school. This only gives me a place to live during the school year. I could live with a friend (as listed above) in the summer, but this hinders my ability to take on internships. I can live on campus during the summer with proof an internship in place. Again, I cannot currently afford that.

Does anyone have anymore potent solutions? Any advice as to who to go to or what to look into? Any help is appreciated.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I cannot go in to great detail in the comment section, but will answer what I can. Anything I cannot answer on here, I will DM.

A simple project with a wide scope. A documentary that could illuminate a most brutal, sexist tradition. No, Meagan Colin wasn’t here to rage at the wage gap or call out ignorant abortion policies. Those were first-world problems. No, I wanted to explore a more primitive act… one somehow still in existence within the more extreme factions of Hinduism: sati. Modern-day widow burning.

I know the act itself is rare. Like literal witch hunts in America, most followers of Hinduism know sati is barbaric and backwards. But from my research, I found out the practice still happened with the more extreme fundamentalists. Albeit, rarely.

Okay, maybe I had no business criticizing their culture. After all, the last thing I wanted to be was an ugly American. I mean yeah, I can put up with other countries eating our cute pets as if they were delicacies, but we’re talking about human lives here. Innocent women coerced into burning themselves after their husbands died, what kind of shit was that!? Goddamn, I’d been single my whole life. The lifestyle ain’t that bad.

Call me a Feminazi, but the fact that people could still defend sati sickened me. Downright chilled me to the bone. And the more I did research, the more horrified I became. Even moreso once I found out sati was practiced by an extremely small sector of Indian Americans. Especially amongst the ones right here in Atlanta, Georgia.

The topic was ripe for today’s climate. Everything about sati was perfect for my senior project. And my team was *good*. Real good.

Laura had been my roommate since freshman year. From the Walters Hall dorm to our current city apartment. She was the creative artist to my academic warrior. And she was almost done with her internship at Inertia Films. 

With long flowing blonde hair and a round face, Laura was pretty… even with her bright highlights and even brighter dresses. I wasn’t as tall as Laura. A little chubbier. But definitely more fiery.

Beneath the professionalism of pant suits and glasses, I wasn’t afraid to explore controversy. Both on paper and in person. Once I had my master’s in Women’s Studies, I planned to go into journalism and blogging, so it made sense to team up with Laura for this project. Especially since her boyfriend Jeff was an aspiring filmmaker. Sure, we were all amateurs… But this documentary wouldn’t just secure our future. This exposé on modern-day sati could change the world.

The three of us did our research. We explored Atlanta’s Hindu scene… particularly the fundamentalist sectors. We navigated the religion’s many local websites. Each successive interview revealed more and more... My blue eyes like lasers helping us coerce the darker rumors. Finally, we had a group suspected of still practicing widow burning: the Shekhawat family.

Immediately, I set my sights on their youngest son Mark. He was a bit older than me. Attractive and smart without being out of my league. On his Facebook picture, Mark’s big dark eyes drew me in. He was tall. Worked in IT. And let’s face it, I had a weakness for beards.

In our apartment living room, Jeff and Laura managed to convince me.

Jeff’s wiry frame trembled with excitement. “You gotta find him!” he said. His wild shoulder length hair matched a blonde scraggle Laura was somehow attracted to. “You hook him and this is it, Meagan.”

“He’s right,” Laura agreed.

So like an undercover cop, I infiltrated the weird world of dating apps. To my surprise, there were quite a few matching us basic Americans with the more interesting Indian Americans. And Mark was without a doubt one of the better matches.

Beneath Jeff’s unrelenting camera and Laura’s nosy gaze, I started talking to Mark on-line. Our conversations casual but flirtatious. To my relief, he was at least attracted to me. Always a welcome stroke for this girl’s ego. Mark didn’t even start sending me dick and ass pics until the second week. And only after he asked. So hey, score another one for Mark.

As we talked, I found out more about the Shekhawat family traditions. By all accounts, they were pretty strict. Pretty primitive. But Mark said he was the black sheep… He was Americanized all the way. Facebook pictures of his days spent partying at Georgia Tech frats and crazy office parties made that clear.

But still, I pressed on. We graduated to phone calls. FaceTime. Our relationship accelerating… even as I stayed at a clinical distance.

Soon, Jeff and Laura taped one of our phone calls in the living room. I leaned back on the couch. “How far back do your family’s traditions go?” I asked Mark.

“Way back,” Mark said through a perfect American accent. “My parents were the first to leave India. So some of those customs…” 
A nervous laugh escaped his lips. “Some of them are kinda weird. But I don’t really get into it too much.”

I sat up. Bracing myself for the next question. “Well, what about… widow burning? Sati?”

Mark gave me another uneasy chuckle. “You sure are curious. You sure you don’t want to go Hindu yourself?”

Always the undeterred interviewer, I sure as Hell wasn’t gonna back down now. “I mean is it true? The widow burning, does it still happen?”

For the first time in our relationship, an awkward silence came between us. Then I heard multiple voices. All in a language I didn’t understand…

“Mark?” I asked.

Holding the camera, Jeff stepped toward me.

Annoyed, I waved him back. “Leave me alone!” I said in a harsh whisper.

Laura gave Jeff a quick hit to the shoulder.

He cringed. “Ow!”

“Hey,” Mark’s voice returned.

I sifted on the couch. “Yeah, you there?”

“Yeah, sorry. I just had to… deal with something.”

I faked a laugh. “Oh, I understand. But what were you gonna say about-”

“Do you want to go out tomorrow?” Mark interrupted.

Our first date was a cloudy, ugly day. Only appropriate considering I didn’t have much interest in the guy… Okay, so he looked even better in person. The body was on fleek. This was Beefcake Millionaire. But still I had to be Meagan the investigative journalist, not Meagan the thirsty single bitch.

After binge-watching *90 Day Fiancé*, I expected the date to be cringetopia city. But instead, Mark was charming. Even respectful… a byproduct of being raised in such a strict Hindu household, I figured. We spent the day at Piedmont Park. A beautiful place of many lakes… even without sunshine.

To stay safe, I texted Laura from time to time. But I never felt uncomfortable. The only time I ever got scared was when Laura’s texts made my phone convulse.

Mark stopped us near a gazebo. “You know you’re a beautiful girl.”

Those cheesy compliments worked every time. I couldn’t resist. We looked into one another’s eyes. Then the anticipation hit me once Mark placed his hand against my face. I exploded with excitement when he gave me that first kiss.

I tried to keep cool. Tried to battle those butterflies... All in the name of women’s lib, Meagan.

Cracking a smile, I struggled to look at him. “Well, uh. You’re not so bad yourself.”

All of sudden, rain poured down. The storm started.

“Oh God!” I cried. Embarrassment replaced my rising elation. My make-up was so fucked... 

Laughing, Mark grabbed an empty cardboard box lying on the ground. In true survivalist fashion, he held it over us. Now I had protection from the storm. And so did my foundation. 

Mark snatched my hand. “Come on!”  he yelled.

Like crouching soldiers dodging gunfire, we ran to the parking lot. The box a decent cover against the bullets of rain.

We jumped into Mark’s Honda. He tossed the box outside before grabbing a hold of my hand. Our smiles only grew bigger. The two of us entombed there inside the vehicle for the time being. 

Amidst the constant pitter-patter of rain, Mark pushed his long curly hair aside. His gaze matched mine. He leaned in close. 

My phone vibrated with another dose of Laura but I ignored it. I was too lost in Mark’s eyes. And in our next kiss.

From there, our relationship grew stronger. Mark moved fast… but at Jeff and Laura’s insistence, I played along. Not that I was complaining. I still had all summer to finish the final project. Not to mention the sex was amazing…

But I wanted Mark to trust me. To really like me… Shit, was I falling in love? Not that I’d know. Twenty-five years of being single can really fuck with your mind.

I tried to convince myself romance wasn’t possible. Instead, I kept pretending to be Meagan the investigative journalist. Still told myself this wasn’t true love. That all I was doing was getting closer to Mark’s family for the sake of women’s rights. An honorable excuse, right?

The only problem was the Shekhawats weren’t telling me shit. They kept me at a comfortable distance. I saw no ceremonies. No customs. No signs of this supposed Hindu craziness. No signs of sati.

After a month, Mark proposed to me. At first, I panicked… until I thought of Laura and Jeff. How far we’d come in this project… and how I did like Mark. The ring was gorgeous, after all. Then there was the promise of more memories. The promise of more sex. More times kissing Mark, more times feeling along his arms and ass. Call me impulsive, but fuck it, I said yes.

We got married just as quick. At Mark’s insistence, we tied the knot at a secret ceremony. At one of those old, forgotten churches downtown. Honestly, I never told mom and dad. I couldn’t even accept the marriage myself… I mean yeah, I wanted to. But deep down, my mission compelled me. Here we were with hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage and even more hundreds of hours spent on research. I couldn’t let my parents’ protests or any other bullshit Colin family drama shatter what was shaping up to be my life’s work. The investigation just had to continue.

That being said, Mark and I’s situation was smooth. And slowly, I ingratiated myself to the Shekhawats. Soon, the ugly American inside of me died. I opened up more around Mark’s family. 

Mark’s parents lived out in the country. Their two story house surrounded by woods rather than neighbors. And to my surprise, his family seemed completely… *normal*. Aside from a few religious books and drawings in his parents’ house, I saw nothing extreme. They watched football, they drank beer, they had cookouts. The Shekhawats were literal All-Americans.

Any questions I had about their culture was greeted by warm calmness rather than shrill histrionics. These Hindus weren’t eating people or imprisoning children. No savage stereotypes were anywhere in sight. Nowhere except for the pages of some of his parents’ books.

I couldn’t help but read some of the sections on sati. One of the images made my heart race in fear and intrigue. The crude drawing showed a young Indian widow being burned alive… An illustration so close up you could see her skin getting charred, her face literally melting into a messy mush. All as a jovial family celebrated around the flaming pyre...

Several sentences stood out to me: *The widow must sacrifice herself* *The sacrifice protects all women* *No single woman should roam alone* 

This shit was outdated. But then again, so was The Bible. Overall, Mark’s family showed no signs of being the savages social media branded them.

In May, I moved into Mark’s apartment. Laura and Jeff were getting impatient… and honestly, I felt pressure. Both from them and my own deadline. But I had no choice. Mark and I were now married, so I couldn’t just force the sati questions on him. How much of a racist asshole would that make me look? Not to mention the fact I actually *liked* the guy.

So I stayed the course. When the time was right, Meagan the investigative journalist would come bitching back. But right now, I just wanted to have fun. Not with Laura or Jeff. Not with anyone but my husband. 

Friday night, Mark and I shut the bars down downtown. Both of us got smashed. We took an Uber back to the apartment. Each of us overcome in drunken laughter. I helped him up the long staircase to apartment twenty.

We staggered into our dark entryway. Mark closed the door.

Playful, he rubbed his temple. “Man, it’s hard to keep up with you!” he teased.

I stopped in the kitchen. My laughter faded to nervous silence. The lights were already on, showcasing Jeff standing by the counter. An eerie frown on his face... but those anxious eyes gave away his fake toughness. As always.

“What the Hell is this!” I shouted.

Mark came to an uneasy stop. “Jeff?” he said in drunken confusion.

Like a monster emerging from the ominous night, Laura charged in from our dark entryway. Her war cry shattered the tension. With startling strength, she swung Jeff’s baseball bat.

Mark didn’t have time to turn. No time to react.

The Louisville Slugger smashed straight into his head. Broken wood and blood fell to the floor. And so did Mark.

Blood coated across Laura, Jeff, and I. The heavy thud Mark’s body made on the tile repeated in my terrified mind. My conscience.

Mark was dead upon impact. His beautiful eyes still very much open. Much like the gaping wound spreading crimson through his hair and beard.

Horrified, I looked on at my best friend. Laura’s breaths stayed heavy. Her glare an expression of sheer madness. Her hands clinging to that broken bat.

“What the fuck…” was all I could say. Even as the tears rolled down. Even as the first man I found myself in love with was dead at my feet.

With cautious steps, Jeff approached me. “Look, it’s about the film, Meagan,” said his trembling tone. “That’s all.”  

I glared at him. “The fucking *film*!”

Laura snatched my arm in a death grip. I looked on at her crazed gaze. Through the blood stains, her demented determination persevered. “We couldn’t wait any longer, Meagan!”

I pulled away from her. “No! Y’all are crazy!”

“They were never gonna tell us about sati! Don’t you get it!”

The hard truth held me hostage. But I didn’t feel any less slimy... Especially when I laid eyes on Mark’s body again. His sexy beard now reduced to a gory ginger shade.

“We have to start it ourselves,” Laura continued.

“It was the only way,” Jeff chimed in.

Laura grabbed me by the shoulders. Her attempt at comfort 
compromised by the busted murder weapon she still held. Blood still spilt off the bat’s many splinters. 

“We couldn’t wait any longer, Meagan,” Laura said. ”*I* couldn’t wait any longer. The internship’s over. You’re almost out of school.” She leaned in closer, for once overpowering my piercing blue eyes. “Just think about it, Meagan. We had to do this. We can make money, help the world. This could launch our careers!”

Battling his own guilt, Jeff leaned back against the counter. Avoiding all contact with Mark’s corpse. “They’re the ones who are wrong, man... Not us.”

I flashed him a look of disgust.

“Exactly,” Laura said. She shook me in her violent grip. Pulling my worried gaze back toward her. “They’re the ones who still practice sati. You know they still do.”

The room grew more claustrophobic. More mad. My emotions swelled. The sadness sunk into my soul. “But we don’t…” I mumbled.

“I know they do!” Laura proclaimed. She leaned in closer. Her stare so focused and clinical. “And now we’re gonna get them.”

From there, I let Laura and Jeff clean the crime scene. Thirsty Meagan had to let go. As did lovestruck Meagan. I had to withdraw back to being a cold, rebellious bitch...

Conflicted by my guilty conscience, I let my friends fake the fall. In the dead of night, they laid Mark’s corpse out at the bottom of the long and winding stairs. The police completely bought it. Mark’s death was ruled an accident. A fatal fall brought on by alcohol.
I was cleared. But still, I had a painful wake to attend. One being held at my in-laws’ house.

Around three, Jeff, Laura, and I journeyed to the country. Wearing dark dresses and suits, we entered the lavish Shekhawat home. To my relief, the crowd wasn’t overwhelming. Not many of Mark’s relatives lived in the States after all. So there was a maybe a group of twenty in attendance.

With Mark’s parents’ permission, Jeff got to film the entire thing. The family’s traditional Hindu music a soundtrack for the scene. Everyone wore bright clothes. Psychedelic robes, *loud* coats. Their jewelery more lit and colorful than a Christmas tree… The family never cried either. Never showed sadness. Instead, they were all smiling. Somehow content with their son’s tragic death.

Most of us stayed around the wide living room. Several tables offered shrimp, apples, crackers… even alcohol. The closed casket stayed on display in the center of the room. And yet Mark’s family created a party atmosphere.

Like actors, Laura and Jeff wore their sad faces. Offered fake condolences to the relatives. All while Jeff kept the camera flowing.

The booze did little to ease my pain. I stumbled through my words and interactions with Mark’s family. The coffin giving me constant dread. 

Laura pulled me to the side. “What the fuck are you doing?” she whispered.

Angry, I pulled away from her. “Well, this is what you wanted-”

“Just try to keep it together!”

“I can’t!” I fought back the tears. My eyes kept glancing around this homemade wake. At everyone smiling and chuckling… The Hindu music now hit a faster tempo. Further unnerving my anxious soul...

Laura leaned in closer. “Hey, if nothing happens, we’ll talk to his parents later, alright. We’ll interview his family.”

Doing my best to control Meagan the romantic, I nodded. Played along with my best friend. My favorite murderer.

Laura squeezed my shoulder. “It’s almost over, Meagan. This is what we wanted. Think about that.”

I stared into her excited eyes.

“Think about changing the world for the better,” Laura said.

“You ready, Meagan?” a calm Indian accent beckoned me.

Startled, both Laura and I turned to see Mark’s short, frail mother. 
Her sliver of a smile honed in on me as she grabbed my wrist. “It’s time, dear.” Mark’s mom put a glass of wine in my hand. Blood red wine.

“I’m sorry…” I said, confused.

“Time?” Laura asked.

“The ceremony,” Mark’s mother told us. With a delicate flourish, she pointed toward the hallway.

In a Shekhawat exodus, the relatives all headed toward the spot. Each of them with a drink and a grin. Enthusiasm spread amongst them.

Mark’s mom’s grip tightened. “We’re having it outside.”

Moments later, we entered the Shekhawats’ great, wide backyard. The manicured lawn perfect up until reaching the forest. 

Hand-carved tables and benches were set up. More wine and snacks. Several speakers still played those same hypnotic Hindu tunes... The serene scene perfect for a wedding or reunion... But this felt different. This was tribal.

Together, everyone stopped and looked on. Laura and Mark’s mom right by my side. Jeff mesmerized behind the camera.

There was the shrine. What we’d been looking for all these months: a large wooden pyre. The circular structure stood surrounded by countless branches and sticks. 

Next to it, a khanda was lodged into the ground. The long sword easily several centuries old. Fading sunlight illuminated a red S embedded into the shiny blade.

Through the pyre’s bars, I could see Mark’s corpse. Trapped in there like a helpless zoo animal. His body preserved… somehow still sexy beneath those red robes. His eyes were open, the fatal wound all sewed up. And best of all, Mark’s beard was completely clean.

Everyone gravitated to this homemade grave. Some chuckled. Some grinned with reverence. Jeff and Laura stayed enthralled. But me. I just cried.

“No, don’t cry, dear!” I heard Mark’s mother say. Her scrawny arm wrapped around me, pulling me down closer to her level. “There’s no need to. Not now.”

I saw Laura step toward Jeff. “You getting this?” she said in a not-so-quiet whisper.

Nodding, Jeff zoomed in on the pyre. “Yeah!”

“Mark’s in a better place,” Mark’s mom continued. She guided the glass to my lips. “Here, drink this, dear. It’ll help.”

Still weeping, I let his mom turn the glass up. Let the hollow wine enter my system.

“There, there,” the mom said. “This is a special ceremony for all of us, Meagan. Especially for Mark.” She caressed my dark hair. Those thin fingers scraping my scalp. “We know you loved him.”

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Jeff and Laura get closer to the pyre. I wanted to cry out to them but couldn’t… My body now drifting into a catatonic state. 

Mark’s father approached us. His body was muscular and toned. His white smile still electrifying. “Are you ready, Meagan?” he asked.

Now I felt all the Shekhawat eyes on me. Only a heavy migraine hindered my mind... The pressure was getting to me. So was the sadness.

Outside, more darkness crept in. The twilight haze further disoriented me. The glass slipped from my hand. Fresh redness hit the grass… but no one paid attention. Instead, Mark’s family waved toward me. Pointed me toward the pyre. Toward what they wanted to be a double headstone.

Both Mark’s mom and dad grabbed my arms. Together, they guided me down the aisle. To the grave.

“We need to hurry, dear,” Mark’s mom told her husband.

“I know,” he replied.

Feeling weaker and weaker, I let them lead me to the grave.

“Meagan!” I heard Laura scream. “Let go of her!” She charged after me. The first real emotion and empathy I’d seen from her in months.

Shivering, I struggled to lean forward. To escape the clutches of my in-laws. But the headache got worse. My eyes collapsed. Over the sitar strings, I heard shouting and footsteps. Heard a heavy camera hit the ground. The pull of a heavy sword.

“No! Meagan!” Laura screamed.

I awoke to see we were in further darkness. And now closer to the pyre.

A couple of Mark’s uncles cornered Laura and Jeff by a bench. My friends were terrified and in tears. Surrounded by Mark’s glaring relatives and their angry yells. Jeff’s broken camera lied at his trembling feet. 

One of the uncles raised the khanda.

Helpless, Laura reached toward me. “Meagan!”

All I could do was watch through the haze. Unable to shed tears for my best friend. To even try to save her.

In one quick thrust, the uncle jammed the sword through my friends. His strength paranormal. His battle cry booming.

The blade shot through their chests, the very end piercing out Jeff’s back. The couple were now a human shish kabob. Complete with dangling ornaments of steaming organs and intestines. Laura’s stabbed stomach covering the Shekhawat family crest.

The couple’s bodies landed with a heavy thud. Their corpses now aligned. Their blood intertwined forever.

Like a statue, I couldn’t feel anything. Not even for my friends... There were no tears. No emotion.

In the increasing darkness, Mark’s mom waved toward the uncles. “Hurry! Start the fire!” she commanded, the panic making her voice stronger.

Fueled by fear, the men threw more branches on to the pyre. Using a lighter, they started the fire. 

Flames immediately roared to life. A beaming glow here in this dying twilight.

I didn’t flinch when my in-laws parked me in front of the pyre. I barely felt sweat. And still I felt nothing.

Mark’s mom and dad backed away. The whole family continued watching me. Each of them full of anticipation.

“Do it, child!” the mother yelled. “Do it for Mark!”

But I didn’t move. I stared on at the flames. At this cozy cremation. The smell of charred flesh swept through me and I could see Mark’s handsome body roasting away… But I couldn’t move. I couldn’t cry.

“I thought you gave her the poppy flower!” I heard Mark’s mom shout at his dad.

“It was in the wine!” he cried.

The headache lingering, I swayed softly against the scent of sizzled flesh. Ever so closer to those ferocious flames...

“Then why won’t she go in!” his mom screamed. “She needs to before nighttime!”

Finally, I stopped myself from falling any further. Ashes floated toward me.

“I’m sorry, honey,” Mark’s father said in fear. 

I stole a look up at a sky that was now a sea of black. There were no stars. No light at all save for the burning before me.

“It’s already too late…” Mark’s father finished.

I heard quick, sudden movement. Faced the fire.

Rising from the embers and ashes was my husband Mark. Only he wasn’t charred. My husband just stood there. His eyes glued to me. Mark perfect in those robes. The flames with no effect on his body or beard. Nor did they slow him down.

Flashing a smile, Mark walked right toward me. His steps so calm... Only his eyes were empty. Stoic.

Behind me, I heard the Shekhawat family’s collective cries. Their panicked screams. Their fear.

Mark stopped inches away from me. The two of us just stared at one another. As if we were at the altar again.

I could hear footsteps rushing toward the house. A table getting knocked over. The Hindu music cut off amongst the turmoil.

But I stayed right where I was.

“Run!” Mark’s mom shouted. “He’s not the same, Meagan! Run!”

But I didn’t care. Especially once Mark reached out and stroked my face. My husband now more flawless than ever. More perfect.

My tears finally fell. My heart grew warmer than the fire. I felt heat rise within me. Relief that Mark was here and our glorious romance was resurrected. Meagan the investigative journalist now gone for good.

I learned a lot and actually got an offer to stay there throughout finishing school, which I'm inclined to accept because my funds are running low.  With that being said, it's taken a long time for all the paperwork and etc to get me started there and I saw a career fair at school that made me really start to consider trying to get internships with tech companies rather than waiting for who knows how long.  I know I need the money from a stable job through school, but am I harming my future prospects by only staying at this one internship vs trying to get a variety of internships at other places?

I finally got a chance to move out this past summer for an internship.  This was in a city about 3 hours away.  Best two months of my life. She still visited every weekend but I had more freedom than ever. After the internship, I got a job and was looking for a place to live for myself. She yelled and screamed and argued about me not living with her, until she finally calmed down and made a seemingly reasonable agreement. I would move in with her and share the rent until she was able to save enough money to buy a house for herself. 

Obviously, I should've known better than to trust her. But my guilt always gets the better of me. My boyfriend and I had agreed to move in together after graduation.  He's been patiently waiting and being very understanding, but we are both tired of this by now. My mom very clearly disapproves of our relationship and it gets frustrating that I can't see him very often since he lives so far. 

I'm finally ready to move out and I'm done waiting for my mother to figure it out. My boyfriend and I agreed that we would move in together by April. I'm excited but I'm afraid my mom is going to guilt trip me again. As much resentment I hold for her, I can't help but feel bad for leaving her alone."

So I started this tier 1 position after doing an internship (no degree) and got offered mid to low 40's a year. At first this offer seemed fair everything in consideration, but after working here for a few months I feel like I'm doing work that is above my pay grade with servers, powershell, onsite work, etc. And I'm happy to be learning so much, but I dont feel this is a typical tier 1 helpdesk job. At my internship I knew multiple tier 2 techs that didn't touch most of these things even. 



I'm gonna stick with this job for at least 1 year, but at that point would it be prudent to ask for a big raise to match my work duties (somewhere in the 60k range) or look for another position that would compensate properly? Have people even been able to negotiate a large raise at your current workplace? Were the bosses offended by the large ask? I am concerned they might be offended if I ask for such a big bump ."
f8kede,220,2020-02-23,TIFU by getting beat by my girlfriend on separate occasions and allowing her to vandalize my home. Also FU loving a girl who abused me,Beatupbygf,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f8kede/tifu_by_getting_beat_by_my_girlfriend_on_separate/,"TLDR at bottom.  Extremely long read.  Throwaway because of embarrassment and avoiding any legal ties.

October 9th 2019 my then GF woke me up on the couch screaming in my face.  It was a rough wake up and I was taken aback, as I knew I hadn’t done something to warrant it.  She was screaming about how I sent my ex gf of five years a timehop photo (her and our dog).  I told her whenever I texted my ex as we are cordial and work together, but that photo slipped my mind.  I was sitting as we all do in the bathroom, came across it, and sent it.  Out of my mind in 2 seconds.  The argument that ensued was ridiculous.  

I was trying to calm her down and level with her but she was screaming/crying/packing.  She put some things in her car and when she came back in she turned on me.  She hit me in the chest about a dozen times, it hurt, but no substantial damage.  I would not put my hands on her, so I just kept saying, “please stop hitting me.”  My younger brother rents a room in my house and came up from the basement hearing all the arguing.  He screamed, “get out of this house,” so she left to put more things in her car.  I turned to him and said, “I’m really sorry man,” and he asked, “why?”  I just said, “I’m sorry I don’t know what to do.”  She came back in, went upstairs, grabbed the last things she wanted, and headed out the door.  I locked it behind her.  

I went downstairs with my brother at this point and his gf was on facetime by his computer.  She was asking what was going on and we all heard a crash!  I immediately thought my now ex gf hit my car.  I have a nest doorbell so I would have it on video.  I opened the front door and the glass from the full view door fell inside my house, it was everywhere.  I have video of the vandalism and a witness to her hitting me at this point.

Instead of calling the police I called her mom.  I am an idiot I know.  I told her what happened and that I needed her to make sure her daughter was safe at home and let me know.  She turned evil when I said, “Instead of calling the police I called you.”  She asked, “Oh really is calling the police necessary?  I replied, “Well your daughter just wailed on me and destroyed my storm door,” and she said, “We’ll take care of the door thanks,” and hung up.

I spent the night cleaning the door up and taking it apart.  My brother helped.  I told some friends and called my father to explain what happened.  

The very next day I took off work, spent the whole day neatly packing her things, and put them all in the driveway very organized.  I texted her mom and dad and asked if they wanted me to drop them off, but they told me, “We’ll take care of it!”  They were so nasty to me after their daughter assaulted me and vandalized my home.

Minutes later my ex pulled up and parked.  Before she rounded her car I told her to stop where she was.  I said, “You can’t come in my home.  You can gather your things here and your parents can come inside to get anything else.  Any conversation we have has to be recorded on this doorbell.”  She stood their crying.  She was hurt, ashamed, and sorry, but her whole life was changing.  I felt bad, but I couldn’t risk something happening inside where she could claim I retaliated. 

Her dad showed up after awhile of me moving more things into the driveway.  He spoke to her for a second and turned to me.  He said it was ridiculous I wouldn’t let her go inside, so I told him I was afraid of what she would do.  He said, “We will all go in, nothing will happen, we will be timely and act respectful to your home.”  Boy I made a mistake.  The moment we went inside he was bumping into me, throwing his arms out so I couldn’t follow her anywhere, and making remarks like, “If you get closer to her I will knock you the fuck out.”  I couldn’t do anything, so I called the police.  I explained the situation and it took them around 15 minutes to arrive.  In between the cops getting there her dad went overboard.  She was taking non-essentials, basically anything she put a dollar toward, and he started throwing her cans of soup in the air in my foyer, letting them fall 14 feet down to my wood floor.  It was absurd.  They then let my dog out into the neighborhood while they were moving the kitchen table she bought (she replaced mine that never needed replacing).  I got the dog back and put him inside and saw an opportunity to close and lock the front door.  I did so right in the dads face.  He slammed on the door repeatedly and cursed profusely, but I was finally back in control.  

The police arrived and talked to them outside, I listened on the doorbell.  She was irate, they had to tell her to calm down many times.  Her dad was telling them I had no right to shut them out.  The cops came inside and talked to me too.  They said she had lived in my home for more than 72 hours so she was allowed to have a guided walkthrough for her personal belongings.  A truck came and picked up her stuff, I waited with the police, and she left.  They asked me if I wanted to file a report and I still refused.  I didnt want to jeopardize her career.  

The day after I went to work in the morning and she blew my phone up all day.  “I can’t do this, you can’t do this to me, please don’t walk away from this.  I am sorry for breaking your door and hitting you that was wrong of me and I am ashamed of that.  Don’t throw this away over a door.”  This went on for hours.  She asked to meet me for some type of closure and I told her I had to work all day and then go home to get ready for work (two jobs).  She offered to pick me up from my day job to talk, I declined.  She insisted on coming to my house to talk in my in between time and I told her she wasn’t allowed in the house.  She cried to me until I said yes.  We went in the backyard to speak when I got home so I could run the dog around and talk at the same time.  Also I was keeping my distance from her, no hugs minimum 15 foot between us.  I should have recorded the conversation but of course I am dumb.  She groveled, begged, and cried buckets of tears asking me to take her back.  I told her it was supposed to be about closure and she left at my request.  

Quite a few days went by where she would text me angry or hurtful things about how I never cared about her or loved her like she did me.  It was a coping mechanism.  

The thing she forgot to take from my home was her old apple watch.  I looked at it every day for about 4 days until the apple account password was changed.  It hurt me emotionally to see how bad she was doing, but also angered me by the explanations she gave people close to her and me why we broke up.  Each text was a bit different but the gist was, “I broke up with him and broke his door because I found out he was cheating on me.”  How preposterous.  

My internal struggle about charging her for criminal mischief ended the Monday after the Wednesday event.  I had texted her father a picture of the receipt for the new storm door.  They told me they would take care of the door so I asked him how he would like me to get it to him.  He refused to pay for the door, threatened me with a, “don’t piss me off,” text, and told me to stay the fuck away from his daughter.  I had been, but I guess he didn’t know that?  I went to the police station after work, sat with officers, wrote all of this down for them, and they called a judge.  He gave the go ahead after seeing the texts admitting she struck me and the video of her destroying the door.  I never wanted to charge her, I wanted my door paid for.  She was taken to the station and processed.

I got a letter in the mail that she had plead not guilty to criminal mischief, saying I had to show up to court and talk to the judge with her.  I was massively depressed, Halloween passed, I wanted to see her face and be near her, damn the charges and the assault.  I texted her a few times extremely thoughtful things and we would talk briefly.  It was great, but I wouldn’t take her back.  One day before work I sent her friend a message on facebook telling her I missed her best friend and I loved her.  My ex left a note on my car at work telling me that no matter what time I got out to call her.  I called her and we had a mellow conversation and agreed to meet in a parking lot by her house.  We met there, talked for hours well into the night, both drove to my house, and we were back together after that.  

She had specific requests from me that needed to be done to repair our relationship.  She had to let me speak to her doctor that prescribes her Zoloft.  Numerous times in our relationship she had expressed she no longer wanted to be on it. She was 23 and she had been on it for 10 years.  She was drinking the night of the incident and those two things don’t mix.  She had to seek counseling for anger, to learn ways to calm herself down, and she had to be more reasonable with expectations of me seeing her 100% of the time she was home with me.  I also had to sit down with her family and speak to them about the breakup and the awful day I had with her father in my house.

The relationship was fine for a while.  She started to slowly move things back in, ask what I was doing before making plans, we went on dates, started planning a vacation to Disney the following year, and booked another vacation to Kansas City for the football game.

I met her doctor with her and we spoke for about 20 minutes.  She is in a building with no paintings/pictures/tvs, and even the receptionist desk is sitting on foldable tables.  It has malpractice written all over it.  The doctor never once looked at us while we talked to her about my gf coming off the drugs.  She asked me why I wanted her off, why I was asking to take her off them.  She told me they seemed to be working so they never took her off.  I asked her if maybe it seemed that way because she grew up, but she said maturity could only go so far.  

My gf made a very good effort to make counseling appointments, but they were booked for the holidays and asked her to try in the new year.  She and I worked on little things the other didn’t like the first time around.  I was skimping on cleaning some things, asking her how her day was sometimes, and not helping with laundry/dishwasher stuff.  We fought a few times over absolutely nothing, but that never stopped her from parading the fight out all day until finally accepting me as a loving partner and having zero hours left to be near one another. 

December 16th I had a white elephant party for work.  All of my coworkers were there with their significant others, including my ex girlfriend.  We had a private event at a brewery and drank and ate.  After that we all ubered to a nearby bar and continued.  I was searching for a doppelgänger photo of my friend in my phone from 4-5 years ago, and I was scrolling way past my gf time period and into my ex gf time period.  I found a picture of a snowman that my ex ex gf and I built 4 years ago.  I showed it to her, remarked on its grandeur, she and her boyfriend laughed, and I scrolled on.  My gf turned to me and said, “I’m not going to sit here and watch you reminisce with your fucking ex girlfriend.”  I responded with, “Ok it’s not that big a deal but please blow it out if proportion.”  She stormed outside and people around me asked what happened.  I just said, “All I did was show “name ex gf” a picture of a snowman she built.  My ex ex gf and her bf apologized to me, I shook it off told them it wasn’t their fault.  

From outside she started texting me.  She said, “Fuck you piece of fucking drunk trash.”  I responded, “I am 100% not drunk.  You have flip flopped and that is to be expected.”  She said, “Fuck you.  You never thought enough of me, you don’t care about me, and you don’t love me.”  all lies, I did not respond.

Our mutual friend came inside to tell me how distraught my gf was.  I explained to her that I couldn’t go outside to speak to her.  I kew where she was mentally and I was afraid of her.  I was afraid of what happened last time would occur again.  She pleaded with me and I reluctantly went outside.  It was raining and my gf was not standing under the awning.  Our mutual friend stood between us and we went back and forth.  I yelled at her, “You are obsessed with “ex ex gf” and it is destroying us!  She is happy with her new boyfriend and you still can’t see that!  I am happy with you but you can’t see that!  We are in love but you don’t give a shit!  All you care about is her!”  I never got to finish.  Her left fist came around my friends face and cracked me in the mouth.  I took an immediate two steps back and I felt blood flowing out of my gums.  I smiled wide for her so she could see the blood.  I asked her, “Do you see what you do?”  She cried and my friend gripped her up.  I took pictures of my face and hand because a piece of my gums was in my hand with blood.  I called the police and removed myself from her area by going inside.  All of my coworkers looked at me and knew exactly what happened.  The cops showed up minutes later, handcuffed her, and took her away.  They spoke with me a bit and brought me to the station for a statement.  She admitted immediately to the cops what she had done and that I did not retaliate.  

I denied filing the temporary restraining order that night because I had a friend waiting to take me home who had work in the early AM.  I was assured that I could go down to the sheriff's office the following day to file an order.  The friend who drove was the only sober individual to hear what I said to my gf that night.  

I filed the restraining order the following day, December 17th.  They had the police report (without the photos of my face I submitted to police) and the previous complaint about criminal mischief and assault on record.  I talked to a hearing officer and they awarded me a temporary restraining order against my now ex gf.  In the order there was a an allowance for a 15 minute guided police walkthrough of my home for her to gather essential personal items (clothes/makeup/toiletries).  

I once again packed all of my ex gfs things very neatly and waited to hear from the police about setting up a date/time for her to come get her things.  I called the sheriff’s office, family division office, my local police, and even a cop friend, but no one could tell me if anything was scheduled.  This went on for days.  At work a mutual friend of ours said, “oh ‘name’ said she was probably going over on Monday to get her things.”  I had never heard anything from any local department so I shook it off.  Nonetheless on December 23rd I prepared the house and her things to make it easy to get in and get out.  I did not prepare a table of hers, her plants, nor did I remember books.  I was about ready to throw in the towel late and around 7PM I got a phone call from the local police department.  They asked when would be a good time for her to get her things as she had two friends and a bigger car ready at the moment.  I told them right now.  

I went in the driveway and setup two large white tables.  I made dozens of trips in and out and organized every single item and had them all neat.  The police took longer than expected but they came to me, explained what she was allowed to do, told me I could tag along to make sure she only took her things, and it would be 15 minutes.  They thanked me for doing a good job of packing her things and elevating them on tables for her.  She made her friends pack the car and turned to the house.  The first thing she did was put her hands down on her table and start to push ALL of the items to the ground.  The cop stopped her.  He said, “ma’am this is for personal belongings right now furniture is not included.”  She argued, “Well all of my things have been packed I have 15 minutes to get my other stuff.”  I interjected, “Sir if we can get all of her things out today I wouldn’t mind.  The less this has to happen the better for both of us.”  He told me if I was fine with it then we could proceed.  I removed the items from the table, put them on the ground, and walked it outside.  The cops outside looked at me and I shook my head, “She wants her furniture,”  I said.

I followed her throughout the house.  She didn’t grab much extra but she didn’t shy from making a mess.  She eclipsed her 15 minutes by seven, totaling her walkthrough at 22 minutes before the cops called it a wrap.  We all walked outside and I saw the three girls trying to to pile into the two front seats.  The cops were stopping them because they didn’t have enough seatbelts.  They argued that their car was too full.  The cops told them they shouldn’t have tried to move furniture.  My gf told the police her parents would be by to pick the other girls up.  The cops asked me if that was ok and I said, “I don’t want her parents anywhere near this house.”  They asked me if her parents were part of our restraining order, I told them, “No.”  The other two girls walked to the end of my street and sat in the two wicker chairs my ex gf had taken from the porch.  They got picked up later and the cops and my ex were gone for good.

My ex plead not guilty to her assault charge it and a court date was scheduled for 1/30/20.  She adjourned the first TRO due to a lack of time to prepare, it was moved from 1/02/20 to 1/09/20.  She adjourned it again to obtain a witness and a scheduling conflict with her attorney.  It was moved from 1/09/20 to 1/16/20.  My father, who I wanted very dearly to be with me and represent me in court as the victim, called me on Tuesday 1/14/20 and asked me to adjourn the court date because he had a work emergency.  I told them on the phone that my father was representing me so they said it may be hard to move again, but they would try.  I received no reply that day from the court.  The next day I called many times and they told me it couldn’t be done.  I explained that I have never adjourned it, the defendant had twice, and I am the victim but can not get help from the court.  They called me back as they were closing to tell me it would be moved to 1/23/20.  I thanked them but also felt slighted.  I should be holding the cards but I consistently am getting the shaft.

Side story necessary for next events.  My tenant (friend) and his girlfriend live in my home.  She is controlling of who he can see and who he can not.  When she was on vacation at her parents for the holidays, he hung out and partied with his friends, including the one girl his girlfriend hates.  I knew this, I said nothing to his girlfriend about it.  They did nothing illicit, he is faithful and in love with his gf, but she wouldn’t have understood.  The girl she hates works with my ex gf.  She told her each time she hung out with my friend/roommate.  Now my ex gf and my roommates gf got along out of necessity.  Behind closed doors they despised each other, funny enough they always pointed out how bad the other one treated us (the guys).  

Wednesday 1/15/20 I went to work as scheduled.  This was the same day court was adjourned.  I was at work and my roommate texted me.  “I broke up with ‘name’ and she left, I hate this.”  I asked him what happened, he explained, “It has come to it’s end I can’t do anything or be near anyone without asking permission and as much as I love her she will never change.”  I told him I was sorry and went back to work, we would have beers later.  About two hours after he texted me, “hey my ex came back and she is on the phone with your ex taking things from the house.”  I respond, “WHAT!  What things is she taking.”  He said, “She took your ex gf’s bowl and grinder (she couldn’t take that in front of the police), and she is trying to take your video games.”  I am shook.  This girl is stealing from my home on the orders of a girl I have a restraining order against. This must be illegal.  He texts me, “I told her she can’t take your games and she tried to tell me your ex bought them for you.  I explained that those games were here long before your ex came into your life and she finally put them back.”  All that was taken from my house was my ex gf’s drug paraphernalia.  I should declare that I do not smoke, but my ex gf did.  She works for a school system as an intern in her last year before trying to obtain a job.  I hid her paraphernalia when she came on the guided walkthrough because if they had seen it she would say it wasn’t hers and therefore, “my house my drugs.”  My roommates now ex gf had known I hid it, so when she told my ex, she instructed her to retrieve it when she came back for her own personal items.

My roommates ex gf texted me while I was at work.  “Fuck you and my ex you’re both scumbags.  I’m moving out tomorrow.”  I responded, “How am I a scumbag?  I don’t know what is going on with you but I have nothing to do with your relationship.  You and I have had ample conversation about our lives and I mean what I say.  I hope you can find the time to apologize.”  I hadn’t known that when she showed up at my ex gfs house my ex told her about all the times her now ex bf was hanging out with this girl while she was away.  She neglected to tell her it was with groups of people of course.  This girl was blaming me for not telling her about the hanging out, so therefore she turns on me.  She makes wild accusations, tells my ex that we hid the paraphernalia so that she couldn’t find it.  She tells her that I was going to anonymously contact her employer and tell them she was unfit to work with children (Entirely fabricated and unnecessary.  School superintendents receive reports every few weeks of their employee arrests.  I do not need to tell them myself, they can plainly see.).  

Forward to 1/22/23, day before our first TRO hearing and another Wednesday night.  I am at work and my roommate calls the job.  He asks to put me on the phone.  I get to the phone and he says the police are at my home and they need to speak with me.  Oh boy what happened now.  The police tell me my ex filed a restraining order against me that night.  I have ZERO clue how this is happening.  Since I am a legal gun owner and the restraining order was granted the police have a search warrant for my weapon.  I explain to them that in October when I felt threatened by my ex gf I moved the gun to my fathers house and put it in his safe.  He told me if a restraining order was ever filed he would transfer the gun to his Federal Firearms License and it would no longer be mine.  Well that time is now.  I leave work abruptly to go home and forfeit my firearms ID card.  I get paperwork sent to them to ensure they know my firearm is no longer in my possession.  

I return to work with a restraining order in hand.  It reads:  “Victim states that there is a history of domestic violence between the two parties which dates back over a year.  The victim has broken up with the defendant several times and has gotten back together with him at his request.  After the TRO was granted she did not have any further contact with him and there has been no allegations of the TRO being violated.  The victim states that the defendant is contacting her friends and stating he is going to contact her employer, claiming she is unfit to work with children.  The victim states that the defendant is also hacking into her social media accounts and iphone account.  The victim knew it was him because the access point IP address was his address in ‘city.’

Lets break this down.  

History of domestic violence, yes her on me, documented, admitted to police in reports, admitted to guilt in texts, pictures of my face, video of my busted door.  Zero texts of me threatening, abusing, putting down her psyche, nothing.

Contacting her friends to tell them I was anonymously going to call her employer.  Who in their right mind would tell people if they were to do such a thing.  That thing is unnecessary as previously stated, her employer receives reports.

Hacking into her social media accounts and her iphone?  I do not have the capability nor do I care to learn how.  I am moving on from this person and getting on her social media would help me zero!

Knowing my IP address?  Unless a court order was sent to my ISP to figure out my IP address then I don’t know how someone would have it.  Maybe her devices log my IP as she lived in my house for so long and used the internet daily?

Either way the whole TRO was fictional and a clear ploy to scare me into dropping my TRO.  They knew I had no representation and they served me the night before court.  If there was a history of domestic violence why not come forward after punching me?  Why not come forward after she broke the door?  Why not tell ANY soul on earth that can corroborate with her story before then.

When I went back to work my roommates ex gf texted me asking to call her.  I called her and she tried to apologize for telling my ex gf things out of spite.  I told her I never said the things she told my ex, and she disagreed.  I told her that she does not recall what I said and that was the only truth.  She said, “but I don’t want them to hate me.”  She really was going to testify against me because a girl she does not like and her family would hate her for doing so.  Ridiculous! 

We show up to court 1/23/20 an hour early.  I ask if we have to check in and the officer asks if I have legal representation.  I tell him my dad is representing me, as I told them on the phone, he tells me we can’t do that.  I sit in fear and I am the victim.  I want to puke because I know all the facts but my head is swimming.  I am going to have a panic attack.  

Her lawyer approaches us and barely gets his name out before saying, “so I think we can settle this outside the court.  Yours goes away hers goes away type thing.”  My dad says, “We will speak to our lawyer about that.  The attorney was shocked.  He took a step back and said, “Oh, you have counsel?”  My dad said, “We do now after last nights surprise TRO.  The attorney says he will work for an adjournment when we get inside the courtroom.  He says he thinks both attorneys can settle this outside the court.  

We go in the courtroom and the judge is not happy.  He asks why there is a request for adjournment and her attorney says I am seeking counsel.  He asks me why I waited so long I told him, “I apologize your honor I was told my father could represent me.”  He tells me thats not a thing.  The other attorney says I was seeking counsel so late because they filed a counter TRO the night before.  The judge knows what is going on.  He is not happy.  He adjourns and warns us that there will be no more postponements. 

A victims advocate approached me outside the courtroom and asked to speak to me.  I asked her if we could find a private room.  She told me I needed to wait for my continuance papers before I speak to her.  I pleaded with her and told her I needed a private room now, I was having a panic attack.  I left my brother to get the papers and followed this social worker.  We closed a door behind us in a private room and the air left my lungs.  I had uncontrollable tears and I felt weak.  They let me yell about having zero control, how even now shes the defendant she is always winning, how much emotional stress this puts me under, how much I hate that I love someone who physically abuses me. She looks over all my paperwork and in few words describes her TRO against me as a ploy to get me to drop all charges.  They knew I had no counsel and that I was vulnerable from the shock of having a search warrant in my house the previous night.  

We went out to late lunch after and I received a message from my roommates ex gf.  “Hey just so you know. I told your ex and her lawyer I wasn’t testifying against you and that me being up there wouldn’t be helpful for them. I just want you to now I respect you and I wouldn’t have done that.  Not sure what ended up happening but I hope you both made out okay.”  I told her, “my attorney has advised me not to talk to anyone about this case.”  

My ex gf’s “witness” told her divorce lawyer that she didn’t know what I said and in anger told my ex gf what she thought was happening.  Her lawyer told her to go up and say, “I do not recall.”  Before we made it to court she explained to my ex gf and her attorney she wouldn’t be testifying.    She said that she would stand up and say she didn’t remember.  Her attorney dismissed her, so she had left before we started.  

My ex and her family threw this girl out of their house.  She had been living with them for a short period after leaving my home.  They tossed her because she wouldn’t testify a lie.  Absurd.

Council was recommended to me by a very close friend.  I met him and retained him after hearing his strategy for court.  I gave him EVERYTHING.  I sent him a 638 page pdf of every text message ever sent and received from my ex.  I highlighted 22 individual conversations that appeared to be arguments, apologies, or her speaking about her anger problems.  I didn’t want him to have to read 638 pages, so I did, twice....

Criminal court was postponed from 1/30, another ploy.  Her lawyer sits as a public defender on Thursday mornings and he kept scheduling our case for Thursday mornings so they could adjourn.  

We show up 1/30 for the civil matter of both our restraining orders.  Our lawyers speak outside and my lawyer brings me a, “deal.”  In order to obtain a restraining order you must fit three criteria.  1.  Something about establishing a protected relationship - we had dated.  2.  Establish a timeline of events either physical, verbal, whatever.  3.  Have a legitimate fear for your safety or life - I can’t obtain this proof.  I reluctantly signed a civil restraint which ensures the both of us can NOT have contact directly/indirectly/third party/social medias.  If either of the two of us violates this civil restraint the other will have grounds for a permanent restraining order.  Figure this out, once again, if I do or say anything wrong in one of her friends company or say a word to the people around her, I am punished.  The victim in every one of the above scenarios.  

A week after the civil restraint was signed we showed up to her criminal court date.  I do not need representation as the prosecutor will be representing me, but my lawyer comes with me anyway.  He tells my father and I that she isn’t there yet and her lawyer is not present but his boss is.  When we are called up only me, my lawyer, and her lawyers boss approach the bench.  Her council says they are seeking a 90 day passive cool-down period.  The judge agrees and the long wait begins.  That brings us to today and the process of writing this story down for my sanity.  

Loving someone who abuses you sucks.

TLDR:  my ex girlfriend beat me on two occasions and vandalized my home once.  Her potential career rides on her NOT getting an assault charge but the state is pressing charges.  Loving someone who abuses you sucks"

f8kl4e,0,2020-02-23,Career Switch Question from Accounting,utsukke,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f8kl4e/career_switch_question_from_accounting/,"Hey everyone, I'd like your advice on whether it's realistic or not, and maybe some alternatives if you have some suggestions for me. Please tell me if I'm being delusional.

I'm turning 25 and about to graduate with an accounting degree about 2 months. I'm from the Toronto area. It's taken me longer than average to graduate and I've done some heavy bouncing back-and-forth with switching majors and all, being the bad student that I was. I actually did switch into computer science a few years back, and did a few courses (maybe 5 or so) but felt like I couldn't pass the theoretical math proof courses at the time and just swapped majors again to accounting because I needed to graduate with something. After learning the road ahead of me, I realized that accounting really isn't something I'm looking to do for the rest of my life. 

In the meanwhile, I've been self teaching myself programming again through courses from udemy, practice on freecodecamp and trying to make some site projects online with a friend who's working a full stacks dev job.

From the research I've done, the only alternatives to getting my foot into the door is to either get a computer science degree (whether bachelors or masters) or head into a bootcamp/self study ... and develop a portfolio of significant projects. Bootcamps usually have a terrible rep and the job guarantee seems to be some temporary 3 month internship that isn't sustainable - The ones that mostly succeed to my knowledge already have related degrees and experience in the industry and would've made it without heading to the camp in the first place. On the other-side, doing another degree would take at least another 3 years realistically, putting me at 28 by the time I'm able to start. A masters would save a year of time but would likely be even more difficult to graduate with (let alone the fact that my GPA is under 3.0 and I'd have difficulty getting in).

While I don't intend on counting any of these options out, they all seem to come with their pros / cons and I'm very indecisive at the moment.

Is there any way to enter the industry without committing the full 3-4 years? I don't mind self studying it and spending the majority of my free time after I come home from work to eventually make the full career change, but only taking classes again and not making money doesn't seem realistic at all for me. Am I simply being delusional?"

First of all thank you so much for being supportive. I have a few questions if you guys don't mind. So basically I'm a self taught front end dev, I have been learning for almost 7 months (HTML, JS, CSS, and ReactJS). I built my portfolio (4 projects), and started applying last month. I have applied for over 100 applications, but I got only one interview, and two phone interviews. It didn't go well for the first interview since the interviewer told that I was too junior, and I had no degree. I basically dropped out of college( I took 93 units in mechanical engineering), and I don't really know how to present in on my resume. So I got so anxious when I did the interview. So the question is, should I mention on the resume that I dropped out of college ) ?

The second question is, I got a phone interview for an unpaid internship, and they know that I dropped out of college, should I consider it ?

Again, sorry for the long post, but I'm really anxious.

Thanks"

Im basically down to two schools.  One school offers CoSc with a concentration of Information Security and the other just offers CoSc.

Would it be smarter to take the one with a concentration in network security since thats probably what I want to focus in or does it not matter as much because a CoSc degree can land you with any job like that.

If I don’t take the network security route does that then effect the internships that I could potentially land in the information security area or does it make more sense to go the information security route.

Edit:
Mean’t to add this part,  I’m also looking at getting a minor in math since CoSc has a lot of math in it already.  The school that has the information security concentration requires 26 credits of math and requires different math classes than what the cosc major requires.  The one without the information security concentration only requires 21 credits of math.  I haven’t looked as deep into what math classes this requires."
f8lep5,88,2020-02-23,What is your #1 struggle in getting your ideal job that you love and becoming a senior software engineer making a ton of money,cspayitforward,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f8lep5/what_is_your_1_struggle_in_getting_your_ideal_job/,"I’m a senior engineer who started at the bottom, as an intern after a coding bootcamp, and I want to  help. I struggled getting from junior to mid to finally senior and struggled even more getting the job I truly want (fully remote, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;$150k base, and fun team/work)

I've been mentoring junior &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; mid level engineers through DMs and calls for a while now (see my first post on this account).

I want to step it up and make it more efficient for everybody because I keep getting the same questions, usually centered around how to improve interview performance efficiently and resume advice.

So, I'm going to run a free live 6 week masterclass on advancing your software engineering career and getting the job you want

So far these are the topics I'm planning to include:- The most efficient study/learning strategy: how to optimize your study time when you only have a few hours a week (HINT: Dont grind leetcode, concentrate on the patterns)- How to make your resume truly stand out- How to use a backdoor way of reaching out to companies and getting interviews, if applying through websites is giving you a low amount of callbacks- Why networking events are a waste of time

I want to add more topics that are as relevant as possible and answer the most common questions everyone has. For those that aren't happy and/or are still at junior/mid level and want to hit senior...what is your #1 struggle with reaching that goal?

No idea how much response this will get, but I'm limiting this first masterclass to 100 students, to make it a good balance of students I help vs time I can spend per student.

Comment here or DM me with your #1 struggle, and I'll try to include it in the masterclass and send you a link to signup.

I'm currently learning Python and am taking free intro to machine learning and data science course online.

Worst case scenario, is it possible for me to pursue a job in machine learning without any internships/experience? What should I do?"

f8o7d7,23,2020-02-24,I appreciate you guys,iwantIvy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f8o7d7/i_appreciate_you_guys/,"Could just be that I'm fucking tired and its 3am, but as someone whose graduating with a likely fairly shit GPA (2.9) in a social science, gotta say I appreciate everyone in the CS field I've met.. with a few exceptions. Professionals, I should say. Everyone who professionally works in the field, busts their ass, keeps everything from IoT to embedded systems and mobile/web apps running, and most importantly helps new grads and people interested in the field get into it? Good on you. Keep that shit going.

I grew up relatively poor in Connecticut, my family pressured me to go into law school to a point where up until literally maybe October it was all I could think about pursuing. It came up a number of times, the idea of me switching tracks to Computer Science and get a double major or a minor (or totally switch fields), but at the time I always felt it was like my folks just forcing another option onto me like they did with law school. So I took a couple classes, still am. Really enjoyed it, trying to get as involved as I can this last semester by starting up a CTF team which has virtually gone nowhere. 

My social science internship ended up being coding a mobile app for all of 4-5 months, without pay, but still. They wanted me to work on it this latest semester, but since I already got the internship credit and was still not going to get paid I said I'd sit on it (and have yet to call them back... probably should). 

I still have no clue how the hell you all write in that dry as hardtack style for papers.. but hey, someone has to do it. I'm on paper 2/3 for one of my classes and I just can't hack it, it feels like my brain is turning to mush just regurgitating the same simplistic information over and over without any kind of polish ad nauseum. Like bashing someone over the head with a big stick until they realize whatever basic concept you're trying to get across. I've tried asking for help, only to get nothing from my professor. If this is the kind of stuff you guys have to go through for an entire degree, god bless you. 

For those who didn't get a degree and think college is bullshit? Congrats on having the self discipline to finish a bootcamp and/or self study your way into a job. 

I don't honestly know what I wanted to make this post for other than complaining about my department but praising the field overall and trying to be positive.. but yeah. I hope everyone had a nice weekend. Any advice on what to do in my position would be appreciated, but isn't needed. Just share some positivity! What's your proudest moment in CS? What did you used to struggle with that you've overcame? 

All the best!"

Recently, I have applied for an internship/study practice with a research institution for getting more practical experience in using theoretical knowledge in practice with support of an academical insitution. The answer is positive and the responsible person presented the project, where my skills are relevant. As far as I can understand, they are dealing with a huge load of data (nature sciences) nowadays and need support in a situation which allows some flexibility. However, in order to exploit this opportunity, I would need to move to a diferent town [movement within Europe] and sustain myself for several months until summer. Moving from a larger urban area and living with no warranty of employment seems to be risky. Due to this reason I would like to negotiate the opportunity to continue working with the project during the summer season (at least) as well and without the contractual support by the univesity. Would it be considered to be too pushy/overambitious to raise this question during the negotiation phase? How would you recommend dealing with this situation?

Some contextual information.: I am a young man in early 30s with education in the field of nature sciences and work experience in customer sevice willing to start using knowledge in the area of interest in practice. Some of my IT skills and education are very suitable for the afforementioned internship."

Hi all,

I'm a 22 year old graduate from Ireland with a BSc of Analytical Science and a MSc in Immunology.

I finished my MSc degree last June and graduated November. I've been applying for positions both domestically and abroad consistently since finishing and I've now reached roughly 500 applications. In this time I've had 5 job interviews, none of which were successful. I've spoken to many recruiters in this time, updating my CV and cover letters constantly. It has become increasingly demotivating filling out applications online and spending time personalizing my cover letter for the company I'm applying for when 80% of my applications don't even get responded to.

I have experience in the industry as I worked as a lab assistant as part of an internship for 3 months in the summer prior to undertaking my MSc, yet I don't feel as though it has added much value to CV.

I'm worried its only going to get worse from here considering the graduate market is only going to increase as time goes on.

I'm not sure how these kinds of posts usually go and I'm half typing this out to just vent my frustration as its 4am and I can't sleep because I'm constantly anxious about the future that seems so dim.

Any advice on how to stay motivated when everything seems to be going wrong?"

f8rwtt,28,2020-02-24,I am just done with this whole thing,RandomUsername790,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f8rwtt/i_am_just_done_with_this_whole_thing/,"I am just so done with this process. After years of working on internships, participating in competitions internationally, sacrificing sleep, and just 4 sucky years of just work, I just feel empty. I came into high school with a wide-eyed love of science and a determination to go to a good college, and now all I have left is like this obsession to get into these places.

I don’t even remember the love for STEM and science I originally had. What’s makes things even worse is that over the last year I have developed test anxiety so my grades slipped, at a 3.7 GPA with a 35 ACT I worry all the time I won’t even get into the colleges, (my only hope is that I got first in a national CS competition, and do a lot of research stuff may make up for that a little) which is now the only thing I really care about. I just feel like a rubber band constantly being pulled in 100 different ways and I really just want to take a breather just for a second. I am both hoping for March to get here while also dreading March bc I know I won’t get into any “good colleges"". I have forced myself to make this my ultimate goal. Colleges like MIT and Columbia are out the window for me ( even though applied) and even if I got in, I don’t think I could handle it. I feel like an echo of my former self.

I know I am in a really good situation, and I am thankful for all of the resources that I have. But goddamnit I just want this to end, except I am pretty sure I won’t like the ending. 

I know this seems really ranty, but I just thought maybe the people on this sub might understand, and maybe some juniors can learn from my mistakes. Don’t spend your 4 years trying to be better than everyone and pushing yourself so hard that you end up failing. Right now, when everything is fine and my four years are essentially finally over, this is when I feel the worst.

I am just done and I don't really know what to do. Maybe you guys can help."

I applied to the Google Summer internship and after doing their online coding challenge and 2 technical phone interviews I was invited to do my third interview for more ""data points"". The day of the interview arrived and I never received the call,  the next day my recruiter emailed me telling me unforeseen circumstances happened which is fine and we should reschedule.

I finally completed my rescheduled third and final technical interview 2 weeks ago (form today it was on the 10th) and I haven't heard back since. I was wondering should I email my recruiter asking for an update or perhaps wait another week or two? Google have actually been really quick with following up with me up to this point usually after doing a ""step"" like giving my resume and taking their tests I heard back the next day to move forward.

Thanks for any advice."

I have two offers and I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight on the companies and their summer intern programs.

|Known for being a little slow|I'll probably be able to learn more skills in the end but I've also heard [Accenture might not have the best reputation in tech](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c3l099/accenture_offer_looking_for_opinions_on_the_firm/) [and largely overwork their employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b6iwqs/accenture_has_anyone_worked_there/)|
|I'll have to renege my at-will contract with them because they offered to me long ago and I signed, but I've heard that reneging for an internship isn't that serious and the contract states at-will for both me and the employer|Offer ends in a week|
|[Stocks are apparently super low](https://prnt.sc/r6xre2) which is kinda concerning|[Stocks are always rising](https://prnt.sc/r6xr64)|

I'm hesitant because if I go for Accenture I'll be losing a potential $18/hr... and that adds up to a *lot* of money lost. But also, since it's my first internship, I should be aiming to learn as much as possible, and Accenture might be able to help with that more. My parents would really like for me to go to Accenture in order to learn as many skills as possible instead of going to Citi to earn more for only one summer.

I was considering negotiating with Accenture about the salary but all the advice I've looked up and heard say not to negotiate an internship salary and that companies (unless they're at the top or the candidate is *very, very good*) usually will not even want to hear about negotiating an internship offer. I suppose it wouldn't really hurt to try, right? They wouldn't rescind in offer because of me asking? Also, I've never negotiated before, so I don't really know how it works.

I figured it'd be good to ask on here so that I can hear opinions from others in the community. Many thanks for reading all of this and helping me out.

Also, if anyone's interned at any of these please let me know about your personal experience!"

I have been in school since 2017 and have not made nearly as much progress as I’d like to. Because of my high school resume and my originally go-getter attitude, I was able to get a few civil internships, I have a bunch of contacts who are more than willing to accept me and *I like the work*. The problem is that I feel such a big disconnect with my classes and the work I do outside of school. 

I struggle with my classes because of my somewhat poor math foundation and only really continue out of spite for what a friend of mine once said to me about said mathematics foundation. 

I’ve managed to BS my way to what was, at one point, my dream college (Manhattan College) and it’s nowhere near what I expected it to be. 

I feel significantly behind other students to the point that I am afraid to even ask them questions to show how far behind I am. I find it hard to manage my time in getting tutors or assistance in other ways. My other engineering friends promise they will help me but are usually too busy with their harder classes that come ahead of where I am, to be able to sit down with me and try to catch me up.

I feel as though I have invested so much into an engineering career that I have no choice other than to continue, but it’s come to the point where I’m not sure if I can bring myself to continue. I haven’t broadened my horizons into anything other than Civil because it was essentially my goal since sophomore year o FB high school.

TL;DR - I feel like I invested too much into my civil engineering education and I am starting to feel like I can’t/no longer want to do it, despite enjoying my internships and work that I have done up to this point.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

f8uywh,2,2020-02-24,Stay as Lead Dev for a startup or jump ship to a bigger company that has more to offer?,goahnary,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f8uywh/stay_as_lead_dev_for_a_startup_or_jump_ship_to_a/,"**Current Company:**  
So let's jump right into this. I'm currently working at a company that has been in ""start-up mode"" for about 5 years. I have only been working here for a little over a year. I started last year as a junior dev. This is my first position as a ""professional"" developer. All of the other jobs I've had were internships (work/study). In the last year, my boss and the lead dev have both moved on to other companies. So with me being the last back-end developer left in the company the position of Lead Dev fell to me. I'm now doing mostly dev-ops stuff (releasing code and managing the branches) and just generally keeping everything going by fixing the major bugs and assuring everyone has what they need.

**Pros**

* I have an extremely flexible schedule. I work from home 3 days a week.
* I just got a pretty substantial raise which is very nice. Not the peak I could eventually be making but definitely a solid salary for now.
* I am the Lead Dev so I am getting some great experience managing a team and learning the ins and outs of dev-ops.
* We have plans to hire more developers soon.
* I have a private office and I do value that a lot. Open office plans irk me a little bit.
* We ""Should"" be getting a huge investment soon. Not holding my breath though. This is something that is talked about almost constantly but has yet to actually happen.  


**Cons**

* We don't follow best practices and never seem to have the time to ensure we are doing that.
* I work by myself almost all the time. The loneliness gets to me pretty hard in the winter. I also don't have many developers above me that can mentor me.
* We work with two development shops outside of the US. This is not exactly bad... but it means they have completely different hours than we do and pair-programming is non-existent. This also means the team will be changing in a few months. The lead dev from one company is leaving in about a month. I have learned a lot from him but I know he will not be here to teach me anymore. So the future coworkers I might have are pretty unknown.
* Funding for our company is pretty inconsistent. Although recently, now that we have changed our business model, it seems to be improving.
* None of the developers we plan to hire will be local and that adds more to my issues with loneliness. Although it may be better if we hire someone US-based. They still won't be close enough that I can turn to them and have a conversation or go out for drinks with.
* Investments are said to be imminent and talked about almost constantly but have yet to actually happen. Although we did get a small investment round recently and I am more hopeful about that. Still, the investment is a few months out at the very least.
* No TDD

**New Company:**  
The new company that I have my last set of interviews with next week is exploding with growth! It is one of the fastest-growing businesses in the city. They are building a new facility and the CEO of the company, who I interviewed with, says they plan to hire 50+ new developers in the next year. Everyone I know who works there says it's a GREAT place to work. All of the reviews I can find online are raving reviews about how great it is.

**Pros:**

* This could be a phenomenal place for me to learn languages like GoLang and Elixir (maybe Rust? Not 100% on that one). Very current and high-paying languages to learn.
* Even with that training, I don't think I would want to leave the company because it seems like such a great place to work.
* HUGE benefit in my eyes though is all the developers they have currently I could learn from and the opportunities that will bring.
* CEO seems VERY cool. I follow him on LinkedIn and he is pretty inspiring.
* Lot's of opportunities for advancement or movement laterally if I want to explore specialization in one area or another.
* Salary will be equal to or more than what I am currently making.
* Everyone I've interviewed with seems very knowledgable about their craft and it's very refreshing to be exposed to so many down-to-earth experts. I feel I could learn a lot from them.
* The best practices will be modeled for me. I will learn about new development tools and how to assure my code scales well.
* TDD is practiced here.

**Cons:**

* It is an open office. Although it is a pretty sweet looking office space (Lots of cool toys like an arcade cabinet with 100s of games built from a raspberry pie. They're dog-friendly and there are a few dogs roaming around the office every day. I love dogs.)
* No talk of work from home yet. I'm sure there will be some but I know it won't be 3 days a week like I have now.
* I'm a little afraid that moving to a larger company means more will be expected of me and I won't measure up; I won't get the help I need and I may not do as well as in my current environment. (Big fish / little pond type of situation currently... Do I really want to move to a bigger pond?).

I wanted to get some advice because this would be the first time I am moving positions in my professional career. I have it pretty good where I am. But I don't want to miss out on other opportunities because I'm comfortable. I also want to make sure I'm not jumping ship on something that may benefit me greatly in the next 6 months. What do you guys think?"

f8vg8l,225,2020-02-24,PSA: This is just the beginning,booneboi,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f8vg8l/psa_this_is_just_the_beginning/,"I am now a third-year in college and just wanted to give forewarning to all the hardworking seniors here that the college application process is simply a baby step and should be integrated as a learning experience.

Going into college I thought I was surely at the end of a long road. Of course, I knew there were things to come, but I definitely didn't know how imminent and IMPORTANT they were. What I'm referring to are internships, summer programs, and pre-professional school applications.

As an economics major/finance person, the singular most important thing in determining my job outcome (e.g. working at a high-paying prestigious investment or consulting firm) are summer internship experiences and connections. I had no idea that applications for freshman summer programs started in the summer after my senior year, and by the time I figured out it was already November and most of the prestigious internships were already gone by then. EDIT: I think I'm overstating the importance of freshman internships here—EXPERIENCE is more important. I forgot that most prestigious internships are not even open to freshman.  I use the word prestigious here because the name of the company you worked for is extremely important; simply having a name or association on your resume can get you through the door for other programs and jobs. I had to settle for a small consulting firm that paid me decently but ultimately is not really going to elevate me above other candidates. If anything, my 'relaxed' attitude after getting into college did me a disservice.

Come the first-year summer, I was already applying to all these programs and had a head start. This is where I really realized it was unfair since most of the prestigious internships did not even allow you to apply unless you went to a certain undergraduate school. Goldman Sachs has specific investment banking opportunities open only to Harvard and Yale undergraduates; McKinsey has specific programs for HYP and UChicago undergraduates. Luckily I attended one of these schools, which is literally the only reason that I was able to get one of these programs.

After completing the program, my advisor at Goldman helped me get into a program for this 2020 summer that will essentially be an outlet for a real job as an IB intern in 2021 when I graduate. This is not uncommon too, you are essentially applying for a job as a SOPHOMORE in college because the timeline is so screwed and these firms/companies want to keep people tied along with them since they have already ""trained"" them, etc.

No one tells you these things, so you have to make sure to know what is happening and when. For example, internship applications for the 2021 summer are opening NOW and some are on a first-come-first serve rolling basis. That could be the difference between you getting an internship the next summer, and then getting a job. I can't tell you how many people I know who have been stuck with no internships due to carelessness and then don't know what to do come third year. Often what happens is they have to take up a low paying job or even other internships for 2 more years before trying to transition into a prestigious firm that will pay you 2x more for the same work. And this is all assuming you attend one of the undergraduate schools they want. If you don't you're already at a massive disadvantage in the entire process.

Overall: Make sure you write FLAWLESS applications for summer programs LONG BEFORE they are due, make sure you stay on a TIMELINE and make sure you know what is going on so you don't get swept up! Also, try to cater to your resume and applications to specific programs!!! Even if it feels like you are BSing it still can make a huge difference!

Full disclosure, this is specific to the finance industry and pre-law. I know that the importance of internships for CS is also akin to what I have described, but there is more room for error since your skills can carry you more in that area. Pre-med is the only outlier where you don't necessarily need 'internships' or a set summer track to get in, but that is a whole different beast that is even more tedious. There are still many summer programs that give you a big leg up in MD and MD/PhD programs, but they are VERY competitive. If anyone has any questions on econ or pre-med summer programs feel free to ask."

**Work experience**
- 2 yrs at a FAANG-type company, working on some breakthrough technologies. Led the design and creation across several teams of a few modules and now am an acting mentor in some ways to one of our new team members. Might wait it out until Nov for a promotion during review cycle or move to one of the high growth startups in my target field of smart city/urban tech by the summer. 

- Took a year off in the middle of undergrad to pursue 2 semesters of internships which ultimately helped me realize which type of SW engineering I wanted to enter, and helped me get my current job. 

**Extra curriculars**
- Organized our university’s hackathon for 2 years driving growth in several processes that are still in use today by the current organizing teams
- Co-founded an urban tech startup while in undergrad. Ultimately failed but it was a good learning experience. 
- Founded a media org that creates podcasts and written content around urban/civic tech. Partnered with a network and seeing significant growth in our listener base (~300 downloads/mo)
- Working with a local community org to help my city build a better Open Data pipeline
- Fluent in Mandarin, working towards official certification (HSK exam)

**Undergrad school/major**
- Top 5 public university (Berkeley, UMich, GTech) with degrees in Electrical/Computer Engr. 
- Minors in Entrepreneurship and Mandarin (unsure how it’ll help during the process, but it shows continued interest in those areas I think)

**Race/nationality**
- Male South Asian (US Citizen)



**GMAT Score/GPA**
- 730 (49 Q, 39 V, 8 IR, 6 AWA)
- Undergrad GPA: 3.5



**Goal of MBA**
- Short term is to exit as a Product Manager into my target field of urban tech (areas like mobility, IoT, wireless comms, open data).

- Long term is to start my own urban tech company and work with cities to improve life for the millions of residents who live there.

**Target schools**
- M7 + Ross/Haas


I’m planning on applying during R1 2021 with 3.5 yrs of WE, so I’m hoping to use the next 1.5 yrs to rly beef up any weak areas in my application!!

This is almost entirely because I don't have enough waking hours. My primary goal is to get any job by May, but I'm not totally sure of the time frame to allot for this. My secondary goal would be to get a job in my area of focus. My instinct was that the best thing to do was to just apply to any and every position I come across with a mostly generic resume and cover letter, but I recently spoke with one of my college's career advisers and he indicated that given my limited available hours to recruit, it would be more fruitful to come up with 5-10 favorite postings and send polished applications in to those companies.

I'm sure this may come off as me just looking to get a job the lazy way, but I'm genuinely concerned that I won't be able to succeed at my current teaching position, coursework, and job hunt simultaneously. Worst case, it wouldn't be the end of the world if I have to sacrifice a half letter grade or more, but **I'd love to hear the most time-effective strategies you all know of** in the hopes I could avoid that!

For my background, I have non-CS internships at three major companies, two teaching appointments in CS at my school, and no personal projects outside of school; although, my course projects have been quite substantial. I'll have my Master's from a top-10 University in CS with (probably) a pretty high GPA. BSE was CS with an above average GPA. I'm most interested in going into autonomous vehicle perception or planning, and to that end have taken 4 courses in robotics and a handful more in CV, ML, AI, etc. Thus, I'm not terribly concerned about my ability to land the job from a qualifications perspective, but I just don't know what to focus my efforts on to make it happen. Recently, I've been revamping my resume to place more emphasis on my technical skills and de-emphasize my non-CS positions, as well as polishing my LinkedIn. I would truly appreciate your guidance."

I am an international Ph.D. student (in US) in the field of Hydrology/hydrogeology. I am graduating next summer, and hoping to land myself in the industry (rather than continuing in academia). My entire graduate work has been computational in nature - running models, programming, good amount of statistics and dealing with plenty of data. Thus, I am targeting companies and positions which have an overlap of data analysis, programming and bit of geoscience (whereever possible) - examples: environment consulting (groundwater modelers), geoscience data scientist, catastrophe modeling companies, oil and gas companies etc. I am also thinking of looking for positions as pure data scientist since I also have a bit of experience with machine learning which I can use to hit the ground running in the field/positions of applied data science.

I am using this resume right now for applying for similar internship positions, and planning to update this when hunting for full-time position this coming fall. Any suggestions to improve anything in this will be much appreciated.

Counting all of my work experience, I have about 2.5 years of technical experience in the software industry on top of my degree.

For a little over a year, I've been running an I.T. repair business where I clean up viruses, build PCs, install new routers, etc. I do enjoy that work, but I enjoy building software more... plus it pays better. I've been thinking of pivoting this business into a software consultancy, where I can be a technical resource for small to midsize companies. My strong suit is web application development. I could start out by doing smaller projects on my own, and hire a small team to assist me with larger contracts if the business grows.

My question is, am I too early on in my career to have enough credibility? If so, what is a good amount of experience to have before taking on this challenge?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I am very new to anything finance; I am still taking my financial accounting class and have not taken managerial accounting yet. These are more or less intro classes in finance and business. (3.9 GPA)

Is this internship something that I could do well with very little knowledge in finance and banking? I'd say I'm proficient with Excel/Word/PowerPoint. 

Was reading around the internet and saw that the analyst position entails:

* Developing/maintaining financial models
* Performing financial analyses; ie. valuations, merger consequence 
* Company research 
* Prep presentations for clients

I'm a senior in high school, I would like to major in software engineering. I'm from a small town in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

My other option is Texas A&amp;M Commerce (you might know this one from the two shootings recently :/) I have made a list of pros and cons, trying to be as unbiased as I can 


UTD

Pros:

Would move me closer to Dallas and away from the small suburbs 

The tech scene in Dallas has grown a ton these past few years, would be easier to find a job and internships

Social scene at UTD is not great, but better than TAMUC, has a lot of clubs I am really interested in 

Would get me away from my family. I love them, but my dad is a drunk (not abusive) and I can't stand the drunken rants and arguments he has. On more than one occasion I have had to pick my brothers up from school because he drank all day

Could commute from as the school is about 45-50 minutes away and save money

Do not have to live on campus freshman year, could try to find an apartment with roommates to lower cost of rent

Cons: 

If I commuted and had class mon-fri I would spend about 7.5 hours in the car each week.  Commuting would also make extracurriculars I want to be apart of hard to participate in as a few of them have meetings that go until around 10 pm

UTD is sorta infamous for how bad the food on the dining hall is

Tuition is about 15k a year

Rent would cost about 10-11k a year

TAMUC

Pros:

Can live at home and save a ton of money 

Tuition costs about half as much

Almost everyone from my school is going there so I would at least know some people

Would eat at home, parents would pay for most food

Cons:

Social scene is basically non-existent

Not a great computer science program 

Does not offer software engineering

f8yyag,79,2020-02-24,"My university is saying my private stipend maxes out my federal financial aid, and they're increasing my tuition.",wiscojin,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f8yyag/my_university_is_saying_my_private_stipend_maxes/,"Not sure if a student loan specific sub would be more appropriate, but this seemed to be more of a legal question to me.

I am a graduate level student in clinical psychology and I am currently placed at a practicum (part-time internship) in an elementary school doing therapy (began August 2019). This elementary school has agreed to offer practicum students a $2,500 stipend to help offset the price of gas (it is an hour drive away) and to encourage students to choose placement at this site. As students we were told we would receive $1,250 in the fall semester (December 2019) and $1,250 in the spring semester (May 2020) as decided by my university's financial aid office. In January we were told the payments were delayed because we hadn't submitted a W9 to our financial aid office. On February 10th we were sent another form to complete from our fin aid office stating our commitment and duties at our practicum site and the statement ""I understand that I will receive $2,500 in the form of financial aid for my one year commitment.""   
On February 21st I received an email from our university's financial aid director stating, ""I wanted to reach out to you because I was notified that you have received an additional stipend award from The Elementary School For $2500.  Because we have changed the process for stipends, you will receive a $2500 check from our finance office but at the same time I am going to have to return $2500 of federal student loan money in order to keep you within your student budget for resources so you will owe $2500 on your tuition account.  So, please note that the $2500 balance on the tuition account will need to be taken care of in order to register into the next semester.""  
Given that email, here are the facts about my awarded stipend. This $2,500 is being given to us from The Elementary School (in no way connected financially to my university), it is not financial aid being given to me by the federal government (has nothing to do with my student budget or amount of loans I am rewarded), and is not a financial aid award being given to me by my university in the form of an assistantship, grant, scholarship, etc. The university agreed with The Elementary School to receive the funds personally (to ease the process) and to distribute them to me and the other practicum students; the fin aid office is being paid overhead for these duties.   
This is the part that seems very sketchy/potentially illegal to me. When I responded to the financial aid director she responded by telling me: the $2,500 is a resource I am receiving as a student so it must be counted toward financial aid awarded, and made sure to point out that I agreed to this in the form I signed on February 10th. Yet, in the email received from her on the 21st she claimed to have just been notified of my stipend where she then dropped the bomb of me having to pay it back. This seems strategic to me, and that she wanted me to sign this form first before she gave me this news. Next, she is claiming that she must reduce my financial aid awards by $2,500 because I have reached the maximum that the federal government allows. I am unsure how this process works, but if I already accepted and received these rewards - does she have the ability to give them back without my consent? And why wouldn't she have me personally give the $2,500 back through my own federal student aid account? Third, she is saying this $2,500 is actually being returned in the form of my personal payment of an additional tuition charge to my University. This is the sketchiest part to me, because why would I be paying an additional tuition charge to my university if she is saying I owe the money back to the federal government?   
A charge of $1,250 has already been placed on my summer tuition, with the threat that if I don't pay it - I won't be allowed to enroll in classes. This is especially frustrating, because I haven't yet seen a dime of the Elementary School stipend. She said the second charge of $1,250 will be charged in fall with the same repercussions of not paying it.    
This is as far as I have gotten with her in communication, and she hasn't responded to my last email. I may be completely off in this being a legal matter - but any advice/suggestions are appreciated!!"

Let me know if  you're also in the Bellevue/Seattle area (perhaps for Microsoft/Amazon)  and are also looking for somewhere to live this coming summer. DM me  with any questions etc.!
f905mh,5,2020-02-24,"Headhunted by Infosys as an ""Associate"". Not a CS grad. Is this worth it?",ghdawg6197,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f905mh/headhunted_by_infosys_as_an_associate_not_a_cs/,"Context: I am **not** a Computer Science grad. I got my bachelor's in Geographical Sciences last year and moved to Australia for a few months as a gap year to travel, now I'm going back to the DC area in May. I'm posting here because it's CS-related work; if not allowed, I will repost to r/Jobs.

Basically title. I was encouraged to apply because I've done a bit of programming in the past at internships, but I would not consider it a career path I want. I got an interview and seemingly bombed the technical portion but seemed to have redeemed myself with the other parts. A few days time and here I am with an offer. $57K and benefits, PTO, etc.

From what I've read on here, it's a great place to start if you want to do dev. They pay you to be shipped out for training somewhere and it's a full-time role.  I don't want to do dev and I want to stay on the East Coast but I haven't had any interviews or anything for my actual career goals (likely to do with me being in Australia, but I digress). Is this worth it? Is it a fun/good place to work, even for non-CS grads? And if you are a CS grad familiar with it, what do you know? I don't want to go head-first into something completely ill-suited for me and my interests if I want to get started on my real career when I get back, but if there's a lot of good that can come out of this then I may still consider it. 

GIS and other geographical work is hard to work on without an academic or professional environment so I don't want to let them get stale by working on unrelated things (but at the same time, not doing anything is bad too)"
f9152n,0,2020-02-24,Game tester vs generic programming experience to get into a game studio,Limitless-xe,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/f9152n/game_tester_vs_generic_programming_experience_to/,"I'm a computer science student and I'd like to get into the game industry, probably as a programmer. I'm looking for internships for the summer as I have no work experience yet. 

My question is: Would it be more valuable if I get a generic programming internship, possibly doing web development or QA testing for a software company, as opposed to a game testing position? 

I 'm still applying and I'm not sure if I can land a programming internship, but I have a solid chance at getting a video game Functional QA testing job I'm being interviewed for. I'm not sure if that would be a waste of time vs working in an actual software company, in terms of experience to have on my resume. Any advice?"

f91s2c,1,2020-02-24,How do I parlay my entry level job into something better?,putcoolusernamehere,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f91s2c/how_do_i_parlay_my_entry_level_job_into_something/,"In college, I got a 3.9 GPA.  I networked, built work experience, and worked hard consistently.  I studied a niche business major that has high demand for workers.  The average student who gradutes my program makes about $55,000 / year.  I was a far above average student (high GPA, VP of our student org, networked a lot, and built a variety of solid work experience in sales and academic support).  I even won an award as one of the top 30 students in the whole country in my major (which has launched massive careers for lots of precious recipients).

However, my senior year, I got kinda desperate for money.  My car was broke &amp; I was living a bit too exuberant a lifestyle. I got desperate.  I applied around town for jobs.  I felt so happy when I got one at my dream company (by far the best company in my city in my niche). So, last Janaury, I took what they offered me, which was an extremely entry level data entry job (which pays $20,000 a year less than someone with my qualifications should expect). I figured I'd make some good connections and they'd move me on to the type job I was qualified for when I graduated in May.  I really wanted to be at this company, so I kept making myself beleive it would work out.

13 months later, I'm still in the same ole job.  I've shown flashes of my competency to my boss, but she has absolutely 0 interest in seeing my succeed beyond the role (the job has a very high turnover rate and several of her best workers have been poached by other teams at the company lately).  She even went as far as to give me a bang average performance review, when I will exceeded all the goals that were set for me, and even went above and beyond by earning an industry designation.  

Once, a higher up saw my potential (she read a scholarship essay I wrote).  She told me that if I apply to the position I want, I should be able to get it.  She invited me to a huge meeting where I'd get a chance to network with the big wigs.  But, in the most unfortunate timing in my life, I had to skip the meeting because I had an exam for my aforementioned industry designation.  I told her this and she said she'd follow up and send me info about the meeting.  3 months later and I've heard nothing from her (and I'm to much a coward to follow up). 

Now, I feel stuck.  I'm apathetic about my job (it feels boring and repetitive). I hate coming to work in the morning, nay dread it.  I feel incredibly unfulfilled.  I'm losing motivation in my professional and personal life. I'm gaining weight. My social life is suffering. I saw all the summer interns come in and get extraordinary opportunities (damn well knowing I was a college student who they gave no such chance).  All of this and I'm still making $20,000 less than even the most average of students with similar qualifications.   

I want to apply for higher roles within the company, but they just aren't opening.  I think my resume would be highly competitive to get this position, but I cant apply if there's no chance.  I've realized lately that I need to make it known what I want.  In January, the hired someone from my major for the job I want without even posting it as an opening (she had interned there).  I feel if I show my resume to the right person, that door could open for me too.  But I don't know who to speak to.  Outside of the lady who invited me to the meeting and my boss who has no interest in me being promoted, everyone there lumps me in with the rest of the entry level support workers. And I'm afraid if I wait too long I'm going to be pigeonholed as one for the long term.  

**TL/DR: I'm an overqualified person in an entry level position, making 20k / year less than people with similar credentials.  I want to move up at my company.  However, there haven't been better job postings in months and my boss is actively refusing to help me advance my long-term career.  What can I do to get someone within my company to see my potential and help me find a role that fits my qualifications better?**"

I'm a senior in high school, I would like to major in software engineering. I'm from a small town in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The school I would like to go to is University Texas at Dallas, but it's going to be expensive and I would not be able to commute. I would obviously have to take out loans. My other option is Texas A&amp;M Commerce (you might know this one from the two shootings recently :/) I have made a list of pros and cons, trying to be as unbiased as I can 

UTD

Pros:

Would move me closer to Dallas and away from the small suburbs 

The tech scene in Dallas has grown a ton these past few years, would be easier to find a job and internships

Social scene at UTD is not great, but better than TAMUC, has a lot of clubs I am really interested in 

Would get me away from my family. I love them, but my dad is a drunk (not abusive) and I can't stand the drunken rants and arguments he has. On more than one occasion I have had to pick my brothers up from school because he drank all day

Could commute from as the school is about 45-50 minutes away and save money

Do not have to live on campus freshman year, could try to find an apartment with roommates to lower cost of rent

Cons: 

If I commuted and had class mon-fri I would spend about 7.5 hours in the car each week. Commuting would also make extracurriculars I want to be apart of hard to participate in as a few of them have meetings that go until around 10 pm

UTD is sorta infamous for how bad the food on the dining hall is

Tuition is about 15k a year

Rent would cost about 10-11k a year

Alumni network doesn't seem to be the best

TAMUC

Pros:

Can live at home and save a ton of money 

Tuition costs about half as much

Almost everyone from my school is going there so I would at least know some people

Would eat at home, parents would pay for most food

Cons:

Social scene is basically non-existent

Almost everyone from my school is going there so I would at least know some people 

Not a great computer science program 

Does not offer software engineering 

I visited the campus my junior year before I was even set on UTD and I didnt like it then

The town this college is in is an even smaller suburb than my current town 

Alumni network is even worse

----

I feel like being in a metropolitan area is going to be much more beneficial for internships and jobs. I have thought about going to the local college then trying to transfer to save some money, but I also feel like if I do this I will be missing out on building relationships with the professors and students of the school I transfer to."

I always wanted to get into cloud engineering and I thought that I could use web development as a stepping stone into that field. So, I did a few web dev projects with a few hundred users. I then created a website to display my work as I looked for internships. 

This lead me to get a cloud engineering internship with a start up this spring. Since I pretty much skipped the web dev stepping stone and I'm getting experience directly in the field that I want to be in, I'm wondering if it's still worth it to keep the site up. I don't know how I'd display my work as a cloud engineer on the site anyway.

Firstly, I have pretty good amount of experience with with tech (i guess). I’ve made websites, an iOS app, videos, and animations. Also am 16. And was valedictorian. You’d think I know what I’m doing and have guidance but no. I don’t know what I’m doing.

I’m interested mostly in machine learning, but I hear that it’s more data science related? Should I change my major? I also plan on going to grad school.

I‘be heard that people who want jobs after getting their bachelors should apply to and get internships every summer. But, if you want to enter graduate school, it’s better to get involved in a research lab. How do you get involved in research labs? I asked a few people and they told me to talk to some of my professors to get advice. I’ve only taken 1 CS class so far and that professor literally doesn’t know anything about research labs.

Also, I don’t have any work experience. I have tons of volunteering and personal projects, but no work. Is that bad?

If there’s any other advice you have for me about what I should be doing at the moment, please let me know. Thank you!"

I also am an tutor at my university in CS courses. I’ve been applying to internships and jobs lately since I did get accepted into a grad program in data science, but would like to take a gap year so I can get professional experience. I’m leaning towards data science/ analytics but I know having software engineering skills is important.  

 I have done personal/research projects and courses in regards to data science but feel that I need experience. I have beefed up my resume and am getting responses back, some are internships and entry level jobs.

I guess my question is am I available to take on entry level jobs or internships since I’ll be taking a gap year? I feel like the idea of the gap year would be to get experience then go back for my master’s."
f988di,26,2020-02-25,"My internship search results as a freshman: ~200 applications, 4 interviews, 1 offer",bromeol,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f988di/my_internship_search_results_as_a_freshman_200/,"Hi r/cscareerquestions! I've been reading this sub a lot to learn from people's experiences during internship recruiting, so I figure I'd do my part as well. I just accepted an SWE intern role a few weeks ago, so here's an overview of my internship search.

**Stats:**

Applications: 206

Rejections/ghosts/no response yet: 205

Coding challenges: 4

Phone screens: 5

Interviews: 4

Offers: 1

[Sankey diagram](https://i.imgur.com/KvhI1KI.png)

**Offer:**

Company/Industry: Startup working with cloud computing

Title: Software Engineer Intern

Location: High CoL West Coast US city

Duration: 12 weeks

Salary: \~$40/hr

Relocation/Housing Stipend: none

**Background:**

* Freshman CS major at top 10 CS university in the US
* No previous internships/research positions
* 3 side projects in Python, \~150 Leetcode questions solved

**Before college:**

I never took any CS classes in high school, but I did have some basic knowledge in Java programming from a summer camp. I applied as a CS major for all my college apps, mostly because it sounded like an interesting subject with a lot of growth/opportunities career-wise. 

Around spring 2019, I started browsing subs like this one and r/csmajors to find out what I was getting into when I would start college in the fall. One big takeaway was the huge focus on summer SWE internships for CS majors, so I set out on maximizing my chances of getting one. I wasn't too worried if I failed, but I wanted to get some experience with coding before I entered college.

**Summer before college:**

I spent \~1-2 hours most days over summer learning Python programming, data structures/algorithms, working on side projects, and doing Leetcode. I didn't take any online courses in CS--instead I just did Leetcode problems and looked up whatever data structure/algorithm people used to solve the problem in the discussion boards. 

In hindsight, it would've been better to take a course to learn these concepts more methodically, but my strategy worked enough to where I grasped enough trees/graphs/DP/stacks/queues/Big O to solve most medium questions within \~25 minutes. I also learned some Python backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create a couple small CRUD web apps, which I hosted on AWS EC2.

**Key takeaways:**

Of course I'm just a freshman so take this with a grain of salt, but here are some lessons I've noticed:

* **Focus heavily on your school's career fair and smaller, local companies.** Quite literally every single phone screen/interview I got was from a company that was either 1) holding interviews at my school 2) attended my school's career fair 3) was located in the same city as my school. I strongly feel that almost all big companies in other cities will immediately toss your resume if you're a freshman (excluding freshman-specific programs). Definitely attend your school's career fair and talk to as many companies as possible. Even if you don't get an internship from it, it's still good to get experience talking to recruiters/engineers.
* **Apply to as many places as possible, as soon as possible, even if you feel like you're under-qualified.** It only takes 1-2 minutes to apply somewhere, so there's no reason not too. In the beginning I mostly applied to companies off of this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/elaine-zheng/summer2020internships). After I exhausted a lot of the companies there, I regularly checked LinkedIn/Handshake/AngelList/etc to apply for more. The critical window to send in apps is *Aug.-Sept.*, when most applications open up for big companies.
* **It's difficult to break into FAANG/Big N, even for their freshman programs, but still try anyways.** Anecdotally, everyone who got the Microsoft explorer internship was previously a HS intern. Nobody I know heard back from Amazon. Some people did score interviews at FAANG/Big N for their regular SWE internships, but very few of them managed to get an offer. In the end, basically everyone who got internships from big, ""popular"" tech firms did it through their freshmen program. Even for these freshman programs (FBU, Google STEP mainly), the vast majority of people got rejected.
* **Apply to CS-related events (hackathons, coding competitions, etc).** Of course this depends on you, but if you have extra time and are interested, keep an eye out for applications to various hackathons and competitions. I attended my own school's hackathon and applied to a bunch of others. A surprising number of them actually gave out travel reimbursements or official bus rides, so it wasn't too expensive to attend. These events gave me a lot to talk about during interviews, which helped offset my lack of experience. 
* **Don't be worried about landing an internship as a freshman.** It's really not a big deal and while it is nice if you can get one, it doesn't determine how smart or skilled you are. Anecdotally, a lot of people in my cohort who I would consider to be extremely intelligent don't have an internship yet. Honestly there's just so much luck/randomness/social connections involved, especially for freshman internships, that it doesn't say anything about your abilities.

Thanks for reading my post, and if you have questions, feel free to DM me or reply to this thread."
f98vfc,64,2020-02-25,How do I confidently know that I am ready for an internship?,pennayz,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/f98vfc/how_do_i_confidently_know_that_i_am_ready_for_an/,"Hey guys, I am a third year computer science student and right now I have been feeling really confused and scared because everyone is trying to get an internship and I am trying as well. The problem is that I'm not sure if I am ready because in all honesty I don't think I can code that well or code at all properly. Within the three years, I had a lot of help from my friends that I felt like I didn't really do much at all. I can code some applications in command line and such and that's basically the extent of it. I have been trying to build a personal project to self improve my coding abilities but I'm always finding myself watching a bunch of YouTube tutorials or follow along videos that build something for you. I fell like if I don't have someone building it or guiding it for me that I can't do it alone. Its like I can't code from scratch or don't know how to. Does this mean I'm no where close to ready to get my first internship?"

I'm a 3rd year college student studying computer engineering. My parents have been giving me money every month so I can take care of myself. I kinda now want to start being independent, I applied for many internships but all of them require me to be free for at least 3 days a week. Unfortunately my university schedule only gives me one day free, which is Monday. So I thought I could find some jobs that I can do online. 

P.S. - I used to do private tutoring in physics and maths last year. But there were complications in that job. I would love to private tutor someone again. Used to do it in my high school as well."

It took almost a year and a half of working hard  at various internships, just trying to build enough experience in my  field (communications) so I could get a relevant gig and be content. I thought I  finally landed it with this position which comes complete with generous  benefits and a decent pay.

Yet,  here I am, less than half a year later, unhappy and probably on the  verge of termination. I had a difficult transition at first, which was honestly my fault. I fixed a lot of my problems though and I thought I would begin to stabilize. However, I'm still having trouble with mundane yet detail oriented tasks like data entry, data reporting, and  sometimes just remembering procedure.

This  isn't helped by a number of factors such as 1) my days are split between two different jobs in two different departments 2) I'm not doing what I thought I would be doing, causing me a fair bit of  dissatisfaction and 3) I'm on the autism spectrum, which makes doing my  job all the harder when one or both departments become super busy, which can easily overwhelm me.

Yesterday I think both my employers and I have reach our respective breaking points when I forgot to create some duplicates of checks before submitting them to finance for deposit. As a result, one of my bosses  expressed her frustration to me which is worsened by the fact that I'm already on thin ice. Meanwhile I'm tired of trying to save a job where a seemingly minor mistake can seriously bite me in the ass and make me  question my self-worth.

I  honestly want to quit and even typed up a resignation letter. Yet I  don't know where to go and I'm wondering if I'm even cut out for an office job in the first place. I feel like I don't know where I belong  anymore. I have roughly 5K saved up, a bachelor's degree, and live in DC  as cheaply as possible and without any outstanding debt. Any advice  would be appreciated, please."

Disclaimer: I'm an introvert who doesn't find easy to find the words and English is not my first language, so there's that too. I'll try my best.

I'm an 20yo intern in a country which I still don't speak the language of (it's very difficult, and I can't afford a course. But I'm trying with the free onlines).
My future is unsure, but I'm hopeful.
It's always been difficult for me to find someone to talk to, heart open, and I've been trying to be more kind to myself only in these last few years. But it seems I don't find easy to trust people, and this is my first time opening up completely.

Here's my biggest issue: I'm starting to feel the need to explore this new life, getting myself in the dating scenario, meeting people, but I'm very afraid.
I don't know if I should even consider dating: I think it would be just a waste of time for them since I'd probably change my mind for my fear of commitment. Kinda digging the idea to live in the woods alone.

But before all that, I don't know how to find friends with my same interests, I've never had the opportunity to become a social person because of my family situation (yeah I've got that too) and I've always been a quiet and shy person.

I don't know what I'm looking advice for, really. I'm very confused, I feel like stuck by something. At the same time, I feel like I'm wasting my 20s.

I've been seeking therapy, but it's so difficult when you are alone in a different country. I can't afford it, and it makes me so sad. I've tried those free ""therapy"" apps but the thought of talking with a stranger about me in a chat frightens me. 

I don't know what to do, I find no solution if not waiting for something better to happen. A miracle.

But as the euphoria settles I start to get overwhelmed by, well, everything.

I made some small progams but now I have to go from ""Hello World""-programs to big company code and I don't exactly know how to make the transition.

So my question to you guys is, if you have any advice on how to tackle some of these points:

* Can't see the forest for the trees - How can I familiarize myself with the code? I mean, my programs where always rather small and I wrote them all, so I know them more or less, but here I don't know where to start. Do you guys have any strategy or advice how to untangle the code?
* Debugging - In my small programs it was always suffcient to print an output and debug the program this way, I don't think this is the way to go in a big project. Do you have any good ressource on debugging? (Videos, books, etc?)
* We have something like a 'godfather' program, so someone who already worked there is my godfather and helps me... Now the thing is, I don't want to annoy this person with stupid questions and I don't want to keep him from working when he has to solve some stupid problem I have. So what do you guys think is the best way to work with my godfather? 

These are my big questions I have and sure there will come many more, but if you could help me a little bit with some of them I would appreciate it very much!

f9g4e0,13,2020-02-25,Leave MSP internship for Full Time Tech Support Analyst Job?,ZurgRushIT,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/f9g4e0/leave_msp_internship_for_full_time_tech_support/,"Hello everyone,

I am a 25 year old who has recently started an IT career . After receiving my A+ certification (no degree), I was able to land an internship at a small MSP on the service desk making minimum wage. I have been working there for almost two months. So far it's been a pretty good experience. I work 24 hours a week under what I would consider good management (willing to answer questions, understanding of my technical limitations as I am still extremely green in IT). Mainly I respond to client calls/emails and create tickets, and resolve various low level issues (Outlook not working, graphical issues, password resets, email group creation). I also monitor our RMM software and have begun creating documentation for various company processes, and I will be going onsite soon where my manager will show me the basic network layout of an enterprise business, and I will start to be involved with installation of network equipment. Some days I have plenty of downtime (gets very boring and I usually study for my Net+ during these hours), and others I am on the phone with several users for more than an hour. Overall, I feel like I am learning. However, I also feel that an offer for a full-time job at this company is contingent on me finishing college (I have about 3 years left SMH).

However, at 25 years old with an aging mother I am becoming increasingly aware of the fact that I will not be able to be supported by her (I live with her, she pays bills/groceries, helps with tuition using her pension) for the rest of my life. I feel that ASAP is the best time for me to starting taking opportunities to make the most money I can now to be able to be completely financially independent, which for me would mean having a full-time job with benefits. Seeing as I'm in IT now, I plan on achieving this by moving up the ladder as fast as I can.

A friend of mine who works on Wall Street recently found out that I now have IT experience, my A+, and that I plan on getting more certs in the near future. He asked for my resume. A few days after he informed me of a job opening for a Technical Support Analyst at his job. Description is as follows:

"" **The Technical Support Analyst is responsible for ensuring that all hardware platforms, operating systems, utilities, and devices are available to successfully maintain service levels. This individual analyzes and evaluates all system malfunctions and takes appropriate action. This includes actively resolving escalated end user help requests within established SLAs. Problem resolution may involve the use of diagnostic and help request tracking tools, as well as require that the individual give in-person, hands-on help at the desktop level. This individual also specializes in one or more areas, including support center/technology support, networking, telecommunications and help desk. They can also act as backup for Help Desk Support, as needed.** ""

It's an opportunity for a full time job in IT. Would it be wise to even entertain pursuing this position? I'm trying to take into account my own personal goals (starting a full-time career ASAP within the realm of IT). Also, it didn't seem to concern my friend that I've only had this internship for over two months after reviewing my resume, but I would feel a bit odd if I left that quick. If I were to successfully interview and land this position, though, would that be better than staying at this current internship?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Service desk intern for 2 months at good MSP, but friend is advertising a full-time tech support position to me. Full-time IT career with intention to move up career ladder/gain financial independence ASAP is my main goal.  Should I pursue interviewing for this position?"

f9h5pd,1,2020-02-25,"Double major Math/CS and graduate on-time, or major in CS minor in Math and graduate early or study abroad?",KIM_JONG_DONG_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9h5pd/double_major_mathcs_and_graduate_ontime_or_major/,"Hello everyone,

Currently I am a sophomore at a pretty good state university on the east coast. My GPA is 3.64. I am in kind of a weird position. I came in wanting to be an econ/math major because I wanted to be an economist. But then I found out that a lot of the econ theory seems kind of questionable and ML models seem to do a better job of predicting economic growth than economists. So I became kinda disillusioned with econ.

I've been into computers ever since I was a kid, and I had gotten involved in research where I did a bit of coding and data analysis, so I decided to take intro to CS and data structures to get a feel for it. I decided I really liked programming, and looking at glassdoor SWE salary estimates, my previous desire to go to grad school and get a PhD in Econ kinda flew out the window. So today, I am pretty certain I want to major in CS with minors in Econ and Math (or maybe major?). I have an Econ minor already completed, and a couple classes left in my math minor, which can be completed by taking a couple of electives that will double-count towards CS.

So, my question is should I go back to my original plan of getting a Math major and just do it alongside CS? Since all my gen-ed is pretty much done this means 4 more semesters of 4 Math/CS classes. Possible benefits could be better preparation for an ML job, which seems a bit more interesting than a traditional SWE job, with maybe a bit more long-term job security. Plus, a lot of my friends are doing CS/Math double major.

Alternatively I could keep the Math as a minor. I could then graduate a semester early and take only 3 CS classes a semester and basically nothing else. Benefits are I could maybe study abroad last semester, or start working sooner and getting paid. Plus, I think I'm comfortable with Math but I'm not that into it, so not having to take more math classes could be a good thing.

Or if I really went ham and did 4 or 5 CS classes a semester I could finish the rest of my course work in only 2 more semesters. But I think that would force me into applying for full-time positions without really having a SWE internship, which could be a lot tougher. So I am not really considering that.

Also I should add that there is almost no out-of-pocket cost for me, as long as I stay in school &lt;5 years (not an issue for me), because I have a $13k/yr. scholarship and tuition reimbursement because my parents work at my university. Being an ex-econ major I am still worried about opportunity cost. Graduating a semester earlier could give me a few months of way more $$ than I could make from my scholarship, or the alternative, a semester abroad could be more valuable/enjoyable than studying more math.

Also I'm thinking that if I want to do ML I should do the online MS from Georgia Tech. 

I realize there is a lot to unpack here. But, I'm struggling to weigh all these pros and cons on my own so any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Trying to decide between CS/Math double major and CS major/Math minor. Former requires 4 more semesters of 4 CS and Math classes each. Latter only requires 3 CS and Math classes for 3 semesters. Cost not a big issue."

What can I do?",transferStudent2018,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9hrbe/junior_in_college_no_summer_internship_yet_what/,"I’ve applied to around 40ish companies (which I know isn’t a lot compared to many on this sub) and I am here at the end of February without a plan for the summer. My resume is good (at least structurally, I have no relevant experience besides class projects) but I’ve only ever gotten an interview from Amazon (who sends it out to everyone) and I didn’t make it past OA2. 

I think the most limiting factor might be that I want to work in my home city, Boston, but I go to school in Chicago, so there’s not many connections back home for me. Plus, Boston places have no real reason to look any further than MIT, Northeastern, etc. for student interns. I would be willing to look at other places in the northeast but it would require me to find housing, and I also don’t have a car, so I’d need to be in a place with public transportation. 

Im just wondering what can I do at this point to try and be doing *something* this summer in CS? I have to get a job, I can’t just independently develop an app or something as my parents wouldn’t let me. I’ve applied to every job on Handshake and LinkedIn with the tag internship and something revolving computer science/software engineering/software developer in the Boston area... and I’m all out of ideas."
f9i2q7,470,2020-02-25,My Success Story,lifebykimchi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9i2q7/my_success_story/,"Hi Reddit! I’ve seen this style of post lately and when I was neck deep in job applications it was super helpful to read everyone’s success stories. It gets so awfully bleak sending out app after app but it does pan out in the end. So I hope this will inspire some of you guys! I also just really felt like sharing since I’m so happy to be done with this shit job hunt. Also, I apologize for it being so long. 

I \[22F\] graduated in August 2019 with my BS in Computer Science and minors in both linguistics and German. I took summer courses every year so I didn’t really have the opportunity to intern at any point while I was in school. I honestly had no idea that this was somewhat of a necessity until I started the job application process.   
 

Well started applying for jobs soon after graduation. I actually got my very first phone interview from my 27th application sent out. I passed it. I was thinking at the time that I was getting quite lucky and thought my job hunt was going to be a lot easier than everyone else’s. I moved on to the technical interview… this was my first taste of actually realizing I needed to continuously improve on what I had learned during school. I completely bombed it. I started studying every aspect of my degree I could possibly think up in order to prepare for these technical interviews. Finally got through to an on-site at a company located about 2 hours from me at my 49th application. Long story short: I got the job offer for about $65K. However, at the exact same time, I was also offered a 3-month unpaid and fulltime internship position as a graphic designer and web developer. Probably the vast majority of you would think I’m crazy, but I took the internship instead. There was something super depressing about the other job offer that made me feel soulless when I walked away, and I just couldn’t imagine enjoying life working there.  
 

So I get this internship. I learn a lot. I learned I don’t really like web development. However, during this time I was also working hard on learning React and Angular in my spare time, which sparked my passion for frontend development and motivated me to pursue this specific job role. I continuously applied for jobs during my internship and even got a handful of phone screens and a couple of Skype interviews. Internship ends. Still no job offer in sight. Internship company promises to put in a good word for a couple big-names like Google and Facebook. Never hear back from them again…

2 months afterwards I finally start getting a rapid influx of response to my job applications. I had been preparing a little bit differently up to this point, working on Codility and learning React and a bit of Angular. I was doing coding challenges to keep abreast of my logic and problem solving skills. Finally, my 180th application I get a response from a company in Hamburg, Germany.   
 

Now, just as a quick background and a bit of a tangent, I’ve been speaking and learning German since I was in early elementary school and always kinda dreamed of moving to Germany when I was older. I didn’t really consider it as a possibility as a recent graduate until I realized that life was a little too short to not pursue goals early-on. So I started applying for jobs in both the USA and in Germany, hoping that it would widen my net.   
 

I actually remember talking to my parents and telling them that there was something about this job that felt right. Well my gut-feeling was spot on. I passed the remote coding challenge with 100%, passed the Skype pair-programming live technical coding interview, and passed 2 more interviews with HR and the founders of the company. Again, long story short, I got the job. So after a total of 193 applications sent out over the course of 6 months, I have finally landed my first full-time job and will be moving abroad in June 2020 to Germany."

SAT: 1570 (didn't take w essay)

SAT 2: Math 2 800, Chemistry 770

AP's: So far just Chemistry and Calc BC, 5's in both. This year I'm taking APUSH, AP German, AP Statistics, AP Physics 1, and mayyybe AP Physics 2.

Unweighted GPA: Our GPA system is weird but I think it's like 3.98-3.99. I think I've gotten one A- and everything else has been A's or A+'s.

Weighted GPA: Idk, but my courseload is as difficult as my school offers

Senior Year Course Load: Not sure yet, but probably something like Multivariable Calc, AP English Something, AP Psych, Advanced Anatomy, AP Bio (not taking a language course because I maxed out the levels our school offers), and then some electives for fun:)

Awards/distinctions: Nothing big nationally/internationally; A few National German Exam awards, Cross Country All-Conference (top 50 or something in the conference), Cross Country MVP, some MUN awards, a state-level scholar award, and I know I qualified for National Merit commended or whatever based on PSAT score. Idrk how/when Semifinalists are decided. Also scored high enough on some exam to represent my state's math team *(not as big a deal as it may sound, they take 45 people from throughout my somewhat small state)* at the regional or national(?) level ARML competition. And then generic stuff like High Honor Roll, All Academic, a few honors societies, etc.

*Also: I forgot to put this in earlier but my cross country/track teams have been conference champions multiple times and state champions twice. I was a competing member (ie, I counted in the scoring) on all those teams, but I'm not sure how much that would help my individual application...*

Extracurriculars- general feedback has been that they're kinda all over the place, but idk I just joined lots of things that I enjoyed. Here they are, in order of commitment and importance to me (leadership/achievements in parentheses):

* **Varsity cross country and track** (Captain for both)- as I've mentioned, I've gotten a few awards through this, and my teams have done fairly well; by far my biggest time commitment
* **Chamber Choir** (auditioned ensemble; I've made the regional and all-state choir every year; our choir has been invited to perform at a few national-level concerts, represent our state, and some other pretty cool stuff)
* Part of a **student- and staff- elected group** that does all sorts of community service and organizes freshman orientation activities, as well as acts as a sort of student council for the whole student body
* **Math team** (Co-captain)- we're not bad, we won our league this year, qualified for New Englands every year, I haven't realllly kept track of exactly how well we've done over the years though... oops
* **Leos Club**\- community service
* **Model UN** (a few awards, but not from well-known conferences)
* **Debate Club** (Helped to re-found it after it was disbanded, co-leader)
* **Science Olympiad** (A-team member, idk if that counts for anything since we only have 2 teams)
* **Other stuff that idk if I'll include:** Some honors societies, piano (got to Level 10 in the Royal Conservatory of Music system), family duties
* *Also:* I formed this online study group where members can create and share study materials with each other. I think there's about 60 people in it right now, and hundreds of review things... is there anywhere I could put this in a college app? It feels like a club (I've advertised it and kept it running), we just don't meet face-to-face

Job/Work experience: Not much; I pet-sit and babysit sometimes

Volunteer/community service: A variety through Leo's club; I tend to gravitate towards STEM activities for lil children though

Summer Activities: CTY for one year, a few academic camps at some colleges (including Harvard and BU, but these were pretty short, like 2 weeks-ish and mostly for fun), and several cross country camps; this summer I will hopefully be doing a research internship, provided COVID doesn't fuck *all* the shit up (more than it already has)

I can't really say how good my essays, letters of rec, or interviews are gonna be. My guidance counselor likes me but I'm not sure how great of a LOR writer he is, so that letter will probably be like a 6 or 7 out of 10. 

Intended major: Engineering? Biology? Not 100% sure yet

State: A New England one lol

School Type: Public, Medium/Large, Noncompetitive

Race/gender: Asian female

Hooks: Zero, zilch, nada

I have experience in Python, Java, SQL, PHP, and Android Studio. I'm mostly looking for junior/entry level developer positions since they seem the most applicable to my skills.

I'll be honest I really don't think I'm that great of a job prospect. My gpa is only a 2.9, I'll qualify it by saying all my bad grades were in classes unrelated to my major, though understandably recruiters will probably still see that as me being lazy. I also haven't done any internships, just part time jobs unrelated to tech during the summer. From what I've read though your gpa and what you did in college really doesnt matter after your first job, so I'm really just trying to get my foot in the door anywhere that will let me.

I have no particular attachment to any location (beyond personally liking locations near the coast or with plenty of sun), and luckily my parents are willing to support me through my first job and have the resources to do so, so I've been heavily applying to mostly NYC and San Francisco since I figure those are the places with the most jobs available and thus highest demand for them. I'm beginning to wonder if thats a mistake though since obviously those locations attract the best talent from around the world as well. Are there cities beside them with plenty of open jobs but attract less competition that I should be looking at as well?

**tldr; Are there cities that would more likely hire a mediocre to poor tech job candidate then NYC or San Franciso?**"

There may be a few errors in this because I’ve typed it up on my phone, sorry in advance.

I’m looking for advice on my career, as I’ve recently graduated in May of 2019. I graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science. 

The way I got into technology is due to my high school which taught me the fundamentals of A+ and CCNA (I was never able to take the exam), which is how I got my internships. For A+ I was able to take apart computers and put them together, and for CCNA I mostly worked in Cisco Packet Tracer through NetAcad. My internships mostly revolved around Helpdesk, which is a total of about 8 months of experience since I only worked during the summer. 

I am currently a Junior IT Engineer, which mainly revolves around maintaining servers within our data center. The problem is I know I’ve done a huge jump between helpdesk and being on the server team. I would like to bridge the gap.

I feel I am lacking in other aspects since I wasn’t able to start from the beginning. I would like to become more well rounded and educate myself more on the server side. I would like to know what you all recommend for me to do in my free time to make up for it.

My second question is about networking (which this may be the wrong sub) I’ve been interested in getting my CCNA. I’m aware they are updating their exam but I keep getting told that software networking is the new big thing. How would I learn more about it to decide if that’s the route I would prefer?

My last question is if it’s worth it to get a Masters, and if I do which should I get? 

I know my post my seem all over the place but any help will be greatly appreciated :)"

But where are people where are self-learners and boot campers who want to transit into tech careers now? 

* How are general self-learning/Bootcamp coders compared to a traditional 4-year degree coder?
* Are there a lot of people giving up after trying too hard?
* What do they do if they cannot find a job in tech?
* Are they happy with their career now?
* Do they ever feel struggled or regret?

I'm asking these questions just out of curiosity, and no mean to offend. Because it took me 4 years to learn programming, lots of projects, LeetCode grinding, two internships, and 2 months of rigorous job searching to find a decent job. I just cannot imagine how people without a CS background can learn how to code in just within a few months via boot camp. How is it even possible for a person to learn all of those data structures, algorithms, system design, networking, database, and etc by themselves or by a Bootcamp?

I really admire software developer/engineer without CS degree. It must be a tremendous effort for them to find job in this extremely competitive industry."
f9kptl,3,2020-02-25,Got two internship offers and need help/advice,stowawaythrowaway9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9kptl/got_two_internship_offers_and_need_helpadvice/,"By some stroke of luck, I received two Summer internship offers. One is with the government, the other is with a private company based in California (but present in the US, Canada, India, ...). I am hesitating because I will complete a Bachelor's in computer science soon and am looking to secure employment upon graduation. I don't know if I will pursue grad school, but I am keeping my grades high in case I decide to apply. I am more worried about gaining industry experience at the moment.

The govt position is for software and data analysis for climate data. I would be writing scripts for data parsing and analysis. This is something I am familiar with from my school projects, and would easily be able to do and excel. I think I would still learn a fair bit, but I have been told that govt bureaucracy can get in the way of creating meaningful internship experiences. I've also heard that the govt is behind on new technologies, which hints to me that I will not be prepared for future employment in the industry. However, part of me is still biased and believes that govt experience looks good on a CV -- if anyone can confirm or deny, that would be great.

The other position is for QA Automation. I will also be doing some machine learning, although my title will not indicate it. This company makes servers and systems, as well as networking products. Now, I need to preface this paragraph by warning you, I have 0 background in computer networking -- I am a student who has only taken high-level programming and algorithms courses. They have decided to take me on board because I am ready to learn the fundamentals on my own before the internship begins in May. They were also very generous to insist on taking their time to train me. I am tempted by this offer because I will learn a lot about CS closer to the hardware. I'm afraid that I might have overestimated my abilities to learn networking on my own, and that I might not be able to reach this company's expectations. The risk of failure is great, but so is the opportunity to learn. 

I'm not sure what to pick, and the deadline for both offers is fast approaching. I want a job so bad, but I also want my experience to be fun and enjoyable (it might be too much to ask lol, beggars can't be choosers). Any advice and wisdom would be greatly appreciated, I hope to discuss with you all in the comments below!"
f9ksvg,1,2020-02-25,Should I work or keep on studying?,Dragon300400,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f9ksvg/should_i_work_or_keep_on_studying/,"Firstly, English isn't my native language, so sorry if there are any mistakes or if anything is unclear. Secondly, sorry for the long post, but thank you for deciding to read my story.

I'm currently 21 years old and have just completed a bachelor's degree in Business Administration in one of the best colleges in my country. Last July, when looking for internships, I decided that I want to fufill my childhood dream of studying computer engineering that I didn't manage to pursue when 17 due to personal issues at the time. I ended up with an internship in something that I thought that I didn't like and decided that I would take the remaining months till December to study for the entrance exams.

Long story short, I ended up liking a lot my work at the internship, but I didn't end up getting hired due to internal politics. I also ended up getting admitted to computer engineering at the college I wanted. However, at the time, I thought that I still wanted to work and I was applying for trainee positions at some very well known companies.

The semester at the college starts in February and I immediately take to the course like a duck to water. I'm seriously in love with the subjects and enjoying it vastly more than the BA degree I had just completed. However, friday I got the call that I got the job at one of the very well known companies that I had applied to.

The issue is that I don't know whether to give up studying and start building up my career now, or wait the 5 years it's going to take to graduate engineering to begin working again. I have till thursday morning to make the decision and I'm stuck.

Things to consider:

* The job pays very little compared to the market average and the hours are long, but the learning opportunities are very vast and it will look great on my resumé for the future
* Money for me is not an issue; I can support myself debt free whether I continue studying or decide to work
* The job is in an area that I'm not too fond of, but the type of work I'll do appears to be something I'm interested in (mathematical and statistical modelling for the financial sector)
* If I decide to pursue engineering, I'm going to be 26 when I graduate and will have to start building my career only in 5 years time, as the college doesn't allow students to work whilst studying, and I'm worried that this will be too late to begin my career and manage to scale a company (one of my life goals is to reach the same living standards that my father managed to give me, which would require a lot of ascension in a company)
* I really wanna work with data manipulation and business intelligence and whilst it is possible to work in the area with a BA degree, it's much easier to do so with a computer engineering degree and it pays much better too.

My parents are ok with whatever I choose, but I'm just worried about the missed opportunity of not taking the job offer or if I'm going to be happier, but guiltier, pursing the engineering degree.

Please help me. What should I choose?

Thanks for reading."
f9m00l,0,2020-02-25,Having second thoughts.,WhereIsTheTilda,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9m00l/having_second_thoughts/,"Currently am a sophomore in University, and like many of you, am studying CS. Right now I am about halfway through my second semester, and I can't help but have second thoughts on where I'm at. My first year at college was probably the easiest year if my life. 

First semester I didn't have a comp sci class yet, but I breezed through all my classes and got all A's. Second semester I started my first comp sci class in C++ and began calc 1 which I had my doubts about. Breezed through that and once again got all A's.

Sweet first year done, 4.0 GPA. Barely broke a sweat. Over the summer I get an interview for an IT internship at my college. Which I pass. Great, got a decent paying job that gives me some good technical experience for my next year. 

Start of my first semester of my second year and I am this time taking the next c++ class where we learn aspects of OOP, as well as a discrete math class with a focus on comp sci. Also calc 2. Second C++ was great, harder than the previous but I learned tons. Discrete math I barely understood but my professor made it all easy. Calc 2 I had an amazing teacher and the class went by with a breeze. Internship is going great as well.

Now, come to where I am at now and I can't help but think I'm making a mistake. Classes I took are computer Ethics, intro to algorithm analysis, Java, and calc 3. And currently all these are going to shit. So far, I essentially failed the first tests in all these classes. I don't even know how I did bad on the ethics one, it's supposed to be an easy A. Java seems like my previous programming classes just in Java instead of c++ but somehow I'm not doing great there either. Calc, although getting better, I have no fucking clue how I'm doing because I need an update on my grade. Somehow, the hardest class, algorithm analysis, I might be doing decent in. But after how I did on these first few tests I can't help but think I bombed that one too, nuking my grade. 

I also was lucky enough to get assigned a web development position at my internship. Thought I'd do great considering it's a field I was seriously considering going into. But I am struggling to do some of the most basic shit there. I'm being tasked to implement some basic functionality with Laravel PHP and I can't get anything done without asking for help every hour. 

My first year and the beginning of this was going great, felt like I was on track for a good career. Each semester was getting better and better, not just academically but also for work, and personal interests in the field. Now I feel like I hit a wall. Did I just luck out my first semesters? Is my combination of classes and work bad? Did I become too complacent or careless from past semesters? Burnt out? Idk... I was hoping things were gonna improve after working my ass off last week, but after getting this grade for my most recent test I just feel like utter shit again. I'm taking these classes with a couple friends and they don't seem to be doing anywhere near as bad. My advisors usually just throw advice that gets me through as quick as possible with little thought on how I will do. Hopefully you guys can give some advice?

f9m67g,0,2020-02-25,Graduating soon. Should I still apply to internship positions?,EclecticIntrovert,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9m67g/graduating_soon_should_i_still_apply_to/,"I should be graduating in August and am trying my best to get a full-time position in the US. Ideally I would like to end up in Chicago, but I've also applied to jobs in New York and throughout California. 

My previous experience includes the following. I had one internship at a political party in my state, doing full-stack software dev for them in Python. I also had a front-end mobile dev (both iOS and Android) position at a startup, using the Flutter framework to create the UI. 

I also have a couple personal projects under my belt, mainly written in Python. One was very successful and got recognized in OSINT and security blogs.

My strongest programming language by far is Python. I have some experience programming in C++, but I wouldn't say I'm super comfortable with the language yet. I would also like to have more experience creating something in a low-level language like Golang or Rust, but I'm still looking for project ideas.

I'm also taking the OSCP, an IT penetration testing course. If I pass the exam, I'll essentially be a certified ethical hacker.

I don't want to do mobile dev, but rather typical software dev, devops, or IT security. However I feel that my experience is still limited and no software company would want to hire someone with my background as a full-time employee. I'm also not graduating with a CS degree; I took a few CS classes in college: programming in Python, C++, and discrete math. Other than that, everything was self-taught. Which brings me to the title. 

At this point, should I still be applying to internships to get more experience before applying for a full-time job? Or should I only look for full-time jobs? Or maybe apply to internships if I'm unable to get any offers for full time jobs?"

I’m really really conflicted on what I want to do with my life. 

On one hand, there’s my art. I’m pretty good if I do say so myself, but the issue is is that I don’t really like the idea of going to an art school AGAIN right after high school. I’m basically gonna just relearn everything I’m learning now, so what’s the point? If I wanted a professional career relating to art, I literally have to go. Also, I want to make a lot of money, and it is very obvious that jobs related to art don’t make a lot. I was thinking that maybe Bc I live in such a modern and artistic city, I’d be able to find a high paying job related to art easily, but idk..

My other interest pertains to criminology and forensics psychology. Unfortunately, I’ve heard that these jobs can become depressing and make you quite mentally drained, even though I’m genuinely interested in this stuff. My other issue is that I have no idea how to get colleges interested in me when there’s not really any internships related to forensics (at least, I don’t think there are..)
Another issue is that I don’t exactly know what job I specifically want. I know it’s in the range of criminology, but I don’t know if I wanna be a forensic psychologist, autopsy reporter, a detective, etc. 

As you can see, I’m really lost. I’m so scattered and I’m running out of time to choose what I’m gonna end up doing for the rest of my life. If anyone has any advice, feel free to dm me or add some comments that’ll help.

GT or Case Western for AE,xylophone98,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f9nnkg/upset_at_georgia_tech_gt_or_case_western_for_ae/,"Hey guys so I got into both schools for aerospace engineering and I know GT is ranked very high for it. There's a small problem though. I kinda don't like it and I love case.
For some background, I take classes at tech now through dual enrollment. Don't get me wrong, I'm super greatful to have the opportunity. But I don't feel like I'd be happy living there for four years.
Don't get me wrong. I have some awesome friends there. I go to the sports games, I'm in a few clubs. So I do keep myself busy there. But the overall feel doesn't feel right for me. I don't feel like I'm what a tech student would be. Personality wise and everything. The competitive environment is probably one of the bigger turnoffs. And people there are kinda shut ins, imo.
On the other hand. There's case. I love the school and the atmosphere from several visits I've had. I'm not dissuaded by a ranking difference, but from what I know gt's AE program is objectively better in most ways. 
However. I want to go into grad school after I graduate. So a lot of the internships and coops are not what I'm looking for. And case has a stronger research focus.

So my question. Does the focus on research make up for the slightly worse program?"
f9nydk,1,2020-02-25,Choosing between an internship for a dream job and staying with my current employer,atpeach,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9nydk/choosing_between_an_internship_for_a_dream_job/,"I recently obtained my degree in CS and I'm currently working as a full stack dev. I have been applying for other jobs in the last few months because my pay is relatively low here compared to my peers. 

I applied to another company because of its impressive portfolio and their projects are things that I could only dream of taking part in. I was lucky enough to be given an interview at this company, but I unfortunately failed one part of the coding test. As some kind of consolation, they offered me an internship and was explicitly told that my pay would be low (as expected). I'm pretty interested in taking the offer since it's an opportunity to grow as a dev within that company, but it feels like a step back career-wise. A part of me is also very anxious about my financial stability and the idea that this internship would not be different if I instead took online courses and worked on my own projects.

I would love to hear some thoughts of what you would do if you were in this position. If you had been, what did you end up doing? 

**TL;DR should I take an internship for my dream job or should I just stay in my current role?**"
f9o9nq,46,2020-02-26,[IWantOut] 22M Canada -&gt; Western Europe,Specific-Light,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/f9o9nq/iwantout_22m_canada_western_europe/,"see below for considered options and tl;dr of my situation

22M from Ottawa, Canada, interested in moving to Western Europe. This includes both Scandinavia and southern Europe. I'm particularly interested in the UK, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden and Germany (in that order). In particular, I'm hoping to move to a country that allows dual citizenship, and would let me keep my Canadian citizenship (I couldn't give that up) - if I love the country and genuinely would want to be a part of it, I would sincerely want to be a citizen of that country.

I'm going to graduate from the University of Ottawa with a degree in political science. I'm fully aware that this is not an in-demand major (chose it because I originally wanted to do law school, which now I definitely don't want to do), so I'm hoping to do a second degree program in computer. There are a few 2-year second degree programs in computer science that I'm eyeing, but I'm concerned some countries won't consider it equivalent to a 4-year bachelors degree. The second degree programs are 2 year programs here because we've completed all our breadth requirements in the first bachelor's degree. Since my first degree was in Political Science, this would make me ineligible for almost all Master's programs in Europe since it wouldn't be consecutive.

I was originally considering Post-Baccalaureate programs (a 1-year post-degree CS certificate), but that likely is worthless for immigration programs. I'm also considering diploma programs because they're more accessible/have lower entrance requirements, but I'm concerned that some countries won't accept them (I know for the US TN visa, a diploma program is only eligible with 3 years of relevant work experience).

I've worked for the Canadian Federal Government for approximately 3 years through internships, casual contracts and part-time job (1 year out of the 3 was part-time). This was in policy, programs, and administrative in nature. I basically took 2 years off to work. 

In terms of real job skills, I don't have much. I have experience with STATA and policy analysis, but I'm well aware this isn't really all that useful when it comes to IWantOut. Again, I'm willing to learn.

I have about $15,000 USD saved, with no student loans at all. I'm able to take up to $30k USD in student loans right now, interest-free, if needed to study in Europe.

I only speak English. I'd love to learn French because it's the second language of Canada, and I would be willing to learn really any language, but I'm not ready for a undergrad in really any European university that isn't English speaking. 

As I see it, I have a few options:

* Do a second degree in CS, and apply for jobs in Europe. Of course, I need to double check whether each country considers a 2-year second degree program to be equivalent to a 4-year Bachelors degree.
* Do a Masters of Public Policy in Germany or France, or a Masters of Local Development in Italy. This wouldn't help me move there or land me a job after graduating, but I'd be able to live in Europe for a while and have something to show for it when I move back to Canada and find jobs locally. This is the path of least resistance, with the weakest returns.
* Do a CS degree in Ireland/UK. Too rich for my blood, it'll take a while to save up for that.
* Working holiday - in which I try to find a permanent job offer. Doesn't seem like it would pan out to be honest.
* Marry someone with an EU citizenship. Next to nil chances.
* Work for a company with intra-company transfers to the EU. Next to nil chances of immigrating in the next 10 years until my career is established.


tl;dr

* Canadian Citizen, English-speaking. Want to move to Western Europe (UK, Ireland, Sweden, Portugal, Germany, etc.)
* Worked for Federal Government of Canada for 3 years, no in-demand real job skills.
* Graduating with political science degree (yes, I know, and I agree), interested in European Masters of Public Policy or Canadian Second degree in computer science (or a cheap second degree elsewhere).
* Budget: $15,000 USD. Can access $30-35k USD in student loans. Am working on saving up more.
* Would like to pursue citizenship, but am also okay with just a brief stint in Europe."
f9oinh,0,2020-02-26,Internships before college?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9oinh/internships_before_college/,"Okay I’m a current high school senior. I will start college in the fall. So anyway I want to try and get an internship in the next few months (doesn’t need to be anything great, just some experience so I can get a paid one during my summer break in college). I live in India and will be attending a university in US. I have a fair bit of programming experience over a lot of languages and python frameworks. I’ve built an app, multiple websites, and a lot of random projects. I’ve also managed to find some internships on LinkedIn but they all require a CS degree (closest I found was that required applicant to be pursuing CS so I applied)

Anyways, how can I get more internships (if at all)? Would it be worth it applying for ones that required the applicant to be enrolled in a university or have a degree if I meet or exceed the requirements?"

Is this job hurting me in any way?  It's basically blocking my ability to apply for internships, which bums me out.

I've probably applied to over 100 internships at this point for this last summer before graduation but have never received anything back. I'm starting to get stressed because most people I've talked to have told me I might as well have not gone to college at all if I don't have several internships by the time I graduate and that I might as well prepare to be permanently jobless.

f9rr7x,1,2020-02-26,Does the grad school rank really matter to companies?,ProfuseGloom,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/f9rr7x/does_the_grad_school_rank_really_matter_to/,"I got an admit to University of Buffalo for MS in Computer Science for Fall 2020. Using USNews as a reference, this University ranks at 61. I am still waiting for 3 more applications, 49 - Northeastern and BU and 43 - University of Arizona. 

Firstly, my profile isn't all that great hence I should be lucky to get accepted to UB. Secondly, I still plan on improving my profile for a year and apply for better Universities in Fall 2021 but I haven't yet given much thought about it hence this is a risky move as well.
Lastly, I'm worried about the job scenario since I plan on working post MS and Buffalo being in upstate New York, I'm told that companies are scarce outside big cities. I would certainly want to look for Summer Internships in 2021 as well.

This is a big decision for me, since it involves lot of money hence I'm to decide whether to proceed with what I have and not get too greedy or trust my ambition [My personal opinion is that a better ranked University is good for resume]. I hope I'm wrong about prioritising Grad School ranks. 
As far as my grad school research is concerned, Buffalo is a good city to live in apart from Winters, it's a well reputed University in the Computer Science industry and the courses offered are difficult but would really reflect well on the resume. This University is also not too expensive compared to private schools hence it's affordable.

So what do you guys think? Should I accept this admission or should I wait for a year? I've put my decision on hold for the moment to wait for other results so fingers crossed for that."
f9secr,0,2020-02-26,"I Want To Leave My Current Company, But I Haven't Received An Offer I'm Looking For",Shirohige6969,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/f9secr/i_want_to_leave_my_current_company_but_i_havent/,"So, I very much dislike my current job. Just as an example, I got super pissed at my tech lead yesterday because of the high levels of redundancy in our process that decreased our efficiency by a wide margin. Of course, this happens right after a manager is like ""Get all this work closed in 2 hours, thank you."" This is just one example, there are several other reasons and I'll answer more of that in the comments. I've been at this job for nearly 3 years, half of which I was an intern. I've also been looking for a new job for almost a year now. I've had a decent number of interviews, a couple of opportunities fall through, recruiters being assholes, and a single offer that I flatout declined due to too many similarities to my current work place. 

After the long search, I finally got an offer for a company that I was actually somewhat excited to work for, until I looked at the offer and benefits package. All of the benefits are a downgrade from my current workplace and the salary is essentially identical. In addition to this, I'm up for a potential promotion at my current work place, so there is also a lot of lost potential there too. As well as needing to stay three years, to get to keep the matching. In addition to this, the recruiter for this offer actually asked upfront how much I was wanting to make and they lowballed. I gave them a range, and they went below the minimum value in the range by about 7%. 

The main benefit is that I'd probably enjoy the work a lot more as I'm currently having to use C at my current workplace with barely any useful documentation, due to the nature of my work. This new place I'd be using a higher level language, like Java, for my work as well as gaining other skills due to new projects. Now, the reason I'm struggling to decide is I'm definitely not learning the required skills at my current workplace to be more relevant at the kind of company I'm looking for. This has been so much so of a problem that I nearly handed in my resignation a year ago, so I could learn those skills on my own and dedicate more solid periods of time to my job search at the same time. I decided against it, due to the advice of several people, but I was still extremely close, like I had my resignation printed and a meeting to hand it to my manager before my decision changed. I still have the letter under my keyboard, which give me a sense of a way out and in that way it is comforting.

Another factor to consider is that I should be hearing back from a recent interview rather shortly, I have another interview next week, and my current workplace will actually be getting another project soon where we'll be using a language I'm much more comfortable with. It's been my experience that no matter how well you think you'll match somewhere, there is not an offer on the table until you have an offer letter in your inbox.

Should I cut my losses at my current job and accept the offer, stay at my current work place for now, or something else entirely that I'm not even considering?

Note: If you have any questions, I'll answer them as I notice them."

I'm a college masters student looking for advice to achieve my career goals. My dream is a C-suite position either as a CISO/CSO, CIO or CTO. I have talked with many of my professors who think I would be a good fit for a position like that (Many of them currently hold these types of positions). I just want to hear your guys advice as to whether I am on the right track or should I be doing something differently? 

Schooling: I'm a first year masters student working toward my MBA (Concentration in Cybersecurity) and my MS in Cybersecurity. I graduated this past spring with a BS in Comp Sci and a minor in mathematics and will graduate in spring 2021. 

Future work experience: Will intern as secure software development intern at very large company this coming summer. 

Current Work Experience: 

- Software developer Intern (past summer) and now part time during semesters for small company.
 
- Graduate Assistant / Teaching Assistant teaching intro to databases to undergrads

Past Work Experience: Interned at state government as software developer intern &amp; part time during the year, IT support during high school and early college summers. 

With all of this in mind, do you guys think I'm doing the right things or is there something I should be doing that I'm not? Additionally, what should my target salary be for when I graduate? For context, my salaries as an intern have been (12$/hour 2018, 20$/hour summer 2019, 36$/hour summer 2020) and I live in a MCOL city.

I'm open to any and all suggestions and I really appreciate the advice. Thank you guys!"

I am mostly trying to get into Software Engineering/Web Development or Data Analysis.

Is it worth it applying to IT based roles? There are a lot of internships where the job description has no coding, just pure IT stuff like setting up computers and routers. Will that actually add value to my resume?

On average, how long does a job that is interested in you take to respond?

Are cover letters important? Are you guys using cover letters for most/all of your applications?

Is it a good idea to apply to positions where you are not qualified for? Some internships already ask for previous internship experience or for you to have graduated already or to know a specific language/framework."

For reasons I don't want to discuss, I regret becoming a contractor. I love the company but I hate my specific situation. I'm not learning, I hate most of the people I work with and I don't take any pride in the work I do. Having networked heavily with this company, I am confident that there are solid roles out there for me. 

I can apply for permanent full time roles at this company and leave my role upon receiving an offer, however if I were to apply then my managers would be contacted first. They would need to give a thumbs up for any hiring process to proceed. I'm not even sure if these managers even know my name honestly. They seem like nice people but I'm hesitant to have a discussion about leaving. 

I work closely with the lead developers and the people from my contracting company. I do not think they would be very supportive of my leaving the team. I'm pretty sure if I apply the managers will just talk to the people I work with and I expect them to react negatively. I don't have a bad relationship with people I work with but I'm afraid that if I tell them I'm looking to leave I'll get stuck in a toxic situation. 

Current plan is to ask one of the managers for a one-on-one and explain my situation but I have massive doubts about this plan. I am confident that I have a good reason for leaving but I want to avoid a toxic situation. Any advice??"

At  the meantime, I'm split between trying to just enter IT/Learning to  code. I'm struggling, and im losing the motivation to learn, as I find  it very difficult to find a path. I applied for an amazon internship  which would guarantee me an IT job but it turns out it wasn't what I  expected it to be, and the progression isnt that great so I'm thinking  what else can I do? I'd rather just pursue my passions than to follow a  dead lead which doesn't pay great.

this  is a long post and i understand if many people don't read this, i dont  have anyone to talk to but I'd appreciate any advice/response :)"

The biggest thing is that my dad is currently in ICU back home, this is obviously stressing me out, especially since I’m about far away. Both my parents have had health problems, and I’m starting to question my decision to be far away, especially because there’s a perfectly good school 20 minutes from our house. 

I basically went to the school that I’m at, because I was convinced that this school would set up my future. I’m a journalism student and the journalism school here is really good, mostly because of it’s connections with a large media company. There were much cheaper schools that I could have gone to, or stayed in state, but I thought the cost would be worth it if I could get some good internships or maybe a job through this school and company. Well, those internships only come when you’re really good. And I don’t think I’m really good yet. Whenever I visited I always knew in the back of my mind that the school was too good for me. All the times I visited or met people in the J school, I always thought they were much smarter than me. And recently when I thought I turned in a great story with great sources I got a 79. 

There were also a couple of things that I enjoyed here. I got to announce a couple football and basketball games on the radio, I wrote a couple things for a satirical publication, I’ve had a few cool classes, and I met some nice people. But I never felt truly happy, or that I had any real friends. I don’t even really talk to my roommate. I felt content and maybe proud at points, but never truly happy. The thing I’m trying to say is: if I’m not truly happy and not 100% convinced that this school will get me where I want to be, than why I am I here while my family is struggling?

I don’t know the answer, and I don’t know what I’m going to do next, I just felt like writing this out."

I work as an intern in IT. I do network support. I have IT certifications A+, Network+, CCENT just got my CCNA. I will have my bachelor's degree in information systems in several months. I make 15 an hour. The thing is someone offered me a job from a different department. 

31 dollars an hour. I was very surprised. I told him I don't qualify because I dont have my bachelor's yet, he said he would waive that requirement and train me. The only problem is it's not an IT job it's a SCADA job where I would program PLCs and stuff. It's related but it's not really IT. 31 an hour with benefits and a pension and its hourly so he said I can get overtime. 

I feel like it's a great opportunity to learn new skills but I feel like if I wait till I get my degree with my certifications I could get an network administrator job pay the same or maybe even more.

Mainly I just want someone to tell me I'll be alright and like talk/write this out.  I feel lost in a vast sea of thoughts,worries, and choices right now. I've never had a job yet. Just been going to college. I'm figuring out what I should be putting my time and energy into. I don't want to have a job and then want to go into something else but then it's difficult due to constraints by then, money,time,etc. I would like to explore well now, know my options before I dedicate significant amounts of time and money.

What I want is a steady income. One that's enough for cost of living and building up a good amount of savings. Sitting at a desk for work, doing routine/repetitive stuff, solving problems, and knowing how to communicate well is good with me. So something involving working in the tech industry sounds good to me.

I think I'm just feeling overwhelmed. I don't want to waste time. I'd like to work sooner than later.

What I'm thinking is to just go into like a helpdesk job. Some kind of entry job so I can start working soon. And maybe move up in that company. And continue to learn, search and connect online and in person. I can see what my community college has to offer as one of the things I can do. I remembered another thing I can do; I can observe, shadow, intern, something like that,  people's job.  Going to have to look into that more."

So for the past several months, I've been trying different strategies of trying to find an entry-level job and start my career in the Digital Marketing and Social Media field. At first, I wasn't even landing any inquires or phone interviews back to me, but I started trying to be innovative and experiment with different methods to try to get employers' attention (Curating resumes to match ATS keywords, networking on LinkedIn with recruiters or Sr. staff, etc). 

Luckily, things seemed to start working as I started slowly getting hits the past month or two and had the opportunity to land many on-site interviews. But unfortunately, I ended up getting rejected from every position I really wanted. It crushed my self-esteem and started questioning that maybe this field wasn't cut for me in the first place. I had multiple internships and part-time experience doing work with Social Media and Content Creation, and I thought that would have been enough to land a relevant job tied in with my prior experience. Even with polishing my interview skills and body language by researching methods and the best questions to ask didn't help, which was disappointing. I was wondering how recent grads were able to land these jobs in their ideal field right away without much prior experience. 

I ended up accepting a job working as Sales Support within the Operations Department at a local tech firm just to get my foot in the door. Even though I'm happy I'm no longer unemployed, I know from the bottom of my heart that I would have succeeded and gone above and beyond working with marketing and digital media at a company I really desired to be apart of. 

I'm currently focusing on getting ready for my new job, but I'm just open to suggestions from the people of r/jobs to see how I could potentially map out my goals to finally get into that field soon. What do you guys suggest I do in the next year or two to make my dreams finally happen? What skills would I need to make a strong impression on employers and get that job I want?"

I do know how to troubleshoot, since that's all I did in the Navy, but that was mostly for electrical equipment. I do troubleshoot and work on computers but on my personal time. I did get to work as a help desk tech for 6 months about 10 years ago before I went to bootcamp.  

I'm graduating in October and haven't had luck with internships (due to my location and possibly the amount of work history I have). I know I need one of these three certs to get a foot in the door, possibly with a help desk job, so I started to study for A+. I even bought a voucher a year ahead to prep myself. 

I was halfway through studying for A+ 1001 when I got told to switch to Sec+ by someone in the field. At first it seemed to make sense to me. But after reading everyone's posts and stories, I'm starting to doubt my decision. It also doesn't help that you can't use the voucher for a different exam. The A+ 1001 I got expires end of May this year.

I have materials for both A+ and Sec+ that were recommended by this subreddit. I skipped Net+ for now because I would need more time to study this than the conventional amount of 3 months. But now it seems like even getting Net+ first would be a better idea than Sec+ because of the overlap. I would just have to bite the bullet if I have to take Net+ first. But then everyone also says that A+ is what employers look for. 

I'm genuinely confused on which one to start on. Any advice would help."

I could work McDonalds or fast food, but the money isn't a pressing issue and I feel like putting that on my resume would only hurt my chances at getting a solid entry level job.

it is my first post so i am really sorry if i make grammar error or not write this good enough.

im a 27 male SEA male living abroad outside my origin country.

the reason i am living abroad is because i went for an engineering degree abroad and i got a job (relatively) smoothly after i graduated and got my degree. i speak 3 languages so i don't really find difficulties in communicating on daily or work here.

i am quite satisfied with my school, degree and job but not life overall.

firstly, i don't really feel like going back home or meet my family because i realized my mother is too ""controlling"" of my life and tend to be toxic a lot of time. 

i grew up believing parents are all right no wrong and i once believe what my parents said to me until i got major heart broken after i got cheated by my 4 years ex in college years. little did i know, my mother once speak to my ex to ""leave me for other guy"" because of my mother think i am too selfish for relationship. i kinda sad by what my mother doing in that time, i need 2 years to get back to life and continue. that is actually my reason to change my life and alter my thoughts to be more mature and searching for other opportunity outside.

eventually, i got scholarship abroad and chance to do an internship in between my graduate school period. i once or twice visit my parents back home to tell them my progress and during that time i still believe and respect my parents.

until my mother is too crazy about my life and trying to manipulate (i guess?) my thinking into believe she was never wrong. my mother start to question about my religion (because my origin country is devoted to religion really seriously) and such. i was expecting my family to supportive about my progress is but all they ask me is...

&amp;#x200B;

""what if you die all sudden? should we cremate you or bury you?"" 

""if you don't believe in god, what chance you will find happiness?"" 

""if you don't do what we believe then you are not respecting family""...something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

i was kind of furious because all they care is about their thinking and not mine. i'm not a bad person, it just i believe more about life than 2000 year old book.

also during that time i had a gf for about some months. my family insisted me to ""marry"" and ""settle"" just because my family think ""you got the best thing in your life and i know you will screw this up again, so just listen to us""...eventually i broke up with my ex that time because it's not really a strong relationship and we're just different.

it made my family upset.

and then when i got recommendation for a job, i did inform my family about it and their respond was like ""look, why did you need to do all such thing? we aren't poor family, we have money so you don't really need to do your best and just come home""

i felt unappreciated. i felt really lonely. i felt that i was failure despite that my school was good and my prospect is bright.

since then i don't trust my family no more.

i did visit them to explain my plan, my future but all they said

&amp;#x200B;

""you don't care about family, you are really a selfish""

&amp;#x200B;

my family never came to visit me during my graduate school years, didn't really respond to my mail, didn't visit me on graduation day (because ""we busy planning your sister wedding"" thing)

plus, when i did spend my money preparing for work and settle to new place and i told them what i feel all these years, my father never reply to my mail and my mother responded me like ...

&amp;#x200B;

""that is because your are selfish and you are NOTHING"" ""why should we help you?""

&amp;#x200B;

since then i never talked to my family again. it's already 2 year passed since i blocked my entire family.

i felt really lonely and all alone here living abroad. my date life always screwed up, i feel like i don't have a home.

i needed someone to share my days but it doesn't happening recently.

what should i do?"

Please help, what should I do?",MGStitch,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fa60qc/sales_job_meeting_with_disappointed_boss_has/,"Hi there, this is gonna be a but long. I'll do a TLDR at the end.

so here I am after today's meeting feeling a bit motivated and a little bit confused on how to perceive this.

He basically made a whole story of his childhood telling us how his father showed him the ropes to be actively listening the situations, seeing, analysing and speaking when is good. He then spoke about kindness saying that he is giving more than many employers in term of vacations. We do have 5 weeks per year, but we are the construction business so we close at the same time they do. There is real money to be made during these times. 

But these week are not full paid for me I have to do overtime which is not even counted as 1.5 hours as it should be here in Canada. I do about 42.5 hours a week. I guess he ask we do a little bit overwork when need to, but the truth is I am not eager to do it in these condition and I postpone for tomorrow morning when I can.

Anyways, he proceeds to tell us the sales have dropped by about 5-15% these years and the part he is making effort went up by 80% which is parts where we basically had nothing before. Then says that if he wanted he could just sell the company and live very well but thats not what he desires. He wish to pursue development and tells us if he is gonna pursue this way he wants people who have the interest of the company at heart and that his kindness is about to run out. 

I've been there for about 1 year and a half by now, I am one of the newest and I am the youngest at 28 y/o.
I still don't know If this is really my place since there's things which ticks me off and I am usually a very creative person who doesnt like authority and I like to work at my pace. He kind of give me some of these liberties but I am tasked with things which doesn't really interest me. 

In winter there is no real interesting work it is all office work with no real client interactions for me.

He actually asked me if I wanted to be more on the administrative side and direct some people but I am doubting I should do it. Maybe because ists gonna be a hard challenge or just because theres many things I should negotiate If I do take this offer.

I won't lie, I did the job but I kind of slacked off out of motivation and wouldn't do more than I feel I am paid for. But this is changing because I wanted a raise.

He seems to want to integrate me and propel me up for years to come. Thing is I kinda got into this job saying I was planning to go to study and I have to straighten my budget up in order to achieve this goal.

This offer surely would give me some skills and more money than I have ever made. 

Sorry if this seems a mess but I am kind of in a crosspath in my life where I sense this decision could impact a lot. He has been is waiting for my answers for weeks and now must think I don't really consider his offer.

Can you help me?


TLDR: Boss offer me an job offer from Technical support and Intern representative to an administrative role to maybe general manager later. After a speech about his vision and how he actually ""lost money these last 2 years to pay our salary"" which gives me bad vibes and weirdly motivates me a bit. What should I do?

The only catch is that, for 3 months, this would be an unpaid internship position which could possibly develop into a full-time paid role.

My parents have emphasized to me that money is not an issue here, and they will help me out if I need it in regards to commuting (I've already been living at home since graduation, so not much is changing there). They don't know this, but it really bothers me to still be very dependent on them for income. I've been working basically since a month after graduating to earn some money and effectively show that I have been working to possible employers, but I would really like to make headway in starting my post-college life. I don't know what's normal for a 23-year-old in that regard. Some of my friends are already in jobs working with what they studied and are moving out and away, while another friend of mine joined me at my interim job and still lives at home as well.

I know the internship would provide valuable experience for me. The consulting gig could as well, and it could include more variety. I was never 100% sold on that position, but it would still be a job. I'd get paid a decent salary and be able to move out. However, who knows what technologies I would be developing skills in? Who knows if and when I would be placed somewhere, or if a placement leads to a full-time opportunity with that company? I'd be able to network pretty well in both positions.

My dad and step-mom want me to do what I want to do. They seemed to go pretty heavy on the internship side, but I think they just wanted me to consider it more seriously than I was. I know my mom will also support me in whatever I choose, but I got the impression that she was siding with the money-making opportunity.

Ultimately, this boils down to these questions: do I just need to get over myself? Do I need to be less concerned with immediately trying to forge my own path? I don't want to feel behind, but I don't want to trick myself into doing the wrong thing just because I would more quickly achieve these current goals."
fa76e0,90,2020-02-27,Someone suggested writing a letter to my AP... Here it is,Givemelove13,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/fa76e0/someone_suggested_writing_a_letter_to_my_ap_here/,"Disclaimer: this is insanely long. Was not expecting to write so much. But it felt really good to let it all out. 


I love you. Despite what you think of me. I care about you a lot and I do care what happens to you and how you feel. But I don't feel like you really care about me. I know you care about my health, my safety, my well-being, but is that really where it is ends? When you see me crying and say nothing, is it because you don't care? When I told you out of anger that you don't care about me, I said that you never asked me how I am or how my day was even though I ask you all the time. The next you asked me, probably just to prove me wrong. It felt strange and unnatural. And you sounded uncomfortable and never did it again. That day I felt like you really didn't care about me.   


I'll never forget the day when I was 16 years old and you caught me with my boyfriend. You didn't say a word until I was in bed and I heard you and Dad fighting downstairs. You said you wished you never had another daughter. And my dad said he didn't want one but she did.  You didn't know I was listening. I cried all night. And what was my fault? All I did was fall in love. It's been over 6 years now, and you still hate that I'm with him. You don't care that he makes me happy. Is it because you don't care about me? When I say that I'm going to see him, you just stay quiet and become very cold towards me. You think that doesn't affect me, but it does. Unlike yours, his love is unconditional. Yet I continue to choose you at his expense. I hurt him so much because I just want your love and acceptance. But why? If you don't care about me. Your love has always come with ifs, ands, and buts. ""I'll love you if you promise to live with me forever"" ""I love you and I sacrificed so much for you so you owe me"" ""I love you but I don't care about your happiness if it interferes with mine"".  You obviously never outright said these things in so many words.  But you also can't deny their truth.  


Since I was kid, you have been telling me that I should never leave you alone. That when I grow up, you'll follow me for school and work and live with me forever. You even bragged to people about it. I always stayed quiet because I didn't want to start an argument. But did you really think I wanted that? It never occurred to you to ask. 


Growing up, I was always jealous of my friends. They would be able to talk to their mothers about cute boys in class and all kinds of things I wouldn't dare mention to you. I wanted that relationship. Instead, you tried to control every aspect of my life. When it came to applying for college, I had to open my mouth for the first time and say that I wanted to live on campus. The arguments were so bad, I caved and stayed at home. Even after graduation, I still regret doing that. I feel like I missed out on a whole college experience that everyone got but me. I still resent you for that. 

This past summer, I got an internship offer that started right after graduation. It was in a city 3 hours away. It was for only 2 months, but I was amazed you let me go and live alone. It was the best two months of my life, even though you visited every weekend.  But it went quickly and as it neared the end, I was offered a job and needed to find a permanent place to live. I was talking with my cousin because we thought we could move in together. But you wouldn't have that. You yelled at me for hours for being selfish and leaving you. You thought you would move up here and we'd continue to live together. I didn't want that, so I fought back. And what you said that day was unforgivable. You said you wished you had died instead of my dad. And that he was lucky he was gone. That was also the day your suicide threats started. If I didn't live with you, you'd kill yourself. How could you? If you cared me like you claim, you wouldn't have said that. But you don't care, do you? I didn't cave that day. I'm proud of myself for not caving then. But a few days later, you came to me with a seemingly rational offer. Since your financial situation was not so good, I'd move to a new apartment with you, and you'd move out in a few months when you were able to sustain yourself. I wish I didn't fall for it. 


My loving, patient boyfriend and I wanted to move in together. I chose you over him because I wanted to believe that things could work out between us. That we could have a good relationship. It's pretty clear that after 5 months, you don't plan on keeping your promise. I'm ready to leave. I miss my boyfriend and being with him. I just want to be happy. I wish you could be happy for me. I know what's going to happen when I tell you. You'll threaten to kill yourself. You'll cry. You'll scream that I'm ungrateful and a horrible daughter. And you'll make me want to cave. Because despite what you say, you know how much I care about you. You know how to manipulate me. I just hope I can endure it. I'll never stop wishing we could have a better relationship. But it'll never be possible unless you change. And you'll never change. You'll also never see this letter. You would just deny everything I said. I love you. But sometimes I wish I didn't. More than that, I wished you loved me enough to let me go."
fa7kgc,3,2020-02-27,"Should I tell my employer about my health issues that might affect my performance/ attendance? (ON, Canada)",still-in-the-game,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/fa7kgc/should_i_tell_my_employer_about_my_health_issues/,"I'm going to talk to my supervisor about this tomorrow regardless.  I just want to know this for future employment and my peace of mind.  

I'm a full time student working part time for my college. It's an office job and not physically demanding. I don't have any long term disability. I have vertigo for about 5 years now. I've been doing everything fine. Going to school, work, everything like normal. I can manage to do almost everything while I'm dizzy. It doesn't bother me as much. But I rarely get episodes where I'm so dizzy that I can't get up the bed and very nauseous. 

I started my current position in February. I work 2 days a week, a total of 10 hours. In my second week at work,  I caught the viral cold and flu. It got so bad that I had to take a day off. It's been almost 3 weeks and I'm still coughing. This somehow triggered my vertigo and I'm really dizzy. I didn't go to work today. I'm planning on going tomorrow but I'm really worried how I will manage. Tomorrow is an event that I need to prepare for. And I'm the only intern in my department so I don't want to bail. 

I feel guilty although it's not my fault that I got sick. I couldn't have predicted the cold but I knew about vertigo. I feel awkward that I've already taken 2 days off within 4 weeks. (It's not paid sick days. I just informed them that I was sick and can't come and I won't get paid for those days) Should I also tell the HR manager other than my own manager about my vertigo and how it might affect my performance. 

For future employment, when should I let them know about my vertigo and how will it affect my chances of getting the job? Or do I have to let them know at all because technically it's not a disability. I personally would feel a lot better if my employer knew about my condition so I don't feel so uncomfortable about missing work. 

I will really appreciate your feedback. Thank you"

I've been working hard(subjective) to maintain my GPA(3.8). Most of struggles come from general education classes and some science classes, and they awfully reduced my motivations in my major (that's why I didn't attempt to work on any side project). I was optimistic like I thought I could easily get a job with this GPA. In reality, employers are looking for those spending their time on some technology-related things (based on my experience at a career fair). I'm trying to find an internship for summer but it seems hopeless. I know I have to stop worrying about failing a class or GPA still I can't change my mind.

The worst thing is that in some classes, I wasn't really able to come up with solutions to assignments and I just copy and pasted from GitHub. I didn't want to disappoint my parent by failing a class but this experience changed my behavior of study in a wrong way.

&amp;#x200B;

long story short, don't get overwhelmed with stupid anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Thanks for all comments. I understand how guilty it is to copy-paste someone's code online and it degrade experience of study. Maybe I'm too overwhelmed by the experience at the career fair. I will definitely look for some small-medium company to apply. At worst, I can spend a whole summer to study some cool stuff. IMO, How people judge GPA is arbitrary, but I got confident with myself now. Great appreciation."

I quit my job, flipped my LinkedIn status to 'willing to hear from recruiters' flew home and spent a few days catching up with house/motorcycle/dental/car repairs, cat feeding and sleeping on a sopophoric couch.  
  
I log back into LinkedIn to nothing I can take- temp to perm jobs three states away, sales positions and ill-formed ""do everything like a senior but pay you like an intern"" positions.   
  
I even think about picking up some litigation work, but that smells like failure.  
  
I drop a line to two technical recruiters I like and ask for some contract work to tide me over.  
  
One, who we'll call Burt, calls me back that afternoon.  
  
Burt:""Hey, I saw you were looking for short term work. I have an, er, odd request and you might be interested""    
  
I hear a buzzing sound in the background, but assume it's just noise on the line.
  
me:""Ok, what is it?""  
  
Burt:""This isn't one of my normal clients. They need to figure out their backups and possibly recover some data. It's urgent, so the faster you can get here, the faster you'll get paid. I'll guarantee that part if you make them happy""  
  
I get a contact, an address and a phone number. I tell Burt I'll be there this afternoon and make my self presentable, collect some tools, then ride out there on my motorcycle.  
  
I arrive, find a place to park and busy my self with getting my suit jacket and laptop bag off the bike while securing my motorcycle gear in my saddlebags.  
  
A middle aged woman has left her beige sedan and is walking towards me with a ""I want to talk to your manager"" air.  
  
Beige Camry:""Don't you know you'll never amount to anything riding that death machine?""  
  
I'm still fumbling with my remove sunglasses, pull regular glasses from their case, place sunglasses in case, remove helmet, put glasses on my face without dropping anything or poking myself in the eye with the glasses, so I don't pay Beige Camry much attention.  
  
me:""huh?""  
  
Beige Camry:""You won't go to college and you won't make it past 30 doing stupid things""  
  
I'm now paying attention. I'm still confused. I look around to make sure she's addressing me. She is. She's planted her nurse shoe wearing feet and wants to give me both barrels.  
  
me:""I've made it past 30 and graduated college, but I still do stupid things. Thank you for the compliment""  
  
I go back to the stowing and bungee cording while she glares, then walks off, towards a building next to the parking lot.  
  
A few minutes later, I'm respectably wearing a suit jacket with my laptop bag slung over my shoulder looking for my destination.   
  
I find my destination and the appropriate office suite. It turns out to be the Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC . The receptionist tells me to wait in a waiting room with outdated magazines while I hear the buzz of drills.  
  
A middle aged man introduces himself as Mr Euripides and ushers me back to his cramped office.  
  
Me:""So, I understand you have some problems with backups""  
  
Euripides:""We do. We switched providers and now everything is messed up.""  
  
Me:""Ok. By 'service', we're talking a managed service provider- a contractor who handles technical issues, sets up systems and the like'?  
  
Euripides:""Yes. The old one was too expensive. They were charging us rent on a file server, so we terminated the contract. I had my nephew build a new server and connect it to a cheaper backup service""  
  
Me:""So, what happened?""  
  
Euripides:"" About two weeks ago, we lost all our files on the server and neither of the backups work. Each blames the other and they start talking technobabble. I threatened them with litigation, but that didn't get my files back."" 
  
Me:""I think I understand. I speak fluent technobabble. Let me take a look and I'll give you an estimate on the costs""  
  
Euripides:""Burt is taking care of that part""  
  
I'll have to figure out what that means. I'm here, so I should at least take a look. Lawyer hands me a wrinkled sheet of paper and walks me to a louder room. It seems that their IT closet is in a construction zone. There's sheet rock dust, saw dust and a few broken drop-ceiling tiles' worth of detritus on a single open rack.  
  
At the bottom of the rack are two flashy gaming PC towers. Translucent Lucite sides with LED light strips show me a stack of hard drives . Clearly the builder was thinking about a different kind of Enterprise than I was.  
  
I turn to Euripides. 
  
me:""Ok. Any ideas on what each of these do?""  
  
Lawyer:""My nephew's number is on that paper. I don't understand all this stuff anyway. Anything else you need from me?""  
  
me:""Let me take a look and I'll call your nephew if I have any questions""  
  
He walks off while I grab a spare keyboard and monitor from an unused cubicle. I plug into the PC on the left and use a password on the sheet to login.  
  
A bit of poking and the OS sees one mountable volume, but four drives. Seems they're some kind of RAID. One drive is showing a hardware failure.  
  
That's odd, but perhaps that's because Windows isn't my strength. I reboot the first PC from a linux USB drive and move my monitor and keyboard to number 2.  
  
This one is a bit happier. I see two volumes mounted. One for the OS, one for file storage.  
  
Even better. The 'storage' volume has one folder, labeled 'Backups'.  
  
This might be easier than I thought.  
  
I look through the backups and see one per day, going back about a month or two.  
  
I pick one from about two weeks ago. It's compressed, so it's going to take a few minutes. I swap back to the first PC, which has booted linux.  
  
Ok. Four drives. I can mount the OS drive fine. One dead. Remaining two a part of an array. I don't get it. Assuming [RAID 5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#Raid_5), one drive can fail and we can still read and write data. I need to think on this for a second.  
  
Back to the other PC to see how the restore's coming. That was fast. I open the folder and see a full backup.  
  
Of the operating system. Not the file storage. I check the other backups and they're all the same size. Great.   
  
Then I notice something that makes me sad. The OS volume is 4TB. The Storage volume is 12TB. One drive, three drives.   
  
There's no parity, the drives aren't mirrored. If any one fails, the whole volume fails.   
  
I find Lawyer's nephew's number and call it. I get voicemail. I tell him to call me back.  
  
So my local backups aren't and the one volume that holds the data is borked.  
  
This is going to be complicated. I call Bart, the recruiter who brought me in.  
  
Bart:""Hello! How's it going, LT?""  
  
me:""Uh, not so well. I have a feeling this is going to be expensive.""  
  
Bart:""How expensive?""  
  
me:""We might have to ship out three drives for recovery. We're talking a few thousand to start""  
  
Bart:""Is that what you'd charge?""  
  
me:""I don't have a clean room. I might swap a hard drive controller board, but this is magic by comparison.""  
  
Bart:""Is there anything you can do?""  
  
me:""I have one last thing to try, but I'm not feeling lucky. Give me an hour""  
  
Bart:""Let me know""  
  
me:""Oh. One last question. Are you paying me?""  
  
Bart:""Yep. I'll pay you for your time and barter with Euripides""  
  
me:""I won't ask""  
  
I look at the other number on the paper. It's a local MSP named OnFight. I call the number. After a few minutes in a phone tree inspired by the maze in Zork 1, I exit the twisty passages and get to Joel, a support rep.  
  
Joel:""HithisisJoelatOnFightpleasehold""  
  
me:""I'm trying...""  
  
hold music, occasionally interrupted by short, amateur commercials about how _awesome_ OnFight's service is.  
  
Joel:""HithisisJoelthankyouforwaiting. What'sthecustomernumber?""  
  
me:""I'm trying to reach whomever manages your backups. I don't have a customer number, but the customer is Law Offices of Amygdala and Euripides, PC.""  
  
Joel:""Uh...(clickity,clickity)they'renotacurrentcustomer...""  
  
me:""Wait wait wait. Can I talk to a manager for five minutes? I think can solve a problem for you all if I can talk to someone who can make a quick decision""  
  
Joel:""Pleasehold""  
  
The wait isn't as long.  
  
Manager:""Hi there. This is Rebecca. What's this about Amygdala and Euripides?""  
  
me:""Thanks. You used to rent them a server and do their backups, right?""  
  
Rebecca:""That's correct. A few months ago we got told to take the server back and to stop the backups""  
  
me:""Ok, got that. Is there any chance you haven't wiped that server?""  
  
Rebecca:""We overwrote the drive,  reformatted the server and allocated it to a new customer. Backups securely overwritten per A&amp;E's request""  
  
me:""A&amp;E _told_ you to delete everything?""  
  
Rebecca:""That's correct. We have emails from Euripides' nephew and a signed letter from Euripides himself""  
  
me:""Wonderful. Thanks. I'll make sure they understand""  
  
I call Nephew again.  
  
Nephew:""Yo""  
  
me:""Hi. This is Lawtechie. I'm trying to figure out your backups""  
  
Nephew:""Yeah, this all should work""  
  
me:""Let me understand. The shiny box on the left is the primary and the one on the right is the backup?""  
  
Nephew:""Yep. What's wrong with you that you can't get it back?""  
  
me:""It looks like you're only backing up the C: drive""  
  
Nephew:""What do you mean?""  
  
me:""You're backing up the operating system on a nightly basis""  
  
Nephew:""Right. The important stuff""  
  
me:""No, that's reinstallable. What about the various documents your uncle's law practice actually runs on?""  
  
Nephew:""It's not?""  
  
me:""Unless there's another backup server, no""  
  
Nephew:""What do you mean?""  
  
me:""There's a lesson every techie learns. If you don't test your backups, you don't have any""  
  
Nephew:""We shouldn't need them. Those disks are RAID""  
  
me:""You sure? It looks like you set them up without mirrors or parity""  
  
Nephew:""What's parity?""  
  
me:""I think you should learn some things before building systems that people rely on next time""  
  
Nephew:""Yeah. I'm going into cybersecurity soon so that stuff won't matter""  
  
me:""Good for you. That's a business where charlatans and the soulless run rampant. There's also a negative side.""  
  
Nephew:""What?""  
  
me:""Is there any chance there's a full backup anywhere else somewhere?""  
  
Nephew:""Yeah. OnFight should have one""  
  
me:""Tried that. Seems that you told them to burn it all""  
  
Nephew:""It's more secure that way""  
  
me:""I wish you luck in your career""  
  
Nephew:""Don't throw me under the bus""  
  
I texted Bart to tell him that it wasn't looking good, then I walked to Euripides' office to tell him about hard drive recovery. He thanked me in the way people do when they think you're trying to take advantage of them and said that he'd talk to his nephew before making any important decisions.  
  
Bart paid me for that day and I went home."
fa7y3k,11,2020-02-27,My Success Story - Currently Working For a Pretty Major Company,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fa7y3k/my_success_story_currently_working_for_a_pretty/,"I would like to share my success story to help those who feel hopeless. If you feel hopeless, I used to feel that way just a year ago before I got this job. I'm not here to toot my own horn. I'm here to tell you how I dug myself out of an awful position that I used to be in and how I rose to be where I am now. You'd probably be somewhat surprised to hear how I got here.

So, first things first, I'm currently working for a pretty big company under my third year in college. Will be returning back to school after this semester to complete my degree after 4 years.

Just a year ago, I felt awful. I was depressed because I got bamboozled, to be fair, out of my own idiocy. I applied for summer positions around January and February, not realizing that most summer positions close at the end of last year or around there. You could imagine how bad I felt not getting anything while my peers were getting positions from different companies. I felt like garbage, that I had no future. I'll talk about this later but I lived and died by an internship in my sophomore year. I felt so depressed that interviewing for more companies in March made me feel worse. My depression was seeping out in my interviews and I was getting rejected by even more companies. Even by startups who claimed they were willing to hire anybody. I felt worthless. Then I suffered from a myriad from mental health issues that I don't want to talk about even further. It was hell. But how did I crawl out of it?

Starting in my third year, I applied and applied and applied and applied and applied and applied and applied. Over and over. Then, I realized that my resume was just horrid and I VASTLY improved my resume. I don't even want to look at what my resume looked like before. Now, it's not perfect but I'll tell you what my resume used to look like was 1000x worse than what my resume is right now. That was a big help to getting an internship. So, the way I got this internship now is that I visited the company's website. I did this for the fun of it. I didn't expect to get a job from this. But anyway, the service bot I guess came to me. I assumed it was a bot. It basically asked me ""What do you want?"" And I said ""I want a job"". Then, the bot said alright, I'll find you something. Then I guess the bot used the profile and the applications I already submitted from jobs before and forwarded to the manager or HR for the internship I'm under now. And here I am. I'm working for a big tech company with lots of history and lots of experience to gain from and I'm happy. I wish I can go back in time to that sad, depressed me and show him my employee ID card and see the reaction.

My advice. One, don't give up. Apply. Even if you don't think you might not fit the job description perfectly, apply. Heck, even if you don't fit the description at all, apply anyway. It doesn't hurt to apply. Two, always adapt your resume and improve your resume. I know this is pretty common knowledge among the professional space but I'm serious. I probably would have a decent chance to make some internships if I improved my resume. At least after I improved my resume, at least I was then getting into interviews and coding tests. Before, they would just throw out my resume because it was just so terrible. The improvement made that much of a difference. Three, you never know. I'm living proof of this. I got a job with a major worldwide tech company with virtually zero connections whatsoever. All of my coworkers got in either through someone they knew or applied through their school's program. I'm the only oddball in my group who found the program and applied to it. Well, I guess the bot applied for me but you get my point. Sure, you can argue that it was luck but that's the thing. You don't know. You never know. The job that you applied to and was like ""Pssh, there's no way I could make that job. That company is way too big for me. They have so much prestige to them. Only ridiculously smart people work there. I'm not smart enough to work there"" could come to you and may offer you a position. Final tip I'll give is don't live or die by internships. I know, for me, I got a happy ending. It worked out for me at the end. But, knowing life, it sometimes ain't fair. In some cases, you may try and might not get something. But, even if that does happen, it's still not the end of the world. There are alternative ways to get experience and fulfill yourself. Internships are great, but it took me a while to learn that they aren't something to live and die by or something to use to prove your worth.

That's all I have to say on that. I would like to thank some of the people who gave advice on here and motivated me to pull myself up from that position. I just felt like posting because I don't want to see people suffer the same way I did back then. I want to see other find success. I recently saw a post on here that reminded me of how I was and I don't want to see that. After getting the internship I have now, I am very happy. And I plan on never going back to that state ever again."
fa82in,0,2020-02-27,I feel like I'm constantly trapped in life and it doesn't matter that I know what I want to do because no employer wants to hire me for the job I want.,throwawaylifeat30,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fa82in/i_feel_like_im_constantly_trapped_in_life_and_it/,"First of all, I want to remark that I hate how universities give students with higher GPA's more freedom to choose their major. If I was allowed to study in the original major I wanted, none of these issues would have arisen. 
I've been in school for a long time. I felt very depressed during a period of these years because I didn't have a purpose or motivation towards what I wanted to do so I literally played video games all day to cope. 3 years ago, I transferred to my current university, not under the original major I wanted, and the regret I felt pushed me to work harder in school and get decent grades.
I did not fix my gpa until last year (meaning it was only last year that I got my gpa high enough to meet the stupid electrical engineering department's minimum gpa to transfer to their program). But I can't change majors because my family is pressuring me to graduate (changing majors means 2.5 additional years). So I'm graduating this May with my useless Math degree and jobless. 
Last year, I got very lucky to get an internship exactly in the area I wanted. The work was very difficult but I enjoyed every bit of it. That ended last September. Ever since, I've been job hunting like crazy to try to get a job like that (the position title is ""embedded software engineer""). They typically hire engineering majors or CS majors for this position. I've had maybe 2 calls back for phone interviews and then nothing. I've gone to job fairs only to be shot down. I did notice that on their job qualifications (for some), they list that experience can be used in lieu of the degree. But then, how do you get that experience if no one wants to hire you? I thought about what I would do if I gave up this dream of mine and it literally feels like theres a void in me if I do. I feel deeply depressed if I can't accomplish this goal because its all I think about day and night. I happily spend my free time learning about this field and programming stuff because I genuinely enjoy it. I don't feel depressed at all when I do this stuff. But it feels fucking horrible when I'm told that I can't have this job because of my major. That makes me feel like I'm fucking trapped back in that time where I was depressed and felt like I couldn't change my situation."

It's been two months and I have been sitting mostly workless for the past three weeks after they were done with their intensive training session. The stuff that was covered so far (springboot, mongo, Kafka, solr and elastic) is definitely interesting but I would still like to go back to being associated with data science.

I am tasked with finding a new way to operate their GIS needs. I have many ideas in mind and was wondering if purchasing ArcGIS Enterprise would be the right way to move forward with this. One of the preserve's goals are to have their maps web based so people visiting the preserve can use their phones or tablets to look at the trails and other map based information. I figured enterprise would work well with this since it comes with the portal application where maps can be uploaded for public use and that seems to fit their needs. The only problem is that I don't really understand how the whole system works. Is it possible for anyone to give me an ELI5 on how servers and arcgis enterprise work, as well as costs if anyone knows? 

Another idea of mine includes simple PC upgrades since not many people are creating content for GIS paired with a mobile app subscription where maps would be uploaded for public use. The only downside to that is that the public user may have to pay and they will have another app on their mobile device. With the portal/enterprise, these maps are just accessed through a website, if I'm not mistaken.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

More about the project:

* very high tests coverage
* my code is reviewed by much more experienced developer
* am I the only developer
* I am a frontend developer made fullstack (had to learn Java)
* I am responsible for deploying to couple of portals (the process is semi automatic, prepared by our devops team, which is working in other projects day-to-day)
* it's more than 50K lines of code (I guess it gives some idea of how big this project is)
* it uses pretty old technologies 
* no testers
* 70% of my job is fixing bugs

In the beginning I felt I was working slow but then I thought it's normal because I just started it and I have to get to know it. Now it's been couple of month and I feel pretty much the same way. I got familiar with Java (I can do this and that but I still don't feel as comfortable as with frontend, and also sometimes I think am I missing some foundations). 

Now I feel like I was thrown into deep water, the project is still overwhelming... What do you guys think?

Also, do you think that this is a good project in means of developing new skills? I was pretty happy to try new technologies but now I feel that without proper foundations I can't build confidence when using it. And bug fixing seems pretty mundane rather than developing.

Hello everyone,

I am struggling with deciding on which career path is right and I need some unbiased opinions.

Bit of back story-

I am in the final semester of my BSW completing my internship working with Children and Family Services at MHA Indian reservation. Internship started completely unpaid and I was just helping across the entire agency, CPS, Foster Care, Case management, Family pres... Within a week of starting, they offered me a job as the sole ICWA Specialist to represent the tribe (their ICWA dept is a complete mess and I know nothing about ICWA, and the last worker quit as soon as they tried to hold her accountable for the mess...).. so $25 per hour full benefits, bump to $28 once I graduate and get my LBSW license.

The tribe also offered to pay $5500 for this last semester of school and will pay for me to get my masters, while working for them. So they want to pay me $60k per year and pay for grad school.

So all that is wonderful.. yipee!! BUT...before this happened

Over the past year personal issues have come up and my husband and I decided to move after I graduate and finish my internship (we moved out to North Dakota for him to work in the oil field and have zero family here..we have three small children) ... I was intending to move to rural Idaho, complete my masters online while maybe working part time.... But this is all in the same town as my entire family so support for my three kids would be amazing.

Working out in that area would be only $12 per hour until I got my MSW then maybe $40k per year.

Our house for sale and under contract to close on April 30, and we when out and found a house in Idaho and started that process....

So fudge... do I put a hold on moving my small children to be close to they grandparents and cousins, work part time and try to pay for grad school myself....

Or stay where I have no family, but a good job, amazing benefits, and school paid....also to me another big thing is the experience working ICWA on the reservation would go along way..... it would be another two years out here..

So family now or career???"

It's the hardest class I took so far, there is no midterms, only labs (which are easy), a research topic and a final worth 30%.  What stresses me out is the fact that there are so many mathematical formulas shown in class but no exercises or examples. I feel like there's no way I will be able to retain a whole computer science class with a lot of formulas, know how to apply each one of them without ever doing a single example. 

Also, another thing that depresses me a bit is the fact that if I go into this field, I would have to compete with other Masters, and PhD students, and I am not sure I want to get a Masters. So all this knowledge on computer vision would just go to waste ? is it just better to drop the course now ?"

However,  halfway  between my degree, as things got difficult I questioned how  much I  actually wanted to study this and how I probably did it because I   subconciously wanted to meet my parents expectations of doing something   medical related.

Anyway, I stuck   with it. 2019 was my final year and I struggled immensely. I went for   councelling and therapy and long story short turns out I was diagnosed   with dyspraxia and ADD at the age of 22, which explained my whole school   career and how I struggled with work despite being (in mine, teachers   and my parents eyes) very intelligent and highly capable

This   led to a downfall and my mental health was in the gutter.  I basically   fucked up my final exams, scraped the dissertation by the skin of my   teeth. I haven't graduated but I have to retake one exam in the summer   of 2020.

Anyway, I'll be on track   for a 3rd class degree (not sure what that is in American but my   Brits/Australians/Irish will understand), and this means I probably   cannot enter a decent graduate job related to medical science or   otherwise.

I've always been a   creative individual from my teenage yeears, and I was involved in   several creative ventures. Luckily I live in London where there's a   World leading film/tv scene, second to LA in the Anglosphere perhaps,   and I want to pursue a creative venture. Im finding it hard to get to   this pursuit as I am also working 3 days a week part time and a lot of   opportunities im applying for, be it parttime unpaid work or otherwise, I   don't seem to be getting much response from them  but im trying

At   the meantime, I'm split between trying to just enter IT/Learning to   code. I'm struggling, and im losing the motivation to learn, as I find   it very difficult to find a path. I applied for an amazon internship   which would guarantee me an IT job but it turns out it wasn't what I   expected it to be, and the progression isnt that great so I'm thinking   what else can I do? I'd rather just pursue my passions than to follow a   dead lead which doesn't pay great.

this   is a long post and i understand if many people don't read this, i dont   have anyone to talk to but I'd appreciate any advice/response :)"

This is probably my first time talking about my feelings with other people than my girlfriend. It might be a long read but I would really appreciate if you shared your honest opinion, no matter how harsh it might be. Thank you in advance.

I am a 22 year old, finishing my BA in software engineering, have been working since 20 years old. I won't get much into detail about the start, but I have always been a top level student and have graduated from the best school in my country with honors, however, I only started programming more than just syntax excercises in school when I entered University, which is 19 y.o.

And it has been more or less ok. Things were not easy but I managed to get decent marks and land my first internship right after first year at a company that adapts ERP's. Didn't get the job later, but that didn't really hurt me since I was the youngest there.

After a couple of months I got an internship in a medium sized (~200 employees in group, 60 in development) company that develops IT solutions. Internship went really well, I successfully completed tasks, which mostly involved bug fixing. I worked with .NET Framework, MVC web solution. The company offered me a part-time position after 3 months and everything went great for the next month, which was exams period. But then I received a task that I struggled a lot with. No senior people helped me since they worked different hours than me, so I was on my own. Then during yearly evaluation, my boss said that I am just terrible and she thinks it's time to part ways. It was a horrible experience... She also said that she doesn't see me as a developer at all since my soft skills are great, but technical skills suck. And that honestly left a scar.

I went on to focus on my studies for a month and later landed a position in a small financial services company, that had only one freelancer developer with 6-month contract and me, alongside 4 business people. In that company, well, I shined. As being the only person there, I managed to develop new web solution with .NET core and Angular, as well as maintain the legacy sub-system. It felt like I also did some complicated tasks, including e-signature implementation from various providers, talking with providers about plans and things like that. So, it felt like my career was going upwards.

But after a little bit more than a year I got an offer to join a huge corporation in my country, probably the most popular and well known employer. It was my dream to work in this company so I just couldn't resist, moreover I felt like I've been doing same things over and over in current job, it just felt bland and not challenging.

And here, everything went really well at first, but then I started struggling. I have always been a slow developer and it took me a bit more time than others to deliver. So basically the first task that included technologies I had no clue about, only knowing .NET Core, took me 3 months to complete, when it was expected to be finished in no more than 2. But my team and the manager took it really well, saying that the task turned out to be more complicated than expected, so many things went wrong that I just cannot believe could be predicted. Anyway, my manager, after a couple of incidents during release, gave me a hard talk that my communication and estimation is not as good as he'd like it to be. He said that I am too often doing things stressfully, leaving some parts for the last minute. It just happened because I really wanted to deliver and issues just went out one by one, I had to fix them quickly and then I rushed the release. I also added some new features that my colleague offered, but my manager got angry for that because I went out of scope, thus it took 2 extra days for release and increased it's risk. Oh, and one note: I was working together with an intern, he barely did anything and I had to spend some time teaching him things. But in the end, it seemed like we got a shared credit for that, so I felt a bit robbed...

Next task was about extending a solution that has been written by the same intern. It was his first program using .NET, so you can imagine how messy it was, I have no idea how someone allowed it to pass (it's only a testing tool, but still).

At first it seemed like an easy task, but it took me 3 weeks. The end result doesn't satisfy me, because it could be improved to give our teammates a better experience. But we are on a tight schedule so I just had to move on this week.

My manager didn't say anything to me, but I feel like I am the least valuable person in the team of 10 people. I am a junior and we also have two interns, it seems like I deliver slightly more than the interns, but I expect more out of myself. Those tasks I have been given were relatively new to the team so there was not much knowledge to be transferred. Anyway, my team is awesome and they are very supportive, always helping me and bashing me during pull requests, challenging me to get better.

But I don't know. Something doesn't feel right. I feel like I am too slow and the quality I produce does not reflect the time I spent. Also, yearly performance review is coming in a month and I am really afraid. I haven't heard a bad word from my manager since that last time two months ago. He was very supportive when I started... (I have been working in this company for 5 months now)

And as you could guess, performance reviews make me shiver.

Moving in to the question: has anyone been in a situation like that where they felt like they are simply not good enough? What should I do to be a faster developer?

I'd be really thankful for any advice. All I want is to become a valuable professional of my art."

I did a remote ""internship"" for a friend of a friend who owns a startup, but I didn't get any feedback so other than something to put on my resume, I don't feel like it helped me grow as a programmer.

4 months ago my spouse suggested that maybe I didn't have enough interest in front end in order to be able to really dive into learning enough on my own and that I should switch gears to learning python, java, and software design concepts instead. I knew that what I was doing wasn't working so I agreed. I took coursera courses in all of the above and felt like I was really understanding what I was learning and was enjoying working on the assignments. When I finished the courses I started working on a project, that I was and still am very excited about. I also started to dive into more complicated things like testing and deployment and since then things have gone downhill again. Once again I find myself with not enough drive to dive into learning more difficult concepts on my own, and my productivity has declined rapidly. 

My spouse has now suggested that I take the next few months off (while I finish up with immigration, which is admittedly a huge distraction) to de-stress and focus on some hobbies for a while, and then if I'm still interested in becoming a programmer, join a bootcamp this summer. As it is, I won't be able to work until june or july anyway, and the bootcamp would only be 12 weeks. Money is thankfully not an issue (although I am eager to be able to start contributing again and take some stress off of my spouse). 

I feel like doing so would be giving up. I also don't know if a bootcamp would be helpful, or if I would be right back where I am now when it finished. I know that it would be good for networking, and anything that would help me eventually get a job would be useful at this point, but I don't know if that's enough to make it worth it. On the other hand, I know I'm not doing very good on my own, and perhaps the structure of a bootcamp is what I need to get past the hump."

fam6ib,6,2020-02-27,Advice about a late transition into a CS-based career,Boson27,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fam6ib/advice_about_a_late_transition_into_a_csbased/,"Hello!

I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

I'm a college senior in Physics and I'm minoring in CS. Throughout high school and undergrad, I was pretty dead-set on going to graduate school to get a PhD in Physics. I had this goal in mind because I was highly fascinated by the field and had immense passion for research. Recently however (within the last year) I've been facing a lot of burnout and disenchantment with the academic system. This may come across as just ""senioritis"", but I'm not motivated anymore to study Physics further. Frankly, I'm very tired of going to lectures, taking exams, and doing homework problems. I'm tired of having irregular sleep schedules and doing school work for most of the day. Additionally, I've been getting several rejections from many of the PhD programs I've applied to. It is looking increasingly unlikely that I will be able to attend graduate school in the fall of this year. Both of these factors combined have managed to dissuade me from academia. I'm not mentally prepared for a PhD at this time.

I am highly interested in applying my skills elsewhere and I think I would be a great fit for CS/CS-related jobs. I'm drawn to software development, quantitative finance/research, and data science. I know these fields are extremely broad, so I'm including my resume so you can get a better idea of what I *could* be good at: [https://docdro.id/KaPFyZQ](https://docdro.id/KaPFyZQ)

Essentially, I would like advice related to what jobs I could be potentially good for. I am aware that I'm posting this somewhat late. Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I know, a lot of tech companies have finished their hiring process for interns and full-time positions by now. I believe most phone and onsite interviews happen in the fall, right? Am I too late to be applying for jobs to any companies for this year? Also, if I'm lacking some necessary skills, I'm happy to hear guidance on filling in any gaps in my knowledge.

Sorry if this post comes across as somewhat open-ended; overall, I'm just looking for \*any\* advice on making the switch to a CS career. I would like some direction on what to with my life given that I am graduating soon. Big thanks for your help!"

famrfe,2,2020-02-27,A little lost,botatheart,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/famrfe/a_little_lost/,"Hi all, 

I'm feeling a little stuck and frusterated with tech at the moment. Hoping I could get some advice so here's my situation. I'm a sophomore at a top public school. I came into college with no coding expirince and thinking I would pursue a liberal arts degree; I had a friend teach me how to code freshman year and fell in love with it. 

I'm a sophmore now and while I've tried to get into the tech world, I still don't have any real world expirience. I've worked in ""tech adjacent"" roles: I'm a computer science teacher, and I started a CS realted org at my school, but I don't have anything I've built to show. I feel so behind since my classmates have had so many more classes and many of them already have internships. I'm having trouble finding an internship for this summer and I'm worried that my lack of expirience will be an even bigger problem if I don't get one before Junior year. 

To further complicate things, I'm not even sure I want to be a software engineer. It seems like a good place to start out, and I do like to code, but I'm a good communicator and a great teacher and I don't think I belong behind a computer for the next 40 years. Maybe I'm just looking for a different kind of role? Something tech related but not as technical as engineering? I'm just not sure what those roles are or how to move into them. Anyway, any advice on how to find an internship, or where I should even be aiming would be great"

Now, she's working at the same place during the school year and during the summer, and now she has a whole ass job offer for after we graduate. Like almost a whole year before!!! I know I should be happy for her and whatever, but when is it going to be my turn???

I have better grades, and I know what I'm doing. The only thing I don't have is experience, and that's the entire reason for the internships!!! I just want things to work out for me soon because it's been overly stressful lately. And when I talk about my worries about not getting a job, my friend keeps saying stuff like ""stop worrying about it. i know you'll get one. or even if you don't, you'll be fine. you can find a different kind of job"" And that makes me even more pissed off, because she doesn't have to worry at all! She could get Cs and Ds in her classes until she graduates and she will be fine, but I have to keep a GPA to keep a scholarship AND to sell myself for jobs! 

I just want to cry and sometimes punch her in the face when she tells me not to worry."
fandiz,125,2020-02-27,So my parents are against my internship-oh the irony,Shimi3078,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/fandiz/so_my_parents_are_against_my_internshipoh_the/,"So some background first- and sorry it’s  a little long plus I’m on mobile. 

I (21F) am trying to get into vet school, much to the disapproval of my parents who want me to go to medical school. I really do love them and in some ways they are great parents but they DO NOT KNOW HOW TO LISTEN, and they deal with their emotions in very unhealthy ways. 
However, they’ve kind of accepted this is the closest I’m going to get to the medical field so they ok with it. 

However in order to get into vet school I’m working two jobs and taking some difficult classes- my schedule starts at 8am and finishes at 1am. I don’t have time to do much else. 

They expect the best grades and for me to become a doctor or veterinarian overnight, without any of the work. They expect me to return home every college break even though I need to work and keep up my grades. They are not happy that I refused to come home (especially since they live far away and it’s expensive) for the upcoming spring break in order to study for an exam. 

Therefore they expect me home for the entire summer. However I got an exclusive internship for the summer that would help me out a lot, and give some great experience. However if it would coincide with the “family reunion” so my parents of course disapprove. Instead of being proud of me they yelled about how irresponsible I was for not putting family first. 
Also they continue to discredit that I got into the internship-it’s something anyone can get, how will this even help you, it’s a waste of time etc. 

After a LOT of convincing and arguing, they agree to me skipping the family reunion. However the moment I tell them that I will need a moped ( which I have saved up my own money to pay for) to get to the internship (since it’s a little far away) they lose their shit. 

They accuse me of being “too big for my own britches” to make a decision like that and that how dare I even consider anything like this without asking their permission. I am an ungrateful daughter who doesn’t deserve anything, etc etc etc. LOTS guilt tripping -why are you doing this when we love you so much? We risked everything to give you a better life, and you’re treating us like this, you don’t even care about us etc. 

They say they don’t like mopeds and are furious at “hiding” this information from me. 

Mind you, I have a scholarship for my college tuition, and do my best to support my living expenses( but I do need help with rent now and then). 
After an angry conversation with a LOT of guilt tripping they essentially disowned me. 

I’m just frustrated and torn, I don’t want to go NC with them because I do love them, but I wish they would be more understanding sometimes. I know a lot of it is their Asian upbringing, but it doesn’t help that it doesn’t change their behavior. 

Pretty ironic imo that they want me to be successful but won’t let me take the steps to be that. 
I’m essentially between a rock and a hard place."
fanlmo,2,2020-02-27,Do I need to go to college for a career in IT?,UnitedCong,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/fanlmo/do_i_need_to_go_to_college_for_a_career_in_it/," 

I am currently a senior in high school with my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certification. I am also expecting to get my Security+ by graduation as well as an AA in general studies from my community college (dual enrollment). I have had two internships: with my school district working as a tech and working at a real estate company as a network technician. I would say I'm graduating high school in a good position, and I'm confident I could get a basic job anywhere with my experience and knowledge (I know it's not as easy as it sounds, so no I don't expect everything to be handed to me).

That isn't important, but what is important is that I don't know if I need a college career to be successful. Ultimately, I want a career in cybersecurity. I have spoken with other people in the IT field, and the majority say that certifications are the way to go. I spoke with a CCIE, and he said that college would be a waste of time where I could be getting vendor-specific certifications. On the other hand, I have spoken with counselors and college coordinators and they all say that I *need* to go to college to be successful in this field. They say my certifications won't hold as much weight as a degree. (I agree with CompTIA certs; however, I'm just starting, and I plan to branch out into more certs in the future)

Now that my senior year is ending, and I should have been applying to colleges like...yesterday, but I'm beginning to feel like without a degree I won't make it. I want to know what other people's experience is like. I do and I want to approach this topic with an open mind. Of course, I believe that a degree may help me, but will no degree prevent me from excelling in my field? I'm open to many different opinions.

As we  know, it is a competitive field and I have been competing for an  internship in this field for a while. Now that I have gotten one, I feel  a little imposter syndrome coming on.

To narrow my question down a little bit:

1. are there roles that are common to most data science interns and what would they be?
2. what are some general tips or guidelines to help me succeed in this position?
3. common pitfalls when beginning in this career?

faqu4x,1,2020-02-28,I think I need help,garbage_human_,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/faqu4x/i_think_i_need_help/,"So I decided to bite the bullet and finally seek help even if it's from internet strangers. I'm getting to the point where I will probably severely mess up my life (like in the next few months) and it terrifies me.

Here are some points I want to talk about and maybe get some answer for. It's gonna be long so buckle up:

1. At this point I'm pretty certain I have depression. Since starting university it's gotten worse each year (cliche I know). That being said, I think I've had it for most of my developmental life (currently 22). Since about grade 7 everything has felt like a dream (feel ""out of it""). When I try to be present in the moment I feel like I'm drunk or half asleep. It's like my brain isn't fully recording or aware. To move on to some more typical depression symptoms: I don't find anything fun anymore and I'm rarely truly happy. I'll have short moments of happiness but they're few and far in between. I can't get myself to even play video games anymore. Fun stuff feels like a chore. Motivation is zero. I am almost physically unable to do anything. It's taking everything in me to write this fucking post. My parents like to tell me it's ""laziness"" and that I'm ""lazy"" but it's not that I'm against doing stuff, my brain just won't let me. I have no energy to do anything and when I don't want to do anything I kind of just sit there in this numb pain. Suicidal thoughts are just about a daily occurrence at this point. I don't think I've had a restful nights sleep since middle school. Going back to my motivation: I can't even physically think about things that are even remotely complicated. My brain gives up. I am emotionally deficient. A family member died recently and I felt next to nothing. I'm terrified of having a romantic relationship because of this. I've been this way for as long as I can remember. Every once in a while I get these euphoric episodes where I'm mentally taken to a different reality (usually induced by music and at night or evening). I think it's just regular emotion leaking through.
2. I'm decently confident I have OCD or at the very least the intrusive thought portion of OCD. I don't really want to get into the intrusive thoughts because they are very fucked up. They cause me a great deal of stress. Not sure if this fits into OCD but sometimes when things don't go how I want them to go I get REALLY uncomfortable. 
3. For as long as I can remember I've had sever anxiety that is triggered by literally everything. It could be something as stupid as travelling north or thinking about certain locations. It has definitely taken a toll on my mental development. As a result, my social anxiety is through the god damn roof to the point where I don't have any meaningful relationships outside of my family and even those are kinda weird because we don't really rely on each other for emotional support. This has definitely handicapped me when it comes to operating in a work environment. Everything about a job is fucking hell for me. I have worked jobs but every day grinds on my soul (as dumb as that sounds). 
4. I feel this mental cocktail has probably bestowed upon me the prestigious honour of having ADHD. I can't focus on my school work to the point where it has greatly affected my grades and probably hurt my potential coming out of university (this is what I meant about messing up my future). I'm currently trying to find an internship before I graduate but I'm worried I won't be able to participate in any kind of job. Reading documents and texts is almost a no go for me. I struggle through them. I can hardly even watch movies or play video games if they're not literally the most interesting content out there. Music is another one I struggle with. I can pretty much only listen to a small portion of music as the rest ""bores"" me. I guess this goes along with the fact the my patience is pretty much non-existent.
5. This is a little bit different but I want to talk a little bit about physical flaws or at least the physical flaws I perceive.  Like many men, I'm pretty sure I'm the victim of receding hairline and probably baldness. It's on both sides of my family. Every time I think about it I mentally check out from reality and shut down (a lot of things have caused this actually). My head is tiny compared to my body and not a nice shape (intense ridge from front to back) so I don't think shaving is an option. I also have a really weak chin. Last thing I want to touch on is my posture. It's atrocious and I'm pretty sure I now have a permanent hunch. That is all.
6. In terms of help, I have the contact info of a psychologist that my parents gave me (it would hopefully be through their health care that I could see this person). My biggest concern though is that she won't be able to prescribe meds (which will undoubtedly need). Would she be able to recommend? The only problem with that is I've told my doctor I don't have depression. I feel it would be weird to now go to her and say ""hey I've had depression for the last 10 years along with all these other problems"". I also realize that if I have all the problems I think I do, I'll be on a metric ass-load of meds. Is there one medication that could fix everything?

I'm probably missing a lot but that's all I can think of right now. I don't want to go back through and edit it lol so it will definitely sound rambly. Anyone who tries to read this clusterfuck and provide any kind of advice will go down in my history book as hero (however long that book is)."

As an intern my planning isnt required since theres actual workers planning the migration, however Ive been tasked to plan as if I had to do it myself.
What Ive thought is to try and manually copy the data after locating all of it via something like robocopy to another drive, then install W19 fresh to the SSDs and transfer the data.

Hello, I am an IT graduate working in a hospitality environment for 2 years now in Sydney. I have a career gap of more than a year (1 year 3 months to be exact). Even though I have graduated, I have a very poor background in programming. I was too lazy to do projects, asked my friends to complete it for me. That’s how I graduated.

After a few years, hospitality work started being monotonous. Now I have realized that there is no growth at my current work. I have started to get frustrated about my career. So thought “Enough is Enough”. I found out about Reddit, signed up and subscribed to different communities. There is one community r/learnpython which interests me a lot. So I started learning python from the very scratch. Studied a few books, did some really easy projects. Got feedback from many users and I am still loving it. After learning some basics of Python, I completed 30 days of code hackerrank. I have gained some more knowledge through it. Now, I want to learn Django. I have collected some books, will start on a few days. It’s really hard to manage time with your full-time work and family.

Now, I want to have industrial experience and have been applying for an internship in more than 50 places yet haven't received any positive feedback from anywhere. So, I started to seek for the agency who helps you get the internship. The agency charges me $2500 for 3 months of placement (9 to 5, 4 days a week) at a random company. It’s going to be an unpaid internship. I just attended one of the interviews today and the company builds the website using PHP. I really want to focus on anything related to Python rather than PHP. But on the other hand, thinking of a career gap scares me. Time is also an essence.

So should I proceed with the company and start learning PHP or try other companies. I am really eager to learn any language but deep down I really like Python. I do not know if I am doing the right thing paying the agency for my internship. But, I have been applying for an entry-level job in many places with no luck. I really want to gain some experience and enter the industry anyhow. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated."

Software developer from Italy here.

I'm 21, right now finishing my 3rd year of CS Bachelor (mid level university, not top not bottom), and because I did most of the exams from this year in my 2nd one, I'm working until i get my degree in july.

I'll have then 1 year experience in this mid-size company, around 90 employees, and even though I'm doing a lot of interesting stuff, I'm not using the latest technologies (Python + AngularJS and jQuery), I know them fairly well now, plus as soon as I finish my exams I'll take a look at Angular. I also know C++ and Java at Uni level.

I did an Erasmus in the Netherlands for 6 months, where I had basically an internship with a local company using NodeJS.

I don't know if I prefer backend or frontend, right now I'm doing both, even if it's not huge projects. Let's say that classic Web developer job with Angular/React/Vue would be totally fine.

Right know I make around 25k (Italy...), and I'm planning to move to Munich with my german girlfriend. My english is really good (C1 IELTS certificate) and my german is I'd say low b1, planning to get a low b2 before arriving, I can have conversations without big problems and I could probably apply to german jobs too.

We are also considering Augsburg for the more reasonable cost of life, and then I would probably commute to Munich everyday, or even better find something in Augsburg.

Do you think I would have possibilities with my curriculum (1 YOE, Bachelor in CS, Erasmus and internship, being 22 when I'll be there), and how much could I aim to, as a salary? (This is also for apartment reasons, we are in the middle of an offer, but since she'll be studying I'll have to provide for her part of the rent too, I don't want to take anything too expensive)

Thanks guys, have a nice day!"

faupbl,1,2020-02-28,Advice to get into IT,confused_67,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/faupbl/advice_to_get_into_it/,"Hi, I'm looking to become a software engineer, but am finding it impossible to break into the industry. I am using online resources to improve my programming skills, build a portfolio, participate in hackathons, attend industry conferences and recruitment drives etc, but I still haven't been able to secure an interview (or even an internship). I am currently completing a cs/software engineering degree and am hoping to start my masters afterwards. Could you offer some advice of what else I should try as I don't know what to do? Could the problem be that I am female?"
fauuyu,39,2020-02-28,Previous OS students with Norman: How did y’all cope with the class? I feel like I have to give up nearly everything else and pretty much re-evaluate my life,elydna,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/fauuyu/previous_os_students_with_norman_how_did_yall/,"Yes, I know the number one thing all CS students complain about is OS, the biggest hurdle for pretty much every CS major. And *especially* this week with both the exam and project 1 due (someone even posted about that [just now](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/fahqfy/best_way_to_study_for_cs439_norman/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)), OS suddenly hit like a truck.

As for OS, the exam was extremely difficult and a week of constant studying didn’t feel like enough. I feel defeated and am now realizing that I’m desperately just trying to pass the class. Also, I feel like I’m in a solid group with other hard-working students, but we’re always stuck in the lab getting overwhelmed by debugging, often having to resort to Piazza or waiting for TA hours.

Before this semester started, I was part of 3 orgs, had a decent social life, hung out or played online games with my friends about a couple times a week, and went to Greg for 1-2 hours nearly every day. Instead of simply reducing all that, I find myself completely eliminating these parts of my life one by one as OS ramps up.

I now feel like I’m doing something extremely wrong and I need some guidance to get my life back on track. I’m trying to commit to a better studying strategy and use time for group projects more efficiently. But I’m not sure if I can maintain my well-being and do decent in OS at the same time. I’m also still looking for an internship for the summer and am not sure if that’s a stretch at this point.

I’m typing this post at 7am after pulling an all-nighter on the project with my group, and I think we may have to use one slip day which also prevents us from going to LeapHacks tomorrow, a hackathon that could have given us a valuable personal project for our resumes.

I want to hear the perspective of students that already finished OS because I’m honestly not sure how I will make it through this semester.

I hope if anyone responds to this with any study tips it might be helpful to you too, u/YoAten"
favnjm,12,2020-02-28,"From your experience, what has been harder? Finding an intern/co-op job or a full-time job?",IBSurviver,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/favnjm/from_your_experience_what_has_been_harder_finding/,"I’m a student in Canada and I go to the University of Guelph. I’m in the Soft. Eng Co-op Program and this is my third year and Summer 2020 will be my second co-op work term. For Americans reading this, a co-op is basically an internship. Not sure if you guys use the term “co-op” but just in case.

The issue is, my grades are shit as I literally failed 2 really important CS classes in the Fall of 2018 (but I’ve been trying to improve a lot by being more productive everyday —thanks agenda!). I did retake and get the credits over the summer though. 

My last co-op was an IT Systems Admin (Fall 2019) which honestly wasn’t that useful for what I want to do in the future. It doesn’t seem to be helping much either in the co-op job search. 

The job search has been brutal. I’ve been mainly applying to the Co-Op site provided by the University (I’ve sent 86 applications since January mainly aiming for Soft. Dev/Programmer positions) and I’ve gotten 6 interview declines, 2 interviews (of which I’ve failed both, and the most recent brought up my grades), and the rest seem to just ignore. I’ve applied to a few outside the Co-op site but to no avail. 

I have talked to my co-op coordinator and my resume isn’t the problem. It’s my grades, my weak ass confidence, my mumbling (during the interview). She says it’s very competitive in the summer and to not feel down about it. The reality is; I do feel down about it. I feel like I’m going to have to apply to another IT position which from what I hear, is not good if you want a Soft. Dev job in the long run.

I’m worried it’s going to be this much of a challenge outside school in the full-time job application world. I literally had plans to go to the US (literally anywhere in the US) after graduation but good god, if I can’t even get a job in Canada, who am I to think I can get one in the competitive USA as a Canadian citizen?!

*TLDR*: I haven’t gotten many call-backs during the co-op job search. I am worried it’ll be this hard/harder when applying for full-time positions. Whats your experience been?"

I'm expecting an offer today. It is for a Project Engineering job, however I graduated with an Applied Physics major (even though I have 1.5 years of PM experience). 

From my history with AECOM, I was still an engineer when I was an intern with them while in school. However, since then I dropped out of engineering school and finished with Applied Physics (bad work ethic, wasn't sure what to do, etc). I'm definitely set on what I want now. However recently I've learned that when I was interviewed and propped up for this job, AECOM was still under the assumption that I was an engineer at school and graduated with that degree.

From my earlier experience, I know that they have a vigorous on-boarding and background check system. The one making the decision to hire me is the contracted company rather than AECOM themselves, and they also believed this because AECOM told them this. 

What are my options here? Once I receive the offer, should I just go through with the background check and hope it never comes up that I didn't actually graduate as an engineer? I'm very scared to lose my contact at AECOM.

For context: I was also offered another job in NYC for a similar role however at a much smaller company. My family keeps pushing me to follow AECOM rather than the smaller company, suggesting that I could have an easier time applying to Grad of Eng programs.

I'm looking for any advice possible on this, as I don't know what to do"

I am a high school senior who has narrowed down their college decision to either Michigan State or UC Boulder (CS major).

I know the CS major/SWE field is highly competitive, but which school would give me the best opportunity to be noticed by these companies. This may be a stupid question, but I just thought I would ask.

Also, I am aware that a strong portfolio is an essential component to a great resume, so what kind of projects would make me stand out as a promising candidate?

I am six months into my first full-time, post-graduate job where I am a Data Quality Analyst. My day-to-day is basically anytime a Software Engineer implements new code in a specific view or table, it is my job to check, or to ""QA"", to make sure there are no bugs and everything is matching - basically validation.

It is gotten to a point where everything feels so repetitive and I don't feel challenged. Worst of all is that I only spend about two to three hours every day actually working. The other five to six hours I try to keep busy whether it's taking online learning courses, improving my coding skills, reading, or just browsing Reddit (like I am doing right now). 

I have asked my manager for more work, but it all feels like busy work and nothing meaningful that actually contributes towards the company's progressions or goals.

I really want to transition into more of a Data Analyst role, as I love working with data, and I have years of knowledge in Excel, SQL, and Python. I was wondering, as the title suggests, when is it a good time to explore new jobs. My mentor, back at my old internship, told me to stick it out for a year, and then apply. But, I was talking my to father, and he told me to start applying because my situation is not going to get any better.

I'll be glad to answer any questions.

faya32,6,2020-02-28,Seriously considering firing my intern,throwaway_targaryen,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/faya32/seriously_considering_firing_my_intern/,"**LONG POST WARNING**

I reside in Asia, and my first time dealing with this sort of an 'intern'. 

So I have a paid intern, let's call him S Hat, who is working in my company for a contractual term of 12 weeks. When I interviewed this intern I thought he was quite nice, although my colleagues pointed out that he had red flags. I accepted him anyway. We accept a few interns from his university every year, and they have generally did well. Until S Hat came.

It turned out that my colleagues were right. 

He was, to put it very nicely, disruptive. I had to ask him to sit back and stop asking us questions about the work while we were working, as our project was an urgent one which was due to be launched in a few months. If we missed that deadline, many departments in the company would suffer and most assuredly my head would be rolling. I dislike being personal during work, but I detest him. 

He had some basic understanding of the work material, but not enough for me to keep him in the team. So we decided to transfer him to another department to see how well he fits. Seemed that no one there complained about him. Life's good it seems. 

But that wasn't the end of it. 

Weeks later, nearing his contractual final weeks of the internship, one of our team members complained that their performance on the company's remote power server was slowed down seriously. We checked the employee code on Task Manager and it was S Hat! He was using over 6 GB (we had 256 GB RAM on that server) while most users would not cross 2GB except in exceptional circumstances despite the power usage of the special software in that server. His CPU usage was consistently 60% and above and I am myself not sure what the hell he is doing in his account on that server.

I really hope I can keep being cordial on my first post (and I am using a throwaway so that people do not know its me). I apologise if I broke the rule 5 here, and if I did, moderators please feel free to delete my post. 

I was considering firing him already and in fact transferred him to show him what happens in a real job when the job can't be done by someone despite his so called best efforts (truth is he wasn't even trying). Now I am actually seriously considering firing him. Complaints have already reached the HR in my company, and if I didn't take action here and now, not only my head would roll, possibly it might cause everyone to lose trust in my company. 

I have fired another team member for something way less egregious than this, so I have experience with terminating people. But an intern is another story. Before anyone here says that interns need to be patiently taught, I have been trying to teach him for weeks before I transferred him, and also told him multiple times that server was not to be touched. 

S Hat requires this internship to graduate, yet I do not believe he should even serve out the remaining weeks of his internship because God knows what the hell he is going to do next. He has made one too many mistakes. I have let him know that he might want to apply for early release, that is to declare that he has completed his internship while paring down the fact that we the company are actually terminating him. I am considering red flagging his resumes so that he will never get hired at this firm again, at least not for as long as I am still at my firm. 

TL:Dr: Errant intern accesses company power server without permission, considering firing him, but there is a lot of hassle involved both for him and for the company.

May I know if this approach is appropriate? Otherwise, how should I be dealing with this atrocity of an intern? Kindly let me know in the comments please, and thank you for reading!"

This summer I will graduate from college (yay!! \*fireworks\*). After graduation I will move to a new state where I know no one, and I am very excited for the new adventure! However, the location I am moving to is very expensive, so I am searching for a roommate. My employer announced my hiring to their employees, and their incoming employees. One incoming colleague (also recently graduated from college, knows no one in the area) has reached out to me suggesting that we live together. This is where I need help.

Living with this colleague would solve my problem of needing a roommate. It would also guarantee the person would be relatively safe to live with. I have shared an apartment with colleagues previously during summer internships. But, in those experiences I felt I could never catch a break from work because of living and working with similar people. Additionally, I would like to keep my private life, well, private. Which I would be concerned with compromising in the proposed situation. So, my options are (1) live with this person, (2) find someone else. The issue with option 2 is that I am not sure how to find someone I would feel comfortable living with. Are there forums are out there for this? Should I meet someone before signing a lease with them? Many questions here.

Does anyone have experience with a similar situation? What do you all advise, take option (1), or look more into option (2)? Really appreciate any suggestions :)"

2. tweak the css etc on existing themes for personalization 
3. build your own theme from scratch

The company itself had an excellent reputation for having an open, free thinking culture and supporting forward thinking causes and charities, so I assumed that I would fit right in.

The first day was great - they showed us the on-site gym and free beer bar and I really felt like I connected with many of the veteran employees.  Plus, the other 4 interns were great and we were able to bond over our shared set of views.  I thought everything there was going to be great.

That was until the second day.  The first project they decided to put the other interns and I on was a contract servicing a major fossil fuel company that is currently under investigation by the New York Attorney General for lying about its role in poisoning the planet.

I was absolutely flabbergasted that the company would even involve itself with big oil, much less that they would assign the interns to help out with something like that.  I was so shocked, in fact, that I didn't say anything right away.  But over lunch one of the other interns raised his objections to the project and that spurred me into action.

After conferring amongst ourselves, we voted to conduct a climate sit in from 8:30 - 12, starting week two.  We figured that this would be fair, as this constituted the amount of time that we were to spend on the oil project every day, but left us time to work on some other projects that we had been assigned to.

In support of this, another intern and I produced a letter containing a reasoned, scientific analysis explaining how climate change was real, how it was negatively impacting our lives today and would lead to even more disastrous consequences in the future, how providing support services to this big oil company was directly contributing to the problem, and how we (as the future generation of our world) could not sit idly by and ruin the planet that we would have to be living in 50 years from now.  We even included some inspiration quotes from Greta Thunburg, Bernie Sanders, and Patricia Espinosa (the current head of the UNFCCC).

We all signed it the Friday before our sit in was to take effect and I emailed it to the company's CEO, as well as the Vice President responsible for the contract, as well as our manager and the internship program coordinators at our schools.  Again, we felt that this was fair as it gave the company plenty of heads up as to what we would be doing and, more importantly, why.

We didn't hear anything from them over the weekend, but Monday morning there were police waiting in the lobby for us.  We were told to hand in our badges and immediately leave the building.  The other intern who wrote the letter and I immediately took full responsibility for it and told them that the other interns should not be punished as they had not written the letter, but they said that since we had all signed it we had shown a ""profound lack of judgement"" and they threatened to arrest us if we wouldn't leave.

I was expecting word of our protest to get around and figured that their competitors would offer us positions out of respect for what we did.  This didn't happen, so I emailed out some press releases, but the responses that I got from that were overwhelmingly negative.  Apparently being progressive and forward thinking is just a public relations position, when push comes to shove these supposedly ""brave"" companies are nothing but cowards.

I'm now trying to find a job for when I graduate, but I've been unable to find a job in my chosen industry.  I even had a phone interview last week in which one of the interviewers asked me if I was one of the people involved in the protest, and laughed at me when I said I was.

Following that interview I think its time to change industries.  I don't really regret what I did, and if I had to I would do it again.  I suppose, if nothing else, it was enlightening on the ills and hypocrisy of capitalism and reinforced my belief in supporting strong government action to help oppose climate change.

TL;DR: organized a climate sit in to oppose immoral practices at my summer internship, was kicked out of the building by police, other supposedly ""progressive"" companies put me on a blacklist rather than rewarding my efforts."

Shortly after, I started an Internship at a big insurance company. Ended up getting a full time offer from a smaller company in the same city and left the internship for a better paying, guaranteed job. I have learned enough to get promoted from Junior to Mid Level Engineer in the past 8 months. A few days ago, I received an offer from a big Financial company which is paying roughly 50% more. The benefits are slightly higher and comes with a 5% annual bonus. The title between the two are the same. 

I brought up the offer to my current employer and they were able to match it but their benefits aren’t as good and there isn’t an annual bonus. What I am concerned with at the potential new employer is the culture, the bigger company feel (slower to execute goals), and the commute. I get along really well with all my coworkers and genuinely enjoy my job, but sometimes there are things the company is doing that I don’t agree with. Also, things move really fast since we still have that startup feel while being more established, which I enjoy. 

The last thing is the commute. Currently I drive about 45 minutes to an hour to work and the new job would be another 20-30 minutes away. There is the potential to WFH a few days a week at the new company but it is team dependent so not guaranteed. My current job guarantees one WFH day a week but that is usually it, no extra days unless there is a special circumstance.

If I leave the company, I want to stay at the new company for at least 2 years to avoid job hopping too much. My other thought is I can stay at my current employer, and then after another year or two, find a job closer to home or go out of state. Not still sure.

If anyone has any good input on the situation, please help so I can decide by Monday!

I'm a final-year CS undergrad, and I'll be starting my Masters degree next Fall. I only recently got my admits, and was otherwise planning on taking this job offer instead. Since I'd mostly be rejecting the offer now, I've been wondering if searching for an internship for when I'd graduate this May was advisable. I'd really like to get some more development experience since all my work so far has been research roles.

One of the recruiters I reached out to (from Amazon) was surprised I wanted an internship instead of a permanent position, and stopped responding as soon as I mentioned going for a Masters degree afterwards. Is it at all possible for me to get an internship? How do I respond to that - do I just say ""I'd be ecstatic if I can get a pre-placement offer from you at the end of the internship, but would only like to apply for an internship right now"" or something like that?

tldr; Finishing my undergrad and going for a masters next Fall and want to get an SDE internship in-between but recruiters only let me apply for permanent roles."

The current three companies are SideFX(3D modeling and VFX company in Toronto), Formlabs (3D printer company in Boston), and a bay area startup (doing pretty arbitrary middleware web development in San Francisco). 

With regards to pay, Formlabs and SideFX are paying similar amounts, and the startup pays more (but not enough that it really changes my life). All of them pay enough money that I'm not worried about breaking even. 

On my current criteria, I am interested in doing web development (my past internship experience is primarily with non-web development technologies), but the company will have roughly two interns. On the other hand, the other companies have a meaningful chance to work on really cool things.

When it comes to known factors, Formlabs has catering and much more interns (&gt;40 maybe), wheras SideFX has much fewer (&lt;10). On the other I know exactly what I'd be doing at SideFX (GPU stuff + distributed systems), wheras I'd presume at Formlabs I'd be doing whatever their software team does (likely some . Beyond that, I have no idea how well known either company is beyond some python and modern C++ (which I have already done). 

1. With regards to growth, what's the best option?  
2. Does either SideFX or Formlabs carry any clout?  
3. Would spending more internship time doing web development open more doors?   
4. What are things I might not have considered?   
5. Does the location of the company carry any weight to recruiters (ie would working at some SF startup impress people more?)"

**me:** 6 years in tech field, masters. currently working at public sector as a manager. pay is ok but work life balance is superior. no family. early 30s. saving money for downpayment to afford a 1 bed condo this year.

**situation:** I am doing part-time second masters in computer science, and I applied for this internship position for a top tech company last year without thinking too much, and to my surprise, I got an interview this month, did the interview, and got the offer which is insane as I didn't even think about it too much as typically applying fulltime for these companies I never even get an initial recruiter call.

**my challenge:** should I leave current public sector FT job for this internship?

**pros**

\-chance to work at a top company which typically is extremely difficult to get into. I applied fulltime position of this company for several years, never got a single call despite tons of networking and customized resumes.

\-current job is super boring and learning stopped. all im doing is flipping emails and finding growth path is very difficult. im not married so i dont care about work life balance much at the moment.

\-located in a local region. no need to relocate.

**cons**

\-it doesn't start until summer.

\-internship doesnt guarantee fulltime while it says select few will become fulltime. this means if i take the risk leaving public sector fulltime job (i know people want to get into my role desperately as well while grass is always greener out there), do the internship and don't get an offer, I feel I got screwed as I'll be jobless then.

\-didn't get compensation package yet, but considering it's an internship, I bet it's going to be ok (great for an internship probably but comparing to current FT compensation, while my current pay is also not that good either for my work experience and background)

\-being in internship/probation/jobless status makes it hard to get mortgage if I get screwed from this risky jump.

\-people around my age and background are all now doing senior managers/directors while I'll be an intern again. Uncertain if it makes more sense for me to just keep finding managerial/upper path roles or go with my passion, which this internship and the company resources will provide.

Any advice appreciated. Honestly if I was in 25-29, I would've jumped with joy but now I need to calculate tradeoffs."
fb6nh0,2,2020-02-28,Am I being hazed at my first job? I just started an engineering job and I feel like I should run from this company. Or should I suck it up?,bjjthrowaway112358,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fb6nh0/am_i_being_hazed_at_my_first_job_i_just_started/," 

Hi [r/a](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/)dvice, I am a somewhat recent graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering. Over the course of my academic career, I had a few engineering intern jobs, some good, some bad, and one actually gave me a return offer. When I was an intern, they all noted I was a hard worker and I was unanimously recommended that I become a full-time hire. Things looked great. There's clearly a little bit of tension at my job between management and the senior employees, (as heard through people consistently gossiping and complaining about tasks they have to do), but I figure it's corporate America, so oh well.

So I started this job, and a big portion of it is training. After a few months of having my hand held, they basically just left me to my own devices to figure out what to do. No big deal. So I am getting involved in projects and trying to display I am a hard worker. Now, I am suddenly getting a weird vibe from everyone.

For one, no one really tells me what to do, so I have to show initiative and get involved in projects. Management encouraged it when I asked if it was okay to do so. As this goes on, some employees, particularly the most senior ones, constantly are saying ""well you're not doing anything, so you should do X."" Whatever, I think it's somewhat in jest so I just do whatever I can. Then, a particular employee has been vocal to me about people ""not to trust"" and has superficially told me that he'll always help me. Recently, he's been coming to my desk, many times, just to say ""I hear you tapping on your keyboard, but are you even working?"" He'll also come up to me and say ""go get me coffee... just kidding, how are you?""

Today, an employee took a dig at me, and said ""Hey did anyone tell you you're doing a good job?"" I just said ""No.."" and he said, ""Well, it's because you're not working hard enough."" Two of the senior employees laughed at me. I didn't really know what to say, because I believe I am doing the right thing so whatever. Another employee, later came up to me, and asked, ""Do you know how to use X database?"" and I said, ""Yeah, I've been trying to update it accordingly."" He cut me off and said, ""Well you're doing it absolutely wrong."" Again, more senior employees laughed at me. He then condescendingly explained things and told me ""It's not that hard. Just do what it's designed for."" There are minor things, like being forced to do things no one wants to do, but I know I'm at the bottom of the pecking order, so no big deal.

The job is stressful as it is. I don't take lunch breaks and often stay an hour late. Some days I'm so busy that I can't breathe, and others I am scrambling to find things to do. I know I am inexperienced but I feel incompetent, regardless of how hard I am working. Regardless of that, I feel like everyone is out to get me. Like I have to watch my back.

I know I should keep my head down and work, but I really feel like an outsider. I feel like everyone is a free agent contracting for themselves, rather than a team. Everyone's been in my department for about 5 years minimum. I know I'm the newest one there, but everyone seems to poke at me and put me down every chance I can. I consistently ask for more responsibility, and feedback to know how to improve, but I feel like I'm going nowhere. I just get superficial responses like ""good job"" and ""keep up the good work."" I might leave this company, but I have to know if I'm overthinking things or is this place actually toxic? I thought it was fine as an intern, but now I have no fucking idea. It was nothing like this then. Should I just keep sucking it up?

Should I run from this place while I can? IS 3 months too short to look for a new job? Your help is appreciated.

TL;DR: I started at a job I interned at, and as time goes on, I feel like I am being bullied by senior members and I don't know if I want this to be my job anymore."

Your input was that putting a senior title this early in my career could be a red flag for employers. Well I've  decided to start finding a new job and trying to figure out what to put for a title considering  I've now been with the company a year and if that changes anything.

Also, I am running client meetings, managing interns and essentially working as an equal to the CTO in most cases where occasionally I'm even planning tasks for him. Not sure if that would qualify as a senior developer or not.

Also also. I'm not applying to senior level positions obviously. Mostly bc I'm trying to get into at least a semi larger company (currently working at a company with less than 5  full time employees).


... so do I put senior developer or not. I really need to find a new job fast and dont want anything working against me obviously."

I have just finished army, and have looked across forums but have either yet to find answers to certain questions or just needed someone to ease my restless mind. Hehe anyways, I have some questions:

1. As stated in the NUS curriculum, theres a difference between Programme Methodology in Info Security and Computer Science (CS1101S vs CS1010). What are the differences, and should I be given Info security, can I still transfer easily to CS should I Score well? If then, whats the GPA that I must hit for such a jump?
2. Should I be a prospective Info Security student, what are some languages to learn that might help to develop 'computational thinking'. Is doing questions on Euler Project and Hackerrank really sufficient?  For example, I recently completed a course on Python. However, I realise that since its so developed and user-friendly, it might not necessarily hone 'computational thinking' as opposed to C language (or am i wrong in this aspect)
3. Is it hard finding jobs in Info Security (Anecdotes are fine) after graduating. Recently while searching up internships, I read up certain forums that suggests other forms of computing, Software developing, before stepping into the security aspect of computing. I assume that its due to the complexity with the library itself. What are your experiences
4. What are your experiences for overseas attachments? I have heard of the pragmatic and rigorous curriculum, but personally, one of my 'bucket-list' in University is signing up for an overseas attachment/internship cos I think its lit LOL. From your exp, are there a lot of people shunning away from such long 3-months attachments simply to study source materials beforehand? I'm interested in Computing because its so broad and interesting within itself, but I also think that Overseas experience are a huge part of my University experience.
5. This will be very personal, and very optional to answer. I am sorry for my lack of tact, I find it hard expressing emotions through texts. This is purely part of my expectations-making process. What are your GPAs and by far, how long do you study every week? Do you study before term starts, if so, how long? Out of 10, how much do you think you have reached your potential/limit.

As for Question 5, it is definitely unfair for me to request for an answer without sharing more about myself. I am not a very smart individual. I am not the kind of Junior College student that suddenly had a epiphany or realisation, followed by a sudden boost in growth; and I know it. I have seen individuals, which I also categorise myself under, studying 8 hours a day with little improvements, as if we have plateau-ed and its honestly really disheartening. I tell myself that computing is so broad, that after finding more about it, I still think 400 students might be just right for such a huge general topic, and that I can definitely find a place in it should I attain worrying grades, but I still feel very uneasy about it."

I am an active duty, military service-member pursuing a Master's degree in software engineering. Despite having no academic pedigree in the discipline, I have been accepted into the University of Advancing Technology's MS in software engineering program. I have two concerns: am I making the optimal decision with respect to the cost of tuition and employability post-graduation? UAT cost $18,150 per academic year to attend, and my personalized track would take 2 years to complete. I would exhaust my GI benefits attending this institution. Is this degree worth the price-tag? I know of alternative schools whose tuition fees align with my tuition assistance cap and will consequently leave my GI benefits untouched. Secondly, based on my degree plan, am I employable? I ask because I am currently located in a desolate location and will only be able to obtain an internship if it is offered remotely. Can I graduate without interning and land a position? 

My degree plan consist of the following 12 courses: 

PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS: Students will be immersed in the past-paced world of programming and software development. They will learn the foundational concepts and skills of programming such as algorithms, flowcharting, input/output, conditionals, loops, and arrays in the context of mobile app development. Objects and object-oriented programming will be explored as students complete personalized programming projects.

DATA STRUCTURES AND TESTING: Students will study and implement many of the foundational data structures and algorithms such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and sorting. They will learn algorithms and techniques to build efficient systems, and they will utilize the full software development process to create high quality systems and applications that are thoroughly analyzed and tested.

MOBILE DEVELOPMENT: This course will introduce and implement mobile development on 2 platforms – iOS and Android. Students will develop apps for both with an emphasis on GUI design for mobile devices, messaging protocols, and application of streaming data sources.

ADVANCED PROGRAMMING AND AI: Advanced programming skills will be developed and utilized building on student’s foundational programming skills and experience. They will be introduced to and implement Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

DATABASES AND WEB DEVELOPMENT: This course will teach how to implement databases and connect these to a website. Databases will be covered from introduction to implementation and include some form of SQL for access to the databases. In addition, basic web page development including tools such as CSS and http will be included. Finally, the integration of the website with connectivity to the database will be implemented.

CLOUD COMPUTING: The infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud computing models will be studied and implemented using cloud computing providers such as Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS. Cloud-based solutions will be designed, developed, and implemented leveraging the strengths of distributed architectures.

BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE: Topics covered include the history of Blockchain, its open source evolution and current architecture. Server and network architecture associated with current Blockchain infrastructure are covered along with the structures used to define Blockchains, their ledgers, encryption, distribution and validation.

CODING BLOCKCHAIN: Students in this course will learn how Blockchains are created and undertake the software development required to build them. Students will learn how the algorithms and architectures of Blockchains are represented in software and exist within hardware. Using industry development environments, basic Blockchain applications will be created.

BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATION PROTOTYPING: Having previously gained fundamental skills in creating Blockchains, students will further develop their skills by building categories of applications that are being advanced as compelling reasons for this technology to be actively explored. Students will explore and build Blockchain applications in areas of high interest that include digital contracts, transactions, currency, identification, records and voting.

INTRODUCTION TO CYBERSECURITY: This course will cover anti-virus tools, security policies, password management, risk analysis, security policies, network communication vulnerabilities, enhancing security with cabling and network hardware, understanding different types of firewalls, packet filtering and NAT, setting up and securing a virtual private network, and understanding hacker exploits.

PRINCIPLES OF CYBER FORENSICS: Research and analysis are conducted on how US security regulations vary from industry to industry, including those in healthcare, education, military, federal matters, utilities and financial matters.

PRINCIPLES OF NETWORK AND APPLICATION SECURITY: This course covers the implementation of the key components of the network and applications that are needed to run the business. This course will cover the concepts of defense-in-depth and the interplay of technologies in securing your organization."

The embedded software was somewhat higher level with a layer or two of abstraction from low-level programming. I used python to make some PC utilities (graphing data, serial communication, apps). Although, if you were to look at my coursework, you'd think I'm interested in communication systems, circuit design, or project management. I have a tiny bit of experience with ML too. Basically, I feel like I have all of this surface level knowledge but nothing in-depth, and I think this might hurt me when it comes to finding a job. I'm approaching graduation pretty soon, and looking at jobs has me realizing that I'm not really specialized in anything. It seems like a lot of jobs require more in-depth knowledge of a specific subject than what I have.

This was a newly created position for the school year to get the school two visual arts and IB status. No one was on it before and it didn't exist. I was basically hired to write the cirriculum for it which I still am. 

For background, I was already given notice it wasn't being renewed two weeks ago. This is standard for all such contracts and interns I have been told by union reps and others part of the district. 

I was then told by HR I had the option to resign and by the union I should because it looks better. The deadline was today. I'm trying to see if past events are connected or not. Was it really better if I did this when it was temporary? Both union reps I asked said yes. 

Then my position for next year appears as an opening for others to transfer into in a districtwide email. I am not eligible to do so being temporary even though the position was created this year. I am imagining this is just the standard process for all because of the nature it was. Others I know that are also temporary also have not. I am trying to find the reasoning here. 

I also haven't had my final evaluation or the results of the cumulative one that happens at the end where we are scored. Any further feedback hasn't been given to me. Previous meetings he did mainly want to see improved classroom management, but this was vague and I haven't been evaluated further to make comparisons yet to show improvement. This principal on multiple occasions has forgot in person how many times he had evaluated me too which needed to be corrected also. 

I had to have a meeting with my principal recently to correct the forms for multiple evaluations that had typos, missing information, took over a month to get to me because his secretary didn't do what she was supposed to and more. He also wrote ambiguous suggestions my mentor teacher of fifteen years couldn't understand in the future asked for more direct feedback for improvement I could understand and graded me on the wrong standards. 


 I didn't come to discuss the content of the observations but it kind of became a meeting about that. It may have sounded like I was whing to him after he said I had a filter and just absorb what is given which I don't understand as I have been following those, he acknowledged some, and I stated I wasn't there for the reasons. He also seemed to make excuses and be defensive at times even though he didn't follow the contract with forms and made mistakes on them that were poor showing for an administrator. If I did similar on a resume, I would have never gotten interviews. 


If I apply for other positions I need to have evaluations without mistakes on them. He gave me so little that I didn't feel like there was much to go on. It ended civilly. He even started saying hello to me for the first time in weeks afterwards. I'm trying to determine why. I had a union rep present out of their advice to do it for all related to evaluations. This meeting also happened after the four day weekend, with little notice the morning of. I also was told about my contract being nonrenewed hours after, but I knew of it just as a general one for HR. 

After this, today, I hear a rumor that I may not be wanted anymore because of this request, but there's no way to verify this or not. Am I being pushed back against for asking for these corrections?

Seeing the personality of this administration this week, we had a meeting also where testing schedule was discussed and several teachers with strong opinions were kind of told to tone it down by this principal and even called in today about it or spoken to even though they were very civil during it. Those who asked the schedule at the meeting were told if they didn't have another solution they had to live with what was going to happen. Some were pulled into his office to reinforce this also. Do I simply have a poor evalutor who is himself not open to ideas being one sided with me or not?

Did any of this have to with the reason this position was opened to others to transfer into or is it just standard protocol being followed? Am I being retaliated against for trying to hold him accountable or something entirely different? 

If I was to have been considered again, would something different have happened instead? 

This is California with a March 15th deadline for such announcements."

So, I've been applying since January and recently got a ""Data analyst"" job. But, that job requires meeting with clients and software customization and it's 9 hours, 6 days of work! The role isn't much technical and requires some weird software to do analysis if some analytics comes up in the first place. Most of my friends said that that's how internships are like and just hustle through, you'll get a tech role eventually. Also, I have a really hard time finding internship and I know it's gonna be rough if I quit this one. On the other hand, I may get a better role if I complete this 3 months internship but I won't be able to update my tech stack. I'm really confused as to what should I do."
fbe9qq,2,2020-02-29,How do I explain my depression nest to my mother?,aydiosmia,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fbe9qq/how_do_i_explain_my_depression_nest_to_my_mother/,"
This is pretty long because I needed to include context and backstory so sorry for that. Also I’m on mobile. 

Hi I’m a 22F and I still live at home with my mother and stepfather. My mother has always been a sort of neat freak and I’ve had a hard time keeping up with her cleaning standards. Still whenever she’s asked me to clean, I have to my best ability. There have been several times throughout my high school life where she has come in my room and gotten upset about the state of my room, made me clean my room with my door open so she could watch me clean, and wouldnt let me anything over the weekend if my room wasn’t clean. Sometimes she’d wake me up if I wasn’t finished cleaning. In high school, I was diagnosed with depression and my mother proceeded to send me to therapy for said depression which was fine and all... but I think she forgets that I actually have depression most times. I don’t think she actually knows how much depression can take a toll on the things you do (or don’t do) because I think she thinks the therapy cured me. A few years ago I went through a traumatic experience, and also last year and naturally..that affected me. But I’m still uncertain if she remembers I have depression. 

Fast forward back to the present day. Yesterday I received a call and a very long text from my mother basically saying that I never listen to her when she tells me to clean my room, my room is filthy, this is why I’d never be able to live with anyone when I move out, and when I get back she’s going to make me clean with my door open so she can make sure I’m cleaning. For context, I left the previous Sunday to dogsit someone’s dog through Friday with only a days notice. She told me to clean be fore I left and I really did clean up in my room and bathroom but I suppose it wasn’t up to her standards. I received this text message while I was on my way to my second job (internship) where I am trying to get converted to a full time employee. The whole thing was very stressful and I felt very overwhelmed and unappreciated because I do listen to her, I DID clean, and I’m exhausted trying to juggle all these things at once. We also got into an argument about my stepfather through our texts. (I’ll provide info to that in the comments if you’d like) For further context, my mother has given me a deadline of the end of the year to move out so I am trying my best to make sure I will be able to move out with enough money so I’m really grinding at the moment. 

But back to the main question at hand. My depression doesn’t leave me with much motivation. It’s not just the room, most days I don’t feel like showering, brushing my teeth, changing my sheets, or doing my hair. I’ll do it if I absolutely have to but I don’t really ever have the energy for it. I’m not depressed at the moment (well at least I wasn’t before this all blew up) but..I have depression. How do I explain to my mother that I am really trying my best and the room thing is something I’m actively working on but..depression?"
fbeaf9,3,2020-02-29,[IWantOut] 24F Financial Analyst USA -&gt; Canada,OJsnails,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/fbeaf9/iwantout_24f_financial_analyst_usa_canada/,"USA (F/24) Good work experience -&gt; Canada (F/25). Marriage is on the table.

Looking for advice from Americans that got into Canada and Vice versa. I (F/25) am expecting to wait 6 more years to be with my gf (F/24). 

Hello,

She is an American (California) that has no problem getting a job because of her education and experience. She’s landed big intern exp at CBS and Netflix offered her a full time job, etc. 4.0 GPA student and will be done school in one year.

I’m Canadian and I have 5 more years left of school to finish my diploma and degree. (5 years because I have to work hours that are enough to help support my family’s rent and food, they cannot support themselves without me. So I take fewer classes each semester).

I probably have to obtain 1-2 years experience full time after finishing school for the US to even consider hiring me. I don’t have experience that my gf has. This another 2 years on top of finishing my education. That is a total of 6 years.

The chances of her getting a work visa in Canada is probably highly unlikely because employers would need to sponsor her which costs them more money if I’m not wrong. 

Realistically, my income won’t be able to support her if I choose to sponsor her here in Canada. I’ve been told even though I am sponsoring her, she still needs a work permit to be able to work in Canada.

—

Most realistic case is that we’d have to wait 6 years to be together. I’d have to finish school and obtain work experience and then the US will hopefully find interest in me. 

So as my questions states, what is the best route for us?"

I mention this because, frankly, I have 0 professional or personal experience outside of class. In applying for internships I drew very little interest and will probably accept a shitty offer this summer, as its better than nothing.

I have the option to go back the school pretty much for free. I'm wondering if it would be worth my while to stay and get a BS in Mathematics... it's only 5 classes I would have to take, but I would need a bunch of credits, so I would probably be taking mostly upper level CS classes. In the same, vein, I could probably go for an MS in Computer Science, but I don't think I want to commit to that.

I don't like college, but I'll do whatever it takes to set myself up in the future. I grew up pretty low income, and don't plan on going back. Any and all advice is appreciated. Would it make more sense to graduate and spend a few months grinding leet code and applying to jobs so I can get industry experience? Or should I stay in school so I can further my formal education and continue applying to internships?"

I'm on track to obtain first class honours in my degree program and have completed the following internships:

2017 -&gt; Data Analytics in a large Irish Bank (SQL &amp; R &amp; Customer Relationship Management)  4 months

2018 -&gt; Software Development in a small Irish CRM company (Focused on Ruby-on-Rails &amp; Node.JS development with some AWS experience)  4 months

2019 -&gt; Software Development in a multi-national company (Mainly Java and Ruby-on-Rails as well as some cloud computing infrastructure development) 8 months

I've an offer from the company I worked for last year to continue on as a graduate developer in their Dublin office but the remuneration would just not be sustainable with living expenses in Dublin (42k per annum).  I would potentially be fit to move internationally with this company but never met anybody beneath the managerial level who successfully managed to do so.

The reason I would like to immigrate from Ireland is because I'm sick and tired of the never ending bad weather, the high taxes, high cost of rent and I want to spend a few years some place else while I'm still young.

I know the USA and Australia are vastly different but both have much of the same factors pulling me towards them: better opportunities, better weather, lower taxes and an opportunity to try living somewhere new.

I think I'm more leaning towards America at the minute but it seems impossible to get a job in California without having US citizenship first.  Australia would be slightly easier, from what I can see, I could get a working holiday visa first working in one of the specified industries temporarily and then once I'm there starting to search for a job in IT and getting a visa sponsor from an employer there. However it appears harder for the employer to sponsor a worker in Australia than the US.

Has anyone managed to obtain IT work in either of these countries online without having graduate experience or transferring within their company? Or if anyone has had a similar experience it would be great to hear."

I recently made a post here about pursuing a new opportunity and leaving the current MSP I have been interning at for the last 2 months.

The comments had me thinking. I am making minimum wage at this place, and before school started I was working 40 hours a week, and now 24 hours a week.

My position is ""service desk intern"". My main duty is to create tickets, answer phone calls/emails, and troubleshoot lower level issues (password resets, creating email groups, configuring hardware in the office).

However, I am also now travelling onsite to help the team. I am very new to this so of course I am still learning. My main task this past week was to create network diagrams of a client's office. 

In addition to all of this, I call vendors to follow up on issues/gain info for clients, I monitor devices that use our remote monitoring system, and I check our A/V platforms for any issues. I am even assisting with creating sales quotes and speccing our machines for clients.

TBH, I am not the smartest guy in the world but I am learning, and I want to keep learning. However, I feel that my current incompetence is annoying my coworkers, and the other intern seems to be a natural for this job, whereas I only handle low level tickets and have to ask many questions. I'm afraid right now to ask for help sometimes because I feel I am annoying my managers. Some days I feel overwhelmed with all my different tasks, some days are full of down time.

Would it be worth it to stay at this place and keep learning, or should I pursue another help desk job with better pay/that is full time with benefits?
